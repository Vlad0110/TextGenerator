preiss           r .  hunter sat in the office chair of mojave center governor  the robot he had been assigned to reassemble .  hunter had to decide what appearance to use on his next mission .  he wore his usual northern european physiognomy now  with short blond hair and blue eyes .  a brawny six feet six inches tall  he had been designed with the ability to change his shape and appearance at will and might have to do so for the next trip back into the past  to china in      .   first  however  he would discuss the question with the humans on his team .  his internal clock told him the time was      p . m .  they were having dinner now and would join him here soon .   after four previous missions into the past  jane maynard  the roboticist  and steve chang  the general assistant  had a routine established now .  since their return last night from the outskirts of moscow in       they had each had a good night   s sleep .  they had spent the day relaxing in mojave center  this new underground city in the mojave desert .  then jane had called hunter about an hour ago to say they were meeting for dinner before coming to see him .   while they rested  hunter had hired a historian who specialized in china during the time of kublai khan to join the team .  marcia lew had arrived from her home in houston a short time ago .  she had agreed to join hunter here soon to meet the rest of the team .   hunter had been especially designed and built to lead the search for mojave center governor  the missing experimental gestalt robot who was supposed to be running mojave center .  however  without warning  he had abandoned his responsibilities .  mc governor had divided into the six component gestalt humaniform robots out of which he was comprised and vanished .   each gestalt robot had fled back in time to a different era .  hunter had led his team of humans on successful missions in pursuit of the first four component robots .  now they stood here in the office of mc governor  merged and shut down  waiting for the last two in order to complete the governor robot again .        hunter  city computer calling .  the governor robot oversight committee is waiting for you on a conference call .         excellent .  please connect me .      the faces of the four committee members appeared on hunter   s internal video screen in split portrait shots .  as usual  they did not waste any time with social amenities .  they exchanged greetings briefly  then hunter got right to his report .      mc   has been joined to the first three components who were already in custody     said hunter .      you   re as efficient as ever     said dr .  redfield  the tall blonde .  she smiled approvingly .     you   ve progressed so quickly that i suppose it has been fairly easy for you .         as i have said before  this does not predict the difficulty of the next challenge .  i still cannot guarantee that the remainder of my work will be completed at the same speed .         where was mc   .     dr .  chin cocked her head to one side  looking at him with curiosity .     nearby  this time .         in western russia     said hunter .  he had not informed them of the time travel device and hoped that the necessity of doing so would not arise .  he was deliberately vague in his reports .  so far  his rapid success had satisfied them .      we have very little to criticize .     professor post stroked his black beard for a moment .     nothing  in fact  that i can see .  where do you expect to go next .         i have a lead in east asia     said hunter .      really .     dr .  chin said .     this is quite a change in geography .         i have only preliminary information     hunter said cautiously .      your information has always been good     said dr .  khanna  speaking with his hindi accent .     your success could not have come about so quickly otherwise .         i feel i must repeat that i can make no guarantee of my progress to come     said hunter .      yes  yes     said dr .  khanna impatiently .     you say that every time we speak with you .  i will ask you the same question i posed last time .  do you have any reason to believe that the next mission will be more difficult than the previous ones .         i can only rephrase my original point     said hunter .     i cannot predict the challenges that my team will face .         we note your caution     said dr .  chin .     and  as always  we wish you good luck .         i   m satisfied  hunter     said dr .  redfield .     maybe we should let you get on with your duties .         i agree     said hunter .     do you have any more questions .      no one did .      good luck     said professor post .      thank you .  good bye .     hunter broke the connection .  he could hear footsteps approaching the office door and recognized steve   s and jane   s patterns .     come in     he called out  before they knocked .   jane came in first  grinning .     hi  hunter .     she shook her head  and her rich brown hair swayed .     even after all the time we   ve spent together  you still surprise me sometimes .  was it our footsteps  our heartbeats  our voice patterns  or .  .  .     she shrugged .     i don   t know what else .         i recognized your footsteps     said hunter .   steve came in behind jane .     evening  hunter .         good evening .  how does your head wound feel .      steve grinned .     i wouldn   t call it a wound  exactly .  i still have a bump on my head  but that painkiller i got last night from r .  cushing took care of the headache .         i contacted cushing today  and he told me your medication will remain in effect for several days .  at the end of that time  he expects you will be healed to a point where further medication is unnecessary .  do you feel well enough to join us for the mission to find mc   .         yes .  i   ll be fine .  but i want to discuss whether you need me or not .  before the last mission  i wanted out because i didn   t feel i was necessary .         oh  not again     said jane .     we   re a team .  we don   t have to talk you into going again  do we .         i   m not mad like i was last time     said steve .     but i don   t want to be taken for granted  either .  hunter  we know a nuclear explosion has eliminated beijing  and you told us we   re going to the time of kublai khan .  i followed the news for a while myself this afternoon .  but do you need me or not .         yes  i believe so     said hunter  as he heard the sound of footsteps approaching .     my concern is how to blend in with the local people as much as possible .  i hired a historian named marcia lew who           right here     said a woman   s voice .   jane and steve moved out of the way and marcia came into the office .  a young woman of chinese descent  she wore a fashionable and precisely tailored black business suit .  her shoulder length black hair was simply parted in the middle .  she offered her hand to jane and steve in turn  as they introduced themselves .      i apologize if i interrupted     said marcia  in a precise and formal tone .     hunter explained when we met earlier today that i   m the one who will need the most briefing  so he gave me a short introduction then about how mojave center governor divided himself and how his components fled in time .  i understand you two have already participated in four of these projects .         that   s right     said steve .      hunter also told me that we are actually traveling in time  a concept that i have difficulty accepting .  however  i have no choice but to believe all of you .     she folded her arms and looked at hunter .   no one spoke for a moment .  hunter saw that steve was staring at marcia in surprise .  however  hunter was not sure of the reason .      hunter  go on with your point     jane said finally .     explain why we need steve .  then we can continue the rest of our briefing .         we are going to china in a . d .           said hunter .     according to the historical data i took from the city library earlier today  we will be going to the city of khanbaliq in a time of peace .  is this correct .     he glanced at marcia .      yes .         hold it     said steve .     khan   what .  beijing is the city that just vanished under a mushroom cloud .  why aren   t we going there .             beijing    is the modem name for the same city     marcia said primly .     a very old city on the same location called yenjing was burned to the ground by genghis khan as he conquered northern china prior to the time we will visit .  this is why no existing buildings in beijing predate that time .  when kublai khan ordered his new capital to be built just north of the remains  it was called    khanbaliq     meaning    city of the khan     in mongolian .  when the mongols were overthrown by the ming dynasty in      that title no longer applied .  it was renamed    beijing     which means    northern capital     as opposed to    nanjing     which is    southern capital .     in fact  the modern city of xian was once called    xijing     or    western capital    and           okay  okay  i get the point     said steve .     it was just a simple question  i don   t need a lecture on the subject  all right .         and the characters for tokyo mean    eastern capital         she finished calmly .      thank you     said hunter  observing that steve and jane were glancing at each other .  he could not read the exact meaning in their expressions .  however  he understood that they were not happy with marcia so far .      you were discussing steve   s importance to the mission     jane said .      steve  my concern is how to explain jane   s presence .  you and marcia  being of chinese descent  will blend into the population just as jane has done in our trips to seventeenth century jamaica  roman germany  and twentieth century russia .  i must decide whether to maintain a european appearance or to alter myself to another look .         so do you have a plan .     jane asked .      i will present a tentative one     said hunter .     i understand that the capital of kublai khan in this time was a very international city .         correct     said marcia .     many persians  turks  mongols  and other tribal nationalities were well represented .  this is also the time of marco polo   s presence in khanbaliq  with his father and his uncle .  in general  however  the international visitors will be from eastern and central asia and possibly the middle east .  if you are thinking of european visitors  the polo family may be the only ones .         i propose that i maintain my european appearance and travel with jane as a married couple .         this would be acceptable     said marcia .     if three members of the polo family made the trip  one more pair of europeans could have  too .      hunter glanced at steve for his reaction to the next part of this proposal .     i also suggest that steve and marcia present themselves as a similar couple  hosting us in what appears to be their country .  the four of us would have a rationale for traveling together .      steve glared at hunter but said nothing .   marcia glanced at steve haughtily .     i suppose this makes sense .  we have to fit into their society as smoothly as we can .  i can tolerate some masquerading .         steve  do you agree this is logical .     hunter asked .      yeah  i guess .         we should present ourselves as visitors from a southern province     marcia added .     this will explain any accent in our speech and unfamiliarity with details of khanbaliq that never appeared in the history i have studied .  we don   t want to present ourselves as native to the city and then reveal our ignorance at the wrong moment .         which province do you suggest .     hunter asked .     we should agree on one now .         i recommend guangdong  which is the southernmost province .  we won   t be likely to run into others from there who will expose us .      steve nodded .      and you must have some career  in case people ask what you do .         okay .     steve shrugged .     like what .         a peasant or ordinary working man isn   t likely to travel across the country in that time .  i think you should be a scholar seeking a government appointment .         me .  a scholar .     he grinned  glancing at jane self consciously .      the top bureaucratic appointments in this time went to foreigners because kublai khan did not trust the chinese .  many of the turks and persians i mentioned were in high government posts .  also  many of the established scholars refused to serve the mongol government  even at the provincial and local levels .  however  some young chinese scholars managed to get into the lower ranks of the imperial offices .  you   re the right age .         this sounds reasonable to me     said hunter .   steve sighed .     okay .         marcia  i have much more to explain to you     said hunter .     time travel is the exciting part of the mission  but i must inform you of some background information .  have you been following the news today .  particularly  the explosion that destroyed beijing .  millions of people died and china is in chaos  and has no government .         the nuclear explosion .  of course .  it   s all over the news media right now .  what does that have to do with a component robot in      .         the explosion was caused by mc   .  when the component robots reach the approximate time at which they fled back into the past  with a margin of error of several days  they explode with nuclear force .         they do .  why .     marcia   s dark eyes widened with horror .      their atoms become unstable because of a problem they did not predict .  they have miniaturized themselves to microscopic size with the same device that sent them back in time .  this is what made them unstable .         why did they do that .         apparently  they wanted to remain microscopic forever so they would not be involved with humans .  they intended to avoid contact so they would not cause possible harm to people by changing the course of history .         of course .  the first law of robotics says that    a robot may not injure a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .             that   s right     said jane .      and i suppose if they were masquerading as humans  they would be in danger of being given instructions by humans that they would have to obey .  as i recall  the second law of robotics says     a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .             show off     muttered steve  rolling his eyes .     all right  give us the third one  too .  get it over with .      marcia arched one eyebrow at steve and spoke in a monotone .     the third law of robotics says      a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .     now may we get on with this briefing  please .         the sooner the better     said steve .      i   m almost finished with this part     said jane .     marcia  the new problem is that the miniaturization turned out not to be permanent .  the instability of that process has caused each component robot to return to full size at a different time in history .         i believe i understand .  at that point  of course  their interaction with humans becomes virtually inevitable .     marcia turned to hunter .     is this how you decide which period in history to visit .         yes     said hunter .     the site of the explosion in our own time reveals where to look .  i made calculations from the records in the console of the time travel sphere that tell me when mc   was likely to return to his normal size .  we must go back and try to apprehend him as soon as we can  before he influences anyone significantly .  returning him to our time with the time travel sphere will prevent him from exploding .         i see     said marcia .      we   re almost done with this background stuff     said steve .     then we can head for the bohung institute .  tell her about wayne  hunter .         perhaps you can summarize that problem for us .         i don   t feel like it .     steve turned away from marcia .     i   m just the hired hand  remember .  i don   t handle this theoretical stuff .             steve could hardly believe that hunter had hired someone as stuffy and pompous as marcia .  though he felt bound by hunter   s genuine need for him on this mission  steve already disliked marcia more than any team member since he had first met chad mora  the paleontologist who had joined them on their first mission  back to the late cretaceous in the time of dinosaurs .  having to pretend he was married to her was going to make this trip even worse .      i   ll explain wayne     jane said quickly .     dr .  wayne nystrom invented the governor robots  and he is angry that the oversight committee is leaving him out .  he wants to get at least one of the component robots under his power so he can try to find out what went wrong himself .         how does he intend to do that .     marcia asked .     is he trying to break in here or something .         no     said jane .     before hunter got here  wayne found the time travel sphere and has arranged to use it himself .  he can apparently move through time without returning here .  but on one occasion  he came back here and found a robot we had left here to apprehend him .         what happened .     marcia looked from jane to hunter .     you mean this robot didn   t catch him .         no     said jane .     we don   t know exactly what happened  but we instructed the robot  r .  ishihara  to hold wayne .  we explained these instructions on the grounds that wayne   s actions in the past threaten harm to humans by changing history   the same concern we have over the component robots .  that first law imperative should have been sufficient to convince ishihara to obey under the second law .         then why didn   t it work .         i can only surmise     said jane .     my best estimation is that wayne somehow created doubt in ishihara   s mind that wayne was causing a clear first law imperative .  that would eliminate the power of our second law instructions and allow wayne to give him new ones .         robots are so logical and direct     said marcia .     you really think this wayne guy could talk ishihara out of his direct orders .      jane shrugged .     he must have .  after all  he   s a roboticist  he   s had plenty of experience with robot logic regarding the three laws .         wayne should be easy to spot .  marco polo   s family and hunter and jane may well be the only other europeans in the capital .         his family .     steve reluctantly turned to marcia .     i   ve heard of marco polo  but .  .  . was his family there .         he traveled to china with his father  niccolo  and his uncle matteo     said marcia .     marco will be  let   s see  thirty six years old in      .  in       he and his family started their trip back home to venice .         hunter     said steve     can we get on with it .  we won   t find mc   by talking here .         yes .  you probably saw the security vehicle waiting outside .  i will drive us to the bohung institute .  but i must ask all three of you if you have received the vaccinations i arranged for you .  and have you completed your sleep courses in spoken chinese  mongol  and italian of this time .      steve and jane both nodded .      yes     said marcia .     i took the vaccinations a little while ago  and i arranged the sleep courses last night after i spoke to you from houston .  from your selection of italian  i suppose you intend to meet the polos .         i want to be ready for this eventuality     said hunter .     i noticed in marco polo   s book that he gives no indication that he ever learned chinese .         that   s correct     said marcia .     he seems to have managed for his entire seventeen years in china speaking persian and mongol  though i believe he must have picked up a few phrases of chinese along the way .         i would think so     said jane .     but if steve and marcia are masquerading as southern chinese  why did you want them to know italian .         i want them to be able to understand what they may hear if we meet the polos     said hunter .     obviously  jane and i would do the talking in italian .  now  i believe we are ready to go the bohung institute .         hunter  hold it     steve said in confusion .     you   re thinking of meeting marco polo .  a guy who wrote a book .  we could really change history if we influence him  couldn   t we .         we must handle any meeting with the polos carefully  of course     said hunter .     marcia  do you feel the danger of affecting polo   s book would be prohibitive .         no     marcia said thoughtfully .     as long as we   re careful  as you say .  frankly  he said just before he died that he had not told half the wonders that he had seen .  for instance  he never mentioned the great wall  even though he lived close to it in khanbaliq for many years .  he probably saw the western end when he arrived from europe and again when he went home .  he never wrote about tea  though it had been a common drink in china for centuries .         good     said hunter .     if we meet the polos  we will simply exercise extreme care not to be worthy of appearing in his book .         one more question  please     said marcia .     maybe the rest of you know this  but i don   t .  why are we leaving at night  after a day   s activity .  shouldn   t we leave in the morning  when we   re fresh .         we must arrive in the evening  when dusk will mask our sudden  unexplainable arrival from any potential witnesses     said hunter .     we will therefore leave this evening  so that your schedules of sleeping and waking will match those of the society in which we will be a part .         where will we land .     steve asked .     out in the middle of nowhere again  i suppose .         yes   to avoid being seen by local humans     said hunter .     since i am unfamiliar with the exact details of the city  we must arrive in the countryside .  this will minimize the chance of appearing right in front of people  if we do land near peasants  i hope the near darkness will also disguise us .  our first task will be to find a safe place to sleep .  in the morning  we will begin our search for mc   .      marcia nodded .     all right .  i understand .      as the team left the office  steve walked out last  wondering how much of a burden marcia was going to be .  by the end of the first mission  he and chad had earned a mutual grudging respect .  on the other hand  rita chavez  the historian on the second mission  had caused more problems than she   d solved .  the other two  gene titus and judy taub  had been pleasant and reliable .  however  tolerating marcia   s personality was going to be a trial .   hunter drove the team through the clean  peaceful streets of the underground city . they were brightly lit  full of shops and restaurants .  hunter drove among both robot and human pedestrians  as well as other vehicles .  the robots and humans who lived in mojave center pursued their daily routines  unaware of anything unusual happening in their midst .  steve wondered what they would think if they knew a device that could send humans and robots through time existed right in their city .  hunter had insisted on keeping their time travel a secret  however  and steve had agreed that was a good idea .   when hunter had first started his assignment in pursuit of mojave center governor  he had arranged to shut down the bohung institute .  a city security detail guarded the exterior  and another robot  r .  daladier  had been assigned to replace ishihara in room f     where the sphere was located  in the unlikely event that wayne nystrom appeared there .  when the team entered room f     steve saw that hunter had already prepared their clothing and money for the trip .      i had two sets of clothing made today     said hunter .     i was not certain if we would masquerade as people of some wealth or not  so i prepared one set to imply wealth and one to convey modest means .  also  i have provided two outfits in each set  so we will have a change of clothes with us .  marcia  please check them for authenticity .  i can assure you that no synthetics have been used  of course .  you will each have a radio communicator in the form of a lapel pin  as before .         we should wear the better clothing     said marcia briskly  glancing at the two stacks .   steve watched as marcia walked over to the stack of neatly folded black and gray silk .  she lifted a long black robe and held it out at arm   s length .  the robe was shaped in a rough triangle  flared at the bottom with a neck that simply overlapped  like a bathrobe .  from its size  steve could see that this was for hunter .      this is fine     said marcia  folding it again .      what about the neck .     steve asked .     in all the old pictures i   ve seen   and the movies set in pre industrial china   the gowns had these tight collars that stand straight up around the person   s neck .         they   re called mandarin collars     said marcia  as she set hunter   s gown aside and shook out a pail    of baggy trousers .     they came into style many centuries later .     she glanced over the trousers  turning them in her hands .     your research has served us well .     she set those down and picked up an identical set of clothes in steve   s size .     if these are in the same style  i don   t need to examine them .         they are identical except for size     said hunter .     will wearing identical colors be acceptable .  the social acceptability of this was not mentioned in the history i found .  also  embroidery was available but i felt we should appear to be moderately successful rather than very wealthy .  so i chose clothing in solid colors .         i agree     said marcia .     appearing modestly well to do is wise .  it will fit the roles of merchant and aspiring scholar that we have chosen .  further  black is good  a sign of prosperity .  since the number of dyes was limited in the society we will visit  most people in a given economic level wore fairly similar clothes .         what about ours .     jane pointed to the pile of gray clothes .      they should be similar .     marcia lifted a plain dark blue robe and then a matching pair of loose trousers .     yes  these are fine .         similar .     steve shook his head .     the cut is exactly the same  isn   t it .         yes     said hunter .     the styles were very loose .  no form fitting was involved .         these are fine     said marcia .     but i don   t see any coats .  what time of year are we going to visit .         late summer     said hunter .     it would be august according to our calendar  though of the course the chinese are using their lunar calendar .         khanbaliq is pretty far north .  the nights could be chilly even in summer .         my data shows that fur coats would be commonly used in cold weather     said hunter .     this is a problem we faced on an earlier mission .  we do not use real fur in our time and i dare not take artificial fur back with us .  so if we need coats  we must buy them there .     hunter pointed to a small pile of coins .     i have gathered authentic coins from that time for us to use  as we have on earlier missions .      marcia picked up a coin and looked at it  nodding .     paper currency was in use during this time .  i should think it would be easy to imitate .         i did not attempt to locate any surviving bills to use as models .  the likelihood of their surviving to our time was too low .         i   m going to change     steve said impatiently  picking up his clothes and heading for the adjacent room .      you do not have your shoes     said hunter .     or the under robe .         huh .     steve stopped and turned around again  looking at marcia .   she picked up a pair of shoes from the counter .  as she turned them over in her hands  all steve could see was flimsy black cloth over flat  heelless soles .  she held them out to him .      those are shoes .  what are they made of .     steve asked doubtfully  as he took them from her .      the soles are woven hemp     said hunter .     the rest of each shoe is just cloth .         that is an authentic design     said marcia .      however  under pressure from the first law  i arranged for the inside of the shoes to have some arched shaping and padding for your feet     hunter added .     this is an improvement that i must hope does not influence anyone in the past  but i believe the likelihood of anyone noticing the inside of our shoes is very small .         fine with me .  i just want to get on with it .     steve also accepted a plain white under robe from marcia  and went to change in the adjoining room .   the robes and trousers felt more uncomfortable than the clothing steve had worn on earlier missions .  the baggy trousers and flowing robe  even after he had tied the sash  felt weird .  the shoes fit all right  at least .  he rejoined the others with a self conscious scowl .   jane glanced at him and took her turn without saying anything .  marcia took no notice of him  instead looking closely at each coin .  hunter gave steve a cloth bag containing the change of clothes for everyone .   steve waited in silence .  he hoped that this mission would end more easily than the others .  between marcia   s arrogance and these bulky  uncomfortable clothes  he did not expect to enjoy this one very much .   when they had all changed clothes  hunter opened the big sphere and helped them inside .  he took a moment to set the console and then joined them .  when he closed the sphere  they all slid together in the darkness  jumbled in the curved bottom .     a moment later  steve tumbled to the ground among some green plants .  the air felt cool but not uncomfortable .  to his right  the sun was low over the horizon .  hunter  jane  and marcia had landed right next to him .   they were sitting up on fairly level ground in some sort of cultivated field .  steve did not recognize the tall green stalks around them  which blocked their visibility beyond a few meters .  he pushed himself up to a sitting position .      is anyone hurt .     hunter asked .      i   m fine     said marcia .      me  too     said jane .     i   m okay .     said steve  getting to his feet and pulling his robe straight .  now he could see over the stalks around him .     but we don   t have much daylight left .  where are we going from here  hunter .      hunter stood up and pointed to the west .  the glare of the sun nearly hid the sight of some high walls and towers in that direction .     that is khanbaliq .         let   s get going     said steve  hoisting the cloth bag .  he pushed his way through some of the stalks .      anybody know what this stuff is .         chinese sorghum     said marcia  glancing at it as she stood and adjusted her own robe .     it   s a common crop here  and closely related to the western variety .      now that steve was standing  he could see people walking toward the city on a nearby road .     we   re lucky we landed in this field  hunter .  otherwise  we would have landed in plain sight of those people .     a dry breeze blew dust along the ground .      that   s true     said jane  brushing dust off her robe .     if they see us walking out of the sorghum field  i hope they don   t ask us what we were doing here .         lodging for the night is a bigger worry     said hunter  pushing his way forward through the plants .     steve is right .  we must walk .         is it always so dusty .     jane asked .      yes     said marcia .     the soil is called loess  comprised of deep layers of dust brought here by prevailing easterly winds from the west .      rolling his eyes impatiently  steve gestured for jane and marcia to follow hunter .  as usual  steve went last .  gradually  they picked their way through the stalks and reached the dirt road .   poorly dressed  barefoot peasants were leaving the city .  some rode empty carts pulled by ponies or donkeys .  others led their work animals on ropes at a walk because their carts still contained some unsold produce .   other people  better dressed  walked or rode on the way into the city .  many of them stared at hunter and jane in astonishment .  the remainder plodded past without noticing them  perhaps too weary to look up .   steve strode up next to jane as the team began walking on the road toward khanbaliq .     i can see that the people leaving town are farmers .  but who are all these people going into the city with us .         i don   t know .     jane turned to marcia .     is this a normal day  do you think .  or is something special happening .         in this time of peace and relative prosperity  i would say this is a normal day .  i believe the people heading back into the city are merchants and maybe even scholars .  they either have arrived from other cities the way we will claim to have done  or else they made day trips to nearby villages .         commuters  you mean .     steve grinned .      well   yes     she said stiffly .   steve laughed  not at his little joke but at the fact that marcia didn   t even seem to recognize it as a joke .  jane elbowed him  scowling .  steve shook his head  openly showing his amusement .      marcia  do you expect we will have any problem finding lodging .     hunter asked .     if the city has many visitors  they may have filled the inns already .         i don   t expect a problem     said marcia .   hunter turned to jane .     do you have any thoughts about where we should begin searching for mc   .         well  mc   specialized in the administration of mojave center .  i think he will almost certainly be drawn to the heart of the government .         in this society  that is ultimately the emperor himself     said marcia .          the team walked in silence as they slowly drew closer to the towering walls of khanbaliq .  the sun sank lower in the west beyond the massive walls .  steve was glad he did not have to listen to another lecture from marcia .   as the team approached the city gate  steve saw several guards impatiently waiting for sundown  when they could close the gate for the night .  they wore full armor and sword belts  and each had a spear in one hand .  as they leaned on their spears  they talked quietly to each other .      maybe the guards can direct us     said hunter .      possibly so     said marcia .      i wouldn   t ask them     steve said quickly .     guys in a job like that are trained to be suspicious of people from outside .  at least  wait till we   re inside and then ask them .         very well     said hunter .     however  i see that they are not questioning anyone .  everyone simply walks through .         they don   t have modem immigration problems at a city gate in this time     said marcia .     in times of war  they watch out for the enemy  of course  and sometimes in peace they are concerned with bandits .  in this time  however  the country is really secure .  the city wall is just a precaution against trouble in the future .      no one on the team spoke as they walked through the gate .  steve avoided the eyes of the guards  who in any case were staring at jane and hunter .  once the team passed inside the gate without incident  hunter stopped and turned to a short  stocky guard who had turned to watch hunter walk past .      we are travelers from a far land     hunter said in a formal tone .     where can we find lodging in your city .      the guard stiffened in surprise at being addressed .     oh  uh .  .  .      his partner  a slightly taller  slender man  stepped forward .     many foreign visitors live near each other in one neighborhood .  is this where you would like to go .         we would     said hunter .     where can we find this neighborhood .         it is near the palace     said the guard  pointing .     eight blocks east along this avenue  then turn to your right .  i might suggest the inn of the white swan .     he grinned ingratiatingly .     you might tell them the guards at the west gate sent you .         thank you .     hunter turned  gesturing for his team to follow .  he led the way up the avenue in silence until they were out of the hearing of the guards .     marcia  is this information consistent with yours .         yes .  many of the foreigners here live near the palace so they can attempt to get audiences with either the emperor or important ministers .      steve looked up and down the streets as they walked .  despite the growing darkness people remained out everywhere .  merchants were lighting candles    inside paper lanterns hanging from poles to light their shops .      the shops are staying open  aren   t they .     steve asked .     is that normal .         in the summer  yes     said marcia .     people like being out in the evening when it   s cool  so the merchants try to attract their business then .         and all these streets are laid out on a right angle grid     said jane .     it looks very modern .  i guess i expected narrow  twisted streets going every which way .         cities of that sort grew spontaneously     said marcia  in her formal tone .     khanbaliq was a planned city  laid out from the beginning as kublai khan   s capital .         was it the first .     jane asked .     as an example of urban planning  i mean .         no .  i don   t know which city in the world has that honor .     marcia shook her head .     i know that in china  the tang dynasty capital of changan was built during europe   s dark ages on a right angle grid .      the team walked in silence for a while  looking at the sights .  other people continued to stare at hunter in particular  whose height remained visible by his silhouette even as the shadows deepened .  in the growing darkness  jane   s facial features and brown hair were no longer obvious .      it looks .  .  . well .  .  . normal     said steve  after a while .     we haven   t been to a place like this before .         that is true     said hunter .     the buccaneers dominated the docks of port royal .  moscow in      faced a foreign invasion .  our other missions did not take us to cities at all .  this city has a normal  functioning society at this time .         most of asia was   is  rather   at peace now     said marcia .     the mongols ruled only part of the indian subcontinent  and did not rule japan or the jungles of southeast asia  but khans ruled the rest of asia .  nominally  they all recognized kublai khan as their overlord .         wow     said jane .   steve clenched his teeth .  he could hear another lecture from marcia starting .      kublai khan attempted two invasions of japan  both of which failed     marcia added .     one fleet was destroyed by the divine wind the japanese call the original    kamikaze .     and mongols did conquer and rule part of northern india .         they did .     jane looked at her .      the word    mogul    is a corruption of    mongol         said marcia     from india .         hunter  we must be getting close to the area     said steve .  he was hoping to stop marcia by changing the subject .     we have only passed four blocks     said hunter .     that is not far enough .         well  tell me  where are we going to stay .  another inn  i suppose .  you want to look for the one the guard mentioned .         that would be acceptable     said hunter .     as you have said to me at certain times  we must improvise .         it looks safe     said jane .     in port royal  i always felt that any buccaneer could be a thief or a cutthroat .  here i see lots of young women walking around casually by themselves .         it   s a prosperous  peaceful country     said marcia .     one that is ruled by an emperor with absolute power .  in fact  a historian once said that in kublai khan   s time  a young woman could travel alone from palestine to korea with a sack of gold and not be bothered by anyone .         hard to believe     steve muttered .     that is  without robots around .         the death penalty was used freely     said marcia .      we must all remember that     said hunter .      but i wonder what mc   will try to do in a society that is fundamentally safe for humans     said steve .      i would not characterize it as safe     said hunter     not when the death penalty is utilized frequently .         i think that kind of concern might provide our answer     said jane .     that is  mc   may try to change government values and policy .  i suppose that would mean influencing kublai khan himself .  marcia  what do you think .         well  you   re the roboticist  of course     marcia said carefully .     i don   t know how this robot thinks .  but in terms of the way this society operates  your idea makes sense .  at the very least  someone who wants to influence policy would try to become involved with the circle of advisors around the emperor  maybe by working for one of them .         how would mc     or anyone else   go about accomplishing that .     hunter asked .      through connections     said marcia .     introductions are very important here .         we know he doesn   t know anyone here     steve said impatiently .     he   s going to show up naked  like the other component robots have .  long before he gets a job with the emperor  he   ll have to find a pair of pants .      jane laughed .     that   s true  but the others all managed .  mc   will too  i   m sure .      steve shrugged .     i think we   ll find him out on the street somewhere  not in the halls of government .     he looked up the street .     we must be getting close to this neighborhood by now  hunter .         we will turn right at the next block     said hunter .     marcia  how would mc   create the kind of network he needs in this society when he arrives here without contacts of any kind .         well .  .  . what kind of education does he have .         education .     steve snickered .     what does that have to do with what a fleeing robot does .         has he heard of marco polo .     marcia asked pointedly .     if so  he might begin with him .         i do not know exactly what data the component robots have     said hunter .     however  i think mc   could very likely have at least a passing knowledge of marco polo .  how would mc   make use of this information .      marcia glanced at jane .     is that a robotics question .  or a historical one .      jane shrugged  smiling .     hard to say .  you start .         well  during this time  marco polo   as opposed to his father and uncle  who were advanced in years now   has been a traveling envoy of the emperor  visiting various chinese provinces and returning to report to kublai khan .  right now  he is back in khanbaliq .         so he could be found     said jane .      yes .  and he   s respected at court  a familiar name and face to many people .  i think mc   could track him down without great difficulty .         then so can we     said hunter .     we shall begin tomorrow .      hunter led them around a corner and up a smaller street .  by this time  night had fallen completely  but the moon was nearly full .  it shed a great deal of light out of the cloudless sky .  around them  hanging paper lanterns lit all the little shops lining the street .      this isn   t a residential block  hunter     said steve .     maybe we should ask for directions again .         steve should do it     said marcia .     ask one of these merchants .  but i don   t recommend that inn of the white swan .  the guards probably get a kickback for mentioning it  and we   ll have to pay a higher rate to cover it .      that was a principle steve understood .  wearily moving the cloth bag to his opposite shoulder  steve walked up to a shop that had no customers .  a young man behind the wooden counter was wiping it off perfunctorily with a damp cloth .  a woman sat on a stool  yawning  with a sleeping baby in one arm .  two older children were scrubbing out a large iron pot .      good evening     steve said politely .     we are travelers from outside the city .  can you tell me where we might find lodging for the night .      the man   s face tightened with annoyance .     you don   t want anything to eat .      steve pulled a couple of small coins out and laid them on the counter .     we may be here for some time  friend .  tomorrow  we   ll be hungry allover again .      the other man forced an affected smile .     of course  of course .     he scooped up the coins without looking down at them .     i am liu guan  at your service .  may i suggest the prosperity inn  two blocks south on your left .         thank you .     steve returned to the others and pointed down the street .  they all started walking again .      you had to bribe him     jane asked     just to answer a question .         yeah .         well  that label is a little harsh     said marcia .     call it a tip .      steve said nothing  afraid he would start marcia on another boring lecture .  instead  he walked faster  looking into the shadows ahead for the prosperity inn .  the others did not speak  either .  he hoped jane and hunter were also learning that inviting marcia to talk was a bad idea .   soon a large  single story building came into view with a long  vertical sign running down the left side of the entrance .  in the yellowish light from the lanterns hanging from the eaves  steve could read  prosperity inn .  similar light illuminated the shades on the windows .      which one of us should make the arrangements .     hunter asked marcia .      steve     said marcia .     you and jane are masquerading as foreigners  and in this society   and as steve   s wife   i would not take that kind of initiative while he   s here .  but we   ll all go in together .         okay     said steve .  he led them inside .   small flames burned in brass oil lamps resting on wooden tables  lighting the room .  a portly man with gray hair hurried forward to greet them .  he wore a light blue robe similar to steve   s .      welcome  friends .  welcome .     he bowed at the waist .   remembering marcia   s briefing on the subject earlier  steve imitated the man   s bow .      you are together .  two families .     the innkeeper looked in surprise at jane and hunter but said nothing else .      yes     said steve .     my wife and i are hosting two guests from another country .  i am a scholar seeking an appointment .         ah .     the innkeeper nodded eagerly .     perhaps you would like a private bungalow  then .  we have several in the courtyard behind the main building for special guests .  i can offer you a bungalow with two bedrooms .      steve glanced back at hunter  who nodded .      how much .         one silver per night .      steve had no idea if that was a fair price or not  but he suspected the innkeeper assumed he would bargain .  casually  he glanced back at marcia  who shook her head slightly .  she stroked her hair with two fingers and wiggled them a little .      too high     steve said firmly to the innkeeper .     two .     he had no idea what this meant  but it was the best he could do without revealing his ignorance .      two   coppers .     the innkeeper folded his arms .     no .  six coppers .      now steve knew where he stood .     two coppers     he said confidently .      hm  well  maybe five .  this is an entire private bungalow  you know .         two .      the innkeeper hesitated  glancing at all of them .     four coppers .         two .         no .  four .      steve turned and walked back toward the door  grinning when he had his back to the innkeeper .     come on .     without looking behind him  steve opened the door and walked back outside .  the sound of footsteps told him that the rest of the team was following him without speaking .  then  as he expected  another set of footsteps ran after them .      fine  fine .  two coppers a night for my special guests     the innkeeper called .   steve stopped and looked back .  the innkeeper smiled eagerly  gesturing for them to return .  the team members waited for steve   s reaction .      two coppers     the innkeeper repeated .      fine     steve echoed .     we will stay .      the innkeeper led them through the main building and out a rear door .  it opened on a courtyard enclosed on all four sides by a high masonry wall .  several bungalows stood lined up in the courtyard  in the shadows  steve could not see how many .  carrying a small brass oil lamp  the innkeeper led them to the first bungalow .  he lit the hanging lamps over the door and then two more small brass lamps inside .   steve glanced around inside .  it was clean and nicely furnished .  the tables and chairs were made of plain but highly polished wood  intricately carved in patterns with tight curls .  the innkeeper led them to both bedrooms  the heavy bed frames were made of the same kind of wood  and quilted cotton comforters covered them .  a small fireplace  which they would not need  warmed the bungalow in winter .      it is adequate .     steve tried to sound unenthusiastic  to maintain his bargaining position in the future .   hunter paid the innkeeper without speaking .   the innkeeper walked backward out of the door  bowing to them repeatedly  and closed it behind him .          steve let out a breath of relief and grinned at the others .     i   m glad my bargaining worked out .  i didn   t know what i was doing .         you got my signal     said marcia .     very good .  when we know the proper price of goods and services  bargaining is easy enough .         we aren   t cheating him  are we .     jane asked .     we   re only paying a small fraction of what he wanted .         no     said marcia .     he wouldn   t have accepted if he could get a better price from someone else .  it   s late now and this bungalow would probably go empty tonight without us .  besides  the economy isn   t strong here right now .         huh .     steve was surprised .     i thought kublai khan was some kind of great benevolent dictator .         for his time  he was very enlightened     said marcia .     but the mongol emperors were not good rulers economically .  the first issue of paper money from kublai khan  made in       was recalled three years ago in       on a one to five basis   your money was only worth twenty percent of its face value .  another depreciation of the same magnitude will happen again in less than twenty years           so money is tight for ordinary people     steve interrupted quickly .     okay  i get it .         i   m tired after that walk     said jane  just as fast .     i   m ready for bed  i think .     she glanced at marcia warily .     how about you .         well  yes  i am  too .  it   s rather late by our schedule  isn   t it .      i suggest you two take the larger bedroom     said hunter .     steve can have the smaller one .  i shall spend the night here in the front room .         always on the lookout for the unforeseen danger .     steve grinned .  he took his change of clothes for the morning out of the bag  then handed the bag to jane .     well  i   m ready for a good night   s sleep  too .  good night .        dr .  wayne nystrom landed flat on his back at dusk on the edge of some plowed field .  the ground and air temperature were warm  this felt like a summer evening  which was what he expected .  next to him  he could see r .  ishihara sitting up .  they both wore the tunics  leggings  and boots that ishihara had originally designed for their trip to roman germany in a . d .    .  wayne also still wore a long fur cloak that he had acquired  though ishihara had traded his cloak away on their most recent trip to the area around moscow in december      .   wayne pushed himself up into a sitting position and saw a group of ten or twelve people standing about ten meters away  staring at them in shock .  they wore thin shirts and trousers  and carried hoes  rakes  and scythes over their shoulders .  their faces were shadowed by basketlike hats made of woven grass .   with a sudden chorus of frightened shouts  the entire group turned and ran .   wayne glanced around in other directions .  only a few meters away  an unpaved road led to a city that was visible in the distance .  many people were on it  going both to and from the city .     what do we do now .  they saw us appear like magic .         i do not know     said ishihara  as he stood up .     have we arrived in the right location .  if not  we can simply move in time again and hope that seeing us arrive will have no serious effect on them .         this looks like the right place     said wayne  getting to his feet .     at least  i   d say that group is a bunch of chinese peasants .  and the weather feels right .         i agree .         the measurements i took from the console on the time travel sphere indicated that i should set the controls for the outskirts of beijing in          said wayne .     if that city   s beijing  then this is where we want to be .         the system has always worked correctly before     said ishihara .     apparently it is still reliable .      wayne looked down the road .  the peasants had stopped running .  now they were talking excitedly among themselves  while still watching wayne and ishihara suspiciously .     i don   t know what kind of explanation we can give them .  maybe we better start walking .         set the belt unit for another time     said ishihara .     if we have to use it in hurry  it will be ready .         yeah .     wayne paused and set the unit for the same location three hours later  after dark .  most likely  no one would be out here then .  he glanced back at the group of peasants and froze .   they were coming closer  slowly .  the men who held long handled farm implements advanced in the front  holding their tools forward as weapons .  other men and women  holding smaller tools  followed them .  some were shouting angrily .      be prepared to trigger the belt unit     said ishihara .     it is too late to run from them .         all right .  but maybe we can communicate somehow .  i don   t suppose you know any medieval chinese  though  huh .         no  i do not .      wayne forced a smile and held up a hand in greeting .     hello     he called out .  more softly  he added     i   m hoping they can understand a friendly tone of voice .      the peasants stopped  still speaking excitedly among themselves .  they kept their tools high  however .  none of them looked away .      i strongly recommend you trigger the belt unit     said ishihara .      they keep saying something like    guei    or    kuai      something like that     said wayne .     any idea what it means .         no     said ishihara .     and i must remind you that the first law will force me to take the belt unit away from you and trigger it myself if they come much closer to us .         well  they stopped when i smiled at them just now and said hello .  maybe we can get through to them .  show them that both your hands are empty .  and smile .     wayne felt more frightened than he sounded .   ishihara held both his hands out  open  and smiled .     i think this word they keep saying means something negative  from their tone of voice .  they fear we are a couple of gueis .         whatever they are .         yes .         the word must mean some kind of supernatural creature   you know  a demon or a fairy or something else that can appear magically .         it must mean an evil creature of some type     said ishihara .     they would not be as afraid or as hostile toward a good spirit .  i surmise that our european appearance has also increased their fear to some degree .  certainly these ancient german tunics and cloak make us look barbaric .         hey .  maybe we can use this .  we   re good spirits .  we have to tell them we   re good spirits .         this will be a difficult distinction to make without a language in common     said ishihara .   the peasants had begun approaching them slowly once again .      no guei  no guei .     wayne forced himself to smile even more broadly than before  though he was too scared to feel very friendly .  he held his hands up  palms forward .   the peasants stopped again  still talking among themselves .  the word    guei     was repeated even more than before .      they understand guei  at least     said wayne quietly  slipping one hand back to the belt unit  just in case .     i   m going to try something else .         be extremely careful     said ishihara .   wayne renewed his phony smile and stepped forward  holding one arm high above his head .  he knew they would not understand his speech  but he hoped that they would respond to a friendly tone of voice and gestures of greeting .     hello  whoever you are .  good evening .  we are glad to see you .      the peasants gazed at him .  their eyes were wide with surprise and puzzlement .  one of the men in the front  who held a large hoe  shouted to wayne suspiciously .      do what i did     said wayne .     i think it   s working .         hello     ishihara called out .  he also raised one arm in greeting .     good evening .      the peasants watched them without speaking .  the man in front lowered his hoe slightly .      we have to convince them we   re good spirits     wayne said quietly .     then they   ll actually help us .         if we can prevent them from trying to kill us .  i will be satisfied     said ishihara .   the peasants began talking to each other again .      it   s working     said wayne .     at least  they aren   t as sure as they were a minute ago that we   re enemies .         we have made no aggressive moves     said ishihara .     that may have helped .  however  i recommend again that we jump forward in time and start over         not yet     said wayne .     this is a populated area  so we might be seen again .         after dark  that is very unlikely .         we can use their help     wayne said eagerly     we   ll need them .  we won   t be able to speak to anyone else here  either .  but we could really use some allies .  if we can become friends with them  can you start learning their language .         yes  if we have prolonged interaction with them     said ishihara .     but i cannot predict how quickly i will make progress .         i think i remember something from my elementary school days     said wayne .     didn   t the chinese used to bow to each other as a greeting .         i do not know .         well  try it .  do what i do .     wayne caught the eye of the man with the hoe and slowly bowed forward from the waist .   next to him  ishihara did the same .   the man carrying the hoe bowed in return .  belatedly  so did several of his companions .  all of them fell silent again .      it   s like offering a handshake in our own time     said wayne .     we finally did something they understood .      an elderly man stepped forward from the group .  the man with the hoe joined him  lowering the hoe to the ground .  the older man spoke to wayne  calmly this time .      any idea what he said .     wayne asked .      no .         i was afraid you   d say that .  but he   s asking a question  don   t you think .         from his tone and facial expression  yes .         i   m going to guess he   s asked who we are or where we came from     said wayne .  he smiled again and pointed to the sky .     i hope that   s what he asked .      the peasants began chattering excitedly among themselves again .  the two men in the front bowed once more .  everyone in the group looked at wayne and ishihara in amazement .      i have to keep this going somehow     said wayne .     just follow me .     he walked forward  still smiling  and patted his stomach .     can you help us  friends .     the only tools of communication he could think of were gestures  facial expressions  and tones of voice .   for the first time  some of the peasants smiled in surprise .  certainly  they recognized his gesture of hunger .  the two men in the front conferred briefly .  then the older man spoke  waving for wayne and ishihara to come with them .   wayne glanced at ishihara  relieved .     well  i got through to them a little .  let   s go .         i would expect the villagers to believe that good spirits who come to visit humans would speak the local human language     said ishihara .     the villagers may question this .         well .  .  . if they do  we can   t understand them .  and if we did  we still couldn   t explain .     with a helpless shrug  wayne smiled again at their plight .     since they don   t seem to want to hurt us  maybe we can get along .         i recommend that you keep your hand on your belt unit     said ishihara  as he joined wayne in walking forward .   the peasants kept a slight distance from them as they took the road  walking away from the city .  they still muttered among themselves and glanced at their new guests with a mixture of awe and fascination .  wayne smiled and nodded at anyone he caught looking at him .      so how do you feel about this so far .     wayne asked ishihara .     joining them  i mean .  they still seem to like us .         i am most concerned about your safety under the first law .  the danger has only decreased slightly .  our inability to communicate effectively means that a misunderstanding could occur very easily .         i understand what you mean     said wayne .     i have every intention of being careful .  but i reiterate my ongoing instructions to you  you must help me under the first law to complete my mission of apprehending at least one component robot .  my career and my life in general will be harmed if i can   t conduct my own investigation into how mc governor malfunctioned .          acknowledged .      wayne grinned .     i bet they think we   re speaking some sort of fairy language .         i assume so .      before long  the peasants left the main road for a narrow dirt path .  ahead  wayne saw a cluster of tightly bunched  single story buildings barely outlined by hanging lanterns over the doors .  small children were playing nearby .   the grounds around the village were raked clean  but the surrounding crops had been planted almost right up against the small wooden houses clustered in the center .  only the width of a footpath separated the village from the crops  and the buildings from each other .   the man carrying the hoe called out .  the children looked up  and elderly women came out of the houses .  all of them stared in wonder at the strangers .     hunter spent an uneventful night in the front room of the bungalow  motionless but not shut down .  at the earliest light of dawn  he heard sounds of activity in the city around the bungalow   people talking  carts and wagons creaking  horses and donkeys clopping  and babies crying .  a few moments later  steve came out of his room .      i guess nobody sleeps late around here     steve muttered .     what a racket .         marcia and jane have not stirred yet     said hunter .     i expect they will soon .         yeah .  well  i   ll go look for the latrine .     stretching  steve left the bungalow .   a moment later  hunter heard jane and marcia talking to each other .  he waited patiently while all three humans rose  dressed  used the latrine  and washed at the water pump out in the courtyard .  then he joined them .  the early morning sunlight angled across the courtyard .  the sky was clear and bright  though the air was still cool at this hour .      good morning     said hunter .     you are all ready for breakfast .         i   m starved     said steve  tugging his robe here and there .     i just hope i can get used to wearing this thing .         i need a shower     said marcia .     but i don   t think they   ve been invented yet .  we can arrange baths later in the day  though .         i   m ready to get breakfast     said jane .     and if this is the neighborhood where foreign visitors are common  then we can start looking for mc   at the same time .         let   s go back to the same place where i asked for directions     said steve .     i kind of promised we   d come back there to eat .         all right .     hunter turned and led his team out of the courtyard through a gate to one side of the main building .     this is a logical beginning .             out on the street  hunter found shops already open .  the aroma of various foods cooking reached him .  people filled the street  walking among pony carts and pushcarts .   steve fell into step next to hunter .     this is a regular city  isn   t it .  on an ordinary day .  where would mc   go around here to find clothes .         as always  i have only approximated the time when he will return to his full size     said hunter .     i believe yesterday was the earliest  he may not appear for another day or two .  i suppose  like the other component robots  he will have to steal clothing when he first arrives  either from someone   s trash or maybe from a line of laundry hung up to dry in the sunlight .      a line of people waited at the stall where steve had asked for information the night before .  long wooden tables and benches had been placed out in front .  hunter could see a big pot of rice gruel simmering over an open fire burning in a brick hearth .  customers bought bowls of the gruel and small plates of pork and chicken strips and fresh vegetables to stir into it .   hunter and steve took places in line and bought three breakfasts .  at the same time  marcia and jane sat down at one of the tables and reserved seats for them .  while the humans ate  hunter patiently observed their surroundings .   most of the people hunter could see were chinese  either tending small shops  pushing vending carts  or walking briskly .  they wore light  pajamalike loose jackets and trousers .  a smaller number  dressed in embroidered silk gowns  were clearly more wealthy .  a very few people he could see  however  were not chinese at all  though they were wearing chinese gowns .      marcia  of what origin are the two men walking toward us on the far side of the street .     hunter asked .     in our own time  i would guess they were from the middle east .      she looked up from her bowl .     that   s a good guess .  in this era  i   d say they are central asian turks .  starting a couple of centuries ago  several waves of migrating turks moved westward from central asia into the middle east  which is one reason that many people of this appearance live there in our own time .  the mongol conquest of the entire region has facilitated travel in all directions and  as i said  kublai khan has hired many foreigners to work in his government .  in fact  these turks probably arrived by the old silk road  just as the polo family         that   s interesting     steve said quickly .     but what about them .     he pointed to two men of east asian ancestry whose gowns were similar to their own  but whose hair was tightly drawn up into a knot on top of their heads .     nobody else has that hairstyle .         they   re koreans     said marcia .     korea has long been a part of the mongol empire by this year .         i think i see some arabs     said jane .     they   re right across the street .         yes  that   s right     said marcia .     the arabs conquered the turks some centuries ago and introduced them to islam .  they had some reason to regret it  some of the turks revolted and overthrew them all the way back to palestine .         i   m glad no one   s fighting here     said jane .     i guess kublai khan pacified them all  huh .         for the time being .     marcia nodded .     but in only a few hundred years           hunter     steve said earnestly  interrupting her again .     what are we going to do after breakfast .  to find mc    i mean .  what   s our plan of action .         this is a good place to begin     said hunter .     we will start today by becoming familiar with the neighborhood and simply looking for mc   .         no reason to stop with that     said steve .     we can also ask around   maybe offer a small reward to people for giving us a lead on him .         marcia  will that be acceptable in this society .     hunter asked .      yes  it will .         good     said steve .     and i guess  based on past experience  we have to keep an eye out for wayne nystrom and ishihara  too .  maybe we should offer a reward for them .         i agree     said hunter .      they haven   t stopped you before     said marcia .      they have come close     said hunter .     we must remain alert for them .        the night before  wayne and ishihara had shared a modest dinner of white rice and steamed fish in the village .  they had slept on pallets in a bedroom in one of the small houses .  though modest  the room was clearly a place of honor  wayne noticed that the elderly man and his slight  stooped  gray haired wife vacated it for them and went out to sleep in the main room with seven other people who seemed  by their mutual resemblance  to represent two more generations of the same family .  unable to communicate  wayne could not protest .  in any case  he wanted to maintain the pose that he and ishihara were good spirits  and he was sure the peasants assumed good spirits would expect hospitality of this sort .   wayne had fallen asleep quickly  and had slept soundly .  when he finally awoke to the sound of roosters crowing outside and people speaking in the main room of the house  he felt well rested but hungry again .   he found ishihara sitting against the closed door of the room  watching him .      morning     wayne said quietly .     did you observe anything interesting during the night .         no .  however  i can announce some minimal progress in learning the local language .         really .  how .         during the night  i have repeatedly reviewed my memory of all our contact with the villagers to this point .  at the time we first met them  the first law required that i focus my attention entirely on the potential danger to you .  after i was satisfied that you were safe  i began reviewing the gestures and conversation of the villagers  also  of course  i was able to observe more of their conversation and gestures during dinner last night .  when they rose early this morning  i was able to hear some of their speech through the door of our room .         wait a minute .  i   m no linguist .  what   s the point of studying their gestures .         it was the only way i could begin to pick up vocabulary .  for instance  every time someone passed or received a bowl of rice  the word fan was used in conversation .         so you   re sure it means rice .  what if it means  hungry  or more of the same .         you have identified the problem exactly     said ishihara .     right now  i am making educated guesses .  however  i will begin speaking some of these words and see how our hosts respond .  i gave you only one example .         what else .     wayne got up and began getting dressed .     more vocabulary .         more than that .  the basic sentence structure has some similarities to english .  the simple declarative sentence goes  subject  verb  object  in that order .  when they ask questions  the tone goes up at the end  the same as in english .  but the vocabulary is tonal  the lilt you give to each word separates it from what in english would be homophones .         okay  okay  i   ll take your word for it .  but you think you can learn it .         gradually  i will develop some ability to speak with them  yes .      wayne finished dressing .     well  i guess it   s time for breakfast .  let   s go out and try it .  and let   s see if we can get some local clothes this time .         yes  i agree we should do that .      when they opened the door and entered the main room  wayne saw that it was crowded with people .  everyone who lived in the house turned to look at them  as did as many of their neighbors who could jam inside .  everyone fell silent .   the elderly woman spoke up  pointing to the big pot of rice gruel simmering over the fire .      fan     said ishihara  with a casual nod .   one of the younger women picked up a wooden bowl and ladled gruel into it .  another woman spoke quickly to several children  who got up and made room at the hearth .  wayne and ishihara accepted their bowls and sat down .   wayne ate in silence  but occasionally he met someone   s eyes and smiled slightly .  ishihara  however  attempted to make casual conversation .  wayne knew that ishihara   s ability to learn the language far outstripped his  so he did not try to participate .   he watched with amusement  however  as ishihara pointed to different people and objects around the room  apparently learning vocabulary .  their hosts were eager teachers  especially the children .  everyone smiled with approval at ishihara   s successful efforts to communicate .   by the time wayne had finished his second bowl of bland gruel  ishihara was speaking and gesturing  frequently pointing upward .  the villagers nodded with guileless wonder as they looked again at both their guests .  finally the conversation came to a pause .      what did you say .     wayne asked quietly .   their hosts turned to him  fascinated by hearing him speak his strange language again .      i have made some progress  i believe     said ishihara .     they are more convinced than ever that we have fallen from the sky as spirits .     guei    appears to mean an evil spirit  maybe an equivalent to a demon or devil .  they do seem convinced that we are not guei .  by the way  all the nouns seem to be collective  without a plural .  you may need to pick up a few phrases .         you seem to be learning the language without much trouble     said wayne .      the first stage is the most difficult     said ishihara .     as i hear more words and more varied sentence structures  my learning curve will rise sharply .  right now i am most effective when discussing physical objects  such as requesting more rice gruel .  concepts such as spirits and demons still make uncertain communication .      the villagers watched them without speaking .      i want to follow up the idea we had last time   of stopping hunter and his team first     said wayne .      do you have a specific plan in mind for our current situation .         maybe .  look  if we can interfere with hunter   s team  then we   ll have a free hand to find mc   .  when we tried that before  you and i were acting alone .  if our hosts  here  will help us in the belief that we   re  uh  good spirits  maybe we can really distract hunter this time .         we must handle this very carefully     said ishihara .     i cannot allow any actions that might harm the people of this village or the human members of hunter   s team .         all we have to do is slow down the bunch of them     said wayne .     send them on a wild goose chase or divide them so that hunter spends his time trying to gather his team again instead of looking for mc   .         by involving the villagers  we increase our chance of altering history in a significant way .         well .  .  . you must admit  we   ve made numerous small changes already  and so has hunter   s team .  nothing seems to have changed  has it .         you and i have not been back to our own time to see if they have had an effect .         our presence in roman germany had not altered the front between the germans and soviets in      .  our collective activities in the time of the dinosaurs and in jamaica in the        before you joined me  had not made any visible alterations  either .         granted  but i insist we must remain very careful .  do you have a plan .         yeah  i think so .  can you tell them that we   re looking for hunter and his team  and that hunter is an evil spirit we must locate .         i believe i can convey that idea     said ishihara .     but i cannot identify hunter   s human team as evil spirits .  doing so might endanger them too much .         then tell them that hunter  the evil spirit  has duped certain innocent humans into helping him  and they should not be hurt .  is that acceptable .         i will tell them that hunter is a good spirit who is temporarily misguided .         yeah  okay .     ishihara turned to the elderly couple and switched to chinese .  he spoke to them for several minutes  sometimes shaking his head .  finally he turned to wayne again .     i think i have conveyed my point .         are they willing to help .         most of the villagers have to work in the fields .  however  some of them are going to the city market with produce to sell .  they have no work animal  so they have to pull and push their cart on the road themselves .  we can go with them and they will help .      wayne smiled  nodding approval to their hosts .     thank you .      several of them nodded back  also smiling .  they seemed to understand his meaning just tine .     hunter walked through the streets with his team members after they had finished breakfast  with jane beside him .  steve and marcia actually led  to maintain the appearance of being the hosts  but hunter quietly told them when and where to turn .  his calculations indicated that mc   would probably return to full size somewhere within several particular blocks  rather than on the street  but the margin of error was too large to be certain .  these blocks were similar to the ones near the inn   full of small shops and open air eateries  with peddlers pushing carts up and down the street .       jane .     hunter spoke in english .  since they were masquerading as foreigners anyway  being overheard here would not matter .     how do you think mc   might have behaved here if he has already returned to full size .         well  these shops have all kinds of stuff  including clothes .  he may find something to wear without too much trouble .  after that  i don   t know .  i know that his specialty in mojave center was administration of the city .         do you think he might move toward the center of government administration here .         it would be a logical move for him     said jane .     but i don   t know exactly what that would mean in this society .  he   d have to figure that out  too .         marcia .     hunter stopped walking .  steve and marcia turned and joined jane .     do i understand that the center of government here is ultimately kublai khan himself .         yes  that   s correct     said marcia .     he is surrounded by a huge chinese bureaucracy  but he is the final authority .  in fact           jane     hunter interrupted  turning to her .      jane  would the imperatives of the laws of robotics impel mc   to seek out kublai khan .         that   s hard to say     jane said thoughtfully .     well  let me think out loud for a moment .  i was thinking that his own programming as a specialist in city administration would draw him in that direction .  but of course  his underlying motive under the first law would be to lessen the harm to humanity by improving the quality of government .         what else might he do .     hunter asked .      well  he could get caught up in more mundane first law activities  i suppose .         huh .  like what .     steve asked .      such as helping laborers avoid accidents .  or stopping fights he happens to see .  any sort of individual incident that might attract his attention .         sounds to me like we should start spreading the word  like i suggested before     said steve .     once we   ve offered a small reward to anyone who leads us to mc    we can just take casual strolls up and down the streets .         i agree     said hunter .     you and marcia will pick the people to approach .      steve glanced at marcia .     let   s get started .         excellent     said marcia .     i suggest we offer a graduated system of rewards .  to most people on the street  a single copper is worth enough to get their attention .  suppose we offer one copper for someone who reports a sighting of mc    two for someone who can lead us to him  and three for someone who brings him to us .  if they bring him soon           hold it  will you .     steve demanded .     why do you have to make it so complicated .  we can just           make it up as we go along .     marcia raised one eyebrow haughtily .     maybe you   re offended that i   m developing your own precious idea .      startled  steve fumbled for something to say .      please proceed     said hunter .     both of you .             the villagers had already postponed their normal routine in order to visit the good spirits who had graced their village .  wayne urged ishihara to explain that they wanted to dress as fellow villagers for their walk into khanbaliq .  the villagers seemed amused and honored by this request .   two men agreed to work in the fields bare to the waist so their guests could wear their shirts and hats .  after some consultation  a couple of women reluctantly brought out some old  tattered pants that had been discarded even by the peasants .  ishihara assured them that these clothes were sufficient  and the two of them changed clothes in their room .   wayne was willing to go barefoot like the peasants  but ishihara refused to allow this under the first law .  instead  ishihara borrowed a knife and cut both pairs of boots he had prepared for roman germany down into a sort of makeshift shoes .  then they joined the small group of peasants making the journey into the city .  the strongest and healthiest men and women of the village returned to work in the fields for the day .   lao li  the village elder in whose house they had stayed  led the others to khanbaliq .  most of the other peasants who accompanied them were elderly  too  except for lao li   s twelve year old grandson  xiao li .  ishihara told wayne that    lao     which meant    old     and    xiao     meaning    little     were common honorific nicknames .   wayne walked in silence  of course  since no one but ishihara could understand him .  the robot talked with the villagers  often with everyone waving  gesturing  and sometimes laughing as they tried to communicate .  ishihara was learning the language as fast as he could .   as they finally drew near the walls of the city  ishihara turned to wayne .     i am making good progress now .  one of the villagers has told me that in many of their old fairy tales  good spirits come to earth like this in human form to travel in secret among people .         that means we fit right in .         yes .  i am very relieved that we are not  in fact  introducing new ideas to this culture but simply demonstrating existing ones .         well  that helps explain why they   ve been so cooperative  too .         still  we must remain very alert to the possibility that we may truly interfere historically with these peasants in some significant way .         i don   t think we have much to worry about     said wayne .     they   re going to market like they do every day  aren   t they .  we   re just tagging along .        by mid morning  hunter had led his team up and down every street in the foreign quarter .  they passed more turks and arabs in colorful  embroidered chinese gowns  koreans wearing their topknots and with slightly different embroidery on their gowns  and stocky mongol soldiers wearing their armor  swords  and daggers .  chinese citizens owned and worked in most of the shops  however  and they were the people most likely to cooperate .   steve and marcia spoke briefly to people on every block  describing mc   .  they approached many who worked in shops  but they also spoke to peddlers pushing their carts and to children who were old enough to remember their description of mc   .  hunter had heard steve grudgingly agree to marcia   s system of rewards .  while they spoke to passersby  hunter and jane hung back slightly in their pose as foreign visitors .   they passed merchants of all sorts .  the shops and stalls sold fabrics and sturdy  simple furniture on one street and fine porcelains and iron cookware on the next .  the third block they visited held stall after stall of different crafts  including a family that was boiling big vats of plant fibers to make paper .  on every street  small children ran and played and peddlers pushed carts of small trinkets .   when hunter realized that the team had seen the entire foreign quarter  he stopped and turned to his companions .      we have saturated the neighborhood with our offers of rewards     said hunter .     since we have been walking for some time  i suggest that we find a place to sit so that you three can rest .  we can consider what to do next .         there   s a place back up this block     said steve .     they   re selling tea under the shade of two big trees .         a tea garden     said marcia .     that   s what the sign over the front entrance said .      steve glared at her in annoyance .  she always seemed to show him up  no matter what he said .  for the sake of the team  he decided not to make a scene about it .      good idea     said jane .     i could use a rest .         i   m hot     said marcia .     but they don   t have cold drinks here  unless you   re out in the country and find a mountain stream or something .         that is fascinating     hunter said quickly .  he found marcia   s spontaneous lectures on local history interesting  but he realized that steve  in particular  really disliked listening to them .      come on .     steve started for the tea shop at a brisk walk and the others followed .      shall we just rest up and wait for someone to find mc   .     jane asked as she hurried along .      that is one possibility     said hunter .     for the first time since our trip to the late cretaceous  we have staked out the location where our quarry should return to full size .  with the reward we have offered  the number of people around  and the stable nature of life here  we have far more potential help than usual .         i hear a    but    coming     said jane .     i think i know what it is  too .  you still can   t be sure if mc   has already returned to full size .         that is true     said hunter .     however  because of his european appearance in a society with very few europeans  we are not likely to lose track of him completely with our offer of a reward circulating .      steve turned and waited for them to catch up .     i heard that .  we could  you know .  .  . split up .     he grinned .      that is unwise     said hunter .     you will remember that in the past           it   s a joke  hunter     said jane  grinning .     every time we split up  we regret it .  we both know that .         i see     said hunter .     was this joke funny .         skip it     said steve .     look  it wasn   t totally a joke  i just didn   t think you   d go for it .  but think about it .  maybe splitting up won   t be as bad this time .         why not .         well  as you said  life is pretty stable here .  two of us could sit down in a prominent place and wait for someone to bring the good news that mc   has been found .  the other two could keep up a more active search .      as they reached the counter of the tea garden  steve turned to order tea for them .      has everyone forgotten that we had a plan already .     marcia asked impatiently .     we were going to look for the polo family today  remember .         i had not forgotten     said hunter .     i merely raised the question of what to do next .  searching for the polos is one option .         all right     said marcia .     i really didn   t think you   d forget .      a young woman led them to a round wooden table under the trees  where they sat down on short  wooden benches .      i kind of like the idea of meeting marco polo myself     said steve .     just out of curiosity .  but is he really important to what we   re doing .         we discussed this last night     marcia said testily .     mc   probably knows about him  too  and may also try to contact him .  is that important enough .         yeah  all right     steve muttered  shrugging .      when you have rested and finished your tea  i suggest we search for the polo family     said hunter .     as wayne followed the peasants into khanbaliq  he realized that they knew exactly where to go .  they worked their way through the crowded streets to a block of open air markets filled with fresh produce .  an empty stall with wooden shelves and a couple of benches waited for them .  lao li and his companions quickly moved their produce from their cart to the shelves in the stall .      is this place theirs .     wayne asked ishihara .      they rent it .  lao li complained to one of the others that their rent will be due next week .         so that means they   re in the same place every day .     wayne looked up and down the street .     they must know their neighbors on this block  then .         i suppose so .  is this important .         maybe .     wayne paused to estimate the length of the city blocks .     we   ll want to start spreading the word for people to find hunter and his team .  from what i can make out  the part of the city where mc   will return to normal size is fairly close .  i think that neighborhood is maybe another couple of blocks east of here .         that is where hunter will be .         obviously .     wayne looked at xiao li  as the boy arranged some stalks of sorghum on a low shelf .     but we don   t want hunter to find out where we are .  we   ll need some help .  can they spare the kid  here .         i will ask .     ishihara switched to chinese  talking with lao li .   their host spoke with his grandson  whose eyes widened with excitement .  lao li talked to him in a stern tone of voice .  wayne guessed that he was admonishing the boy to obey these good spirits .  then ishihara turned to wayne again .      he will do whatever we ask .  of course  i cannot allow him to take any significant risks .         well  i don   t have anything dangerous in mind .  i just want him to spot hunter   s team for us without revealing our involvement .  since hunter can   t let him get hurt  either  he should do just fine .         i agree .  what shall i tell him .         ask him what sort of neighborhood lies a few blocks east of here .      ishihara translated and waited for the answer .     he said it   s where the foreign traders and diplomats live .  also many of the foreigners who have taken jobs in the government here .         i see .  guys like marco polo  i guess .         yes  that is my impression .      xiao li looked back and forth between them  eager to please .      well  let   s give this a try .  say that we want him to take us over there because we think hunter may be in that area .  repeat the description of hunter and also steve and jane .  then describe mc   and tell the boy that he is even more important than hunter .  and explain that we have to hang back and keep these big hats over our faces so that hunter won   t recognize us until we choose to be seen .      ishihara translated and xiao li waved for them to follow him .  wayne shifted his hat down lower over his face .  ishihara did the same   the morning had grown hot .  after a short walk  wayne could see that they had reached the foreign quarter  he saw a number of people he guessed were turks .  in any case  they were not chinese .   xiao li looked up at ishihara and spoke .      he suggests we sit down at a small corner stall near this spot to have some noodles or tea and wait     said ishihara .     he will take a quick walk up and down this block for us .  if he doesn   t see hunter or mc    we   ll all walk to the next block and repeat the pattern .         tell him that   s fine     said wayne .   when xiao li had eagerly hurried off  wayne shrugged .     well  since we don   t have any money  we can   t buy anything .  but i   m ready to sit down .      ishihara pointed to a large tree growing near the street between two small shops .  one sold glazed pottery  while the other held cotton and silk clothing .     that spot should be relatively cool .  it is not in anyone   s way .         yeah .     wayne walked over to the tree and sat down  leaning his back against it .  his legs and feet hurt  and he would have a long walk back to that village  too  unless they were lucky enough to find mc   today .  that seemed unlikely  but so far  he was optimistic about their overall chances here .  for the first time  he had a team of people helping him to compete with hunter   s team .   ishihara stood next to him under the tree  looking at the people on the street .   a child   s excited shouts got their attention .  wayne looked down the street and saw xiao li running toward them with a big grin  waving and yelling as he dodged around other pedestrians .  wayne started to stand  then decided to rest his legs just a moment longer .   the boy stopped in front of them  talking quickly .  ishihara listened  nodding .  when xiao li finished  he grabbed ishihara   s hand and started pulling him .      i suggest we go     said ishihara .     he reports that friends of his have seen hunter and his team on the next block .  in fact  hunter has widely offered rewards to anyone who can bring them in contact with mc   .         oh  yeah .     wayne got to his feet .     well  let   s take a look .  we still have to stay out of sight  though .      as they started to walk  ishihara spoke briefly to xiao li .  the boy nodded and let go of his hand .  he led them at a brisk pace  however .      what did you say .     wayne asked .      i told him that running would draw attention to us     said ishihara .     i reiterated the importance of hunter   s not seeing us until we were ready .         good .      wayne could tell when they were nearing hunter because xiao li slowed down and moved to one side of the street  furtively glancing ahead to the opposite side .  wayne lowered his head slightly so the broad brim of his hat would cover more of his face .  ishihara did the same .  the crowd of people and carts on the street gave them plenty of cover .   finally xiao li moved behind the corner of a small noodle shop and pointed diagonally across the street to an area that was shaded with trees .  wayne and ishihara slipped behind him .  xiao li spoke eagerly to ishihara .      hunter and his team are drinking tea at a table in the shade     said ishihara .     i can see hunter  facing slightly away from us .         yeah .     wayne looked around the corner carefully .  he spotted hunter easily  because of his height and blond hair .  jane sat next to him  blowing on her teacup .  steve sat across from her  next to a woman wayne did not recognize .  she would be the team   s historian for this trip  of course .      see them .     ishihara asked .      yeah .     wayne grinned and gave xiao li a quick pat on the shoulder .     tell him that he will have good luck for doing such a fine job .      ishihara spoke to the boy  who smiled broadly .      now what shall we do .     ishihara asked .     we do not have any funds with which to match hunter   s reward .         that   s right     said wayne .     that reward means real trouble for us .  now hunter has a lot of people   an uncountable number   working for him now .         your plan of distracting him in some way could still work     said ishihara .      that   s true  i guess     said wayne slowly .      i believe so     said ishihara .     if hunter is busy and therefore difficult to locate  then his efficiency will still be lowered  even with many people helping in his search .  we might increase our chance of finding mc   first .         let   s make sure the story on the street is true     said wayne .     tell xiao li to approach hunter and ask about this reward .      ishihara spoke to xiao li  who looked startled .  wayne could see that he was not eager to go near hunter .  the boy turned and studied hunter for a moment before answering ishihara .      he is frightened     said ishihara .     he is afraid of the bad spirit .         remind him that hunter is not an evil spirit .  he   s just a good one who is misguided   he should not be doing what he is doing .  give xiao li our absolute guarantee that he won   t be hurt .  then see if he will talk to hunter and report back without revealing us .      xiao li listened carefully to ishihara and nodded .  then he took another cautious look at hunter and slowly walked forward .  in the shade across the street  wayne saw steve pouring tea again for everyone .   once xiao li reached the tea garden  the traffic on the street blocked wayne   s view of him .  after only a moment  however  the boy came hurrying back with a big smile of relief .  he dodged the people moving up and down the street and trotted up to ishihara  reporting breathlessly .   wayne drew back around the comer of the shop  out of hunter   s sight .     what   s he saying .         he says it   s true     said ishihara .     hunter has offered a stepped system of rewards based on how much help he gets .  even the top reward will not make anyone rich  but it is attractive enough to have started many people talking about it on the street .  they are searching for both mc   and the polo family .         polo family .  you mean marco polo .         apparently he is here with his father and an uncle  as well     said ishihara .      oh .  well  i don   t know much about marco polo .  just that he came here in kublai khan   s time from italy and went back home to write a book about it .         i know no more about this than you do     said ishihara .      this is the chance we wanted  though     wayne said suddenly .     will you tell him to report to hunter that the polos have left town .  today  so hunter thinks he has a chance to catch them .  i don   t think you should have an objection under the laws .  hunter will protect his own team .         yes  i can tell him to do this     said ishihara .     however  hunter will ask which direction they took .  do you wish to develop your ruse further .  we have an opportunity to distract him .         well  sure .  but i don   t know exactly what to say .  where is there to send him around here .  someplace convincing that will take him out of way .         i am not certain .  as i told you  i have little knowledge of this society .         yeah .  .  . me  too .     wayne thought a moment .     what do we know about this time .  marco polo  kublai khan  printing  gunpowder .  .  .     he looked up suddenly .     say   what about the great wall of china .         what about it .         uh  where is it .         perhaps xiao li knows .     ishihara turned to the boy and exchanged a few words .     he says it is north of khanbaliq .         how far .  we want hunter to go on a long diversion  not just a quick side trip .      ishihara spoke to xiao li again .      he has heard that the trip takes a couple of days on horseback .  since he has never been there  he does not know for sure how far the great wall is .         that   s far enough to get hunter out of our way for a while .  let   s send hunter there if we can .         i will tell xiao li     said ishihara .          hunter waited patiently while his companions rested in the shade .  since he regenerated his energy by converting sunlight through the microscopic solar cells on his skin  he had benefited from the walk in the direct sunlight .  certainly this climate  in the summer  was easier on him and his human team members than the russian winter had been during their last mission .   the little boy who had asked him questions a few minutes earlier walked back  looking at hunter shyly .  he stopped several meters away .  hunter waited for him to speak  but he remained silent .      may i help you .     hunter asked .      i have information for you     said the boy with a polite bow .   steve looked up from his teacup .     what is it .         i have heard that the polo family went north this morning to the great wall .         yeah .     steve grinned .     hunter  that   s great .  we know where to find them .  and mc   probably hasn   t had time to reach them yet .         are you certain of this .     hunter asked .      this is what i have been told     the boy said carefully .      who told you .     steve asked .   he hesitated .     two men .         i see     said hunter .     what is your name .         xiao li .         give him a tip     said steve .      a tip is appropriate at this time .  what if his information is inaccurate .         we   ll have to take some risk .  don   t give him the whole reward yet .  if he   s right  we   ll pay him the rest .         is this acceptable .     hunter asked xiao li .      yes  sir .      hunter reached into his gown and gave xiao li a couple of small copper coins .      thank you .     with another bow  the boy turned away .      wait a minute     said steve .     you might be able to help us with more information .      xiao li paused  looking at them all .      you have more questions for him .     hunter asked .      not yet     said steve .     but exactly what are we going to do .  if we need to change our plans  he might know where we should go to find other people .         agreed     said hunter .      what is our plan now .     marcia asked .      i would like to hear all of your opinions     said hunter .     i am not certain what to do now .         this is a stroke of luck     said jane .  she paused to sip her tea .     we could have spent hours trying to find the polo family and they aren   t even here .         if mc   can   t find them  then why do we need them .     marcia asked .      good question     said jane .     but at least we won   t waste time looking for them here in the city .         i think we should go after them     said steve .     they only left today   probably just a few hours ago .  maybe mc   is even with them or following them  too .  in order to get some kind of introduction through them to the government  he will have to establish some kind of friendship with them .         well  hunter .     jane shrugged .     what if mc   is here in town  instead .         that is a point to consider     said hunter .     mc   is our quarry  not marco polo .         i hate to repeat the obvious     steve said with a grin .     especially when i know you don   t like it .  but this is a stable town and we have no enemies here .  why not split up .  maybe  to reduce your worries  we three should stay here and you can go north to look for the polos .         i accepted such logic on earlier missions     said hunter .     in most cases  i came to regret it .  this time  we will stay together .         okay .     steve shrugged .     so what   s it going to be .  are we staying here to look for mc   .         i remain undecided     said hunter .     marcia  how far is the great wall from here .         about sixty five kilometers .  the road goes north from khanbaliq through some mountains to a major gate in the wall .         we would need horses to make the trip efficiently     said hunter .     on horseback  that is a two day ride each way  i estimate .         that   s right     said steve .     at least  depending on how rugged the road is .      marcia eyed him skeptically .     oh  you know all about horses  do you .         no     steve said stiffly .     but i have some experience with them .  i   ve owned a couple in the past and used to ride them out in the desert .  i can take care of them and i know how far they can travel in a day .         we rode horseback in roman germany     said jane .     as long as the horses are calm and well trained  we   ll be fine .      hunter was studying marcia .     have you ridden horseback before .         no     said marcia uncomfortably .  .      jane is right that safety is largely a matter of matching the horse to the rider     said hunter .     i will not allow us to go unless we can find one you can ride .         we wouldn   t have to make the whole trip to the great wall     said jane .     if we leave soon enough  we   ll catch up to them when they stop for the night .         that   s right     said steve .     we   ll take the rest of today to reach them  talk to them tonight or tomorrow morning  and then return tomorrow .         this is acceptable     said hunter .     spending two days is not extravagant .         what about wayne .     jane asked     what if mc   is still in town .         this is a reasonable point     said hunter .     we could be leaving wayne and ishihara two days to find mc   here without competition from us .         the most logical move is to separate  hunter     said steve     no matter how you figure it .         my interpretation of the first law at this time does not accept that logic     said hunter .     my need to protect you overrides the distant possibility that we will find mc   by splitting up at this time .         if the chance of getting mc   was clear and immediate  you would allow us to split up .     jane asked .      yes     said hunter .     the first law imperative to catch him is stronger than unclear risks to you three .      steve sighed and finished his tea .     all right .  so what are we going to do  then .         we must choose between two risks     said hunter .     if we stay here  we have no current lead to find mc   .  if we follow the lead we have  we may leave wayne and ishihara a free hand here to find him first .         doing something is probably better than nothing     said marcia .     i suggest we follow the lead we have to find the polos .         yeah  i agree     steve said grudgingly  with an annoyed glance at marcia .     for this reason  hunter .  we   ve told everybody around here that we   re offering a reward .  these people  as a group  have a better chance of grabbing mc   than wayne and ishihara .         yes     said hunter .     we are leaving some help for ourselves behind .         good .     steve got up .     let   s stop wasting time talking about it .     he turned to xiao li .     where can we get some horses   four  to be exact .         nowhere in this neighborhood     said xiao li .     but i can take you to some stables several blocks from here near the north gate .         i do not want to take you away from your home neighborhood     said hunter .     please give me directions .  we will find the location .        within an hour  steve rode out of the north gate of khanbaliq on a small mare  leading the rest of the team .  following xiao li   s directions     they had found a number of commercial stables in business just inside the north gate .  as before  the bargaining fell to steve .  since no one would lease horses to be ridden out of the city  they   d had to buy them  and of course saddles and bridles  as well .   hunter had enough money to do so  and the man who sold the horses also told them where to find inns along the way where they could spend the night .  steve had mounted each horse they   d considered buying  to make sure that it was well trained and calm enough for the less experienced riders .   when hunter   s concern for everyone   s safety had been satisfied  steve had found a shop that sold water skins and meat buns they could take with them .  another shop had sold them each long leather coats trimmed with fur for the cold nights in the mountains .   immediately outside the north gate of the city  the road was deserted in the middle of the day .  steve could see that it wound up into the forested mountains ahead .  he turned to look back over his shoulder .   marcia sat stiffly upright on a seven year old gelding  holding the reins gingerly .  hunter rode next to her  giving her instructions .  jane kicked her mount and  came up next to steve at a trot .      i just thought of a problem i hadn   t considered before     said jane .      huh .  what   s wrong .         the man who sold us the horses said we could find inns along the way to spend night  right .         sure .  what   s the matter with that .         well  the idea was to catch up to the polos when they stop for the night .  but if this road has a lot of inns  we   ll have to look for them at every single one .         i guess we can do that .         i guess .     jane shrugged .     i just hope we don   t find too many inns tonight .         we   ll have lunch in the saddle     said steve .     the polos will probably stop by the side of the road to eat  like anyone ordinarily would .  if we   re lucky  we might even get close enough this evening to see them up ahead .  then we   ll see where they stop .         i guess we can hope .      steve looked behind them again .  marcia remained tense but said nothing .  he considered teasing her about her nervousness  but then decided that he preferred having her quiet .  the last thing he wanted was to start her talking again .   the road grew more rugged less than an hour out of khanbaliq .  tall trees shaded the road as it began to wind up the slope of the foothills .  two riders passed them on the way south  as did one large wagon full of firewood  but traffic was light .   on the road itself  the ground was dry and dusty .  many hooves  wheels  and feet had left their imprints  but to steve   s eye  a few fresh tracks of horses and wheels overlaid the older ones .  they had been left by the people who had most recently preceded them .  he assumed that some of the tracks had been made by the polos  he hoped that at least one set were mc     s .  if the team was on the track of mc   already  this mission could be really short .   at intervals  steve offered the buns and a quick drink of water to the others .  in order to close the gap between themselves and the people ahead of them  they stayed in the saddle and kept moving .   the air grew cooler as they rode higher into the mountains .  late in the afternoon  steve paused to put on the long coat he had bought  marcia and jane decided to wear theirs  too .  the shade of either the trees or the mountains covered them most of the time at this hour .   finally they rounded a bend and came to an inn .  steve dismounted and asked if any foreigners had stopped for the night  in exchange for a coin  the innkeeper told him that none had .  the team rode on .   a much larger inn lay a short distance up the road from the first one .  steve decided that the two inns had been been positioned about a day   s ride from both khanbaliq and the great wall .  night was falling quickly now  and the air at this altitude was chilly .  he reined in and turned to hunter .      see the stable here .  this inn has quite a few guests .  and it   s getting cold pretty fast .  i think we should spend the night here  whether the polos are inside or not .  if they found another inn up the road  we can start early tomorrow morning and try to catch them on the road .         i agree     said hunter .      i   ll be glad to quit riding for the day     said jane     marcia  how are you .      marcia started to dismount  then paused with a grimace .     i think i need help getting down .      hunter dismounted quickly and reached up to lift her off .  he gently set her on her feet .     are you injured .         no .  just sore .      a hostler came out of the stable and steve arranged for him to take care of the horses .  then they went inside the inn .  entering last  marcia walked stiffly but without help .   inside the door  steve found a large room with a fire roaring in a stone fireplace set into the opposite wall .  people were seated around several tables near the fire  eating and drinking .  to the left of the door  a slender man with gray hair looked up from the counter where he was carefully writing with a narrow brush .   steve identified himself again as a scholar seeking an appointment .  he requested two rooms for the team as two married couples .  the innkeeper took them up to the second floor and showed them the rooms  which were across the hall from each other .  they were small but clean and tidy .   each room had two beds  a large pitcher of water  wash basins  and a chamber pot .  steve glanced at each of his companions  they all nodded .  hunter paid for the rooms .   then hunter remembered the group of people sitting near the fire .     do you have any foreign guests tonight .         foreign guests .  no  sir .  not tonight .         are all your guests right here .         no .  a few have finished their dinners already and gone to their rooms .         i see .  are there other inns nearby .         one small inn lies south of here a short distance .  the lodgings there are not nearly as comfortable as ours  however  and           we saw it on the way .  are there others .         not within half a day   s ride .         all right .  we will be right down in a minute to have dinner for four .      the innkeeper bowed and went back downstairs .      i   ll just leave the bag of clothes up here     said steve .  he tossed it onto one of the beds .     let   s go get some hot food .  i   m starved .             as they descended the stairs  steve glanced over the other travelers seated at the tables .  he had no idea what their clothing signified  except that all of the other patrons appeared fairly well to do .  certainly none of them were peasants .   steve found an empty table in the comer .  the other patrons had taken tables closer to the fire .  in a moment  the innkeeper hurried out to bring them a pot of tea and teacups  pouring for all of them .      are all of these people chinese .     jane asked .     or are some of them mongols .         i don   t see any turks in this group     steve said with a grin .     at least i can tell that much .         i would say by their clothing that they are all chinese     marcia said quietly .     here along the border  a lot of genetic mixing has taken place over the years  so you can   t really tell by personal appearance .      steve inclined his head toward a couple of men who wore swords in scabbards at their belts .     soldiers .         yes     said marcia .     but they   re chinese soldiers in the army of the chinese empire  not mongols .         what about the others .     hunter asked .     how much can you tell from their appearance .         the three men in plain black silk robes are probably government scholars     said marcia .     or the youngest one might still be a student .  the men in the colorful silk robes with all the embroidery are most likely rich merchants .         i know we   ve talked about it before  but i feel so much safer in this society than i did on our other missions     said jane .     even in a place like this .  in port royal  an inn like this would have been full of buccaneers ready to fight at a moment   s notice .  here i feel that we can just eat dinner and go to sleep .         and those dinosaurs won   t show up to trample us  either .     steve laughed .      it fascinates me     said marcia .     after so many years studying this era           you just can   t believe you   re really here     steve finished for her .      well  yes     marcia said stiffly  glaring at him .     something wrong with that .         of course not     said jane .     it   s just that all the historians we   ve worked with said something like that at one time or another .  but i know you mean it .         take this inn for instance     said marcia  turning to jane .     many chinese folktales are set at roadside inns just like this one .         really .     jane asked  sipping her tea .      some were fairy tales about ghosts  spirits  and monsters  others told of mysterious disappearances .     marcia smiled .     i guess these inns weren   t completely safe .         the people in those stories didn   t have positronic robots guarding them under the first law     said steve .     stiff and uncomfortable  wayne sat in an old  worn saddle on a weary horse  with ishihara riding behind him on their mount   s bare rump .  their peasant friends had somehow bought the horse for them and the saddle and bridle  as well .  they were following hunter   s team on the road north out of khanbaliq .  when hunter   s team had first bought their horses  xiao li had hidden nearby and watched .   ishihara had suggested that they let hunter and his team leave khanbaliq while they stayed behind to look for mc   in the city .  however  wayne had insisted that this kind of logic had ruined his plans before .  as soon as hunter found out that the polos had not taken the road north  he would come right back .  this time  wayne wanted to sabotage hunter   s team more thoroughly  but he did not know how yet .   the peasants had volunteered to come with them  wanting to earn the goodwill of the spirits they had befriended .  ishihara would not allow it  feeling that a trip of that length would be too disruptive to the village .  wayne wanted their help  but he understood that arguing with ishihara over this particular interpretation of the first law was a waste of time .   in the end  wayne and ishihara had hidden with xiao li to watch hunter   s team ride out of the city .  after that  wayne and ishihara had waited for hunter   s team to get a head start before following them .  they did not want to risk being seen .  ishihara tracked them  instead .   all day on the road  wayne considered what to do once they caught up to hunter that night .  the best way to distract hunter had to be to separate him from his human companions up here  far from khanbaliq .  then both hunter and his human team would spend their time and energy trying to reunite .  that would leave wayne and ishihara a clear opportunity to hurry back to khanbaliq ahead of them and search for mc   without hunter   s interference .   the sunlight in the mountains was fading quickly when they passed a small inn .  ishihara observed that the tracks left by hunter   s team stopped outside but then continued .  he and wayne rode on and reached a much larger inn as night fell .  overhead  however  a high  bright moon offered light of its own .   wayne reined in .  in a small stable off to one side of the main building  he could see a man grooming a horse by lantern light .  flickering light leaked from cracks around shutters on the windows of the inn .      did they stop here .     wayne asked quietly .      yes .  with my vision altered to maximum light sensitivity  i can just recognize their horses    tracks .         all right .  now we have to come up with a plan .         i suggest we move back down the road a short distance to talk .  if hunter turns up his aural sensitivity  he could conceivably overhear us .      without another word  wayne turned their mount and slowly rode around a bend .      this is far enough     said ishihara .     the wind is slight  but rustles the trees sufficiently to cover our voices from here .         good .         our own horse has slowed considerably     ishihara added .     i believe he needs a good night   s rest after this trip carrying both of us .         all right .  that   s important .  it means we can   t just jump on and ride him back to the city tonight .         no .  i do not believe he can make it .         well .  .  . we still have to distract hunter somehow .         i must remind you that i cannot allow any plan that would harm or allow harm to the human members of hunter   s team .         i know  i know     wayne said with exaggerated resignation .     telling me that is hardly necessary .  besides  i don   t want to hurt anybody .         another rider is coming up behind us     ishihara whispered .     i hear light hoofbeats .  if we are planning a ruse of some kind  perhaps we do not want to be seen here .      wayne led their mount into the trees by the side of the road  ducking low under the branches .  in the darkness  they did not have to move far to hide themselves .  they waited silently .  their horse lowered his head to graze .   several minutes passed before wayne heard slow  plodding hoofbeats .  finally the combined silhouette of a small mount and a smaller rider came slowly up the road in the moonlight .  wayne tensed  waiting for the single rider to pass .      xiao li     ishihara said loudly .     it is the boy xiao li .      xiao li   s shadow jerked in surprise .  however  wayne understood that ishihara was now worried .  they had induced xiao li to take an unnecessary risk in following them .  wayne yanked on the reins to pull his horse away from what he was grazing on  and they returned to the road .  in the moonlight  wayne saw that xiao li was riding bareback on a donkey  using only a halter and reins .   ishihara spoke to xiao li in chinese .  the boy relaxed  recognizing them .  after a moment of conversation  ishihara switched back to english .      his relatives pooled their cash from the morning   s market sales     said ishihara .     they bought this donkey for him .  all the peasants want to help us .  they are absolutely trusting that we will take care of xiao li .         but you told them they couldn   t come with us     said wayne .     what happened .  are the others coming .         no .  apparently the villagers decided just to send xiao li .  they told him to help us out with little errands or anything else he can do for us .         well  we   ll have to take care of him  of course .  and maybe we can think of a way for him to help  too .         i am alarmed by this .  i am afraid that we have caused too much change regarding that village already .         i don   t see what we can do at the moment     said wayne .     we obviously can   t send the him away all alone .  and we can   t just turn around and ride all night back to khanbaliq tonight  either  on this poor horse of ours .  xiao li will be safest staying with us .         yes  that is true .         look  i may have an idea     said wayne .     but i want to ask you some questions to find out if your interpretation of the first law will make it objectionable .         proceed .         all right .  will separating hunter from his human team members harm them .         not necessarily .  of course  that depends on the circumstances .         not in and of itself .         no .         will sending hunter on a diversionary errand be objectionable  in and of itself .     wayne asked     again  not necessarily .         good .  i thought so .  then i instruct you to think up a diversion that will separate hunter from his team and still be acceptable to you .         i do not have a precise plan yet  but i can describe the condition our diversion must meet .         all right .  what is it .         after we distract hunter and send him away  i must be in a position to watch over his team  so that i can protect those humans  instead of hunter .         uh  what about me .  and xiao li .         ideally  you will not be in danger or very far away .  but i must know that you are safe  too .         okay .  let   s see what we can come up with .  suppose xiao li goes into the inn and tells another story to hunter .  it worked to get them all up here .  maybe we can split them up somehow that way .         hunter has the ability to radio his team for help     said ishihara .     we will have to take that into consideration also .  what should xiao li say .         as a roboticist  i think the best way to engage hunter in action will be to repeat what i attempted before   kidnap one of the members of his team .  as a robot  do you agree .         yes     said ishihara .     the first law requires him to take action  and if i am present to prevent harm to the victim  i can accept this .         all right .  then  to satisfy you under the first law  i suggest that you conduct the kidnapping .         i must agree to the overall circumstances  as well .  what will they be .         i   m not sure yet  but we   ll need xiao li to speak to hunter inside the inn .  .  .  . tell you what   ask the man in the stable to go inside and see if some other guests will come outside .  maybe we can enlist their help .        hunter ate lightly at dinner  just enough to maintain his appearance as a human .  since his energy came from the sun  he did not require food .  even after his team finished dinner  they remained at the table  drinking hot tea .   marcia had been lecturing them on areas of mongol and chinese history that were not immediately pertinent .  no one else had spoken for some time .  hunter noticed that the hostler came in and requested that the guests at the other tables go outside with him  hunter supposed that some minor problem with their horses had developed .  since the hostler had not addressed their table  hunter gave no importance to the matter .   steve sat with his arms folded  his cup of hot tea on the table in front of him .      most people think the mongols overwhelmed their enemies by sheer numbers     marcia was saying .     that   s not true at all .  in fact  they were often outnumbered in their military campaigns .  they won through speed and efficiency .         nobody cares     steve muttered .     and it doesn   t make any difference to our mission .         well  pardon me .     marcia straightened in her chair .     perhaps i was mistaken .  i thought you might want to learn something for a change .      steve rolled his eyes and started to get up .   hunter heard the front door open and saw steve suddenly freeze in place .  when hunter turned  he recognized the boy from the market coming inside .  the boy glanced around and then shyly walked toward them .      that   s the same kid  isn   t it .     steve asked quietly  sitting down again .     i mean  i   m not confusing him with someone else  am i .         that   s him     said marcia  folding her arms .      yes  it is     said hunter .   xiao li stopped in front of hunter and bowed politely .  he started to speak  but nervously fumbled for words .  his face was flushed and he glanced uncomfortably around the table .      may i help you .     hunter asked .     i am surprised to see you here  so far from khanbaliq .         my family followed you up here from the city     xiao li said carefully .     they captured the man you wanted .         really .  where are they now .     jane asked .     are they outside .         they are down the road     said xiao li  turning to address her .     at first we told the man to come with us and he did .  then someone must have said something he did not like  because he tried to run away .  my family has grabbed him  but he is much stronger than he looks .  i rode up here on my donkey to find you .      hunter noticed that the boy   s speech was slow and very mannered  as though he was repeating something he had memorized .  that would make sense if the villagers had sent him on ahead with this message .  further  his explanation fit the laws of robotics .  initially  if mc   had understood he was being ordered to cooperate and come with the villagers  he would have been required to obey .  later  he might have made an interpretation under the first law from something he saw or heard that gave him the freedom to flee .      let   s go     said steve  getting up from the table .     we   ll ride down there  grab him  and be done with it .      xiao li   s eyes widened .     i can   t wait for the hostler to prepare your horses .  your friend might escape .     he looked at hunter with large  hopeful eyes .     please come right away on my donkey with me .  your friends can ride down after their mounts are saddled .         good idea     said hunter  rising also .      you sure .     jane asked  as she and marcia left the table to join him .      yeah  what about not splitting up .     steve grinned as they walked out of the inn with xiao li .      the situation has changed .  we are no longer conducting a random search .  now the necessity of apprehending mc   while i can is critically important .         what about our horses .     jane asked  as they stepped outside into the chilly darkness .     are we just going to leave them up here .      hunter paused .     no .  we will give them as gifts to the villagers .  they will not return the horses to the city  i realize  but the horses will be back in the same vicinity .         you better go     said jane .     we   ll ride right down after you as soon as the horses are ready .         do not bother     said hunter .     you will be safer here than riding down this rough mountain road in the moonlight .  i will come back with mc   and the villagers .         whatever .     steve shrugged .      our mission appears to be nearly complete     said hunter .     i suggest that you move up to one of the rooms together and switch on your lapel pins .  that way i can communicate with you freely without our being overheard by anyone else .         that   s a good idea     said steve .     let   s get this finished and go home .     he turned and went back into the inn with marcia and jane .             you   re very big for my donkey     said xiao li shyly     but he can carry us both for a short distance .         we need not burden your donkey further     said hunter .     i can jog alongside him down the road .      xiao li faced his donkey   s flank with both hands on the animal   s back .  he jumped and vaulted forward  landing on the donkey   s back with his abdomen .  then he expertly swung one leg around the donkey   s rump and sat up  straddling his mount .  he kicked it a couple of times and rode off at a trot .   hunter fell into step alongside xiao li and his donkey  concerned that neither the boy nor his donkey could see the road well enough in the moonlight to ride safely at this pace .  since speed was a legitimate concern  hunter did not suggest slowing down .  instead  he magnified his vision to maximum light receptivity and watched the uneven ground for anything that could trip the donkey .   hunter and xiao li moved down a gently sloping section of road  around a bend  then down a steeper slope .  with hunter   s hearing set at a sensitivity in the range of sharp but normal human ability  the only sounds were the donkey   s hoofbeats  hunter   s own footsteps  and a light breeze rustling the leaves on the trees as the road took another bend and leveled off .      i like my donkey     said xiao li suddenly .     he   s nice .  i don   t think he   s too old .  sometimes i get to ride my uncle   s donkey in the village  but not very often .  he has to carry tools and crops all the time .      beneath the boy   s unexpected chatter  hunter heard a sudden crackling of twigs and snapping of branches near him from the side of the road .  he turned to look and saw the dark shapes of adult humans leaping out at him .  before he could judge how to avoid them without harming them  they tackled him .  rather than resist and risk hurting them under these unknown conditions  hunter allowed himself to be knocked to the ground with a thump .   hunter immediately understood that he had been trapped .  xiao li   s chatter had been intended to cover the sound of the ambushers .  even as the humans who had tackled him grabbed his arms and legs  now shouting among themselves  he surmised that xiao li had been given very specific instructions about what to do and say  and that the boy had followed them precisely .   hunter felt himself lifted off the ground .  he discerned seven different voices around him and recognized them all .  each of these humans had been sitting at the tables in the inn near the fire just a short time ago .  hunter did not know what this meant  but he called his team on his internal transmitter .      hunter here .  emergency .      steve said     what   s wrong .         i have been attacked by seven men who were in the inn near us during dinner .  they are carrying me into the trees near the road .  i do not know what they want  but xiao li drew me into a trap .  please be very careful .         can   t you get away     jane asked     just by wrestling free of them .         yes  but not without revealing my robotic strength     said hunter .     i prefer not to do that  since you three remain safe and i am unharmed .         what should we do .     jane asked .     or  rather  what are you going to do .         i am undecided     said hunter .     but i can hear xiao li riding away .  if you see him  do not trust anything he says .         got it     said steve .     look  shouldn   t we ride down after you .  you   d have to protect us and you   d have first law permission to break free .         do not come down here     said hunter .     i cannot estimate the level of danger to you yet .         we   ve survived worse     jane said .     remember the fights on the pirate ships .  or the battle between the ancient germans and the roman soldiers .         those were different circumstances     said hunter .     right now  i have no reason to believe that your endangering yourselves will help find mc   .         we still have to get you free     said steve .     that will definitely help the search  so it should satisfy your objection .         please remain where you are     said hunter .     entering danger will simply force me into greater first law dilemmas .  it will not help us .         all right     said jane .     steve  he knows more about this than we do .  but listen  hunter .  we   ll stay here where we can receive your messages freely .  keep us informed .         agreed .  for now  i must find out what my captors want with me .     he broke the connection .   in one of their rooms at the inn  steve leaned against the door and looked at marcia and jane .  no one spoke .  the only light flickered from a candle flame inside a glass cylinder .      i can   t believe this     marcia whispered .     what are we going to do now .      steve glanced at her  surprised by her anxious tone .  a light sheen of sweat covered her face  despite the cool mountain air .  she folded her arms across her middle as though her stomach hurt .      what is it .     steve asked .     is dinner bothering you .         no .         you okay .     jane asked her .      of course not .  none of us are     marcia snapped .     what   s wrong .     steve asked .      well   i just   can   t you see .     marcia wailed .      no     said steve .      i think i understand     said jane .     it   s hunter being out of range to help us .  isn   t it .      marcia nodded tightly .     of course it is .         but we   re fine     said steve .      we aren   t used to living without robots around like you are  steve     said jane .     remember .  you made a few comments on our first mission about that .  i   ve learned to improvise on these missions myself   and to get along without hunter right next to me .  that   s all it is .         yeah .     steve shook his head  looking at marcia .     she   s panicking because hunter is down the road and doesn   t want to reveal his strength .      marcia shrugged  glaring at him .      well  look     said steve     i think we should consider riding down there after hunter  no matter what he said .  we can help him get free .          i don   t think we should     said jane .     his reasons for waiting were clear .  at least  we should call and talk about it with him again .         we   ve taken more risk and initiative than that on our own before .         it   s not just us .  i   m arguing about this as a roboticist .  hunter doesn   t choose the first law  it governs his behavior whether he likes it or not  and he has given us his current concerns and interpretation already .         if we find him  the first law will make him free himself to protect us  won   t it .  like i said to him .         yes  probably .  but there   s more to consider .  during the last mission  hunter finally allowed himself to take trips back to our own time in the middle of a mission in order to escape trouble .  he   d never done that before .  that was a real change in judgment for him .         what about it .         i   m worried that pushing him into a severe first law dilemma might force him to take us back again .  every time we vanish and reappear  we increase our chances of being seen and we lose some continuity in our plans .  in the long run  we might be better off cooperating with hunter for now .         well .  .  . you   re the expert on this stuff     steve said reluctantly .  .      you mean we aren   t doing anything .     marcia looked back and forth between them in disbelief .     we   re just going to sit and wait .         for now     said jane .      let   s get some sleep     said steve  straightening from leaning against the door .     we   ll need it tomorrow .  you two stay here  i   ll go across the hall .  just make sure that your lapel pins are turned on .  we don   t want to miss hunter calling again .         you and marcia are supposed to be married     said jane .      nobody   s going to notice how we divide the rooms     marcia muttered irritably .     i   ll stay with you .      steve watched her for a moment  tempted to tease her about refusing to play act her role by sleeping in the other room with him .  then he decided she was already upset enough .  with a brief nod to jane  he left the room  closing the door behind him .   across the hall  he entered his own room and found enough moonlight shining around the shutter on the window for him to see .  ignoring the unlit candle  he closed the door and undressed .  the chilly mountain air also leaked into the room  but he could tolerate the temperature .   in the darkness  under the covers  he found himself tense and wide awake .  he could hardly stand marcia  but the uncertainty about hunter bothered him  too  in a different way .  marcia felt vulnerable without a robot to protect her .  steve simply felt that he was wasting time  lying here doing nothing while hunter remained a captive .     hunter had stopped struggling in order to conserve his energy .  he did not know how much strength he would need to free himself .  also  no matter what actions he took  he could not replenish his energy supply until the sun reappeared .   someone had thrown a cloth bag over his head .  it smelled strongly of hay  overwhelming his olfactory sense .  now only his hearing and sense of touch brought him information .   the same seven humans still stood around him  talking excitedly .  at this point  only two were actually holding him  one on each arm .  of course  if he pulled free  the others would immediately jump on him again .   the voices around him had been talking for some time  arguing about what to do with him .  most of their chatter had been indecisive and unimportant .  however  hunter noticed that all of them repeatedly referred to him as a    spirit .      hunter searched his knowledge for the significance of this .  at first he thought it might be a colloquial reference to him as a foreigner .  he knew that many years later  in the nineteenth century  a chinese nickname for europeans and white americans was    foreign devils .         we must decide what to do     one man said clearly .  he spoke with some authority .     otherwise  we may argue here in the woods all night .         our choices are three     said another man .     one  tie him up in the forest and leave him .  two  remain here and keep watch over him all night .  three  offer him sacrifices of food and wine and give him our respect .      no one laughed .  hunter realized that these were serious choices  not jokes .  they really believed he was a spirit of some kind .      we must chain him while we speak     said someone else .     away from the road .      the two men holding hunter   s arms pulled him forward .  he followed  stepping carefully on the uneven ground to find his footing .  his escorts were slower than he was  but they made some effort to guide him  he supposed to avoid tree branches and large rocks .   after a walk of no more than about ten meters  he was stopped and backed up against a tree trunk .  he heard the clink of metal and then felt chains pulling him fast against the tree .  while his captors muttered to themselves about the exact placement of the chains  he called his team again .   all three of them responded with drowsy voices  at first talking at the same time .  no matter which rooms they were in  they all had their lapel pins turned on .      i have a question for marcia specifically     said hunter .     my captors refer to me among themselves as a spirit .  however  i cannot reconcile some apparent contradictions .  they cannot decide whether to leave me chained to a tree or to make sacrifices to me .  the former seems hostile  the latter respectful .  is this choice normal .         i can   t tell yet     said marcia .  she cleared her throat  yawned  and then spoke with more certainty .     um  this is related to their local folk religion .  it evolves constantly and varies from one geographical location to another  sometimes even between neighboring provinces or villages .         oh  wonderful     muttered steve .     so it   s impossible to know what they   re thinking at all .         let her go on     said jane .      it   s not totally impossible     said marcia .     hunter  what robotic abilities did you exhibit to them .  they must have some reason to believe you   re not human .         none .     hunter quickly reviewed all his actions from the time he and the team had first arrived at the inn .     i am certain that i have revealed no abilities to this particular group that are not human .         well .  .  . that won   t help us  then .  maybe you resemble a spirit in some folk tale .         hold it     said steve .     you mean  like if someone fit the role of cinderella .         or king arthur or paul bunyan     said marcia .     hunter  from what you   ve said  they may consider you a good spirit who is misguided or out of control .         in what respect .         maybe they believe you have been sent here to do something specific that they don   t like .         yes .  what does this mean .         well  this would explain that they want to stop you from fulfilling your instructions from the spirit world   whatever they think those are   but they still want to remain on your good side .         i understand     said hunter .     this is consistent with their behavior .         i have to ask you something  hunter     said jane .     is the third law likely to become an imperative soon .  that is  are you in danger   or do you expect to be .         no     said hunter .     if the situation changes and the   third law forces me to escape  i must do it alone without endangering the team .         can you reach the belt unit .     jane asked .     if so  you could return to our time  then come back to this time in another location .      hunter shifted slightly  testing the chain that held him .     i cannot reach the belt unit without freeing myself .  the chain holding me has small links  but i do not know if i can break it or not .         your captors haven   t taken the belt unit .     jane asked .     didn   t they wonder what it was .         they did not search me     said hunter .      that   s further evidence that they hold you in some awe     said marcia .      what   s our current plan .     steve asked .     what do you want to do .         i repeat  do not come to rescue me .  i ask that you three get a good night   s sleep so that we can be ready to face any unexpected situations tomorrow .         all right     said steve .     i haven   t slept too well so far  but you   re right .         okay     said jane .      do you have a plan .     marcia asked anxiously .     do you know what we   ll do .      hunter surmised that she was scared because of his absence .     i am convinced that you are not in danger .  otherwise  i would have to make every effort to free myself .  please get a sound sleep .         all right     marcia said reluctantly .     it won   t be hard .  i   m exhausted after all that riding .        jane lay back down on her bed in the darkness .  she felt her advice in support of hunter had been justified  but she also worried about him more than she had let on to the others .  marcia was scared because hunter was not here to protect them  which jane understood .  steve just wanted to get on with the mission .  however  jane could not stop worrying that hunter would enter a contradiction between multiple first law imperatives and be unable to function .   within a few minutes  marcia   s nervous  uneven breathing became smooth and rhythmic with sleep .  apparently the day on horseback really had worn her out .  jane tried to relax  but she was simply too tense .  she lay on her bed  wondering if she had made a mistake in arguing that the team take hunter   s advice .   she had no way to measure the passing of time as she lay awake .  however  she remained fitfully awake when a sharp knocking on the main door downstairs startled her .  wondering if hunter had returned on his own  she listened as the knocking was repeated .  finally  she heard a single pair of footsteps walk across the floor to open the inn door .   more than a few people entered  judging by the number of footsteps .  she could not distinguish exactly how many  however .  as she heard some quiet voices  too muffled to understand  she realized that these were probably the people who had ambushed hunter .   all of them remained downstairs .  she could hear chairs scraping on the floor  probably as they sat down by the fire again .  they probably wanted to warm up after their hike outside .   since jane was wide awake anyway  she decided to take a look .  she rose and  as quietly as she could  dressed again .  if possible  she wanted to overhear anything they might have to say .           out in the hall  jane thought about waking up steve .  then she decided not to bother him .  she could wake him later if she learned something important .  otherwise  he might as well get some sleep .   jane took a deep breath and walked down the stairs .  she knew that women had a more restricted role in this society than in her own  but without marcia to advise her  she had no idea if she was doing something unusual now or not .   downstairs  she recognized the men sitting near the fire .  she counted seven  the same number of captors hunter had reported .  three wore plain  black robes  two others had embroidered robes  a couple of them wore brown tunics and sword belts .  as hunter had said  they had all eaten dinner there earlier .  when a young man in a plain black robe saw her  his eyes widened and he whispered anxiously to his companions .   all of them turned to look at jane .  she forced a slight smile  and nodded to them as she approached .  the men by the fire watched her in silence .   jane could not decide if they were staring because she was a foreign woman alone at this hour or if they simply had not wanted to be disturbed by a stranger .      now     said one of the men .   together  every one of them leaped up and sprang toward her .  before she could call out  one of the men in black robes had clamped a hand over her mouth .  others grabbed her arms and legs  lifting her bodily off the floor .      hey       the innkeeper started  but at the sound of a sword sliding out of its sheath  he fell silent .   jane twisted around to look at him .  one of the men held a sword against the innkeeper   s throat .  she flailed again  kicking  and realized that she could neither get free nor make enough noise to wake up steve .  with one hand  though  she managed to switch on her lapel pin .  hunter would hear whatever noises her communicator happened to transmit .   jane   s captors marched her out of the inn  into the cold night air .  they held her faceup  and over the silhouettes of their heads and shoulders she could see the moon and the tops of trees against the sky .  she could tell that she was being carried down the slope  in the same direction hunter had gone with xiao li .     steve dozed fitfully .  the long ride on horseback had tired him  but leaving hunter chained to a tree for the night bothered him .  he understood hunter   s desire to be left alone for now  but that didn   t help him sleep any better .  when footsteps pounded up the stairs  he woke quickly .   suddenly steve noticed static hissing from his lapel pin .  before he could listen more closely  whoever had just run up the stairs thumped on his door .  steve picked up his robes to hold in front of him and found his way to the door in the darkness .      who is it .         the innkeeper  sir .      steve opened the door a crack .     what   s wrong .         one of your companions  sir .  the foreign woman with the brown hair .     the man held a burning candle on a small tray .  the light of the flame flickered over his face  which was lined with fear .      jane .  what about her .     steve   s worry v vas followed by a surge of adrenaline .  something had really gone wrong .      the other guests carried her out of here   by force .  with a hand over her mouth and a sword at my throat  i could do nothing  i assure you           i believe you     said steve  fumbling his robes on as quickly as he could .  he stepped past the innkeeper to rap on marcia   s door .  then he remembered that they were supposed to be married  the innkeeper would expect to see marcia in his room .     excuse me  will you .     he found a coin in his robes and gave it to the man .      thank you .  i promise you  sir  i had no choice   this is a fine inn .  nothing like this usually           please excuse me  all right .     steve demanded  taking the candle from him .   the innkeeper bowed quickly and hurried away .      marcia .         hmm .     she sounded sleepy .      is jane in there .     he tried the door and found it unlocked .  slowly  he opened it only a little .     you decent .         come in .  i   m under the covers .  uh no  she isn   t here .      by the light of the small candle  steve saw marcia move up on one elbow and draw hair away from her face .  the room was essentially the same as his .  jane   s bed had been disturbed  but was empty .  he did not see her clothes anywhere .      what   s going on .         she   s been kidnapped  too .  get dressed and bring your coat .  i   ll wait out in the hall .         what .         hurry up .     steve backed into the hall again and closed the door .  he got his own coat out of his room and picked up the cloth bag  as well .  the need to improvise meant that they might not be coming back .  he would call hunter as soon as he had spoken to the innkeeper again .   marcia joined him  fully dressed but much more groggy than he was .  she had obviously been sleeping soundly .  he hoped this meant she wouldn   t lecture him all night .      did jane leave anything in the room .         no .         she must have gotten dressed for some reason .  come on .     steve led her downstairs  where the innkeeper was anxiously warming his hands by the fire .      where are we going .     marcia asked  her voice still rough with sleep .      i   ll tell you outside .     steve turned to the innkeeper .     can you tell me anything else about what happened .         not very much  sir .  the other guests came back in rather late and sat down by the fire to warm themselves .  then your friend came downstairs           on her own .         yes  sir .  she just walked down here  and they got all excited and grabbed her .  they ran outside with her .  as i was saying  i had a sword to my throat  or else           yes  i understand that .     steve thought for a moment .  freeing hunter was now a necessity .  if hunter couldn   t break the chain holding him with his own strength  then steve would have to help .  he pointed to the poker leaning against the side of the fireplace .     i want to borrow that .         eh .  what   s that  sir .      steve walked over and picked up the poker .     i   ll need this .  do you mind .         begging your pardon  sir  but of course i will be needing it  too .         yeah  all right .     steve pulled out a couple more coins and tossed them to the innkeeper .     i   ll bring it back when i   m finished with it .         thank you .     the innkeeper bowed again .      let   s go     steve said to marcia .  they hurried outside into the cold mountain air and walked a short distance from the front of the inn .      are we going to get the horses .     marcia asked .      uh  no .  too noisy .  i   m not sure exactly what happened to jane  but we have to stay out of everyone   s sight if we can  until we find out .  we   ll have to find hunter on foot .     steve turned on his lapel pin .     hunter  steve here .         yes  steve .         jane   s been kidnapped .  from what the innkeeper said  i guess it   s the same bunch of people who jumped you .         i suspected something of the sort had happened to one of you           what .  why didn   t you call and wake us up .     steve was startled .     you   ve just been sitting there  even under the first law .         i have been puzzling over how to respond .  for only the last few minutes  i have been receiving static and the sounds of footsteps and breathing from someone   s lapel pin  but nothing more clear than that .  i did not call because i fear  even now  that her captors are listening to our voices coming out of the air and will be even more fearful than before .  once you called me  however  the damage was done .  i must have your help to free myself .         where are you .     steve asked .     are you alone  for that matter .         i have been left alone  chained to a tree     said hunter .     i have no way to convey my exact location .         you can   t free yourself .         no .  i have ascertained that i cannot break the chain on my own .  until i heard the unexplained static  i had intended to wait until after dawn to try again .  at that time  my energy would be replenished  and i could awaken you three without disturbing your rest .         we   ll come get you     said steve .     i have a fireplace poker  maybe we can use it to pry open a link of your chain .  how can i find you .         follow the road back down the slope .  when i hear you nearby  i will call to you .         okay .  but i   ll leave my lapel pin on .     he turned to marcia .     come on .         it   s freezing out here     marcia muttered .      well  it   ll help keep us both wide awake .        ishihara and wayne had hidden themselves near the road about halfway between the place where hunter was chained and the inn .  xiao li stood with them  holding the reins of his donkey and also the horse wayne and ishihara had ridden from khanbaliq .  they had to stay far enough from hunter so that he could not hear their voices .   earlier  after xiao li had asked the other guests in the inn to come out and speak to them  wayne and ishihara had given them the same story that xiao li and his fellow villagers had accepted  that hunter was a misguided spirit .  some of the guests had been skeptical about this  but the more superstitious men among them had convinced the others to consider it .  finally  wayne had assured them all that hunter was absolutely prevented by supernatural law from harming humans  but that he had to be restrained .      we have to figure out what to do next     said wayne .     we have hunter .  he   ll probably radio his team to come get him  but maybe we can interfere with that  too           i have an emergency     ishihara said abruptly .     i have been monitoring hunter   s radio band to intercept his communication with his team members .         yeah .  what of it .         steve has just reported to hunter that jane has been kidnapped from the inn by the same guests we convinced to take hunter .  they obviously saw them together and acted on their own .         but that   s good     said wayne enthusiastically .     it   ll keep the whole team busy .  why didn   t they grab the other two  while they were at it .         it was apparently a spontaneous move .  however  i now feel that i am responsible for potential harm to jane .  under the first law  i must rescue her .         well .  .  . wait a minute     said wayne .     let   s think this through .         i cannot wait .     ishihara turned and began working his way out of the trees to the road .      a further consideration is that her captors will have overheard the voices of steve and hunter through her lapel pin  which seems to have remained turned on .  this could endanger her even more .         we can still talk about it     said wayne .     this isn   t necessarily bad .  at least  let   s consider the whole situation before we act .         the first law will not allow me to wait     said ishihara  over his shoulder .      well .  .  .     wayne plunged after him  crashing through the underbrush .     then wait for me .         please hurry     said ishihara .     the only transmission now is background static and the sound of humans breathing and walking .  however  this tells me that they are coming down the road toward us from the inn .      wayne pushed his way through tree branches after ishihara  panicked by the danger of losing his only ally .  certainly  ishihara could rescue jane  and wayne did not object to that .  however  as a roboticist  she might very well argue first law interpretations with ishihara that would convince him to stop cooperating with wayne .  .   behind him  he could hear the sound of xiao li following  bringing the horse and the donkey .      shut off your hearing     said wayne urgently to ishihara  as he finally managed to come up next to him on the road .      i dare not .  my first law imperative to rescue jane requires all my efforts .     ishihara strode quickly up the road in the moonlight .      i don   t want jane to trick you .  she may argue that you should help hunter instead of me .         if her arguments are valid  i will respond .  if they are not  of course i will not be influenced .         well .  .  . all right .  but remember  jane   s arguments about cooperating with me do not involve jane   s personal welfare in this particular situation .         i accept your instruction .      wayne said nothing else as he hurried up the slope .  he knew that while every robot had to obey the first law  each one had some leeway to make independent interpretations .  all wayne could do now was try to influence him .     since jane   s captors did not speak as they carried her through the cold night air  she did not learn anything about what they had in mind .  they were still taking her in the same direction hunter had gone  so she was not really too scared .  before they had gone very far  however  the men carrying her suddenly stopped .  jane heard the voices of hunter and steve coming over her lapel pin  muffled slightly under a fold in her rumpled robe .  suddenly very frightened  she forced herself to cough and clear her throat  in the hope of covering the sound .      what   s that .     one of the men asked fearfully .      what   s what .     another asked .      voices .         i hear them  too     said a man near jane   s left shoulder .     voices from the air .  no   from her .     he released his grip suddenly and she began to fall .      let her down .  let her down .      jane felt herself lowered  at least they had the decency to set her on her feet .  when she found her footing  she looked up and saw all the men slowly backing away from her in the moonlight .  then another pointed past her  down the road .      look .  someone   s coming .  who are they .     he spoke in a hushed  worried voice .      maybe it   s the big spirit     yelled a third     coming back for her .      with a roar of frightened shouts  every man who had carried jane to this spot suddenly turned and ran back up the road .  puzzled  she glanced down the road to see if hunter had somehow gotten free .  instead  two other figures were running up the slope toward her .   at first she had no idea who they were .  then  even in the moonlight and shadows  she recognized wayne and ishihara .  xiao li  mounted on his donkey and holding the reins of a horse  waited without moving behind them .   she had to choose between dealing with them  following the others back up the slope  or running into the forest .  she did not really want to face wayne and ishihara without hunter .  however  she knew that their company would certainly be safer than that of her recent captors .   after all  no matter what argument wayne had used to bring ishihara under his control  the first law would still require the robot to protect her from actual harm .  if she could convince ishihara to drop wayne  then she would have accomplished something important  too .  so she waited for them to come running up to her  checking to make sure that her lapel pin was still on .   she did not want to speak directly to hunter now  while ishihara could hear her .  if hunter could hear them through the lapel pin  he might find a way to help .  in that case  he would want the element of surprise .      now shut off your hearing     wayne ordered ishihara  as they drew near .     and don   t read her lips  either .         i already told you i cannot do that     said ishihara .  he stopped in front of jane .      that was when she was a captive     said wayne .     now she   s okay .         jane  are you harmed .     ishihara asked .      no     jane said sternly .     i   m not .  but i don   t owe any thanks to you for that .         i had nothing to do with your being kidnapped     said ishihara  his voice conveying just a hint of urgency .     neither did dr .  nystrom .  i have not violated the first law .         no .     jane put her hands on her hips  assuming the tone of schoolteacher challenging a naughty child .     what are you doing cooperating with him at all .  hunter told you that his missions are driven by a first law imperative .         don   t listen to her     wayne insisted .     i told you that hunter   s argument is full of holes .         ishihara  take custody of wayne on behalf of hunter   s first law duties     said jane .      then  still hoping that hunter was listening  she tried to help give their location .     since we   re only a short distance down the slope from the inn  the rest of my team is not far .         i cannot .  the imperatives under the first law are not clear to me on either side .  i wish to convince you  however  that your kidnapping was never part of our plan .  the guests at the inn acted on their own .         well  i sort of guessed that     said jane .     but you must have told them something that set it up .         that is true     said ishihara .     i am relieved that you are well .      xiao li  who was still leading a horse  joined them on his donkey  but did not speak .  .      look     said wayne .     we have to talk  but not here .  ishihara  take her lapel pin and shut it off .         no .     jane ordered  stepping back .     stop .  this will harm me .         i will not allow harm to come to you     said ishihara .  he reached out and took her lapel pin .   jane did not bother trying to wrestle with the robot .     what do you want with me  wayne .         ishihara  we have to get away from here before her team comes after her .  bring her .         hey .  you can   t do that .     jane backpedaled again  but she knew she could not outrun ishihara any more than she could wrestle with him .  her only chance was to argue .     ishihara  this constitutes harm .  i need sleep and i need to rejoin my team .  you must see that .         i cannot harm you .     ishihara gently took hold of her arm .     further talk in private will not harm you .         say     said wayne suddenly     steve is marching around here somewhere looking for hunter .  he probably has their historian with him .  can you grab them  too .         no     said ishihara .     i could not keep control of three humans without risking harm to them .         well  all right  then     said wayne  glancing up and down the road anxiously .     let   s get off the road and into the brush .  fast .              steve led marcia down the side of the road  keeping to the shadows as much as possible .  since they had kept their lapel pins on  he and marcia had overheard the reaction of jane   s captors to his last conversation with hunter .  a moment later  they   d also listened to jane   s exchange with wayne and ishihara  up to the moment her lapel pin had been suddenly switched off .      jane   s in serious trouble now  isn   t she .     marcia asked quietly .      well  at least she   s safe with a robot     said steve .     hey  look up ahead .      steve saw the growing shadow of a large group of people down the road .  they were running up the slope toward steve and marcia .  quickly  he grabbed marcia   s arm and pulled her into the trees  then crouched with her in the underbrush .      quiet     he whispered .   she nodded .   the group of frightened men  breathing hard from the exertion of running up the mountain road  pounded past without seeing them .  in another moment  they had rounded the next bend back toward the inn .  steve stood up  pulling marcia with him  and returned to the road .      well  i think jane   s in trouble     marcia whispered .     we have to rescue her  don   t we .         we have to get hunter first .         do we have time .  what are these other two going to do with her .         ishihara can   t violate the first law any more than hunter can  so jane won   t be harmed .  but he must be following wayne   s instructions  which means that he won   t let us just take her away  either .         how can you be surer        because jane wants me to get hunter  too .         oh  come on .  she didn   t say that .         she couldn   t say it plainly without giving away the message to wayne and ishihara .         so what makes you think you heard it .         she knew her lapel pin was on  until one of them took it .  if she had wanted us to come running  she could have yelled for us .  since she didn   t  she was telling me she was okay for now .         but how do you know that .      steve sighed .     because i   ve worked with her long enough now to know how she thinks .      marcia finally fell silent again .   as they walked  steve tried to figure out what wayne would want to do now .  he had no way of knowing exactly where steve and marcia were  though of course ishihara would have picked up his recent conversation with hunter .  so they knew steve and marcia were out here looking around .   wayne might be hustling jane farther down the mountain road  going south  or taking her out into the forest itself .  then again  he could have ordered ishihara to grab steve and marcia  too  though steve doubted that a single robot could hold all three humans captive at once .  most likely  wayne and ishihara were running away with jane while they had the chance .   in any case  as steve and marcia hiked down the road  they saw no sign of them .      steve     hunter called from the trees .     this way .  follow my voice .      steve turned carefully toward the sound  picking out the direction .  hunter called out repeatedly so that they could find him .  steve glanced back to see that marcia followed him through the branches and underbrush  then pushed forward .   after a few minutes of hiking on rough  uneven ground  they reached hunter .  hardly enough moonlight to see anything reached them here .  steve looked up high at the silhouette of hunter   s head .      aren   t you even taller than usual .         yes .  i made myself as tall and thin as i can  to loosen the chains .  however  i was still not able to get free .  i can move my arms somewhat  though .  do you have any more information now about jane .         not really     said steve .     except that she didn   t scream for immediate help .         ishihara will protect her  of course .  you have the poker you told me about .         yeah .  but i don   t suppose i   m strong enough to do much with it .         give it to me .  i have enough freedom of my arms now to use it .      steve felt for hunter   s hand and placed the poker in it .     you want me to do anything .         yes .  i have felt the individual links of the chain i can reach already .  in my other hand  i am holding the weakest one .  these are not  after all  mass produced .  as i hold the handle of the poker  please fit the point of it into the middle of this other link .         okay .  let   s see .  .  .  . got it .         please stand back .  i will use the curve of the tree trunk as a fulcrum and attempt to pry the link open .      steve backed away  moving marcia with him .  if the end of the poker slipped out of the link by accident  the point could swing around and club them both .  steve could barely see hunter   s movements  but after a long moment  he heard the chain fall  clinking  to the ground .      finished     said hunter .     i will return to my previous appearance .         now what are we going to do .     marcia asked .      i shall attempt to locate jane     said hunter .     i believe that wayne and ishihara arranged to have me trapped in order to break up our team and waste our time and energy .  however  i am certain that they expected me to remain isolated much longer .  they will not expect you to have released me so soon .         the trouble is  now that they have jane  we   re still split up     said steve .      how are you going to find her .     marcia asked .     her lapel pin is turned off .         i am turning up my hearing to maximum     said hunter .     as we walk on the road  i believe i should be able to hear xiao li   s donkey .  if they are moving through the underbrush  the donkey will make more noise than the humans .  if the boy rides him on the road  i may hear his hoofbeats .         let   s get back out on the road     said steve .       from the r .  hunter files    the now famous prototype of the highly successful    hunter    class robot first demonstrated his remarkable abilities in the mojave

held weapon or ground assault vehicle .     jane said nothing as ishihara led her slowly through the dark forest by a gentle but firm grip on her arm while wayne walked beside them .  she heard xiao li following them  walking the horse and donkey now that they were moving among the trees once more .  ishihara walked slowly  changing direction to avoid trees  boulders  and dense clumps of underbrush .  when they finally stopped  she had no way of judging how far from the road they had gone  but she doubted it was very far .  she waited to see what wayne and ishihara would do next .      have you heard any communication between hunter and steve .     wayne asked ishihara .      no .  i am surprised .  i would expect hunter to send a constant signal  so that he could be found .  or else i would expect ongoing conversation between them .  i do not understand what they are doing .      jane saw wayne turn to her in the faint moonlight .      we haven   t really had a chance to talk  have we .     wayne asked  in a casual tone .      no .  that   s true .     she could barely see his silhouette in the moonlight that filtered through the leaves overhead .     what do we have to say to each other .  anything .         may i speak to you as one roboticist to another .         what choice do i have .     jane demanded .  she could afford to take a hostile tone with ishihara here to protect her .      i just want to explain something to you .         well  i   m waiting .         i only want to participate in the review and investigation of the governor robots .     he waited for her response .      go on .     she tried not to react outwardly .      i can   t allow total strangers to take over my work and pass judgment on it without me .  these robots are my creation .  you understand that .         yes     she said stiffly .      the problem is not science and engineering  but politics .  i have no bargaining power unless i hold at least one of the component robots in my possession .      jane said nothing .      what   s objectionable about this .     wayne demanded .     don   t you think i have a point .         it sounds reasonable enough on the surface .  how do i know that   s the whole story .         you don   t trust me .     he sounded genuinely hurt .      you   ve kidnapped me .  what do you expect .         wait a minute .  have you forgotten that trip we all made to russia in      .         of course not .         i saved both that other woman on your team and steve from being shot by a nazi guard   when i had a clear chance to get mc   instead .     his tone turned bitter .     or didn   t any of you notice .         of course we did .     jane felt a little embarrassed .     everyone noticed   and i thank you for all of us .  and i know i won   t be harmed with ishihara here .  but why don   t you consider just coming back and discussing the situation professionally .         no .         i think the oversight committee will be responsible .  they should be allowed to do their job .         this is logical     said ishihara .      hold it right there     wayne said angrily .     i can   t afford to gamble my entire career on the committee   s integrity .  i told you  i need independent bargaining power .  and a chance to examine mc   myself  without interference .         listen to him  ishihara     said jane .     you can see he isn   t being reasonable .  you can   t possibly have a valid first law reason to keep me here .         remember what i told you     wayne ordered sternly .     my first law argument to you concerns the unnecessary harm hunter   s team is doing to me .  that   s the argument you accepted when you first agreed to help me on these missions .         that is true     said ishihara .      what   s true .     jane demanded .      i cannot shift my second law loyalty to you     said ishihara .     i have accepted the possibility that wayne is being harmed by the actions of hunter and his team .  he requires my aid as a result of this .         all right  look     said wayne .     since i can   t convince her i   m right  she   ll have to come with us for a while .  we have to get away from here  so hunter won   t be right behind us every minute .  let   s go find mc   .         you mean return to khanbaliq .     ishihara asked .     our horse is exhausted .  the animal cannot make the return trip tonight  nor can the donkey .  you and xiao li and jane will need rest as well .         we don   t have to go all the way back tonight     said wayne .     but i want to get started .  then we   ll find a place to sleep for the night .         it   s too cold out here to get much sleep     jane said sourly .     we don   t have any protection from the elements .  that   s not very good protection from harm  ishihara .         we   ll manage     wayne said quickly .     ishihara  you take charge of our route .  include evasive action to avoid hunter .  jane and i will not be harmed by a night in this weather .         my options are limited     said ishihara .     fleeing through the forested mountains in the dark is highly dangerous to you and jane .         do what you can     wayne said sternly .       steve brought up the rear as hunter led the way through the trees back to the road .  marcia walked with her arms wrapped around herself  shivering from the cold .  out on the road  hunter waited for them .      i want to change frequencies now that we know ishihara is listening     said hunter .     he has always listened in when we   re in the same time period together .     he altered the settings on their lapel pins .     i hope we will not separate again  but we must be prepared .         he   ll just scan the frequencies again  won   t he .     steve asked .      i assume so .  however  we will not use the lapel pins often  so he may simply stop scanning because it wastes his energy .  if he happens to scan the radio band when we are communicating through these  he   ll locate the new frequency  but perhaps not immediately .  any delay we can create in being overheard will help us .         okay .     steve shrugged .     you know more about what a robot does than i do .      suddenly hunter straightened  turning to look down the road  to the south .      what       marcia started .   steve put a hand on her shoulder to quiet her .  he heard nothing and could not tell if hunter heard something or was receiving a radio transmission .  either way  hunter certainly did not need any distractions .  marcia shoved his hand away but said nothing else .     i hear two sets of hoofbeats cantering down the road  back toward khanbaliq     said hunter .      two sets     steve repeated .     shouldn   t there be at least three .  wayne and ishihara must have ridden up here on horseback  plus xiao li   s donkey .         and jane is riding double with someone     marcia added .     i see .         i hear two animals     said hunter .     one much smaller than the other  matching the gait of xiao li   s donkey  but the hoofbeats are heavier than before .  that one is certain  two people are riding the donkey .         what about the other one .     steve asked .      by the gait and the weight  it is a horse     said hunter .     i cannot be sure if it is carrying two riders without having heard its hoofbeats earlier .  it could simply be an usually large  heavy horse .         you think two people are riding the horse  too .     steve shrugged .     i guess it   s possible .         wayne and ishihara could have found a mount as easily as we did     said hunter .     perhaps financial limitations confined them to one horse .         those mounts are worn out from a long day   s ride already     said steve .     if they   re both carrying two riders  they won   t go far tonight  especially at a canter .  they may not go far at all .         i have considered that     said hunter .     i suggest that i begin jogging after them from here to maintain aural contact .  you two can return to the inn for our horses and bring them .  i know they are tired  too  but they will be able to carry us at least as far as the two mounts we are pursuing .         that makes sense to me     said marcia .      i have a counterproposal     said steve .     suppose we all return to the inn for a good night   s sleep .  we know ishihara can   t allow any harm to come to jane .  then tomorrow we can go on to the great wall to find the polo family .         i can   t believe this     marcia wailed .     you   re just going to forget about her .         of course not .     steve snapped .     but jane is just as safe with ishihara as she would be with hunter .         that may not be precisely true     said hunter .     ishihara   s judgment is in some doubt  since he is obviously following wayne   s instructions .         you sure .     steve asked .     as far as immediate harm to jane goes  he can   t let her get hurt .  just how much leeway do you robots have in your interpretations .              steve doubted he could change hunter   s mind about a first law interpretation  but he wanted to try .  he trusted ishihara to keep jane safe .  the team could save a lot of time .      well  hunter .         i cannot go on without jane     said hunter .     i agree that ishihara would protect her from clear and immediate harm  but his judgment is in doubt regarding more complex situations .  further  i still remain responsible for jane as part of my team .  also  if we can apprehend wayne or even just ishihara  we can eliminate further interference from them .  that will make the rest of this mission and all of the next one much easier for us .  i must pursue them and free jane .         then we should split up     said steve .     i don   t know how many times i   ve suggested it already  but this time i   m really serious .  you go after jane  and marcia and i can return to the inn for some sleep .  tomorrow we   ll go north for the polos .  when you have jane  come after us .         as you know  i consider dividing the team to be a mistake .         you let jane and me sail back to jamaica on a pirate ship without you .  this is a much safer environment .  our real trouble seems to have been instigated by wayne  not the local situation .  even the people who grabbed you and jane would never have acted without wayne .      hunter turned to observe marcia .     you are very cold and tired  are you not .         i   m afraid so     said marcia .     and what he says makes some sense .  besides  you could probably help jane a lot faster alone than you could with me along .         and we   ll blend into the crowd     steve added .     without you and jane  we look like locals .         the same people who kidnapped jane and me have almost certainly returned to the inn .  i cannot have them carry you two away .  i suggest you take rooms at the other inn we saw .         no need .     steve grinned .     now that we know they think you   re a spirit  we can manage them  i think .  anyhow  they   ve probably gone to bed .  we   ll be careful about going back inside .  if we don   t see them  we   ll go upstairs .         this is also a great danger     said hunter .     at the very least  you should take a room at the other inn .         maybe not     said marcia .     i think they focused on you and jane in part because of your european appearance .  and they were running pretty fast when they passed us on the road a while ago .  maybe they   ve had enough .         we   re wasting time     said steve .     every minute we debate  jane is being taken farther south .  but i also want to return to the same inn because of the innkeeper .  he made a point to come and tell me that jane had been taken .         you feel safer with him .     hunter asked .      yeah  you could put it that way     said steve .      i will return to the inn with you     said hunter .     if it is quiet  and you can return to your rooms unseen  then i will allow us to separate .  clearly  you both need to stay warm and get some sleep .      steve hiked back up the road with hunter and marcia  relieved that hunter had given in .  the mountain air had grown very sharp  and by the time they returned to the inn  he was even more ready than before for a warm bed .  hunter stepped up to the front door  preparing to open it .      i should do it     steve said quietly .     if those guests are awake  they may react to seeing you .      hunter moved back to make room for steve .   steve found the front door of the inn barred .  that was certainly normal for this hour .  he rapped on it sharply .      who   s there .     the innkeeper   s voice was cautious and fearful  but clearly wide awake .      three of your guests     steve called .     we are well .  please open .      he heard the bar slide to one side .  the innkeeper opened the door a crack and glanced at them all before opening it wide and stepping back .  he bowed to them repeatedly  expecting them to come right inside .      are your other guests awake .     steve stayed where he was  with hunter and marcia behind him .      eh .     he gestured for them to enter .      your other guests  who took our woman friend .  they came running back here  didn   t they .         oh  yes .  they were all very excited about something when they first came back .  now they have all gone to sleep up in their rooms .         we would prefer not to be seen by them .         of course .  please come in .  your friend is not with you .     he glanced past steve .      no .  but we are not blaming you .  in the morning  we will remain in our rooms until you tell us they have left .  is this agreeable .         of course .      steve turned to hunter .     i really think we   ll be okay .  in the morning  we   ll stay in our rooms until he tells us the others have hit the road .  they won   t bother us .         all right .  but i am concerned that you will take unnecessary risks .         there shouldn   t be any risks     said steve .     we   ll just let the others get a head start on us in the morning .  then during the day we   ll make sure we don   t catch up .         is it okay .     marcia asked .     i   d like to do this .  i   m really cold .         it is fine     said hunter .     i will go prepare my horse .  i will take jane   s  too .         good night     said steve .  he stepped aside for marcia to enter first  as hunter left for the stable .      night     marcia muttered  yawning as she turned and went inside .   steve followed her .  behind them  the innkeeper barred the door again .     several minutes later  hunter forced his weary horse into a canter  the reins of jane   s mount were tied to his saddle .  he was not comfortable with the further splitting of his team  but he could also see that marcia badly needed rest .  even steve  though he was more accustomed to physical activity than marcia  would quickly become too tired to act efficiently unless he slept for the remainder of the night .   in the absence of a more pressing emergency  hunter had to let them sleep in the relative comfort and safety of the inn .  he accepted that steve and marcia would be reasonably secure at the inn as long as the other guests did not see them .  he also trusted steve to act wisely .   at the same time  he felt he he   d failed to take proper care of his team .  wayne had already succeeded in interrupting their search for mc   .  now hunter had to prevent him from taking full advantage of the situation .   as hunter rode down the moonlit mountain road  he slowed the horses to a walk to preserve their energy .  with his vision on maximum light receptivity  he identified the fresh tracks that matched the sounds he had heard earlier .  the most recent donkey tracks leading south were much deeper than the same ones xiao li   s animal had made riding north  the horse tracks with them were deep enough to have been made by the horse whose heavy hoofbeats he had heard .   hunter had to plan his approach to his quarry .  he chose not to radio ishihara with any sort of threat or argument  since wayne clearly had become more persuasive in making his case to ishihara .  any such transmission would merely reveal to ishihara that he was chasing them and give ishihara some fix on the .  distance between them .  hunter   s best chance to rescue jane and apprehend wayne would be to sneak up on them .   hunter did not know if ishihara   s hearing ability was fully equal to his own .  since hunter had been designed specifically to search for mc governor  he had been given some abilities greater than most robots  but he had never specifically compared his hearing to ishihara   s .  however  he was certain that ishihara   s aural sense was greater than any human   s .  that lessened his chance of making an unheard approach .   obviously  hunter   s pursuit would become obvious if he simply cantered up behind them  since even wayne would hear that .  hunter could  however  draw closer slowly .  when he heard the first faint sounds of hoofbeats up ahead  he could pace them at a distance until he formed a specific plan .   if ishihara   s hearing equaled his own  however  then ishihara might hear hunter   s horses at the same time .  the question of stealth might in fact turn on uncontrollable variables  such as the direction of the wind or the echo pattern off the surrounding slopes .  he would have to remain aware of those as he continued on his way .   now that he had identified the tracks  however  he did not have to study each hoofprint carefully .  he could see the trail plainly enough .  instead  he turned his attention to the condition of his mount .  the tired animal kept slowing down  and had to be prodded forward .   after more than a mile  the tracks of his quarry still followed the road .  hunter had expected more effort at evasion  but postulated that ishihara  under the first law  could not take the risk of allowing the humans to flee through the mountains in the darkness .  another possibility was that wayne had simply decided to forget about evasion .  he might be taking his companions as far as they could go straight down the road before their mounts wore out .   hunter still expected that the two mounts ahead of him would tire more quickly than his own .  all of them had traveled a long way earlier in the day  but the mounts ahead of him were  by his calculation  carrying two riders each  one was merely a donkey  whose short legs had to take many more strides to keep up with the horse .  maybe they were gambling that hunter   s substantial weight would tire his horse first  instead .   he considered that possibility unlikely  but the burden on his horse was real .  to minimize it  he moved to jane   s mount in order to rest his own .  wayne did not have that option .     in the lobby the innkeeper gave steve a small brass oil lamp before sleepily returning to bed .  leading marcia upstairs  steve was relieved to find the corridor quiet .  he turned to marcia to say good night .  she stopped at the door to her room  looking at him uncertainly in the shifting light .      what   s wrong .     steve asked quietly .     everybody else here is asleep .  we   ll be okay .         i know     she said softly .     but .  .  .         what .     he could see that her arrogance had vanished .     what is it .         i was thinking about your other missions .  were they like this .         like this .  what do you mean .         well  how dangerous were they .  when you talk about buccaneers and dinosaurs and everything else  were you really in serious danger .         yes .  we were .         i don   t think the risk became real to me until hunter was kidnapped .      steve nodded .     i know .  all of you who live in cities in our own time have robots around you constantly .         yes .  i never even thought about it before because i was so used to it .         i think we   re in less danger now than usual .  hunter is between us and wayne and ishihara .     he gestured toward the rooms around them     we should keep quiet and just go to sleep  so we don   t wake up the kidnappers .      marcia nodded and opened the door to her room .     of course .  sorry .         make sure you bar the door behind you     he added .     light your candle with this .     he carefully handed her the brass lamp and waited while she took it into her room .  a moment later  she brought it back out  silhouetted by the candle flame flickering behind her on a small table .      good night .     she yawned again and went into her room  closing the door behind her .   steve waited in the hall until he heard her slide the bar into place .  then he went into his own room and did the same .  in a few minutes  he was sound asleep .     as the hours passed  hunter could feel jane   s mount tiring .  both horses walked more slowly .  he changed mounts again  but his horse now had to be kicked more often to keep up the pace .  the moon was about to set .  his magnified vision revealed that the tracks ahead of him remained on the road .  however  his hearing no longer detected the sound of hoofbeats ahead .   this puzzled him .  considering the amount of weight the mounts ahead of him had to carry  he had expected that he would either have drawn close enough to hear them by now  or else he would have seen the tracks leave the road for the forested hills .  since hunter had already concluded that ishihara would not take that risk at night  he was not surprised to see the tracks continue on the road  but he had apparently missed something .   hunter reined in and dismounted .  he kneeled to examine the tracks .  even his magnified vision needed help now that the moonlight had faded .   carefully  he studied the depth of the tracks and then compared them to those of his own horses .  he also saw that the hoofprints his own mount made now  shuffling wearily on the road  were much shallower than the ones just a few feet back  when hunter had still been in the saddle .  suddenly he realized that the horse and donkey in front of him were no longer carrying the amount of weight they had been when he had begun tracking them .  from the saddle  in the waning light  the difference in the appearance of the hoofprints had been too slight for him to see  but it was clear now .   somehow  those he was following had dismounted and left the road without leaving footprints .  hunter had been fooled  most likely by ishihara lifting wayne and jane directly from their mounts into the trees .  he had also miscalculated ishihara   s interpretation of the danger that the forested hills would offer to his human companions at night .   that triggered his own first law concern .  if ishihara   s judgment was questionable  then hunter could not conclude that the humans with him were safe  as he had believed to this point .  he hoped they were hiding in one spot  maybe for the humans to rest .  that would be less dangerous than hiking through the mountains .   hunter concluded that xiao li was probably riding the horse now and leading the donkey .  his weight was slight enough not to alter these hoofprints significantly .  certainly the tired animals would not have continued down the road all night on their own .  at least one rider had to be urging them forward .   now hunter had to decide how to investigate all these surmises .  he had two essential problems  the near exhaustion of both his horses and the deepening darkness .  both problems could be improved by waiting several hours .   once his horses had rested  even for a short time  they would move a little faster .  daylight would allow him to follow tracks even in the forest .  now that wayne  ishihara  and jane were on foot  he would have the advantage .   hunter hobbled his horses and sat down by the side of the road to conserve his energy and wait for dawn .           jane waited in the forest with wayne and ishihara .  neither of them insisted on holding her every moment .  all three of them knew that she could not outrun ishihara  so she did not bother trying .   a short time earlier  at wayne   s suggestion  ishihara had lifted wayne and jane from their mounts to sturdy branches of trees near the road .  then he had followed them .  once they had all jumped to the ground on the far side of the trees  in the darkness away from the road  they waited for wayne to decide what to do next .   meanwhile  xiao li had ridden on down the road with their mounts .  ishihara had allowed this because he knew that hunter would not harm the boy .  since xiao li had followed them up here on his own  ishihara felt he would be safe on this road a little longer .      we can   t fool hunter for long     wayne said .  his voice was strained and anxious .      what do you suggest .     ishihara asked .      well .  .  . i don   t know .  but our mounts were about to fall over from fatigue .  we had to do something .  and if hunter grabs me  my hopes are finished .         you really don   t have that much to worry about     said jane .     i still think the oversight committee will handle their review of your robots responsibly .         don   t bother  i   ve heard it before .     wayne looked at ishihara .     you have any ideas .         i have one .         yeah .  what is it .         we can use the time travel unit to move all the way forward to khanbaliq  arriving tomorrow morning .  since we know hunter is behind us  and has no lead on mc    hunter cannot gain on us during the period we are skipping .         say .  .  . that   s right .     wayne nodded .     before  i was always worried that hunter would take the component robot during the interval we were jumping .  this time we know where he is .  and we   ll have the advantage .         what about xiao li .     jane asked suddenly .      what about him .     wayne shrugged .     he   ll be all right .  this is his time .         ishihara  he   s just a child .  and he   s only riding around the mountains in the middle of the night because of you two .  how can you just abandon him .         i expect hunter to catch him and protect him .  with that likelihood established  my first duty is to you two  as humans from our time .         but you don   t know he   s safe     said jane  wishing she had thought of this argument earlier .      hunter is tracking him     said ishihara .      we   ll go back to the outskirts of khanbaliq     wayne said firmly .     we   ll arrive tomorrow morning  back out by the village .  since they   ve already seen us appear like magic  we can do it again .         they   ll ask about xiao li     said jane .     what are you going to tell them .         that he   ll be fine     said wayne .     besides  we didn   t bring him with us  he came on his own .  he can find his way home if he has to .         that   s very callous     said jane .      let   s go now     said wayne  ignoring her .      all right     said ishihara .     steve slept late the next morning .  even when he woke up  he lay in bed listening to the sounds elsewhere in the inn .  he heard doors opening and closing on his corridor  downstairs  footsteps clunked and a chair scraped on the floor  accompanied by muffled conversation .   none of the voices sounded excited .  he had not heard marcia   s door open .  quietly  in no hurry  he got up and dressed .   as the morning passed  steve finally heard the other guests go outside one by one .  soon the clopping of horses    hooves reached him as the other patrons rode away .  then a lone set of footsteps walked up the stairs and down the hall .      sir .     the innkeeper rapped quietly .     the other guests have taken their leave now .      steve opened the door .     thank you .  i   ll get my wife .  we will have two breakfasts .         of course .     with a quick bow  he hurried away .   marcia opened her door  already dressed .     i   ve been listening .  everything   s okay  huh .         yeah     said steve .     you okay .         basically .  i   m sore from all that riding yesterday .     she winced as she walked out into the hall .      i   m afraid we have more of the same today .  but before we go downstairs  i want to call hunter .         all right .         hunter  steve and marcia here .  how are you .         i am well but have had no success .  how are you two .  and where are you .     hunter   s voice was faint and almost drowned out by a great deal of static .      we just got up at the inn .  the other guests have left  so we   re okay .  where are you .         i am down the road but on my way back toward you     said hunter .     i waited for dawn to rest my horse and to have more light .         you   re coming back .     marcia asked .     that   s great  but what happened to jane .         ishihara fooled me in the darkness .  i followed the tracks of xiao li and the animals long after the others had left the road for the forest .         what did they do .         they moved to the trees directly from their mounts .  it is a move familiar to me from our missions to the late cretaceous and to roman germany  but in the darkness i failed to spot the location .         where   s xiao li now .     marcia asked .     did you catch up to him .         no .  i backtracked at sunrise .         is he going to be okay .     steve asked .      i believe so     said hunter .     my first duty is to jane  in any case  it must take precedence over my first law concern over a local human .         are you sure .     marcia asked .      yes .         so what happened .     steve asked .      not much     said hunter .     i had to examine the tracks closely in order to see where they suddenly became shallower  indicating less weight .  eventually  i was able to find the area where the others had moved into the trees .         why aren   t you still following them .     steve was puzzled .     you wouldn   t just give up .         a short distance from the road  all the tracks and marks in the trees and brush vanish .         that   s impossible     said marcia .  then her tone changed .     uh  isn   t it .         no     said hunter .     after carefully reviewing my observations  i can only conclude that wayne took jane and ishihara to another time .         oh  no     steve muttered .      they left .     marcia stared at steve in horror .     now what do we do .         ishihara still has to protect jane     steve reminded her calmly     no matter where they went .         but where are they .         theoretically  they could be anywhere in history and geography     said hunter .      what do you think they would do .     steve asked .  he was more worried than he wanted to reveal to marcia .      wayne still wants to capture mc       said hunter .     they have probably gone right back to khanbaliq .         you said you   re coming back toward us     said steve .     why don   t you go back to khanbaliq after them .  we   ll go on to the great wall to find the polos .  after we learn if they can help us with mc    we   ll rejoin you in a day or two .         i dare not .  because of losing jane  i am again suffering from a feeling of failure .  i must reunite with you two as soon as i can .         well  we   re still going to have breakfast  but .  .  . how far are you .     steve asked .     if we sit here and wait  we   ll lose a lot of time .         i estimate that i am roughly half a day   s ride behind you at this moment .         you   ll catch up some while we   re eating .  then i think we should go on north .  we   re safe enough .  you   ll catch up to us tonight .         probably     said hunter .     now that the sun is replenishing my energy  i can jog alongside the horses i have with me .  that will relieve them of the burden of my weight .  however  they are still very tired .         we   ll be okay     said steve .      i can accept this if you can assure me you will call at the first sign of danger so we can discuss it     said hunter .     and avoid all risks you can see .         of course     said steve .      hunter out .      steve and marcia went downstairs .  the innkeeper hurried out with their breakfast of rice gruel with meat and vegetables in it  and a pot of hot tea .  he retired as steve and marcia started eating hungrily .   when steve had finally satisfied himself  he leaned back with a grin and sipped a little more tea .     that sure is familiar .  it   s the same breakfast i   ve had in chinese restaurants in our own time .         that   s true     said marcia .     i recognize it  too .  in fact  much of the chinese cooking in our own time is  at least in style  many centuries old .  even new ingredients  such as corn from the new world  have been available since the age of exploration .  an excavation on the old silk road in the late twentieth century revealed mummified dumplings virtually identical to what we eat now .  .  .  .      steve grinned as she prattled on with another of her lectures .  after seeing her genuinely scared and vulnerable last night  this lecture did not annoy him the way the earlier ones had .  now it just struck him as funny .  while she talked  steve ordered some meat filled buns they could take with them on the road .   when marcia finished her lecture  even the tea was gone .  steve got the duffel bag out of his room and paid the innkeeper .  then he and marcia walked out to the stable and had the hostler saddle their horses  which had already been fed .  steve paid him  too  and mounted up .   marcia grimaced as she swung into the saddle .     i don   t think i   ve ever used these muscles before .  not in this combination .  it   s not like riding a bike or a motorcycle at all .         no .     steve grinned .     that   s true .     he kicked his mount and turned up the road .   marcia steered her horse after him .     well  it   s a nice  clear  cool morning  isn   t it .         yes  it is .  and we have a leisurely ride ahead .  we don   t dare catch up to the travelers ahead of us  and we want hunter to catch up to us if he can .         good     said marcia  with a wry grin .     slow and easy sounds just fine to me .        jane  wayne  and ishihara landed in early morning right outside a small peasant village .  several chickens and a couple of children darted away in surprise .  beyond the buildings of the village  jane could see adults walking from the village into the fields with their farm tools .   as they got to their feet  jane looked around in all directions .  they were out of the mountains .  then she recognized the walls and towers of khanbaliq a short distance away .  in fact  she could see that they were fairly near the spot where hunter had first brought his team from their own time .   she yawned and wondered if she would be able to sleep soon .  wayne also needed rest .  she waited to see what her captors would do next .   an elderly man walked out of the house in the front of the village with an expression of concern on his face .  he spoke sharply to the children  then stopped abruptly when he saw wayne and ishihara .  the man bowed deeply to both of them .   wayne and ishihara responded in kind .  then wayne leaned close to ishihara and whispered something too low for jane to hear .  in turn  ishihara spoke quietly to the elderly man  who nodded as he listened .      come on in     wayne said to her in a casual tone .     we   ll get some rest .      their host took them inside to a small room .  it had two sleeping pallets of straw  covered with some sort of rough cloth .  the single window was shuttered .      thank you  lao li     ishihara said to the villager  who bowed and left them alone .      you and i both need a good night   s sleep .     wayne looked pointedly at jane .     ishihara will remain with us both for safety and to make sure you stay with us .         i   m too tired to run off     said jane .  she sat down on one of the pallets .     i guess this will do .     then she looked up at ishihara .     just make sure you stay here .  i don   t want to be left alone with him or in this village without you .         no harm will come to either of you     said ishihara .     steve and marcia rode slowly along the winding mountain road .  each time they crested a rise  he looked ahead for the travelers who had kidnapped hunter and jane the night before .  usually  they were too far ahead to see  but twice  when the terrain allowed him a particularly long view of the road ahead  he glimpsed the knot of riders moving north in the distance .   several times during the day  steve called hunter just to make contact with him as he followed them .  frequently  steve stopped to allow marcia some time to dismount and walk around  that was all they could do about her stiff muscles .  they ate the food he had brought from the inn and kept on riding .   late in the day  they rode in the shadow of a mountain as they came around a curve .  below them  in a narrow pass between two steep mountainsides  sunlight angled across a huge gate in a massive gray wall .  the wall had a rock base and high brick sides with crenellations across the top .  a small town had grown up just inside the gate .  startled  steve reined in to take a look .   steve had seen pictures of the great wall of china  always long shots in which the wall snaked over the top of a ridge .  those distant shots had no reference by which a viewer could judge the   size of the construction .  now  seeing the wall in front of him at a distance he could judge for himself  steve simply stared at it .      chuyungguan     said marcia .     that   s the name of this gate .  i was able to visit it once in our time .  the version standing now was restored in the twentieth century  but it looked the same as this one to me .      steve could see that this gate was in an important place .  the arched gate ran under a watchtower  and high on each mountain to the east and west  another tower stood guard over the land .  the narrow pass would be easy to defend  blocked by the great wall .      how big is this thing .     steve asked quietly .     how high are those towers .         the towers are about twelve meters high .  they   re about twelve meters square at the base and angle inward as they go up to about nine meters square at the top .             about    .         they didn   t use the metric system back then .  they had a measurement system of their own .  i   m rounding off the fractions .      steve nodded  still gazing at it .     how high is the wall itself between the towers .         it varies .  no shorter than about six meters and no higher than just over seven meters .         that thing is thick  too  isn   t it .          just over seven and a half meters .         is it solid rock .  or brick .         neither .  they raised the inner and outer faces of stone and brick first  then filled the space between them with earth or clay .  they pounded it down and then paved a brick road over the top of the wall .         so they can march troops along the top .         yes .  or ride four horses side by side .     she pointed to the three towers in turn .     they were placed within two bow shots of each other and they extend forward from the outer surface of the wall .  the idea was that archers in the towers could reach attackers all along the front of the wall .         i   m impressed .         so were the mongols .     marcia smiled .     genghis khan failed in a couple of assaults on this gate .  he finally took it when another mongol army under a subordinate broke through another gate that was less well defended and came up behind the chinese defenders here .         i guess no one needs it now  right .  kublai khan rules on both sides of the wall .         that   s right .  this gate has a small garrison  but in this time  it   s more of a checkpoint for travelers than anything .         shall we ride on down .  i guess the polos will be down there somewhere .         sure .              steve enjoyed the view as they rode down the slope into the narrow pass .  as they descended  the wall loomed larger and higher than ever  a magnificent edifice that seemed to be part of the mountain ridge on which it had been built .  as they drew closer they could see that the individual stones in the wall were very large .  when steve remembered the wall had been built entirely by human and animal labor  with no modem machinery or robots at all  it seemed even more impressive .  dusk had arrived by the time they reached the town just before the gate .   on the watchtower over the gate  and along the top of the wall  soldiers were silhouetted against the sky  all of them looking away to the north .   steve could see that the gate was standing open .  four uniformed soldiers stood guard inside the gateway  leaning casually on their spears and looking attentively at something beyond his sight on the far side of the gate .  at the sound of hoofbeats as steve and marcia drew near  the guards glanced idly back over their shoulders  then resumed looking through the gateway .      what are they looking at .     steve asked .  he could hear the shouts of men and the thunder of many hooves in the distance .     sounds like a lot of riders .  whatever it is  the sentries don   t seem to be alarmed by it .         i have no idea .         let   s go see .         i don   t think that   s such a good idea .     marcia shook her head vigorously .     no .         come on  why not .  you   ve been here before  but i haven   t .  i want to see the wall up close .  do you think we can go up in one of the towers .         no .         what   s wrong .         look  it   s a tourist attraction only in our time     marcia said anxiously .     i wouldn   t ask these soldiers just to show us around .         why not .         to use a modern phrase  this is a functioning military installation  even if it   s not as important now as it used to be .     marcia lapsed into her lecturing tone again .     and we aren   t mongols  they see the chinese as a conquered people .  asking to go up in the tower could raise the suspicion that we might attempt sabotage or espionage in some form .         even an ordinary couple like us .         as soon as we ask to tour the watchtower  we won   t be ordinary anymore .  we   ll look very odd .  like i said  this is not a place for tourists in this time .         well .  .  . i see .         good .         but we can still go find out what they   re looking at .  i mean  the gate   s standing wide open .         i don   t think we should .         well  look  we have to ask someone about the polos anyway .  they should know .  come on .     steve kicked his mount and rode up to the gate .      well  be careful .     shaking her head  marcia followed him reluctantly .      should we speak mongol to them .         no .  judging by their armor and their weapons  they   re chinese .         they are .         even under the khan  the mongol armies and the chinese armies are distinct .         why don   t they have just the mongol army now  if the khan is worried about the chinese rebelling .         the mongol army alone isn   t big enough to garrison the whole chinese empire .  the khan needs the chinese army for that .  the chinese army is controlled by generals put in place by the khan  as emperor of china .         oh .  well  okay .  i get the idea .     steve felt that if he was polite and careful  he could at least see what had caught the attention of the sentries .  besides  if the polos had passed through the gate  the sentries were the ones to ask .   as he reined in at the gate  the sentries turned to look up at him .  all four were stocky  muscular young men .  they seemed more resigned than wary .      what is your business here .     one sentry  marginally taller than the others  straightened up .      i have heard that the polo family took this road in the last day or so     said steve .     marco polo and his father and uncle .  i seek them .      the other three guards also drew themselves up  suddenly interested .  the polo name obviously carried some importance .  however  all four sentries looked at each other and shook their heads .      they have not come this way recently     said the first sentry politely .     we know their name  because they are favored by the emperor .  we have seen them on this road in past years  but not recently .      steve was startled  but he nodded courteously .  he suddenly realized that xiao li   s story had been a falsehood from beginning to end .  as soon as he could report to hunter without local witnesses  he would .   behind him  marcia sighed audibly .   steve pointed through the open gateway .  several large groups of men were riding in the distance  across patches of rugged  steeply sloped steppe surrounded by forest .     who are they .  what are they doing .      the sentry frowned .     a local mongol battalion has camped just outside the wall .  they are practicing maneuvers  no more .  after all  we are many miles from the borders of the emperor   s empire here .         really .     apparently more comfortable now  marcia rode up closer to steve and looked out  too .   steve could see hundreds of riders moving together in one group  their banners flying on upright lances .  in the distance behind them  a separate group was wheeling about  riding through a sharp turn .  a third group of riders stood on a far hill  unmoving .      that looks like fun     said steve .      don   t you dare     marcia whispered loudly .      calm down .     he grinned .     i   m not going out there .  but i used to ride out in the mojave desert .  my favorite horse was a half quarter horse  half arabian mare .         these are mongol horses .         i know .  arabians have more delicate features and more high strung temperaments .  but both are small  hardy desert breeds .         you still have your horse .     she looked at him with a new curiosity .      no .  i don   t have any of them now .  but i miss that one the most .     he nodded to the sentries and reined his mount around .     come on .      steve rode a short distance away from the sentries and all the small buildings in the little settlement .  marcia followed him .  when he was out of the hearing of everyone else  he leaned close to marcia .      we   ll pretend we   re talking to each other  since people can see us .  i   m calling hunter .         all right .         hunter  steve here .      for once  hunter did not answer .      hunter  you there .      marcia   s eyes widened as she looked at steve .      hunter .      only static hissed quietly from the lapel pin .      maybe my transmitter   s broken     said steve .     try calling him on yours .      marcia switched on her pin .     hunter .  marcia calling .  steve and i have reached the great wall .      she  too  received only static and shut it off .     what do you think happened .      steve turned to look back the way they had come .     maybe nothing .  he was about a half day   s ride behind us  and we   ve come through some very rugged country  much rougher than the ground we covered yesterday .  the mountains block radio signals .  he   s probably still coming .         then why could we communicate last night .         it depends on the configuration of the mountains and passes .  the signal can bounce  too .  it   s impossible to predict exactly where it will go .         then you think he   s still coming .         yeah .         so what are we going to do .      steve looked at the sky .  the sun had gone behind the mountains  and the sky was reddening with sunset .  the air had abruptly chilled even in the brief time since they had arrived at the gate .   marcia waited  looking back up the road as though she hoped to see hunter .      well  i guess we wasted a lot of time coming here     said steve .      you think the polos turned off the road somewhere along the way .         no     said steve .     if you remember  we haven   t passed any forks today .         i saw some paths .  hunting trails  most likely .  these mountains provide game for the emperors .         i don   t think the polos came this way at all .  xiao li must have pulled a fast one from the very start .  i should have figured that out last night  but so much was going on  i never thought it all through .         none of us did  with jane and hunter being carried off     said marcia .     but  as i asked you a moment ago  what are we going to do .         i guess we can take a room   two if you prefer   for the night .  hunter should arrive sometime later .  tomorrow  we can go back to khanbaliq .         oh  no .  some of the same people must be here in one of the inns .    the people who kidnapped hunter and jane .         well .  .  . that   s true .     steve looked around .  the little town had three inns with stables  some small houses  and seven taverns .     this is a strange place .         yes  it   s just a road stop  really .  travelers would account for the number of inns  of course .  but only the garrison of guards on the great wall could support that many taverns in a settlement this size .         do they live in the houses .         no .  they   re garrisoned in the towers along the wall .  the houses must be owned by some well to do tavern owners or innkeepers who can live separately from their businesses .     she shrugged .     hard to tell  really .         look  that group of travelers stayed together all day .  at least  every time i saw them  they were still together .  if they   ve taken rooms in the same inn  then we have two others where we can stay .         but they might have split up .  besides  how are we going to know where they are .         come on .      steve reined his horse back around and rode to the nearest inn  where he stopped with marcia outside the stable .  most of the horses were out of sight  but the hostler was grooming one .  steve had been hoping to recognize the horses belonging to the other group  but he had not taken any special notice of them yesterday .      i   m going to look inside the inn     said steve .     stay on your horse  all right .         all right .      steve dismounted and quietly walked up onto the front porch of the small wooden building .  he opened the door and leaned inside  looking around .  it was much like the inn in which they had stayed the night before  with a large room full of tables in front of a big fireplace .  the furniture was more finely finished  carved and deeply polished  suggesting greater prosperity .  long  vertical landscape paintings hung on the walls .      welcome  friend .     a big  burly innkeeper hurried forward  smiling .   past him  steve recognized a couple of merchants from the group he wanted to avoid .      sorry     steve muttered quickly .  he pulled out of the doorway and closed the door quickly behind him .  from what he could tell  no one except the innkeeper had seen him .      what happened .     marcia asked .      they   re in there     said steve  as he swung into the saddle .     that   s good  because now we know where they are .  i don   t think anyone saw me .         then we can stay at another inn .         i   ll do the same thing again  in case that group had to split up to get rooms .      they rode to another inn .  again  marcia waited outside .  steve looked inside this one and did not recognize any of the visitors who had sat down to dinner .  he stepped inside  still looking around cautiously .   this time a slender  white haired man approached him and bowed .     good evening  stranger .  are you in need of lodging .         i may be     said steve .     i  uh  had an argument yesterday with other travelers along this road .  i would like to avoid them if i can .         i see .  well  i have some soldiers here on their way south to khanbaliq .         the ones i   m talking about are going north .  some merchants and students  as well as soldiers .         i have no group like that .      steve grinned with relief .     good .  uh  i have a companion .  we   ll take two rooms .  and two dinners .         very well .  i ask six coppers for each room .         fine .  i   ll take our horses to the stable .         of course .      as steve hurried out  he realized that he had forgotten to bargain .  it was too late now  he had revealed to the innkeeper that he had reason to avoid the other inns  which had ruined his bargaining position .  he decided not to worry about it .  in this case  a safe place to wait for hunter was more important than exactly how much they spent .   the hostler was a tall  gaunt man with graying hair who walked stiffly with age .  with a weary  uninterested nod  he took the reins from steve and marcia .  steve untied the cloth bag with their changes of clothes from the back of the saddle .  as they started toward the inn  hoofbeats came through the gate and they turned to look .   a group of mongol riders rode through the gate .  grinning  they arrogantly ignored the chinese sentries who glared sullenly at them  and split up .  small knots of riders trotted toward different taverns and inns .  four young riders  dressed in furs with breastplates  backplates  and pointed steel caps  came toward steve and marcia .      i guess the battalion was dismissed     said steve .      let   s get inside     said marcia .     i   m scared .         all right .      they turned away .      ho .  you there .     one of the soldiers called out in accented chinese .      ignore him     marcia whispered .     let   s just get inside .         i better not     said steve .     we don   t want to make them mad .     he turned and looked up at the riders .     good evening     he said in mongol .   the lead rider raised his eyebrows in surprise .     you speak our language .         yes  friend .  and i see you have fine horses .  we saw you ride a few minutes ago  beyond the wall .     steve figured a compliment would always be wise .      the best in mongolia .     the rider grinned  seeming to mock his own boasting .     you know horses .         a little     steve said modestly .  he was certain that boasting himself would be a mistake .     i had a very fine one of a different desert breed once .  she was the kind ridden by the arabs .         ah .  my uncle rode against the arabs in the west .  he fought in persia .         then he must have seen the same breed .         he must have .     the mongol shrugged .     is this inn crowded .  we seek chinese wine .  i prefer it to our koumiss .         uh  no  it   s not crowded .         good .     he swung out of the saddle  and his companions did likewise .  without even looking at the hostler  he gestured for the old man to take their horses .  he turned to steve .     you will come and drink with us as my guest .         well  i have ordered dinner for my friend and me     said steve uncertainly .      do what he says     marcia muttered quickly in english .     keep him happy .  but they know a decent woman won   t drink with them  so i   m going up to my room .  bring me something to eat when you can  okay .     she took the cloth bag from him .      all right     said steve .  he didn   t know what else to do .     but what   s koumiss .         fermented mare   s milk .     marcia hurried into the inn ahead of them .   steve grimaced at the idea of that  then turned to the mongol leader  speaking in mongol again .     thank you .  i will be honored to join you .      the mongol clapped him on the shoulder .     wine and food for all of us     he called to the innkeeper in his accented chinese .     your best .      the innkeeper bowed deeply and rushed away .   the mongol leader led the group to the table closest to the fireplace and gestured for them all to sit down .           steve sat down with the mongols  smiling at each one with a nod of greeting .  when he got the chance  he would ask the innkeeper to take marcia   s dinner up to her .  right now  he felt it was wise not to remind the mongols that she was up there .      what is your name .     the mongol pointed to himself .     i am timur .         steve .         ss   teve .  the sound is unusual to me .  but of course  my chinese is not so good .      the other mongols introduced themselves in turn  but steve could not understand the unfamiliar names he heard .  he decided not to ask that they repeat them .  instead  he simply nodded again courteously .      so  you must be a rider     said timur .      not like you are .  i saw you from the gate  riding on maneuvers .  i could never ride that well .         i am curious about you  steve .  i never met a chinese man who had bothered to learn our language before .  tell us more about this other breed of horse .         uh  well  the arabians were bred to the southern deserts  at low altitude  near the sea .     steve was no expert on the history of arabians  so he dropped that approach .     my best horse had a sharp  delicate nose and a small body .  she was very hardy .  i remember  she never even seemed to notice if the wind was blowing up a sandstorm or if it was raining .  all weather was the same to her .         a sandstorm .     timur asked .     you rode her in the desert  then .         well  yes .         this must have been the same time when you learned our language  eh .         yes  it was .     steve hesitated  glad to see the innkeeper come hurrying out with a piece of candle and wine and wine cups .  a younger man followed him with bowls of noodles and strips of meat .  steve did not want to be drawn into questions about how he had learned to speak mongol .  as soon as the innkeeper had lit the candle and poured wine for them all  steve lifted a cup .     i toast my new friends .         ah .     timur grinned and held up his own .  his friends joined in and they all drank .   before timur could ask more questions about steve   s experience among mongols in the desert  steve turned to one of the other mongols .     tell me about your experiences in the battalion .  have you fought anyone recently .         no  i have not had the chance .     the man shook his head as he started eating .      we are too young  all of us     said timur .     we missed the great wars of conquest by the khakhan  which were finished before we came of age .         but we are ready     said another     and eager for the chance .  we must prove ourselves every day and hope that our battalion will be sent to a distant land someday         it would be very exciting     steve said carefully  as he began eating his own dinner .  he tried to think of another question that would keep the conversation away from his own life .     you   re off duty tonight .  why isn   t the whole battalion coming to drink .  only a few of you came through the gate .      timur laughed .     no  no  you don   t understand .  those of us who came through the gate all have sentry duty tonight  to begin when the torches are doused and the camp sleeps .  we have some free time before then .         i see .      the mongols ate and drank eagerly  without speaking further .  steve decided he could take the time to eat his own dinner .  timur   s curiosity about him seemed satisfied .   everyone finished eating without more comment .  steve hoped he could take some food up to marcia soon  but that would have to wait until the mongols had left .  however  timur leaned back with another cup of wine and looked up at steve .      which tribe did you ride with .     timur asked .   steve froze .  he thought he remembered marcia mentioning something about mongol tribes  but he could not recall what she had said .  maybe he was mistaken about that .      what   s wrong .     timur studied his face .      i  uh  rode with friends .  that   s all .         friends .  but you must have lived on the grasslands  didn   t you .  if you rode out in the desert at times .         i was a loner .      timur shrugged .     about these arabian horses .  can they carry a man day and night  across deserts and mountains .  when we are on the march  we push our horses to the point of dropping  but they carry us where they must .      steve almost asked him how he would know  since he had never been to war  but he knew better .  it would only anger them .     i am sure you have the finest horses in the world .  everyone knows that .      timur nodded  and drained his wine cup .     we must return to the camp to begin sentry duty .     he glanced at his companions .     and no mention of how much chinese wine we have drunk  eh .     he grinned at steve .     the punishment for falling asleep on watch is death .      steve wasn   t sure how to respond to that  so he said nothing .  when the mongols rose from their chairs  he did  too .  timur tossed some coins to the innkeeper .      farewell on your travels  steve .  show us one of those horses one day if you can   or maybe we   ll ride to arabia and see them for ourselves .     he laughed and led his companions out of the inn .      farewell     steve called after them .   when they had gone  he drew in a deep breath and let it out .  he only realized now how tense he had been throughout the dinner  concentrating on his company to avoid offending them .  now just beginning to relax  he turned to the innkeeper  who was clearing the table .      bring out dinner for my friend     steve said in chinese  picking up the candle from the table .     i   ll go up and ask her to come down .         very well .  i showed her to the first two rooms on the left .     the innkeeper hustled away with an armload of dirty dishes and cups .   steve grinned slightly as he climbed the stairs to the second floor by the flickering light of the small candle he carried .  he was sure marcia would be amused by the story of his dinner with the mongols .  since he had managed to avoid angering them  and had somehow survived the question of how he could speak mongol  it would make a funny anecdote .   he rapped lightly on the door of one of the two rooms they had taken .      marcia .  steve .  the mongols have left .  you can come downstairs for dinner now .      when he received no answer  he knocked on the door of the other room .     marcia .  you awake .     after a pause  he tried the door  expecting it to be barred .  instead  it was open .  the room was empty .   he moved back to the other room and tried the door .  also unbarred  it swung open easily .  the cloth bag steve had carried on his horse with their changes of clothes lay on the bed .  marcia was not here  either .   worried  he looked down to the far end of the corridor .  to his right  another staircase led down .  he walked down the hall for a better look .  down the stairs  he could see one doorway that led down the corridor on the ground floor and another that led outside .  maybe she had just gone out to the latrine and had taken the back stairs to avoid passing the mongols .   steve decided he would wait for a minute to see if she returned .  it was time to try calling hunter again  anyway .  he walked back to the room and switched on his lapel pin .  before he could speak  however  he heard the hoofbeats of several horses coming through it .   alarmed  he listened carefully .  the hoofbeats were cantering  too many for him to hear how many horses were present .  the sound was clear  with minimal static  meaning that marcia   s lapel pin was still nearby .  no one spoke .  however  he knew what it meant  like jane when she had been kidnapped  marcia had managed to turn on her lapel pin so it could transmit whatever sounds occurred around her .   some people had kidnapped marcia  apparently by using the back stairs and the rear entrance .   hunter would also be listening to it  wherever he was .  however  with marcia   s lapel pin switched on  steve could not call hunter without being heard by the people who had taken marcia .  steve could only assume they were the same group he had seen at the other inn  who had kidnapped hunter and jane .  he had mistakenly believed that when he had stuck his head in the door and seen a couple of them that they had not seen him .   exactly why they had taken marcia remained a mystery  but it did not matter right now .  he grabbed the cloth bag and hurried back downstairs .  at the sound of his feet pounding on the steps  the innkeeper rushed around the corner to find him .      something wrong .     the innkeeper asked .      my friend is gone .  who came in the back door while i was having dinner .  did you see them .         no .  i heard some people come in  but i have other guests here .  i thought they had gone out to the latrine and come back .  i did not look to see who they were .         yeah  all right .  hold her dinner .  and our rooms .  i expect to be back .     steve strode out the front door into the chilly mountain air again .   a single paper lantern swung in the breeze over the stable .  under it  the tall  gaunt hostler sat on a wooden chest  bundled in fur robes .  he took a swig of something from a narrow earthenware bottle .      saddle my horse  please     steve said .   at the sound of his voice  the hostler jerked in surprise .  his eyes widened fearfully as he recognized steve in the moonlight .  he said nothing .      come on .  i   m in a hurry .     steve reached into his leather pouch for a couple of small coins and started to toss them to the old man .  then he saw that the hostler had made no move to catch them .      what   s wrong .     steve asked .     i need my horse .      the man just stared at him  quivering .      what is it .      the old man tightened the fur robes around him .      look   did you see some people leave by the back door a little while ago with my friend .      the man still just looked at him .  over his head  the paper lantern swayed gently .  finally  as steve glared at him  he nodded slightly .   steve remembered turning over the reins of their horses to him when they had arrived .  at the time  the hostler had acted as though doing his job was just a tiresome chore .  he had shown no interest in steve or marcia personally at all .      tell me what happened     steve demanded angrily  stepping forward .     i want to know where my friend went .      the terrified old man shook his head  dropping the earthenware bottle slowly to the ground with a thud .      did someone speak to you .  tell me what happened .     steve shouted .   the hostler was scared beyond the ability to speak .  shadows shifted across his face as the lantern swung back and forth .  he stared at steve  motionless .   steve fought to control his anger .  he took a deep breath and stepped back .  shouting would not get him anywhere .  he could saddle his own horse  of course  but now he had to know what had scared the hostler .      why are you scared of me .  i won   t hurt you .     steve took several more coins out of his pouch .  holding them in this open palm  he slowly walked toward the man and dropped the coins on his lap .  then he backed away again .     did someone tell you i would hurt you .      the old man looked down at the money  then up at steve again .  slowly  he moved one hand to cover the coins .  then he eyed steve again .      i won   t hurt you     steve said gently .     i just want to find my friend .      the old hostler studied his face for a moment  then looked around in the darkness nearby .  he swallowed and picked up the coins in one hand .  then he fumbled around for his earthenware bottle .   steve stepped forward and picked it up .  he brushed off some bits of dirt and broken straw and handed it to the old man .  then he moved away again .   the hostler took a long drink .  he lowered the bottle  wincing  and let out a long breath .  he looked up at steve again  less frightened than before .      what happened to my friend .     steve asked .      you act like an ordinary man .         yeah  i guess .  why wouldn   t i .         they told me you deal with evil spirits     he muttered  looking away .      what .  who told you .         some men from another inn     he said quietly .     they said you and your woman deal with evil spirits .         look  it   s not true .  we don   t deal with evil spirits .  it   s a misunderstanding .         they seemed so sure .  and some of them are educated young men .         it   s not their fault .     steve struggled to hide his impatience .     another man has fooled them .  but i have to help my friend .  tell me what happened .         they paid me to show them the back door and to saddle her horse while they were inside .  then they carried out your friend .  when they left  they said they would come back for you .         will you help me .      the hostler hesitated .  he seemed embarrassed by the story he had just told .     what do you want .         saddle my horse and tell me which way they went .      the hostler nodded and slowly got to his feet .     i   ll help you .  they took your friend through the gate .     he walked toward the horses .      what .     steve followed him .     don   t the guards close the gate at night .         yes .  they bribed the sentries to open it for them .  i saw them in the light of the torches .     the hostler went inside the stable .   steve waited for him outside and looked toward the gate in the great wall .  torches burned over the gate  but no guards were posted down on the road now .  he could see firelight flickering in the windows of the watchtower over the gate  obviously  that was where the night watch spent their hours on duty .   a moment later  the hostler led his horse out with a halter and tied it loosely to a pole .      can the sentries normally be bribed that way .         yes  the chinese guards can be .  but not the mongols  if you see any .     the hostler went back inside the stable and came out with steve   s saddle .      how much does it take .      the hostler threw on the saddle and adjusted its position .     what you gave me would do it  but each man who comes down from the watchtower must have the same .     he drew the girth up under the horse and cinched it .      how many are there .         only two men are on watch .  sometimes only one wants to come down .  maybe the other is asleep  or just doesn   t want to bother .     the old man slipped off the halter and put on the bridle .  when he had fastened it  he handed the reins to steve .      i expect to be back tonight with my friend     said steve .     we   ll want you to take care of our horses again .     he put his foot in the stirrup and swung up into the saddle .   the old man nodded .   steve looked up into the sky .  the moon was high and threw enough light to see the ground .  still  he had no idea what kind of terrain he was about to cross .   he nudged his mount forward and reached up to unhook the lantern that hung over the stable .     i   ll bring this back if i can .     then  holding the lantern in one hand  he rode toward the gate in the great wall .           marcia rode through the darkness more frightened than she had ever been .  her wrists had been lashed together  then tied to the front of her saddle .  one of her kidnappers held the reins of her horse .   her captors did not have a lantern .  they kept to the road as it wound across open areas of steppe  away from the forest .  moonlight lit the way north .   during the first terrifying moments when her kidnappers had come into her room  she had been gagged almost immediately .  as she tried to resist them  she had been able to switch on her lapel pin before her hands had been tied .  then her captors had carried her out of the room and down some back stairs in near silence .   the old hostler had been waiting with her horse .  in the light of the small lantern at the stable  she had finally counted five kidnappers  one of whom had taken the reins of her mount and tied them to his own saddle .  they had paused to dicker with the sentries at the gate in the great wall  but the sentries had ignored the gag tied over her mouth .   these sentries were not the same men steve had spoken to earlier .  obviously  the watch had changed since then .  these sentries were more interested in the bribe they received for opening the gate after dark than in interfering with other people   s business .   no one spoke .  marcia rode at a walk through the moonlight  listening to the clopping of the horses    hooves .  she supposed the lead rider had to go slowly because of the near darkness .  certainly she would not complain  wherever they were taking her  she hoped the trip took a very long time .   the road curved as it skirted the edges of the forest  rising and dipping steeply at times .  ahead and to her left  marcia could see lights clumped together in the distance  she decided they were torches or camp fires at the mongol camp .  she could not tell how far the camp was  but her captors clearly had no intention of going any closer .   marcia had no idea if she could realistically expect any help .  hunter might still be too far to receive the sound of hoofbeats through her lapel pin .  even if he were receiving them right now  he could be too far back down the road to catch up before something horrible happened to her .   steve  for all she knew  could still be enjoying his dinner with the mongols .  he certainly had to keep his lapel pin turned off while he remained in their company .  besides  when he did discover that she was missing  he would be alone without a robot to help rescue her .   the riders around her pulled up for a moment on the crest of small hill  the man holding marcia   s reins drew her mount to a stop with them .  in the pale moonlight  she saw that the road forked  one branch angling to the left toward the mongol camp .  the other branch continued north .      what are we going to do .     one man  merely a shadow to marcia  turned in his saddle to look at the others .     which way shall we go .         i say we are far enough     said another .     we must do what we are going to do .      marcia felt herself go cold deep inside .      i do not like it     said a third man in a high  whiny voice .     she will be found here  and the sentries at the wall will remember us .         she deals with evil spirits     someone else reminded him .     we must kill her and return to the inn before evil spirits come to save her and kill us all .         we have to kill her friend as well     said the first man .     we must finish with her in time to return for him and bring him back out here .         at least we must take her away from the road     said the man with the whiny voice     into the trees where her body will not be found until we are far away  if ever .         who will do it .     the first man asked .     one of you soldiers .  you have the swords .         i am a soldier  not a murderer     someone said stiffly .     anyone of us can do the job .         we are all in this together now     said another     no matter who actually does it .      no one spoke for a long moment .  marcia could hardly believe she was listening to them discuss killing her .  she could not believe she was going to die in this year  centuries before she had been born .      either all of us must kill her or none of us     said the first man .   marcia understood their dilemma .  they were not murderers by nature .  however  they were highly superstitious and were driven by their fear of her .      we cannot let her live now     said one of the others .     she will call evil spirits down on us .         i have an idea     said the man with the whiny voice .     we can leave her out in the woods  tied  without her outer robes .  the heat of the day and the cold of the night will do the work  or maybe wild animals .         this is good     said the first man .     we shall be equally responsible .      marcia could see the heads of all her captors nodding in the moonlight .  none had the stomach for killing her outright .  they wanted to take the easy way out .      yes  i agree     said another man .     nature can do the job for us .  and we can return for her friend .         fine     said the first man .     now we must move away from the road and find a place to leave her .      marcia tried to swallow  but her throat was too dry .     steve rode north from the great wall at a trot .  that speed was risky in the moonlight on a bad road  but it was his only chance to catch up to marcia and her kidnappers .  he hoped that they had been traveling at a walk ever since they had left .  if not  he had no chance of catching up .   he held the lantern forward as he rode  to see the fresh tracks he was following .  while those tracks were not much newer than the other tracks left by the day   s travelers  they overlaid the earlier tracks with clear imprints on the dry  dusty road .  he knew they might leave the road at any time  and he had to spot the location immediately if they did .  since hunter  with his enhanced vision  had failed to notice where wayne   s group had left the road last night  steve was acutely aware of how easy it would be to miss this .   through the shadows in the moonlight  steve kept his gaze on the road .  he left his lapel pin turned on .  it provided him with the sounds of hoofbeats of the riders ahead of him .  gradually  he heard those hoofbeats grow louder as he gained ground on the steep  rolling slopes .   when steve heard voices coming from his lapel pin  he listened carefully .  he heard marcia   s captors discuss their plans for her .  from his own point of view  having marcia tied up and abandoned was not bad at all .  if he could avoid her kidnappers on their return trip  he could find her through the lapel pin and free her .   however  he did not like the uncertainty in their voices .  he was afraid they might change their minds and kill her outright after all .  that meant he still had to rescue her if he could .   steve wanted to form a plan  but he was not sure how to proceed .  from the volume and clarity of the hoofbeats coming through his lapel pin  he knew that he was not too far behind them now .  he guessed the distance at about thirty meters  a distance at which he could still not hear their hoofbeats clearly without the radio signal .  apparently they were behind some hill .   steve paused to blowout the flame inside the lantern he carried .  otherwise  marcia   s captors would see the glow as he drew closer .  they would not hear his hoofbeats for a while yet because the sound of their own would camouflage his .   steve wished he could confer with marcia .  he wanted to reassure her that he was nearby and also plan her escape with her .  of course  her captors would hear his voice .   then he realized that he could use that to his advantage .  after all  they believed that he and marcia dealt in evil spirits .  hearing his voice through her lapel pin now would not make any difference .      marcia  steve here     he said in english .     i   m right behind you .      he heard a roar of startled shouts from the men in the background .      mmmmmm .         marcia  you okay .  is that you .         mmm .      steve realized  then  that she was gagged .   the men were still gasping  then shouting  in awe at the sound of a man   s voice from nowhere .   steve switched to chinese .     do not harm this woman     he intoned authoritatively .     she is under the protection of good spirits .  beware .         hunter here .     the robot   s voice was weak and nearly drowned out by static .     since you are not afraid of being overheard  i can say i am much closer to you now than i have been all day .  marcia must be in trouble .  i am riding as fast as i can  but my mount is very tired .         where are you  hunter .     steve asked .     we need help .  i don   t have any weapons or anything .         i can see lights in what i believe is a watchtower in the great wall ahead  but i am not close to it yet .  right now  i am on the crest of a hill  looking across a considerable distance .         we don   t have time for you to catch up     said steve .     follow us if you can .      up ahead in the moonlight  steve saw the shadows of the group on horseback .  his only advantage was their fear of evil spirits  so he decided to give them another scare if he could .  suddenly kicking his mount hard into a gallop  he screamed as loud as he could and rode straight toward them .   with panicked shouts  the riders in front of him all turned and fled .  he could see marcia   s silhouette momentarily in the moonlight .  her mount suddenly took off away from the road  over a rolling hill .   steve saw that her arms angled down to the pommel of the saddle and suddenly realized that her horse was out of control .  he reined after her and kicked his mount hard .     hang on .      marcia was helpless on her breakneck ride through the near darkness .  at any moment  her horse could stumble in the moonlight  throwing her out of the saddle and then dragging her by her wrists .  if his own mount fell  he might never catch up to her .      turn your horse .     steve shouted to marcia .     use your knees  elbows  lean against the side of his neck  anything .  try to slow down .      steve knew that she couldn   t actually turn her mount completely .  however  she might slow him down  even make him turn a little .  now  steve could see that he was gaining ground on marcia .   her horse went over the crest of a rounded hill and down a steep slope .  marcia leaned to one side in the saddle  struggling to steer her horse to the right .  steve rode hard and gradually came up on her left .  her reins would be trailing loose from her horse   s bridle .   steve leaned forward over his mount   s neck  still riding hard .  he looped his reins over his left wrist and shifted the paper lantern to his left hand .  with his right hand  he reached out and flailed in the dark for marcia   s reins .  suddenly his hand snagged the loose  unseen reins and he jerked them taut .      whoa .     steve drew back  reining in his own mount and also marcia   s .   back on the road  the other riders did not stop .  they rode on into the darkness .  in a moment  even their shadows were lost around the next bend .   steve and marcia finally came to a halt .  he maneuvered his horse next to hers so he could reach her gag .  she leaned toward him to make it easier .      got her  hunter .     steve reached over and untied the cloth around marcia   s mouth .     you okay .         yes     she said breathlessly  nodding .     but my hands are tied .         i am glad     hunter said  his voice still sounding distant through the static .      we have to hurry     said steve .     i   m afraid those guys will gather their wits and come back for us .     he wished he still had the knife he had carried on their second mission in jamaica during the seventeenth century .  instead of cutting marcia loose  he had to untie her .  finally he pulled her bonds free  and she rubbed her sore wrists .      can you handle your reins .     steve asked .      yes  i think so .         good .  let   s go .     steve turned his mount and kicked it to a trot .  marcia kept pace .      hunter  we   re heading back south at a trot .  the guys who kidnapped marcia are riding fast in the other direction  but i   m afraid they may change their minds .         i understand     said hunter .  his voice came through slightly more distinctly than before .     i read you more clearly now .  i have almost reached the small town by the gate in the great wall .  i hope to join you soon .         good     said steve     just in case they come back .  but you   ll have to bribe your way through the gate .  if we   re lucky  the kidnappers won   t stop running till they reach siberia .  we just can   t take that chance .      as they rode  steve glanced back over his shoulder .  he saw no sign of the other men behind them  nor did he hear them .  maybe they truly were too frightened to stop fleeing anytime soon .   in the distance to his right  he could still see the lights of the mongol camp in the distance .  some of the campfires had burned down  but others remained as bright as ever .  he supposed that timur and the other sentries kept some fires burning all night .   steve and marcia rode side by side at an urgent trot .  every so often  he turned to look behind them again  but he still saw no one .  at times  the moonlight outlined the crenellations atop the great wall and the watchtower over the gate ahead of them .  then the road would dip and take them out of sight of the great wall again .   they had ridden for some time when suddenly the dark silhouettes of men on horseback moved out from behind a small bluff .  the riders crossed the road at a walk in front of steve and marcia .  then they calmly turned to face them and stopped to block the way .   startled  steve yanked back on the reins and started to turn .  he saw more riders moving around them on each side .  behind them  several more blocked the road .  marcia  looking around frantically  gasped in surprise .      who are you .     a voice demanded in mongol .     where are you going at this hour .         back to the great wall     steve said politely in the same language .   suddenly one of the other riders made a clicking sound and lit a torch .  steve winced in the sudden light  then saw that the mongol raising the torch held a flint and steel in his other hand .  by the flickering orange torchlight  steve recognized timur as the man who had spoken .      ah .     timur grinned  seeing steve   s face clearly for the first time .  .  . so  it is my friend from dinner .              steve smiled back timur  relieved to see him in a friendly frame of mind .     good evening .         what are you doing out here in the middle of the night  my friend .     in the flickering torchlight  timur glanced at marcia  then back at steve .      be careful     marcia whispered in english .     kidnapping probably gets the death penalty here .  almost every serious crime does .      steve understood her point .  they did not want to cause her kidnappers  or anyone else  to die .  already  the team had influenced local people to take many actions they would not have otherwise taken .      we had a misunderstanding with some of our fellow travelers  but it is settled now .  i apologize for the inconvenience to you and your men .         we can find these people for you .  perhaps you want them punished .         no .  no  the problem has ended .  i gave them a good scare myself .     steve glanced at the riders around them  hoping to change the subject .     you must have brought all the sentries out with you .      timur chuckled  and so did many of his companions .     no  my friend .  most of the sentries remain on duty .  i saw a mysterious light out here a short while ago and woke up a squad of riders to join me in finding it .         it was just this .     steve lifted up the paper lantern .      i first saw it moving north .  by the time we got out here  we heard you returning and took our positions to intercept you .         you were very quiet     said steve .  he figured a compliment couldn   t hurt .     i had no idea you were coming toward us or waiting here .      timur simply nodded casually .     we shall escort you back through the gate .     he turned his horse  and his men imitated his movement .  the rough circle of men around steve and marcia began to ride south at a walk .   steve exchanged a glance with marcia  and they kept pace .  he felt safe from marcia   s kidnappers  but he also knew that timur was not giving them any options .  their host wanted them returned to where they belonged .  in any case  they were now safe from marcia   s kidnappers  even if that group did turn around and come back .      you   re okay .     steve asked marcia quietly in english .  he was not asking for information .  instead  he wanted to convey a message to hunter  who undoubtedly had heard the entire conversation with timur .  he would still be listening  concerned about their condition .      i   m fine     she said clearly .      so am i .     steve grinned  sure that she understood what he was doing .   tired after a long day of riding  steve would not have minded moving faster .  his mount was weary  however  and he decided that asking the mongols for more speed might lead to a full gallop .  he definitely had had enough breakneck riding for one night .  so he said nothing and simply gazed up at the great wall in the moonlight as they returned to it .   under the watchtower  timur reined in .  as his companion raised the torch high  the other riders also stopped .  in the windows of the watchtower  sentries looked out  their silhouettes outlined against the light of their own fire inside the watchtower .      open the gate     timur shouted in his accented chinese .     open for two lost travelers .         the gate opens in the morning     a sentry called back .     who is there .         you know me     timur growled angrily .  he rose up in his stirrups .     open this gate now .      the man with the torch held it so that the light fell clearly across timur   s face .  the sentry who had spoken disappeared from sight .  several of the mongols had already nocked arrows to their bowstrings .   steve held himself motionless  hoping that no violence would begin .  next to him  marcia gasped slightly .  he saw now just how arrogant and quick to anger the mongols could be toward the chinese .   after several moments  the gate opened with a creak .  a single chinese sentry drew it open  staring at the mongols fearfully .  timur rode forward  as did the man holding the torch  and stopped right in front of the open gateway .      our friends must return to their inn     timur said with cold authority .     tomorrow i may return through this gate to visit with them again .  when i do  i will want to hear that all has gone well for them .      the sentry nodded quickly .   still looking down at him  timur waved steve and marcia forward .   steve rode carefully  glancing at marcia to make sure she was coming with him .  they passed without a word through the arched gate .  on the other side  steve turned .      thank you  timur     he called in mongol .     good evening to you all .         farewell .     timur waved once  then turned his mount and trotted away in the torchlight of his companion .  the other mongols rode after him  and they all vanished quickly into the darkness .   the sentry sighed loudly  letting his shoulders sag  and closed the gate again .   steve reached into his pouch for a coin .  timur   s warning to the sentry would probably carry a great deal of weight  but a modest token of generosity would not hurt  either .  he tossed a coin to the sentry  who fumbled for it with a surprised look and then had to pick it up off the ground .  the sentry gave him a nod of thanks .   as the sentry hurried back up inside the watchtower  steve rode toward the inn .  the stable was dark  the hostler had either gone to bed or was hiding .  steve hung up the paper lantern where he had found it .      wait a minute     said marcia  following him reluctantly .     we can   t go back to the same inn .         hunter  steve and marcia here     steve said quietly .     where are you .         here     said hunter aloud  stepping out from behind one corner of the inn .  he held the reins to his tired mount and jane   s  as well .     i am relieved to see that you are both well .  i continued to receive your transmission  so i knew you were coming back safely .         but now what are we going to do .     marcia asked .     i   m so tired .         so are all the horses     said steve .     they   re probably ready to drop .         the inn is unsafe     said hunter .     the people who have now kidnapped three of us may still be able to return tonight .         that   s right     said marcia .      yeah  that makes sense     said steve .     so let   s go back to my original idea   use the sphere to follow wayne and ishihara back to khanbaliq .         can we .     marcia asked hopefully .      why not .     steve said .     we can get a good night   s sleep .         i like the sound of that     said marcia  smiling weakly .     i   m really cold .  and i hurt from all the riding .  i   d love to skip the ride back .         i do not like the sound of it     said hunter firmly .     we must ride .         why .     steve asked .     if we jump back  we won   t have to worry any more about a bunch of guys who were last seen riding off north of the great wall in the dark .  and wayne won   t have an advantage over us after all .  tomorrow morning  we   ll be right back in the search for mc   .         we must return the horses to the city     said hunter .     so we must ride them .         that   s a two day advantage for wayne and ishihara     said steve .     not to mention that we don   t know where to spend the night .         i will protect you now from further harm     said hunter .     we will remain together .  we will not be surprised or overpowered again .         but what if wayne finds mc   during the next couple of days .     steve demanded .      we must return the horses     said hunter .     they cannot fit in the sphere with us safely .         you know we could be throwing away the entire mission     said steve urgently .      riding back is not ideal     said hunter .     of course i realize this .         look  we all got suckered into coming up here     said steve .     the polos never came this way at all .  wayne and ishihara have given themselves a free hand .         we bought the horses     said marcia .     why can   t we sell them here .         or even give them away     said steve .      we would be leaving a potentially serious change behind that we can prevent     said hunter .      hold it right there     said steve .     how serious can the horses be .         we cannot know     said hunter .     that fact is the crucial point .         well  then  as you like to say  what is the likelihood .  i don   t think it can be very great .         i disagree     said hunter .     horses are very important in this time .         i think i may regret this     said steve  with a sigh .     but would you explain exactly what harm we can do by selling our horses here .         if we leave ours here  they may provide transportation or additional income to people in this town who would not otherwise have had them .  conversely  we may at the same time deprive people in khanbaliq of those advantages .  we must return them to where we found them .         i was right     steve muttered .      about what .     marcia asked .      i do regret asking .         then you accept my argument .     hunter asked .      maybe not     steve said slowly .     it just doesn   t make sense to me .         it   s only four horses     said marcia thoughtfully .  she rubbed her folded arms harder .      hunter  horses are important here   but they   re also very common     said steve .     they   re everywhere .         that   s true     said marcia  with sudden enthusiasm .     in a society that uses horses all the time  they actually have somewhat less value than in our society .  in our own time  owning a horse is a luxury  either for the very wealthy or for people like steve  who live in a rural area where it   s affordable .  but in neither case is it a necessity .         that   s right     said steve .      i agree that the relative value is different in this society than in ours     said hunter .     however  within the context of this society  horses are expensive and important to the people who own them or need them .         well  yes     marcia said reluctantly .      you know we   ve proven that the ordinary changes we   ve caused don   t matter     said steve .     on previous missions  we bought weapons in port royal and abandoned them in panama .  we took fur cloaks and moved weapons in ancient germany  too .  in the soviet union  we caused guys in cars to drive around looking for us and use up gas .  we   ve already talked about how consuming food and water and air hasn   t changed anything important in our own time .  the horses just aren   t much bigger than the changes we   ve already made .         your list of our past changes is correct  but i judge these horses to be more important .  weapons and clothing were undoubtedly moved in large numbers even without us in morgan   s mission from jamaica to panama and in the battle of teutoburger wald .  the mechanical resources and fuel used in the battle of moscow also far outstripped the consumption we caused .  in each of those cases  our influence was subsumed by the larger events .  however  in this case  the effect of leaving our horses would stand alone .         debating with you is exhausting     said steve .     i see the logic in all the particulars .  but if i look at the whole picture  i   m just not convinced that moving four ordinary horses will matter in the long run .         i have no idea how these horses will spend the remainder of their lives     said hunter .     i do know that leaving them here might help someone here  or hinder someone in khanbaliq  at some indeterminate point in the future .         i can   t believe we   re arguing endlessly about this in the middle of the night on the edge of mongolia     said marcia .     where are we going to sleep .  and when .         why can   t we do what wayne did .     steve asked suddenly .     however he managed to do it .         what  exactly .     hunter asked .      we   ve already figured out that wayne has somehow rigged his belt unit to move him and ishihara in time without returning to the institute .         that is the case     said hunter .      well  can   t you adjust our unit the same way .     steve asked .     if wayne could do it  you must be able to .  then we can all return  even with the horses  because the sphere won   t be involved at all .         yes  i assume i can figure it out     said hunter .     however  i do not want to further develop time travel technology .  if humans gain wide use of it  they will do irreparable harm to themselves .         you mean that   s the only reason you haven   t done it already .     marcia asked in amazement .      yes .  the first law imperative .         i don   t get it .     steve sighed loudly .     hunter  the technology already exists  we agreed a long time ago wayne knows how to do it .         even so  the more this knowledge is confined  the better off humans will be .         hunter  look     steve said impatiently     the faster we grab wayne and mc    the better off humans will be .  how about that line of argument .         it is also logical .         good     said steve .     hunter  the time travel technology is going to be a problem no matter what we do tonight .  you acknowledge that .          yes  of course .         then suppose you figure out how to make us competitive with wayne now  and we worry about how to handle the secret of time travel after we   ve finished our missions .         this has some logic  too     said hunter .      now that wayne has a two day head start on us  i   d say it   s extremely logical .         all right .     hunter said nothing more  remaining completely motionless .              what   s wrong .     marcia asked  staring at hunter   s immobile form .      i don   t think anything is wrong     said steve .  he understood that if a robot paused long enough for humans to notice  it meant he had a substantial amount of data to process .     he   s probably studying the design of the sphere and the belt unit .  then he has to figure out what changes to make .         yes     said hunter .     i see how to do it now .  however  i require several minutes  at least  to alter the belt unit .  i suggest you dismount  as well .  moving the horses with you on them is potentially dangerous .         that   s true     said steve .     we don   t want them falling on us .     he dismounted .  until now  he had remained mounted in case they were going to continue riding .   marcia did so  as well  and hugged herself with both arms .     i   m really cold .      hunter also dismounted and gave his reins to steve .      we   ve had two very long days     said steve .  he watched hunter as the robot opened the belt unit .   the shape of hunter   s right index finger stretched and reformed itself so that the end became a very finely shaped tool .  then he worked with it on the intricate insides of the unit .  in less than a minute  he closed the unit and returned his finger to its normal shape .      you finished already .     steve asked .      yes  but i must test it first on myself .         wait a minute     said steve .     you mean you   re going without us .         not to khanbaliq .         huh .  where are you going  then .         i will simply jump about ten meters and half a minute into the future .  please remain where you are .     hunter walked a short distance away from steve and marcia .     the range of field may have changed without my realizing it .  i want to make sure you are not carried with me .      steve watched as hunter vanished .  for a long moment in the waning moonlight  steve and marcia stood silently holding the reins of their horses .  a slight breeze rustled the trees .   then hunter appeared ten meters away  stumbling to catch his balance .      it worked     said marcia  with obvious relief .     are you okay  hunter .         i am fine     said hunter  as he walked toward them .     however  i will take the horses to khanbaliq first .  if they stumble or fall  i will have the best chance to avoid them .  then i will return for you .         okay .     steve held out his reins .     what time are we jumping to .         just one minute forward .  that way  you will have time to get plenty of sleep .     hunter took the reins of all four horses and led them away from steve and marcia .         and where are we going .     marcia asked .     i mean  will we land outside the city again .  and have another long ride back to the inn .         no .  i recall a small stand of trees at the city market  not far from the inn by horseback ride .  at this hour  i expect no one to be on the street there .         good     said marcia  yawning .   hunter and the animals vanished .   then  almost instantly  hunter reappeared .      that was quick .     steve grinned .      not to me     said hunter  walking up to them .     all the horses stumbled but did not fall .  no one saw us arrive .  i took the time to see that no one was coming from any direction  and to tie them to a tree .  we will return only a moment after i left  again unseen by others .         sounds great to me     said steve .  he yawned  too .     now .         now     said hunter .     jane slept most of that first day back in the village near khanbaliq .  after the exhausting night out on the road by the great wall  she slept soundly even in the room with wayne and ishihara .  on waking  she found wayne gone but ishihara sitting on the floor by the door of the room .   as soon as she stirred  the robot looked at her .      how long have i been asleep .     jane asked  sitting up .  she stretched .  the air in the room was hot and stuffy now  she had been sweating in her sleep .      eight hours  seventeen minutes  and twelve seconds     said ishihara .      so  i guess it must be the middle of the afternoon by now  huh .         yes .         tell me where wayne is .         he rose about an hour ago .  i believe he was hungry .  he is somewhere in the village .         look  i need a trip to the latrine and i   m hungry  too .  you know these are first law concerns  even if it   s not an emergency yet .  what can you do about them .         i will make sure you have all your necessities     said ishihara .     i must escort you  however .  i have been instructed not to let you leave .         well  at the moment  that will do .  i also want some water to wash up a little .         come with me .      jane followed ishihara outside .   in the shade near the door  a number of elderly villagers glanced up at her curiously as they threshed rice in small  hand held wicker strainers .   ishihara paused .     food  please  for her .      an old woman nodded and got up .  she hurried inside the house .  the others returned to their work .      she will need a few minutes to prepare it .         yeah  okay .      ishihara led her to the latrine and then to the village well  where he raised a bucket of cool water for her .      you may wash in it safely     said ishihara .     do not drink it unless it has been boiled .  some water inside has already been boiled for wayne .         all right .         i wish i had my change of clothes     jane muttered .     and a hairbrush .      ishihara said nothing .   when jane had washed her face and hands  and smoothed out her hair with her fingers  she glanced around .  some small children were running and laughing together as they played  others had stopped to stare at her .  she smiled at them  then looked out at the fields surrounding the village  where she saw older children and adults working .      where can i eat .     jane asked .      this way .      ishihara led her back into the house where she had slept .  this time  they went back into the kitchen area  where the old woman squatted on a stone hearth .  she stirred something sizzling in a pot that hung over the fire on a hook .   jane moved closer and saw strips of meat and chopped greens sizzling in hot oil .  she could not identify the meat or the vegetable by looking at them  though .  she decided that perhaps she would rather not know .  the food smelled good enough .      the villagers consider us all honored guests     ishihara said quietly .     the food they prepare for us is better than what they normally eat .         i suppose that   s more meat than they usually eat .     jane nodded .     are we harming the village .  what if they need more food later  maybe during the winter .         i have considered this     said ishihara .     we must not stay here for long .      the old woman picked up a wooden bowl and used a long handled wooden ladle to dish out the food .  then she placed a pair of chopsticks across the top of the bowl and held it up for jane .      thank you .     jane accepted it .   the old woman nodded soberly and turned away .      it   s hot in here     jane said to ishihara .     can i eat outside .         yes .      ishihara led her back outside .     is this cool enough .      the elderly villagers were still threshing rice .  after brief glances up at ishihara and jane  they looked away again quickly .  they still had a great deal of unthreshed rice .      i think we make them uncomfortable .  is there some shade somewhere else .         yes .  you can sit under some trees on the west side of the village .      jane nodded and followed ishihara again .  around the corner of the building  she saw wayne sitting under one of the trees .  an empty bowl similar to hers lay on the ground near him  with chopsticks angling out of it .   ishihara stopped suddenly and looked back toward the dirt path leading through the fields toward the front of the village .  jane looked in the same direction .  a small figure was riding up the path on a donkey .         it is xiao li     said ishihara .      did you say it   s xiao li .     wayne got to his feet and looked  too .     hunter and his team couldn   t have come back with him  could they .         i thought hunter would take care of him  but i hear only the donkey .  he is alone .         i hope so     said wayne .      i guess he must be okay     said jane .     i   m relieved .     she picked up the chopsticks and began eating where she stood .     ishihara  shouldn   t you check on him .         yes .      by this time  the elderly villagers had also seen the boy .  a couple of them left their threshing to meet him .  ishihara hurried after them .   wayne remained next to jane .      don   t worry     she muttered between mouthfuls .     i still can   t outrun ishihara .  besides  i don   t have anywhere to go now .  and i   m hungry .         you get enough sleep .         yeah .      wayne nodded .   over on the path  ishihara lifted xiao li down from his donkey .  the boy smiled and tolerated the questions of the two villagers who come to greet him .  one escorted him inside  the other took the reins of his donkey .      weren   t they mad     jane asked     when you and ishihara came back without him .         no .  they asked about him  but they don   t seem to want to challenge what we do .     wayne hesitated .     i think that would change if we actually hurt someone .  but i thought hunter would find him .         your judgment isn   t that good     said jane  seeing a chance to raise some doubt in his mind .     neither is ishihara   s  obviously .  this whole situation could get out of hand .      ishihara returned to them .     the boy seems to be all right .  he said that he slept by the side of the road last night and then rode all day to come home .         you could have caused extreme harm to him     jane said sternly .     your sense of the first law is very poor .  so is your overall judgment of human behavior and your reliance on hunter when you didn   t know if hunter had even caught up to him .         don   t listen to her     wayne ordered .     if xiao li is okay  then you have not violated the first law .  she just wants to sabotage your efficiency .         you have no efficiency     jane declared .     think about it  ishihara .  think about the danger this boy was in  traveling that open road by himself .         i   ll have him lock you up alone     wayne warned her .     if you   d rather enjoy the fresh air  then shut up .      jane shut up .  she had already used her strongest arguments .  however  she knew that ishihara might not respond to them .  since xiao li had demonstrably survived his ordeal  wayne was right  neither ishihara nor hunter had technically violated the first law .      it   s too late to go into khanbaliq today     said wayne curtly to ishihara .      what is our plan .     ishihara asked  with unusual stiffness in his manner .   jane knew  then  that her comments had at least forced ishihara to feel some doubt about his actions toward xiao li .      we still have a good head start on hunter     said wayne brusquely .     maybe a long head start  if he stays up near the great wall looking for all of us .  we   ll spend this evening in the village and get another night   s sleep here .  tomorrow morning  we   ll look for mc   .              steve woke up the next morning in his room in the inn back in khanbaliq .  he had not managed a full night   s sleep  but he had rested enough to get on with the search for mc   .  as before  hunter waited outside as he and marcia dressed and washed .  then for breakfast they returned to the same stall they had visited on their first morning in the city .   steve and marcia again bought bowls of steaming rice gruel and plates of meat and vegetables to drop into the rice .  they sat down at one of the long wooden tables  away from other patrons .  steve ate hungrily .   next to him  hunter stood by the end of their bench and looked up and down the street over the heads of the people eating at the nearby tables .  steve glanced up from his bowl and  as before  saw people from many lands crowding the street .  they reminded him that marco polo really was around here somewhere .      see anything interesting .     steve asked .  he was just making conversation  he knew very well that hunter would announce any sighting of significance .      i recognize many of the people i saw at this hour on our first morning .  i conclude they are living a regular routine  but this is irrelevant to our immediate goals .         well  what about those goals .     marcia asked  between mouthfuls .     i   d feel much more comfortable if we could rescue jane .         i feel responsible for her     said hunter .     however  i know that ishihara will not let her come to harm .  in contrast  we are racing wayne to locate and apprehend mc   .  that search remains more urgent .         we don   t have to repeat this whole line of argument again  do we .     steve shook his head .     wayne wants us to be distracted by jane   s kidnapping .  that alone should tell us that searching for her is not in our best interest .         i accept your logic     said hunter .     if i develop the slightest reason to believe that she might be in danger  however  the first law will alter my priorities .         okay  understood     said steve .     and i just realized something else that   s important here   jane   s presence will actually help us  since ishihara is now forced by the first law to protect two humans .         that   s true     said marcia .     she   ll either be with them both  or wayne will have to leave her imprisoned somewhere .  i wonder what ishihara would do then .         my own interpretation of the first law would require me to remain with her     said hunter .     i would judge wayne more capable of taking care of himself than a human who was held against her will .         wouldn   t you want to keep them together .     steve asked .     so you could protect both humans .  come to think of it  wouldn   t you insist .         that   s right     said marcia .     you behave that way to some degree with us .         ideally  we would remain together     said hunter .     however  i cannot guarantee exactly what interpretation of the first law ishihara will make .         i think that if we search for mc    we may very well come across all three of them     said steve .     and if we just get mc   first  we can save jane after that .         we have already discussed the heart of this matter     said hunter .     i agree that our search for mc   should lead us to jane .         then what   s our plan of action .     steve asked .      our original plan  of finding marco polo  is still good     said hunter .     we allowed ourselves to be fooled  and i share responsibility for how easily we were drawn out of khanbaliq .  even so  our goal remains sound .         well  as far as i know  he   s here at home somewhere     said marcia .      wherever that is     said steve .     but instead of just asking around  and letting wayne and ishihara sucker us again  we should think of a more reliable way of finding him .         we could go to the imperial palace of kublai khan     said marcia .     someone there   probably lots of people   must know where he lives .         lots of people .     steve asked .      servants  mostly .  couriers who take messages back and forth   that kind of thing .      steve nodded .     makes sense .         i prefer not to risk that     said hunter .     any involvement on our part with the palace is more likely to alter the future significantly than our dealings with common citizens .  i want to avoid the palace if we can accomplish our goals without going there .         okay  what do you suggest .     steve leaned back from his empty bowl .      perhaps some of the other foreign dignitaries or traders will know the residence of marco polo     said hunter .     we certainly have many of them to ask .  marcia  what do you think .  will they cooperate .         it   s possible .     marcia shrugged .  she  too  had finished her breakfast .     it   s as good as asking people on the street at random .  i would suggest that you do the asking  however  in your role as a fellow foreign trader .         i understand     said hunter .     all right .  i will make this attempt .         let   s stay right here     steve said to marcia .     after all  we belong to the conquered people .  maybe he   ll do better without us .         good point     said marcia  with a trace of surprise in her voice .   steve grinned .     well  i   m learning .      steve and marcia watched hunter walk out to the street .  as usual  he towered over everyone around him .  hunter let the chinese pass him .  steve saw him stop two men with dark curly beards and speak to them briefly .      where are they from .     steve asked .      persia  i would say by their clothes .      steve nodded  still watching hunter .   the two men shook their heads and continued on their way down the street .   hunter glanced around and approached a man in a long  colorfully embroidered robe .  this man listened but did not stop walking .  he merely shook his head and hurried past .      how about that guy .     steve asked .      maybe a turk .  i   m not sure .         hey  what about these two .     steve nodded toward two other men whom hunter had stopped .  both men were tall  with black hair and long  angular faces with carefully trimmed black beards .  they wore white turbans and long  flowing robes .  as one stood by impatiently  the other nodded and pointed with one arm .      arabs     marcia said firmly .      i guess they know something     said steve .   after a moment  hunter nodded and the two arabs walked on their way .      come on .     steve got up and led marcia over to hunter .     well .  did they know where to find him .         i have directions to the residence of marco polo .  the man who pointed is a trader .  in the course of his business  he has met marco polo and was once a guest briefly at his home .  he does not know if marco polo is present today .         we obviously should have done this the first time     said steve .      i had no idea it would be this easy     said marcia .     this is embarrassing .         if we had begun this way  wayne might have also altered his plan to send us up to the great wall     said hunter .     we did not make a simple mistake before  we were deliberately misled .  however  the house of marco polo is nearby .         lead on     said steve .   hunter took them at a brisk walk down the crowded street toward the center of the city .  the imperial palace rose above the other buildings in this area .  hunter saw that under the hot and unrelenting morning sun  steve and marcia were sweating heavily .  he slowed down .   after several blocks  hunter turned right along a smaller street .  here  tall trees lined the street  shading it from the sun .  high walls of painted brick hid the houses from view except for their roofs  visible through treetops within each compound .  the roofs were made of glazed tile that shone in the sunlight .      this is it     hunter said .  he stopped at double doors set into a round archway in the wall .  this wall was white  the doors were red .  a small brass bell hung on the hook to one side of the doors .      the home of marco polo     marcia said quietly  looking up at the roof beyond the treetops .     wow .      steve smiled .  ever since hunter had been kidnapped  marcia   s manner had been looser   more spontaneous and less stuffy .  he realized that he had actually come to like her .   hunter rang the little bell .      we have to remember which languages to use     marcia reminded them .      correct     said hunter .     you two should not reveal that you can understand italian  if he uses it .  i will use it with him to make what i expect will be a positive impression .  we can all speak mongol with him .         won   t he wonder how you learned it .     steve asked .     i mean  supposedly  marcia and i live in this empire  but you   re from somewhere else .         i will explain that i learned mongol on my journey here .      the sound of a small door opening and closing reached them from beyond the wall .  steve heard footsteps on stone coming toward them .      the servants could be chinese  right .     steve asked .     but then  how could he communicate with them .         maybe they aren   t     said marcia .      i will try mongol with the first servant     said hunter .     they must be bilingual if not multilingual .  the question will be which languages they speak .      the red door opened .  a tall  slender man with graying hair bowed perfunctorily and studied hunter carefully  appraising his robes  he gave steve and marcia only a quick glance .  however  he said nothing  waiting for hunter to speak first .      he   s chinese  isn   t he .     steve muttered .   marcia nodded .      i am hunter  a trader from europe     hunter said in mongol .     i arrived recently and would like to speak with the venetian marco polo .  is he here .      the servant looked at steve and spoke in chinese .     you can translate for your friend .  what does he want .         i speak chinese     said hunter  in that language .  he repeated his request to see marco polo .      please wait .  i will return shortly .     with a deeper bow this time  the servant closed the door again and hurried back to the house at a brisk walk .      well  he must be here     said steve .     otherwise  the servant could have told us he wasn   t .         now the big question is whether he   ll see us     said marcia .   a moment later  the door of the house opened and closed again .  the servant   s footsteps tapped quickly on the stones as he hurried back .  this time he drew both doors open  bowing deeply as he moved out of their way .      welcome  welcome .  please come in .      hunter entered first .  steve waited for marcia to go next  but she shook her head tightly .  he followed hunter and marcia came in behind him .  the servant closed the doors behind her .   the grounds were covered by a small  grassy lawn shaded by the trees they had seen over the wall .  a leafy hedge lined the inside of the wall .  a walk of precisely cut stones led to the front door .   the house itself had been constructed of wood  now painted white .  the front door stood in the center  with precisely matched windows on each side  the entire building  down to every detail  was bilaterally symmetrical .  long  white curtains fluttered in the open windows .   the servant hurried from behind marcia to beat hunter to the front door .  he flung it open and stepped aside  bowing again as his guests entered .  another servant  a young woman with long braids  held the door inside  also bowing .   the servants led them through a foyer into a large sitting room .  large tables of chinese rosewood  small ones of black lacquer  and rosewood chairs lined the room .  the chairs were padded with embroidered silk cushions  porcelain vases on the tables held green plants or flowers .  chinese landscape scrolls hung on the walls .   a european man of average height entered .  he had curly brown hair and a neatly trimmed matching beard  and he wore a plain blue chinese robe .  steve judged him to be in his late thirties .      welcome     he said in formally in italian .     i am marco polo .  do you understand italian .         yes     hunter responded in that language .     i am hunter  a trader .  my companions are close friends .         welcome     polo said to steve and marcia in chinese  with a slight bow .      thank you     said steve  bowing .  in the rear of the house  he could hear other footsteps and muffled conversation .  obviously  polo employed many servants .   next to him  marcia also bowed but said nothing .   switching back to italian  polo added     i am not fluent in chinese  but i have picked up a few words .         you have done very well here     said hunter .      by your accent  you are not italian     polo said to hunter .     where are you from .         switzerland .         switzerland .  i have heard it is beautiful there .  my travels never took me that direction .      steve glanced quickly at marcia .  he did not recall hunter discussing this detail of his role .  she did not react  so steve decided that hunter knew what he was doing .      however  i have traveled a great deal     said hunter .     i have not been home for many years .         have you been to venice .  can you bring me news of my home city .         i can tell you a little .      for the first time  polo smiled broadly .     excellent .  please sit down .      steve waited for hunter to move first .  hunter accepted a large rosewood chair .  a small black lacquered table inlaid with abalone shell separated it from a matching chair that polo took .  steve and marcia then sat down on a small couchlike seat with a straight  uncomfortable back .   polo turned to the servants  who were standing attentively to one side .     cha  dian xin .      the servants bowed and hurried away .      he knows more chinese words than you thought     steve whispered .  polo had ordered tea and the brunch more commonly known in cantonese as dim sum at home in their own time .      so tell me about venice     polo said in italian .     is it still the premiere city in italy .         it is proud and splendid     said hunter     the finest city in all of europe .         and venetian galleys still sweep the mediterranean of pirates .         yes .         i   m glad .  i left when i was still young .  my father and uncle are jewelers .  they live in this neighborhood  too .         how did your family first come here .         my father and my uncle had a house in soldaia  on the black sea .         that city has an entire colony of italian merchants  doesn   t it .         yes .  you   ve been there  i take it .         no     hunter said .     i have heard of it .         oh .  well  it is a fine city  though not the equal of venice   and certainly not the city that khanbaliq is .      steve relaxed  leaning back in his seat as hunter and polo discussed more events in venice .  he sneaked glances at marcia  who did not react outwardly in any way .  steve realized that hunter was using the information he had accessed from the mojave center library to convince polo that he knew venice .           polo paused in the conversation as the servants hurried into the room with a big brass tray holding a porcelain teapot and four cups .  steve saw that hunter followed polo   s lead and did not speak .  the servants poured tea for everyone and handed them the small cups .      is the tea to your liking .     polo asked .     the food will take a little longer  i fear .         it is excellent tea     said hunter .   polo glanced at steve and marcia and spoke in chinese .     good .         very good     said steve .   marcia nodded  smiling .      well  where was i .     polo said  speaking italian again .     my father and uncle journeyed from soldaia to the land of the golden horde when i was a child .         much of modern russia     marcia whispered almost inaudibly to steve .      from that land  they came here to see kublai khan     polo continued .   hunter nodded  sipping his tea .      when the khan heard of our religion  he asked them to return home and have the pope send a hundred men learned in christianity back with them  along with oil from the sacred lamp at the sepulchre in jerusalem .         really .     hunter asked politely .     where were you during this time .         i was still in my youth .  however  when my father and uncle returned  they invited me to travel back to china with them .         i see .         we took a couple of friars   the pope would not send a hundred   and some oil and started our journey .     polo smiled and shook his head .     the friars turned back out of fear  and we could not stop them .  but we brought the oil  and we have been in the khan   s empire ever since .      steve took a deep breath and fought his impatience .  this was mildly interesting  but accomplished nothing he could see .  as polo and hunter continued to talk  he whispered to marcia in chinese .      why doesn   t hunter get to the point .     he spoke into her ear  still watching polo and hunter .      this kind of slow exchange to get acquainted is part of business in this era     she whispered back .     in fact  as a social mannerism  it lasts largely up to the middle of the twentieth century .         what   s going on .         business is very personal in this time .  certainly polo knows hunter came to ask for a favor  and he wants to get a sense of who the stranger is before he asks what hunter wants .  and hunter seems to know this .         why doesn   t polo ask first what hunter wants  and then decide if he wants to help .         that   s considered rude .         oh .         we   ll just have to wait .         if polo continues to do most of the talking  though  i don   t see what he can learn about hunter .     steve straightened again and listened to hunter and polo .      i have told my friends here a great deal about europe and the lands between here and there     said hunter  nodding toward steve and marcia .      kublai khan is the greatest man of our time     said polo .     possibly of any time .         don   t buy it     marcia whispered to steve in chinese .     polo never saw the large picture .      steve remembered that when marcia had first briefed the team  she had told them how the money had been devalued several times because the economy was poor .  he also recalled that most serious crimes received the death penalty .  this empire appeared prosperous  but economic mismanagement and rule by fear underlay life here .   the servants entered again  this time carrying two brass trays with dishes of steaming dumplings and noodles .  they set the trays down on a large table and placed individual servings on small plates with chopsticks .  then they brought the servings to everyone .   hunter and polo resumed their conversation in italian .      smells familiar     steve whispered to marcia .     it even looks the same as in our time .         much of the dim sum has been unchanged for centuries     said marcia .      wait a minute .  how do you know .     steve grinned .     food doesn   t keep that long .         old recipes are still on record     said marcia .  she paused to blow on a hot dish .     some dishes appear in paintings  relief sculpture  and book illustrations .         well  here   s the real proof .     steve paused to eat .      i   m fascinated just by meeting marco polo     said marcia softly .     i just .  .  .         what .         i wish i could tell him about his book .      steve glanced over at polo and hunter .  polo was listening to hunter   s story of their travels .  maybe they were making progress .      what do you mean .     steve whispered .     what do you want to tell him .         i wish i could tell him that after he returns to italy  when the genoese capture him in a war  not to worry .  and that he   ll tell stories of his travels in prison to a writer who sets it all down .         he does it in prison .         yes  as a prisoner of war .  and i would warn him that much of what he says won   t be believed in his own time  or for many years afterward  but that it will finally become a timeless classic .         but you can   t .  it might influence him in the wrong way  somehow .  as hunter would say  then everyone who ever read his book might be a little different  too .  the changes could really add up .         i know .        jane walked through the streets of khanbaliq between wayne and ishihara .  wayne had wanted to leave her behind in the village  but ishihara  under the imperative of the first law  had refused to leave her with the villagers .  now wayne and ishihara were searching again for mc   .   many of the villagers had accompanied them to khanbaliq this morning .  some tended their market stall  but others had taken time away from the fields to visit the city with the good spirits who had come to their village .  wayne had sent the others to fan out around khanbaliq in search of mc    but xiao li had remained with them .   jane had been thinking about how to escape ishihara .  here  where some of the blocks were relatively crowded  she could probably dart away suddenly and have some chance of losing herself in the crowd .  since he could not risk harming her  the idea of trying to escape had become more attractive now that they were back in khanbaliq in daylight instead of out in the forest at night .   however  she also saw several problems with this plan .  for one  she had nowhere to go .  she figured that hunter and the rest of the team were either looking for her back on the road to the great wall  or else they were riding back to khanbaliq .   even if hunter had decided to return to the sphere and come right back to khanbaliq  she had no idea where in the city the team was now .  the only meeting place they had used was the inn where they had spent the first night  but the team would not be waiting there at this time of day .  presumably  they would be out looking for her and mc   .   another problem was that she was so obviously a foreign visitor .  she expected that if she ran  wayne would order ishihara to shout to all the people on the street in chinese that she had to be captured .  since wayne was also of european descent  she supposed that onlookers would assume they were together .  for wayne   s purposes  any excuse to stop her would do  perhaps that she was crazed or drunk or even a thief .  she could not outrun everybody .   further  if her captors did not enlist the help of other people  the last problem was that ishihara would inexorably follow her .  she would gradually tire  while the sun replenished his solar converters with energy .  sooner or later  unless she had a safe haven very close  he would catch her again .   finally  after she had attempted to run away  ishihara would probably hold her arm continuously in the future .  that meant she realistically had only one chance .  in order to have a reasonable likelihood of success  she would have to wait until a particularly good opportunity developed .  the best chance would come if she saw hunter and the team somewhere on the street .     when polo had seen that all his guests were well fed  he invited them into his study .  steve  holding his teacup  followed polo and hunter with marcia at his side .  the male servant waited outside the room  ready to be summoned .   long wooden tables with intricately carved sides and legs lined the study .  all were cluttered with a variety of objects .  steve saw scrolls of paper  chinese ink sticks and brushes  and brass and porcelain bottles .      the empire of kublai khan is full of wonders     said polo .     hunter  look at this .     he lifted a long  narrow piece of blank paper and gently placed it over hunter   s open palms .     i suppose you think it   s a kind of parchment .      steve clenched his teeth together  fighting laughter .  marcia jabbed him in the ribs with her elbow .  he took a deep breath and hid his smile behind his teacup .   hunter looked at the paper closely  obviously pretending never to have seen it before .  he brushed his fingertips across the surface .  then  as though it was tremendously valuable  he held it out for polo to take back .      how is it made .     hunter asked .     it is clearly not parchment .         no .     polo laid the sheet back down on the table     paper is made from pulping certain kinds of plants .  the pulp is then suspended in a vat of water .  when the mix is just right  a screen is placed in it and pressed .  the pressing removes the water and makes it into these sheets .  they are excellent for writing and painting .         i have seen the chinese write with their brushes     said hunter .     instead of using quill pens .         in their language  the brush is very beautiful     said polo .     personally  i find it difficult to write the alphabet with it .  i have tried many of these things you see on the tables around us  just to get the feel of them .      hunter nodded .   marcia jabbed steve in the ribs again .   he looked at her in surprise .     what .     he whispered  mystified .      the paper and brush .         what about them .  i can   t write that way .         well  i can .  i practiced a little as part of my historical studies .  but you have to say something .         oh .     steve raised his voice and spoke in chinese .     hunter  she can demonstrate the brush for you and marco .         eh .     polo waited politely for hunter to translate .      may she show us .     hunter asked in italian .     i would like to see how the paper accepts the ink .         of course .     polo gestured for marcia to come forward .   steve sighed quietly .  all this polite posturing made him very impatient .  somewhere in the city  wayne and ishihara were dragging jane around with them and might be on the verge of finding mc   .   marcia dipped the end of a slender  black ink stick in a pan of water and began grinding it in a shallow stone bowl designed for the purpose .  she added more water from the pan and ground the stick again .  after only a moment  she selected a narrow brush from a bamboo cylinder and dipped it in the liquid .  the brush tip came out black .      watch closely     polo said to hunter .   marcia slowly wrote a straight  horizontal line .  below it  she wrote two  the bottom one longer than the other .  then she wrote a character with three horizontal lines .      even i recognize those     polo said with a smile .     the numbers one  two  and three .      steve saw that the character for    four    was more complex  it was a rectangle with two squiggles inside .   marcia wrote ten characters in all .  then she dipped the brush in the water pan  rinsed it  and laid it carefully across the ink bowl .  with a slight bow  she stepped back out of the way .      the characters have great beauty     said polo .     i believe she has simply written from one to ten .      hunter nodded  leaning over the paper .     this paper accepts the ink very well .  it must be much cheaper than parchment .  is it widely used .         yes .     polo picked up a large porcelain bowl of water .  a flat  narrow piece of metal with a point on one end floated on top of it .     hold this in your hand .      hunter took it .      now turn the bowl so that the arrow points a different direction .      hunter did so .      watch .      steve saw that the arrow  bobbing slightly  slowly turned to point north .  he suppressed a smile .  at first  he hadn   t recognized it as a compass .      what is the significance of this needle .     hunter asked politely .   steve knew very well hunter was still acting out his role .  beside him  marcia turned away to hide her own smile of amusement .  not laughing at polo had become a major challenge for both of them .      it always points north     said polo .     as travelers who have crossed uncountable miles  you and i know how helpful it could be .         yes  i see .     hunter gently laid down the bowl .      you told my servant that you arrived recently in khanbaliq .  these wonders are all new to you .         they exist only here  do they not .     hunter looked around at the other items on the long tables .     no one in europe has ever seen them .         that is true     said marco .     i hope to bring some of them back to venice someday .      hunter nodded noncommittally .      how can i help you .     polo asked .     do you need introductions here in the city  perhaps for your business .         i seek another foreigner  who goes by the nickname mc   .  he is a european  short and slight in stature .         what is his trade .      steve tensed  wondering what hunter would say .      we believe he is seeking a post with the government     said hunter .      ah  a civil servant .     polo nodded .     has he been in khanbaliq long .         no     said hunter .     a few days at most  but maybe even less .         i see .     polo turned to his servant in the doorway and spoke in heavily accented chinese .     see to it .      the servant bowed quickly and hurried away .   polo picked up a large porcelain bottle and pulled out the cork stopper .     of all the wonders in the khan   s empire  this is the most spectacular .     he poured some gray powder out of the bottle into a small stone dish .   steve looked at marcia  puzzled .     what did he mean when he told his servant to    see to it     about mc   .     he whispered in chinese .      i think the head servant will probably order some of the others to go to the palace or ask their other contacts in the city     said marcia .   the servant returned to the doorway .  polo pointed to the gray powder .  the servant bowed  then left again .   steve looked back at the substance in the dish .  he was fairly sure it was gunpowder .  when he glanced at marcia  she shrugged almost imperceptibly .   without speaking  polo cut a short piece of string from a roll with a small knife .  then he rolled the string in the powder until it was gray .  he pulled it out so that the string overhung the edge of the dish and then laid it down .   the servant returned with a burning candle in a brass holder .  polo took it from him .  then the servant returned to the doorway again .      watch carefully     said polo .   steve suppressed a smile and caught marcia   s eye .  she  too  was fighting a laugh .  hunter  of course  looked as though he had no idea what was about to happen .   polo lit the fuse .  it fizzed  sparked  and crackled .  the line of fire quickly moved into the dish  where the remaining powder burned as well .  marco set the candle down on the table and stepped back .   when the gunpowder had burned down  the servant came back into the room .  he leaned over the table to open a window  then picked up a small fan .  as polo moved out of his way  he waved the smoke toward the open window .      your companions are amused because this is old and familiar to them     said polo pleasantly .     but you must understand the power of this substance .  when tightly packed in a container  it explodes with great force .  when a hole for the release of the fire and smoke is provided  it can make the container fly up into the air .     he looked at hunter for his reaction .      indeed .     hunter said cautiously .      a container of this type can send fire many times farther than a burning arrow     marco said grimly .   hunter simply nodded .   steve realized that hunter did not want to enter a discussion about the potential of gunpowder .  anything he said could alter what polo would later write in his memoirs .  none of them dared react very much .      i  too  was shocked by the idea     said polo .     but you will get used to seeing many wonders here in this empire if you stay long .  come .  let us return to the sitting room .              steve took his seat again in the front room and accepted more tea  poured by the young woman servant .  marcia sat next to him  as before .  hunter and polo continued their talk about the wonders of kublai khan   s empire .   steve could still hear other servants in the back of the house .  meanwhile  the two servants who had already attended them carried away the leftover food .  moments later  they brought out more of the same   fresh and steaming .      i   m full     steve muttered in chinese to marcia .      it   s part of the courtesy here     said marcia .     food will be available as long as we keep eating it .  when we left the room  it wasn   t because we had finished but because our host wanted to show us around .      finally  as polo and hunter discussed politics within the far flung empire of the khan  the head servant came in with a younger chinese man  who was sweaty and breathless .  polo looked up .      yes .         xiao sung has information for your guests  sir     he said in mongol .      all right .  xiao sung  go ahead .      xiao sung took a deep breath and spoke in chinese .     i may have located him in the khan   s palace .         excellent .     polo turned to hunter .     even i understand that much chinese .         how do you know .     hunter asked .      i spoke to a courier whom master polo knows .  he works at the palace .  on the palace grounds  he saw a new courier  hired only a few days ago  who fits the description .         has he spoken to this new courier .     hunter asked .     mc   has a language problem here .  to my knowledge  he does not speak any of the prevailing languages  though he can learn languages quickly .         no  our acquaintance did not speak to this man     said xiao sung .     but many languages are used in khanbaliq .  if he is the man you seek  he may have been able to communicate with at least some foreign guests .         couriers who cannot gossip are in great demand     said polo .     they betray fewer confidences .  all they must do is deliver written messages or packages faithfully to the right location or individual .         a stranger can just arrive in the city and work in the palace of the khan .     hunter asked .     without references or introductions .         foreign arrivals have a better chance of working in the palace than the local chinese     said polo .     the chinese are considered a danger within the palace walls  since they are the conquered people here .  and because the number of foreign people who will come here cannot be predicted  they are often welcomed quickly into certain jobs .         i see     said hunter .      mc   could get the post of courier  but he will be closely watched during his first months on the job to see that he is reliable .  within the palace grounds  his movements will be severely restricted .  he will be assigned to accompany a trusted courier during this time  to learn his way around and to earn the trust of his superiors .         then we must learn if this new courier really is mc       said hunter .   polo frowned thoughtfully .     to your knowledge  could he be a danger of any kind to the khan .         no     said hunter .     in fact  if given the opportunity  he would risk his own well being to save the khan   s life .  but he might wish to gain the ear of the khan someday and offer some opinions .      polo laughed .     nearly everyone in the empire would love to have the khan   s ear for one reason or another .     he glanced at xiao sung .     is that all .         he has more  master     the head servant said politely .      oh .  please go on .         i must also inform you that a search for an evil spirit of the description of this man called mc   is already underway in the streets .         eh .     polo glanced at hunter .     my chinese is poor  but did he say that a search on the streets has already begun for this man .         yes     said hunter .     a business rival of mine also hopes to make contact with him .         ah .  i see .         supposedly  a couple of good spirits have come down from the sky to capture mc       said xiao sung .      what do they look like .     steve asked suddenly in chinese .      like foreigners     said xiao sung .     they resemble master polo and your friend  in a general way .      steve grinned and glanced at hunter .     yeah  that   s our business rival  playing games .  have they offered a reward for finding mc   .         no  sir     said xiao sung .     no reward is offered  but the more superstitious people in this part of the city are looking for him .         do you believe in evil spirits .     steve grinned at xiao sung .     does everybody .         of course  sir     said xiao sung  frowning in puzzlement .     but i do not confuse every foreign guest with visitors from the spirit world .         good     said steve .      would it be possible to receive a letter of introduction from you .     hunter asked .     i must go to the palace and see this new courier for myself .         i will do more than that     said polo .     several days ago  i reported to the khan on my most recent trip out to the provinces .  now i am taking a week or so to relax  which leaves me free today .  i  too  am curious about this mysterious stranger  so i will take you to the palace myself .         i am imposing on you     said hunter .      nonsense .  i will enjoy the walk .         then i am in your debt .      polo glanced up at this servants .     you will accompany us     he said in mongol .   the servants left the house first  followed by polo and hunter .  steve and marcia walked behind them .  the young woman servant followed  first closing the front door behind them and then the gate in the wall .      hunter is going to be worried even more about altering polo   s actions     steve said quietly .      that   s true .  well  polo was always welcome at court  so this isn   t likely to be too significant .     marcia took a deep breath .     i can hardly believe it .  i   m about to see the palace of kublai khan .  .        ishihara waited as wayne and jane took a break under a large tree on the edge of a city street .      look     said xiao li .     one of my cousins is running through the crowd toward us .     he pointed .   ishihara looked .  a young man from the village dodged around a peddler   s cart and stopped  breathing hard .     your friend has been seen .         where .     ishihara asked .   beside him  both wayne and jane tensed .      a man saw him deliver a message from the palace of the emperor to the home of a general  then return again .         what did he say .     wayne asked in english  impatiently .     does he know something .         he went to work in the palace     said ishihara in english .     the seat of power .         you will come .     the man looked back and forth between wayne and ishihara .     if an evil spirit is working in the court  he may cause harm for everyone .         he is not an evil spirit  remember     said ishihara .     he is merely a misguided spirit who belongs with us .  we will take him away from the court if someone will take us inside the palace grounds .         my mother   s cousin is a minor attendant to one of the princes in the court .  he will come to the gate if i ask the guard to call him .         can he let us in .     ishihara asked .      i believe so     the other man said slowly .     i have never tried before .         will we be stopped inside .     ishihara asked .     we cannot disturb the palace routine .         that   s right     said jane .     we can   t afford to cause any trouble  remember .         my mother   s cousin has often said that the palace grounds are like a separate city within khanbaliq .  thousands of bureaucrats  servants  and other workers do their daily duties inside the walls .         this is acceptable     said ishihara .     a few more people can get lost in the crowd during the day .  will you take us to the palace .         i am at your service .         good .         are we going .     wayne asked in english again .     can we get to mc   .         yes     said ishihara .     steve stared at the towering walls around the palace grounds as he drew near behind polo and hunter .  the grounds covered the equivalent of many city blocks  though steve could not judge how many from this perspective .  the walls rose up at least as high as the great wall .  sentries stood guard outside the closed gates .  when they recognized marco polo  however  they bowed and opened the gates without comment .   within the walls  the palace grounds were also laid out in the manner of a city .  broad walkways and large buildings lined up on a right  angle grid .  trees shaded the walks and the buildings .  marcia took his arm and pointed .      see that long building with the statues by the entrance and the wooden threshold .  by the architecture and the statues  i think that   s a temple of some kind .      steve nodded .     how about the other buildings .         i can   t be sure of most of them .  these buildings did not last into our time .  too many are made of wood  and they were replaced one by one as the centuries went by .     marcia looked to each side  then into the distance .  she pointed to a huge edifice topped by a roof of vermilion  yellow  green  blue  and red  shimmering in the sunlight .     the largest building is the palace itself .  in marco polo   s book  he says the palace is the greatest that ever existed .  he wrote that the largest hall can hold six thousand people at dinner .  the khan   s quarters are there  and those of his four wives .         yeah .         and the other buildings must house various bureaucratic offices .         i wonder if there   s any chance we could see kublai khan himself .      in front of them  polo and his entourage came to a halt .  polo spoke briefly to a young man in a long  black robe who bowed deeply and hurried away .  then polo turned to hunter with an amused smile .      i have been fortunate to enjoy the khan   s favor ever since we arrived here .  many of the attendants know me  that man recently passed the examinations necessary to enter government service .  he will speak to the chief of the palace couriers  and bring mc   to us .         thank you     said hunter .      it   s going to be that easy .     steve muttered to marcia .     hard to believe .         dr .  nystrom sent us on a long detour to the great wall .  i just hope jane   s all right .         of course she is  in ishihara   s company .     steve shrugged .     well  mc   isn   t here yet .  so our search hasn   t exactly succeeded .         come     polo said to hunter .     now we will sit down and wait .     he gestured forward  and his servants led the small entourage again .   this time the group walked to a shaded garden with a lawn and a hedge of flowering shrubs .  carved stone chairs surrounded a round table of matching stone .  the servants stood under a nearby tree  waiting patiently as the others sat around the table .      if we must wait long  i shall send for tea     said polo .  he leaned back in his chair .     what do you think of the palace grounds so far .         it is very impressive     said hunter .     efficiently laid out and well tended .      polo laughed lightly .     you have an odd way of speaking  my friend .  it is beautiful here  is it not .         yes     said hunter .      you know  in the spring       suddenly polo stopped talking  his eyes on a small group of people approaching them .     the khan .  do as i do .     polo leaped to his feet .  he bowed very low from the waist and held the position .     speak only if he bids you .  do not address him directly .  say     the khan     or the    great khan     as though you are talking about someone not here .      hunter rose and imitated polo precisely .   steve  startled  also got up and bowed  next to him  marcia did the same .  around them  the servants had reacted more quickly and also stood motionless in their position .  steve sneaked a glance at the khan .   the man who stopped in front of polo  frowning  had sharp  dark eyes and a ruddy complexion .  his long  narrow mustache and wispy beard were gray .  on his head  he wore a white cloth hat that angled down around his neck .  his plain white robe was held by a tasseled belt of gold braid .  of medium height  he was stout but not flabby .  four grim faced men in elaborate embroidered robes stood behind him .      marco  i did not know you were coming to the palace today .  why did you not have yourself announced to me .      polo did not move .     i did not wish to disturb the khan .         rise  marco .  your companions  as well .      polo straightened  his servants did so just a moment afterward .   steve and marcia also stood erect again .      i am always pleased to see you  marco     said kublai khan .     you have business here today .         i seek a new courier working in the palace     said polo .     my friend  here  is also from europe and wishes to speak with him .         ah .     kublai khan glanced at hunter without interest .     come tomorrow  marco .  we will visit over tea at midday .     he walked away  followed by his retainers .   polo bowed again .  the others followed his example once more .  when polo straightened  he grinned at them .      i am relieved that he is not angry because i failed to announce my presence .  i did not expect to see him today .         bowing is the acceptable response .     hunter asked .     what about kneeling and touching one   s forehead to the floor .  i heard this was the proper posture in the presence of the khan .         that is true if we are summoned to the throne room for a formal appearance     polo said .     here on the palace grounds  that is much too impractical .         i see .      marcia nudged steve   s arm and whispered in chinese  pointing surreptitiously .     that first guy marco spoke to is coming through the crowd with somebody .  is that mc   .      steve looked through the crowd .  he recognized mc    whose appearance was identical to that of the other component robots .  mc   had somehow acquired a plain black robe and black cloth shoes .      hunter     he said quietly .      i see him     hunter said  also in chinese .     remember  he does not know we are from his time or that we have come for him .  we must not reveal ourselves before we can apprehend him  or he will flee .         what are we going to do  then .     marcia asked .     we have too many witnesses here just to pounce and disappear with him   unless we want to wind up as a vanishing wonder in polo   s memoirs .         and we don   t have jane     said steve .   hunter switched back to italian .     i must speak to this man alone  outside the palace walls .  i hesitate to ask you for another favor  but can this be arranged .         i believe i may be able to help     said polo .     i will have to speak to        suddenly steve glimpsed jane through a crowd of people pursuing their daily business .     hunter     he interrupted quickly  in chinese .     look .     he jumped up and pointed through the crowd .  now he could see wayne and ishihara  too .      be cautious     said hunter .     we must get mc   away from witnesses and we cannot appear to be kidnapping him .  our other disappearance in front of local people during other missions occurred during and prior to battles  among people distracted by immediate  life threatening situations .  we cannot avoid being noticed here .         but we have to save jane     said marcia  standing up next to steve .     what are we going to do .         vanishing from court could alter the beliefs and expectations regarding religion and court policy  maybe even influence the khan himself     said hunter .     i cannot take that risk .        jane spotted hunter sitting in the shade in a small garden at a distance  between a european man and steve .  even through the crowd of people walking through the palace grounds between them  hunter was too big and distinctive to miss .  wayne and ishihara  on each side of her  had not seemed to see hunter .  however  she could not decide what to do .   a few moments before  ishihara had spotted mc   .  now he and wayne were walking quickly to catch him .  mc    wearing black  approached hunter  steve  and marcia in the company of a young man .  she could see that hunter must have arranged to have mc   brought to him  and she did not want to do anything that would interfere .      be ready     ishihara said .     we cannot just grab him and try to run out of the palace grounds .  we must apprehend him together and then instantly trigger the belt unit .      in another few moments of fast walking  however  jane saw that ishihara had almost come with an arm   s reach of mc   .      hold onto jane     wayne ordered .   ishihara took jane   s wrist .      hunter .     jane screamed as loud as she could .   hunter  steve  and marcia suddenly ran forward toward mc   .  at the same moment  ishihara pulled jane toward the component robot  with wayne next to her .  jane braced her feet against the paving stones under her  and bent her knees  pulling against ishihara .  her feet merely skidded on the stones  she did not slow him down noticeably .     steve ran toward mc    but he could see that ishihara nearly had a hand on the component robot already .  suddenly  however  mc   saw steve  marcia  and hunter charging toward him .  he first shoved his human companion  the other courier  out of the way  then mc   darted in the other direction .  even ishihara  reaching out with one hand  failed to grab him .      hunter  you get mc   .     steve shouted as he threw himself on ishihara .      get him .     jane called  pulling back harder on ishihara   s other arm .   steve collided bodily with ishihara and clung to him .     stop .  i order you to stop moving .  let go of jane .      ishihara neither released jane   s wrist nor spoke .  he grabbed the firmly tied sash of steve   s robe with his free hand and pulled .  steve lost his grip  stumbled  and fell to the ground .  he understood that some first law imperative had overrode his instructions to ishihara .   steve glanced over at hunter .  mc   had turned to flee  but hunter snatched him up off the ground and held him high  kicking and flailing .  steve scrambled to his feet .      stop struggling     steve ordered mc   in english .    keep quiet and don   t try to get away .      the small robot obeyed .  hunter set him on his feet again  but held one arm firmly in his grasp .  he turned toward jane .   wayne had halted in front of hunter  seeing that he was too late to get mc   .  ishihara still held jane   s wrist tightly as she struggled against him .  marcia had stopped  uncertain what she should do .      steve .     jane pleaded .   suddenly steve leaped forward  this time aiming at ishihara   s outstretched arm as jane pulled away from him again .  before steve made contact  however  he saw ishihara  jane  and wayne vanish .  he landed hard on the paving stones .   polo strode up quickly  speaking italian in a low  urgent tone .     what happened here .  where did they go .  what .  .  . happened .      steve looked up  glad he supposedly could not understand italian .   hunter and marcia said nothing .   a small crowd of people had surrounded them  gasping and murmuring .   polo glanced quickly back over his shoulder .     i do not know what this is about  but the khan saw this incident .  he is coming this way .  be very careful how you speak to him .      quickly  steve got to his feet .  marcia moved close to him .  hunter  still holding mc   in his arms off the ground  turned to look .  kublai khan and his small entourage hurried up in front of them .   steve bowed low from the waist again .  since the khan did not bid them to rise  or say anything else right away  he remained in that position .  so did polo and marcia .  hunter  as he held mc     s arm  also bowed and held the position  as did mc   .   all steve could see were the paving stones below him and the khan   s feet  in leather boots that curled up at the toe .  for a long moment  no one spoke or moved .  suddenly steve wondered if they would all lose their heads .      what is this magic .     the khan finally demanded in mongol .     marco  who were those foreigners who disappeared .  who has cast spells here in my presence .      steve thought he could detect an element of fear in the khan   s voice  but if so  it was very subtle .      i do not know     said polo .      rise  all of you .  i want to see your faces .      steve straightened  his heart pounding .  before  all the jumps in time had either taken place away from local people  or else had happened in the middle of chaotic situations where other people   s attention had been diverted .  if any situation could change history  though  he suspected that having marco polo and kublai khan witness a disappearance into time might do it .   kublai khan looked up into hunter   s eyes .     stranger  explain this .      hunter said nothing .   startled  steve looked at him in amazement .  always before  hunter had offered an effective response to any difficult situation .  steve realized that for hunter  refusing to answer meant that he could not think of anything to say that he considered safe under the three laws of robotics .   polo nudged hunter with his elbow .      i have no explanation     said hunter in mongol .   the khan glared at him  then turned to steve .     speak .      steve swallowed .  he had no idea what to say  either .     i  uh           may i speak .     marcia spoke softly .      speak     said kublai khan  turning to her with a piercing gaze .      we seek evil spirits that tried to infiltrate the great khan   s court .         eh .  evil spirits .      marcia nodded .      marco  what do you know of this .         nothing     said polo .     but i was told this small fellow in hunter   s grasp would do anything to protect you .         why are you holding him like this .     the khan asked hunter .      he is a good spirit who has lost his way     marcia said quickly .     he would never let harm come to his khan  but we must return him to his home .         you bring spirits and magic within my walls without telling me .     kublai khan glared at each of them in turn .      we feared the khan would not believe our story     said steve .      that is correct     said hunter .     we had hoped to handle this matter without disturbing the khan .         i have just seen three people disappear with my own eyes     said kublai khan .     until now  i would not have believed this .         we are dealing with good spirits     said marcia .     but i suggest that neither marco nor the khan speak of this .         no .     kublai khan studied her carefully .      what about everybody else .     steve asked her quietly .      i don   t believe the others will matter .         marco  what is your opinion of this .     kublai khan turned to him .      i have seen many wonders since i entered the khan   s empire     said marco .     many would not be believed back in venice .  this is another one of those .         i will not have anyone think i have gone mad     said kublai khan .     however  that includes your friends .     he turned to marcia again .     why should i believe you .  how do i know this is not some elaborate game  conducted to make a fool of me .         we can prove our claim to your satisfaction .     she glanced at hunter .     we can do what those spirits did .      hunter nodded acknowledgment .  still holding mc     s arm  he slipped his other hand inside his robe .  he waited  watching marcia .   steve got the idea .     if we prove to marco and the khan that we are dealing in spirits and possess magic  will the khan accept our advice not to discuss this matter or act on it in the future .         if you confer with good spirits and prove your magic  i will accept your advice     said kublai khan .      so will i     said polo .      okay  hunter .     steve grinned at him .      we must step away from them     said hunter .  he backed away from polo  drawing mc   with him .   steve and marcia moved to his side .   polo turned .  standing only a step away from the khan and his entourage  he looked at hunter with a puzzled expression .  none of them spoke .      good bye  marco polo     marcia said softly in mongol .     farewell  great khan .  i was honored to meet both of you .      as polo glanced toward her  the scene vanished .     once again  steve felt the hard  curved interior surface of the sphere in room f    under him .  he and marcia slid against each other in the blackness .  then hunter opened the sphere and helped them both climb out .      get out     steve said to mc   .     don   t shut off your hearing or go anywhere .      r .  daladier still stood by the door .     dr .  nystrom and ishihara have not been back here .      hunter nodded .     thank you .  please continue your assignment here until further notice .         agreed .         it feels weird not to have jane with us     said steve .     and what about disappearing in front of marco polo and kublai khan .  what if we did change history this time .         we will not know for a while yet     said hunter .     i can see that the sphere and this room are unchanged .         that   s something  anyway .     steve nodded .     i   m ready to go find jane anytime .         you still need a good night   s rest before our next mission     said hunter .      i feel okay .     steve shrugged .      in any case  i will have to prepare more vaccinations and hire a new historian     said hunter .     for now  you and marcia should change your clothes .         i   ll go first     said marcia .  she picked up her regular clothes and went into the other room .      i am concerned about jane  also     said hunter .     however  i trust we will all meet again on our next mission to find mc   .  we will prepare for it in the same way as the others .  i will make the arrangements and you will have some time to rest  eat well  and relax .         i won   t relax too well this time     said steve .     but i   ll be ready .      by the time steve had taken his turn to change  hunter had arranged for a security vehicle to take the team and mc   back to mc governor   s office .  steve instructed mc   to come with them  and they rode through the quiet streets of mojave center .  no one spoke .  from past experience  steve knew that hunter was monitoring news reports to make sure that no explosion had destroyed beijing and find out if and where another nuclear explosion had occurred .   in mojave center governor   s office  hunter closed the door and turned to steve .      please instruct mc   to merge with the others .      steve pointed to the figure standing in the corner .  the first four component robots stood merged there .     join with them     he said to mc   .     then remain motionless here  just like the other component robots now are .      the small robot walked over to them .  in a slow  slithering motion  his shape became fluid and he merged with the other figure .  now it nearly resembled the large  humanoid shape of mojave center governor .      we are doing well     said hunter .     we have only one more piece of the puzzle to find .         you must have checked the news by now     said steve .     did we really get away with vanishing in front of marco polo and kublai khan .         in my monitoring of the news  i have not detected any sign of change in our world     said hunter .     and mojave center appears to be the same as before .  that is only a superficial review  of course .  i am also accessing historical references in the city library as we speak .  so far  they confirm my initial conclusion .         i think we got away with it     said marcia .     i thought this through before i started talking to kublai khan  but i didn   t have any way to explain it to you .         what do you mean .     steve asked .      as i mentioned before we left  marco polo said on his deathbed that in his book  he had not told half the wonders he had seen on his travels .  i think he also omitted witnessing spirits who vanished before his eyes .         but what about kublai khan and all those other people standing around us .     steve frowned .     i was glad to get out of there  but wouldn   t at least a few of them change their beliefs about the world or religion .         that   s the other part i had to consider     said marcia .     but most of the people there   maybe all of them   believed in some form of chinese or mongol animistic religion .  even the buddhists and taoists in china had open attitudes toward folk deities and spirits .  kublai khan himself instituted state tolerance of all religions and seemed to consider them equally valid .  i don   t think we altered anyone   s beliefs because they already believed that spirits in human form came and went around them .         kublai khan said he didn   t want anyone to think he was crazy     said steve .      if the great khan did not want the incident mentioned again  i can guarantee that no one in the palace grounds spoke of it openly     said marcia .     a few whispers in private or some rumors outside the walls in the city after hours would simply get lost among other unprovable reports of spirit visitations .         your explanation seems sound     said hunter .      what about mc   .     steve asked .      the news headlines report a nuclear explosion in southern england near the welsh border     hunter said grimly .     like the others  it has killed millions of people .         did you get the date we   re going to visit from the sphere console .     steve asked .      yes .  mc   will return to his full size in a . d .      .  at that time  a man named arturius  upon whom the legend of king arthur was based  was the most powerful individual in britain .
