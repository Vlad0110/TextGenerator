   midden lane   pseudopolies   sto plains   the discworld   on top of great  a tuin   the univers   space .   nr .  more space .       begin reading     the bees of death are big and black  they buzz low and somber  they keep their honey in combs of wax as white as altar candles .  the honey is black as night  thick as sin and sweet as treacle .   it is well known that eight colors make up white .  but there are also eight colors of blackness  for those that have the seeing of them  and the hives of death are among the black grass in the black orchard under the black blossomed  ancient boughs of trees that will  eventually  produce apples that   put it like this   probably won   t be red .   the grass was short now .  the scythe that had done the work leaned against the gnarled bole of a pear tree .  now death was inspecting his bees  gently lifting the combs in his skeletal fingers .   a few bees buzzed around him .  like all beekeepers  death wore a veil .  it wasn   t that he had anything to sting  but sometimes a bee would get inside his skull and buzz around and give him a headache .   as he held a comb up to the gray light of his little world between the realities there was the faintest of tremors .  a hum went up from the hive  a leaf floated down .  a wisp of wind blew for a moment through the orchard  and that was the most uncanny thing  because the air in the land of death is always warm and still .   death fancied that he heard  very briefly  the sound of running feet and a voice saying  no  a voice thinking oshitoshitoshit  i   m gonna die i   m gonna die i   m gonna die .   death is almost the oldest creature in the universe  with habits and modes of thought that mortal man cannot begin to understand  but because he was also a good beekeeper he carefully replaced the comb in its rack and put the lid on the hive before reacting .   he strode back through the dark garden to his cottage  removed the veil  carefully dislodged a few bees who had got lost in the depths of his cranium  and retired to his study .   as he sat down at his desk there was another rush of wind  which rattled the hour glasses on the shelves and made the big pendulum clock in the hall pause ever so briefly in its interminable task of slicing time into manageable bits .   death sighed  and focused his gaze .   there is nowhere death will not go  no matter how distant and dangerous .  in fact the more dangerous it is  the more likely he is to be there already .   now he stared through the mists of time and space .   oh  he said .  it   s him .      it was a hot afternoon in late summer in ankh morpork  normally the most thriving  bustling and above all the most crowded city on the disc .  now the spears of the sun had achieved what innumerable invaders  several civil wars and the curfew law had never achieved .  it had pacified the place .   dogs lay panting in the scalding shade .  the river ankh  which never what you might call sparkled  oozed between its banks as if the heat had sucked all the spirit out of it .  the streets were empty  oven brick hot .   no enemies had ever taken ankh morpork .  well  technically they had  quite often  the city welcomed free spending barbarian invaders  but somehow the puzzled raiders always found  after a few days  that they didn   t own their own horses anymore  and within a couple of months they were just another minority group with its own graffiti and food shops .   but the heat had besieged the city and triumphed over the walls .  it lay over the trembling streets like a shroud .  under the blowlamp of the sun assassins were too tired to kill .  it turned thieves honest .  in the ivy covered fastness of unseen university  premier college of wizardry  the inmates dozed with their pointy hats over their faces .  even bluebottles were too exhausted to bang against windowpanes .  the city siesta   d  awaiting the sunset and the brief  hot  velvet surcease of the night .   only the librarian was cool .  he was also swinging and hanging out .   this was because he   d rigged up a few ropes and rings in one of the sub basements of the unseen university library   the one where they kept the  um  erotic  books .  in vats of crushed ice .  and he was dreamily dangling in the chilly vapor above them .   all books of magic have a life of their own .  some of the really energetic ones can   t simply be chained to the bookshelves  they have to be nailed shut or kept between steel plates .  or  in the case of the volumes on tantric sex magic for the serious connoisseur  kept under very cold water to stop them from bursting into flames and scorching their severely plain covers .   the librarian swung gently back and forth above the seething vats  dozing peacefully .   then the footsteps came out of nowhere  raced across the floor with a noise that scraped the raw surface of the soul  and disappeared through the wall .  there was a faint  distant scream that sounded like ogodsogodsogods  this is it  i   m gonna die .   the librarian woke up  lost his grip  and flopped into the few inches of tepid water that was all that stood between the joy of tantric sex with illustrations for the advanced student  by a lady  and spontaneous combustion .   and it would have gone badly for him if the librarian had been a human being .  fortunately  he was currently an orangutan .  with so much raw magic sloshing around in the library it would be surprising if accidents did not happen sometimes  and one particularly impressive one had turned him into an ape .  not many people get the chance to leave the human race while still alive  and he   d strenuously resisted all efforts since to turn him back .  since he was the only librarian in the universe who could pick up books with his feet  the university hadn   t pressed the point .   it also meant that his idea of desirable female companionship now looked something like a sack of butter thrown through a roll of old inner tubes  and so he was lucky to get away with only mild burns  a headache  and some rather ambivalent feelings about cucumbers  which wore off by tea time .   in the library above  the grimoires creaked and rustled their pages in astonishment as the invisible runner passed straight through the bookshelves and disappeared  or rather  disappeared even more        ankh morpork gradually awoke from its slumber .  something invisible and yelling at the top of its voice was passing through every part of the city  dragging in its wake a trail of destruction .  wherever it went  things changed .   a fortune teller in the street of cunning artificers heard the footsteps run across her bedroom floor and found her crystal ball had turned into a little glass sphere with a cottage in it  plus snowflakes .   in a quiet corner of the mended drum tavern  where the adventuresses herrena the henna haired harridan  red scharron and diome  witch of the night  were meeting for some girl talk and a game of canasta  all the drinks turned into small yellow elephants .      it   s them wizards up at the university     said the barman  hastily replacing the glasses .     it oughtn   t to be allowed .         midnight dropped off the clock .   the council of wizardry rubbed their eyes and stared blearily at one another .  they felt it oughtn   t to be allowed too  especially since they weren   t the ones that were allowing it .   finally the new archchancellor  ezrolith churn  suppressed a yawn  sat up straight in his chair  and tried to look suitably magisterial .  he knew he wasn   t really archchancellor material .  he hadn   t really wanted the job .  he was ninety eight  and had achieved this worthwhile age by carefully not being any trouble or threat to anyone .  he had hoped to spend his twilight years completing his seven volume treatise on some little known aspects of kuian rain making rituals  which were an ideal subject for academic study in his opinion since the rituals only ever worked in ku  and that particular continent had slipped into the ocean several thousand years ago .   the trouble was that in recent years the lifespan of archchancellors seemed to be a bit on the short side  and the natural ambition of all wizards for the job had given way to a curious  self effacing politeness .  he   d come down one morning to find everyone calling him    sir .     it had taken him days to find out why .   his head ached .  he felt it was several weeks past his bedtime .  but he had to say something .      gentlemen       he began .      oook .         sorry  and mo           oook .         i mean apes  of course           oook .      the archchancellor opened and shut his mouth in silence for a while  trying to re route his train of thought .  the librarian was  ex officio  a member of the college council .  no one had been able to find any rule about orang utans being barred  although they had surreptitiously looked very hard for one .      it   s a haunting     he ventured .     some sort of a ghost  maybe .  a bell  book and candle job .      the bursar sighed .     we tried that  archchancellor .      the archchancellor leaned toward him .      eh .     he said .      i said  we tried that  archchancellor     said the bursar loudly  directing his voice at the old man   s ear .     after dinner  you remember .  we used humptemper   s names of the ants and rang old tom .          did we  indeed .  worked  did it .         no  archchancellor .         eh .         anyway  we   ve never had any trouble with ghosts before     said the senior tutor .     wizards just don   t haunt places .      the archchancellor groped for a crumb of comfort .      perhaps it   s just something natural     he said .     possibly the rumblings of an underground spring .  earth movements  perhaps .  something in the drains .  they can make very funny noises  you know  when the wind is in the right direction .      he sat back and beamed .   the rest of the council exchanged glances .      the drains don   t sound like hurrying feet  archchancellor     said the bursar wearily .      unless someone left a tap running     said the senior tutor .   the bursar scowled at him .  he   d been in the tub when the invisible screaming thing had hurtled through his room .  it was not an experience he wanted to repeat .   the archchancellor nodded at him .      that   s settled  then     he said  and fell asleep .   the bursar watched him in silence .  then he pulled the old man   s hat off and tucked it gently under his head .      well .     he said wearily .     has anyone got any suggestions .      the librarian put his hand up .      oook     he said .      yes  well done  good boy     said the bursar  breezily .     anyone else .      the orang utan glared at him as the other wizards shook their heads .      it   s a tremor in the texture of reality     said the senior tutor .     that   s what it is .         what should we do about it  then .         search me .  unless we tried the old           oh  no     said the bursar .     don   t say it .  please .  it   s far too dangerous        his words were chopped off by a scream that began at the far end of the room and dopplered along the table  accompanied by the sound of many running feet .  the wizards ducked in a scatter of overturned chairs .   the candle flames were drawn into long thin tongues of octarine light before being snuffed out .   then there was silence  the special kind that you get after a really unpleasant noise .   and the bursar said     all right .  i give in .  we will try the rite of ashkente .         it is the most serious ritual eight wizards can undertake .  it summons death  who naturally knows everything that is going on everywhere .   and of course it   s done with reluctance  because senior wizards are generally very old and would prefer not to do anything to draw death   s attention in their direction .   it took place in the midnight in the university   s great hall  in a welter of incense  candlesticks  runic inscriptions and magic circles  none of which was strictly necessary but which made the wizards feel better .  magic flared  the chants were chanted  the invocations were truly invoked .   the wizards stared into the magic octogram  which remained empty .  after a while the circle of robed figures began to mutter among themselves .      we must have done something wrong .         oook .         maybe he is out .         or busy           do you think we could give up and go back to bed .      who are we waiting for  exactly .   the bursar turned slowly to the figure beside him .  you could always tell a wizard   s robe  it was bedecked with sequins  sigils  fur and lace  and there was usually a considerable amount of wizard inside it .  this robe  however  was very black .  the material looked as though it had been chosen for its hard wearing qualities .  so did its owner .  he looked as though if he wrote a diet book  it would be a bestseller .   death was watching the octogram with an expression of polite interest .      er     said the bursar .     the fact is  in fact  that  er  you should be on the inside .      i   m so sorry .   death stalked in a dignified way into the center of the room and watched the bursar expectantly .   i hope we are not going to have any of this    foul fiend    business again  he said .      i trust we are not interrupting any important enterprise .     said the bursar politely .   all my work is important  said death .      naturally     said the bursar .   to somebody .      er .  er .  the reason  o fou   sir  that we have called you here  is for the reason        it is rincewind .      what .      the reason you summoned me .  the answer is  it is rincewind .      but we haven   t asked you the question yet .      nevertheless .  the answer is  it is rincewind .      look  what we want to know is  what   s causing this outbreak of   oh .      death pointedly picked invisible particles off the edge of his scythe .   the archchancellor cupped a gnarled hand over his ear .      what   d he say .  who   s the fella with the stick .         it   s death  archchancellor     said the bursar patiently .      eh .         it   s death  sir .  you know .         tell him we don   t want any     said the old wizard  waving his stick .   the bursar sighed .     we summoned him  archchancellor .         is it .  what   d we go and do that for .  bloody silly thing to do .      the bursar gave death an embarrassed grin .  he was on the point of asking him to excuse the archchancellor on account of his age  but realized that this would in the circumstances be a complete waste of breath .      are we talking about the wizard rincewind .  the one with the       the bursar gave a shudder      horrible luggage on legs .  but he got blown up when there was all that business with the sourcerer  didn   t he .       into the dungeon dimensions .  and now he is trying to get back home .      can he do that .      there would need to be an unusual conjunction of circumstances .  reality would need to be weakened in certain unexpected ways .      that isn   t likely to happen  is it .     said the bursar anxiously .  people who have it on record that they were visiting their aunt for two months are always nervous about people turning up who may have mistakenly thought that they weren   t  and owing to some trick of the light might have believed they had seen them doing things that they couldn   t have been doing owing to being at their aunt   s .   it would be a million to one chance  said death .  exactly a million to one chance .     oh     said the bursar  intensely relieved .     oh dear .  what a shame .     he brightened up considerably .     of course  there   s all the noise .  but  unfortunately  i expect he won   t survive for long .      this could be the case  said death blandly .  i am sure  though  that you would not wish me to make a practice of issuing definitive statements in this field .      no .  no  of course not     said the bursar hurriedly .     right .  well  many thanks .  poor chap .   what a great pity .  still  can   t be helped .  perhaps we should be philosophical about these things .      perhaps you should .      and we had better not keep you     the bursar added politely .   thank you .      goodbye .      be seeing you .   in fact the noise stopped just before breakfast .  the librarian was the only one unhappy about it .  rincewind had been his assistant and his friend  and was a good man when it came to peeling a banana .  he had also been uniquely good at running away from things .  he was not  the librarian considered  the type to be easily caught .   there had probably been an unusual conjunction of circumstances .   that was a far more likely explanation .      there had been an unusual conjunction of circumstances .   by exactly a million to one chance there had been someone watching  studying  looking for the right tools for a special job .   and here was rincewind .   it was almost too easy .      so rincewind opened his eyes .  there was a ceiling above him  if it was the floor  then he was in trouble .   so far  so good .   he cautiously felt the surface he was lying on .  it was grainy  woody in fact  with the odd nail hole .  a human sort of surface .   his ears picked up the crackle of a fire and a bubbling noise  source unknown .   his nose  feeling that it was being left out of things  hastened to report a whiff of brimstone .   right .  so where did that leave him .  lying on a rough wooden floor in a firelit room with something that bubbled and gave off sulfurous smells .  in his unreal  dreamy state he felt quite pleased at this process of deduction .   what else .   oh  yes .   he opened his mouth and screamed and screamed and screamed .   this made him feel slightly better .   he lay there a bit longer .  through the tumbled heap of his memories came the recollections of mornings in bed when he was a little boy  desperately subdividing the passing time into smaller and smaller units to put off the terrible moment of getting up and having to face all the problems of life such as  in this case  who he was  where he was  and why he was .      what are you .     said a voice on the edge of his consciousness .      i was coming to that     muttered rincewind .   the room oscillated into focus as he pushed himself up on his elbows .      i warn you     said the voice  which seemed to be coming from a table     i am protected by many powerful amulets .         jolly good     said rincewind .     i wish i was .      details began to distil out of the blur .  it was a long  low room  one end of which was entirely occupied by an enormous fireplace .  a bench all down one wall contained a selection of glassware apparently created by a drunken glassblower with hic cups  and inside its byzantine coils colored liquids seethed and bubbled .  a skeleton hung from a hook in a relaxed fashion .  on a perch beside it someone had nailed a stuffed bird .  whatever sins it had committed in life  it hadn   t deserved what the taxidermist had done to it .   rincewind   s gaze then swept across the floor .  it was obvious that it was the only sweeping the floor had had for some time .  only around him had space been cleared among the debris of broken glass and overturned retorts for     a magic circle .   it looked an extremely thorough job .  whoever had chalked it was clearly very aware that its purpose was to divide the universe into two bits  the inside and the outside .   rincewind was  of course  inside .      ah     he said  feeling a familiar and almost comforting sense of helpless dread sweep over him .      i adjure and conjure thee against all aggressive acts  o demon of the pit     said the voice from  rincewind now realized  behind the table .      fine  fine     said rincewind quickly .     that   s all right by me .  er .  it isn   t possible that there has been the teeniest little mistake here  could there .         avaunt .         right .     said rincewind .  he looked around him desperately .     how .         don   t you think you can lure me to my doom with thy lying tongue  o fiend of shamharoth     said the table .     i am learned in the ways of demons .  obey my every command or i will return thee unto the boiling hell from which you came .  thou came  sorry .  thou came   st  in fact .  and i really mean it .      the figure stepped out .  it was quite short  and most of it was hidden by a variety of charms  amulets and talismans which  even if not effective against magic  would probably have protected it against a tolerably determined sword thrust .  it wore glasses and had a hat with long sidepieces that gave it the air of a short sighted spaniel .   it held a sword in one shaking hand .  it was so heavily etched with sigils that it was beginning to bend .      boiling hell  did you say .     said rincewind weakly .      absolutely .  where the screams of anguish and the tortured torments           yes  yes  you   ve made your point     said rincewind .     only  you see  the thing is  in fact  that i am not a demon .  so if you would just let me out .         i am not fooled by thy outer garb  demon     said the figure .  in a more normal voice it added     anyway  demons always lie .  well known fact .         it is .     said rincewind  clutching at this straw .     in that case  then   i am a demon .         aha .  condemned out of your own mouth .         look  i don   t have to put up with this     said rincewind .     i don   t know who you are or what   s happening  but i   m going to have a drink  all right .      he went to walk out of the circle  and went rigid with shock as sparks crackled up from the runic inscriptions and earthed themselves all over his body .      thou mays   nt   thou maysn   t   thou mays   n   t       the conjurer of demons gave up .     look  you can   t step over the circle until i release you  right .  i mean  i don   t want to be unpleasant  it   s just that if i let you out of the circle you will be able to resume your true shape  and a pretty awful shape it is too  i expect .  avaunt .     he added  feeling that he wasn   t keeping up the tone .      all right .  i   m avaunting .  i   m avaunting     said rincewind  rubbing his elbow .     but i   m still not a demon .         how come you answered the conjuration  then .  i suppose you just happened to be passing through the paranatural dimensions  eh .         something like that  i think .  it   s all a bit blurred .         pull the other one  it has got bells on .     the conjurer leaned his sword against a lectern on which a heavy book  dripping bookmarks  lay open .  then he did a mad little jig on the floor .      it   s worked .     he said .     heheh .     he caught sight of rincewind   s horrified gaze and pulled himself together .  he gave an embarrassed cough  and stepped up to the lectern .      i really am not       rincewind began .      i had this list here somewhere     said the figure .     let   s see  now .  oh  yes .  i command you   thee  i mean   to  ah  grant me three wishes .  yes .  i want mastery of the kingdoms of the world  i want to meet the most beautiful woman who has ever lived  and i want to live forever .     he gave rincewind an encouraging look .      all that .     said rincewind .      yes .         oh  no problem     said rincewind sarcastically .     and then i get the rest of the day off  right .         and i want a chest full of gold  too .  just to be going on with .         i can see you   ve got it all thought out .         yes .  avaunt .         right  right .  only       rincewind thought hurriedly  he   s quite mad  but mad with a sword in his hands  the only chance i   ve got is to argue him out of it on his own terms        only  d   you see  i   m not a very superior kind of demon and i   m afraid those sort of errands are a bit out of my league  sorry .  you can avaunt as much as you like  but they   re just beyond me .      the little figure peered over the top of its glasses .      i see     he said testily .     what could you manage then  do you think .         well  er       said rincewind     i suppose i could go down to the shops and get you a packet of mints  or something .      there was a pause .      you really can   t do all those things .         sorry .  look  i   ll tell you what .  you just release me  and i   ll be sure to pass the word around when i get back to       rincewind hesitated .  where the hell did demons live  anyway .     demon city     he said  hopefully .      you mean pandemonium .     said his captor suspiciously .      yes  that   s right .  that   s what i meant .  i   ll tell everyone  next time you   re in the real world be sure and look up   what   s your name .         thursley .  eric thursley .         right .         demonologist .  midden lane  pseudopolis .  next door to the tannery     said thursley hopefully .      right you are .  don   t you worry about it .  now  if you   ll just let me out        thursley   s face fell .      you   re sure you really can   t do it .     he said  and rincewind couldn   t help noticing the edge of pleading in his voice .     even a small chest of gold would do .  and  i mean  it needn   t be the most beautiful woman in the whole of history .  second most beautiful would do .  or third .  you pick any one out of  you know  the top one hundr   thousand .  whatever you   ve got in stock  sort of thing .     by the end of the sentence his voice twanged with longing .   rincewind wanted to say  look  what you should do is stop all this messing around with chemicals in dark rooms and have a shave  a haircut  a bath  make that two baths  buy yourself a new wardrobe and get out of an evening and then   but he   d have to be honest  because even washed  shaved and soaked in body splash thursley wasn   t going to win any prizes   and then you could have your face slapped by any woman of your choice .   i mean  it wouldn   t be much  but it would be body contact .      sorry     he said again .   thursley sighed .     the kettle   s on     he said .     would you like a cup of tea .      rincewind stepped forward into a crackle of psychic energy .      ah     said thursley uncertainly  as the wizard sucked at his fingers     i   ll tell you what .  i   ll put you under a conjuration of duress .         there   s no need  i assure you .         no  it   s best this way .  it means you can move around .  i had it all ready anyway  in case you could go and fetch  you know  her .         fine     said rincewind .  as the demonologist mumbled words from the book he thought  feet .  door .  stairs .  what a great combination .   it occurred to him that there was something about the demonologist that wasn   t quite usual  but he couldn   t put his finger on it .  he looked pretty much like the demonologists rincewind had known back in ankh morpork  who were all bent and chemical stained and had eyes with pupils like pinheads from all the chemical fumes .  this one would have fitted in easily .  it was just that there was something odd .      to be honest     said thursley  industriously mopping away part of the circle     you   re my first demon .  it   s never worked before .  what is your name .         rincewind .      thursley thought about this .     it doesn   t ring a bell     he said .     there   s a riinjswin in the demonologie .  and a winswin .  but they   ve got more wings than you .  you can step out now .  i must say that   s a first class materialization .  no one would think you were a fiend  to look at you .  most demons  when they want to look human  materialize in the shape of nobles  kings and princes .  this moth eaten wizard look is very clever .  you could   ve almost fooled me .  it   s a shame you can   t do any of those things .         i can   t see why you   d want to live forever     said rincewind  privately determining that the words    moth eaten    would be paid for  if ever he got the opportunity .     being young again  i can understand that .         huh .  being young   s not much fun     said thursley  and then clapped his hand over his mouth .   rincewind leaned forward .   about fifty years .  that was what was missing .      that   s a false beard .     he said .     how old are you .         eighty seven .     squeaked thursley .      i can see the hooks over your ears .         seventy eight  honest .  avaunt .         you   re a little boy .      eric pulled himself up haughtily .     i   m not .     he snapped .     i   m nearly fourteen .         ah ha .      the boy waved the sword at rincewind .     it doesn   t matter  anyway .     he shouted .     demonologists can be any age  you   re still my demon and you have to do as i say .         eric .     came a voice from somewhere below them .   eric   s face went white .      yes  mother .     he shouted  his eyes fixed on rincewind .  his mouth shaped the words  don   t say anything  please .      what   s all that noise up there .         nothing  mother .         come down and wash your hands  dear  your breakfast   s ready .         yes  mother .     he looked sheepishly at rincewind .     that   s my mother     he said .      she   s got a good pair of lungs  hasn   t she     said rincewind .      i   d  i   d better go  then     said eric .     you   ll have to stay up here  of course .      it dawned on him that he was losing a certain amount of credibility at this point .  he waved the sword again .      avaunt .     he said .     i command you not to leave this room .         right .  sure     said rincewind  eyeing the windows .      promise .  otherwise you   ll be sent back to the pit .         oh  i don   t want that     said rincewind .     off you trot .  don   t worry about me .         i   m going to leave the sword and stuff here     said eric  removing most of his accoutrements to reveal a slim  dark haired young man whose face would be a lot better when his acne cleared up .     if you touch them  terrible things will befall .         wouldn   t dream of it     said rincewind .   when he was left alone he wandered over to the lectern and looked at the book .  the title  in impressively flickering red letters  was mallificarum sumpta diabolicite occularis singularum  the book of ultimate control .  he knew about it .  there was a copy in the library somewhere  although wizards never bothered with it .   this might seem odd  because if there is one thing a wizard would trade his grandmother for  it is power .  but it wasn   t all that strange  because any wizard bright enough to survive for five minutes was also bright enough to realize that if there was any power in demonology  then it lay with the demons .  using it for your own purposes would be like trying to beat mice to death with a rattlesnake .   even wizards thought demonologists were odd  they tended to be surreptitious  pale men who got up to complicated things in darkened rooms and had damp  weak handshakes .  it wasn   t like good clean magic .  no self respecting wizard would have any truck with the demonic regions  whose inhabitants were as big a collection of ding dongs as you   d find outside a large belfry .   he inspected the skeleton closely  just in case .  it didn   t seem inclined to make a contribution to the situation .      it belonged to his wossname  grandfather     said a cracked voice behind him .      bit of an unusual bequest     said rincewind .      oh  not personally .  he got it in a shop somewhere .  it   s one of them wossname  articulate wossnames .         it   s not saying much right now     said rincewind  and then went very quiet and thoughtful .      er     he said  without moving his head     what  precisely  am i talking to .         i   m a wossname .  tip of my tongue .  begins with a p .      rincewind turned around slowly .      you   re a parrot .     he said .      that   s it .      rincewind stared at the thing on the perch .  it had one eye that glittered like a ruby .  most of the rest of it was pink and purple skin  studded with the fag ends of feathers  so that the net effect was of an oven ready hairbrush .  it jiggled arthritically on its perch and then slowly lost its balance  until it was hanging upside down .      i thought you were stuffed     said rincewind .      up yours  wizard .      rincewind ignored it and crept over to the window .  it was small  but gave out onto a gently sloping roof .  and out there was real life  real sky  real buildings .  he reached out to open the shutters     a crackling current coursed up his arm and earthed itself in his cerebellum .   he sat on the floor  sucking his fingers .      he tole you     said the parrot  swinging backward and forward upside down .     but you wouldn   t wossname .  he   s got you by the wossnames .         but it should only work on demons .         ah     said the parrot  achieving enough momentum to swing upright again  whereupon it steadied itself with the stubby remains of what had once been wings .     it   s all according  isn   t it .  if you come in through the door marked    wossnames    that means you get treated as a wossname  right .   demon  i mean .  subject to all the rules and wossnames .  tough one for you .         but you know i   m a wizard  don   t you .      the parrot gave a squawk .     i   ve seen    em  mate .  the real mcwossname .  some of the ones we   ve had in here  they   d make you choke on your millet .  great scaly fiery wossnames .  took weeks to get the soot off the walls     it added  in an approving tone of voice .     that was in his granddad   s day  of course .  the kid hasn   t been any good at it .  up to now .  bright lad .  i blame the wossnames  parents .  new money  you know .  wine business .  spoil him rotten  let him play with his wossname   s old stuff     oh  he   s such an intelligent lad  nose always in a book        the parrot mimicked .     they never give him any of the things a sensitive growing wossnames really needs  if you was to ask me .         what  you mean love and guidance .     said rincewind .      i was thinking of a bloody good wossname  thrashing     said the parrot .   rincewind clutched at his aching head .  if this was what demons usually had to go through  no wonder they were always so annoyed .      polly want a biscuit     said the parrot vaguely  in much the same way as a human would say    er    or    as i was saying     and went on     his granddad was keen on it .  that and his pigeons .         pigeons     said rincewind .      not that he was particularly successful .  it was all a bit trial and wossname .         i thought you said great big scaly           oh  yes .  but that wasn   t what he was after .  he was trying to conjure up a succubus .     it should be impossible to leer when all you   ve got is a beak  but the parrot managed it .     that   s a female demon what comes in the night and makes mad passionate wossn           i   ve heard of them     said rincewind .     bloody dangerous things .      the parrot put its head on one side .     it never worked .  all he ever got was a neuralger .         what   s that .         it   s a demon that comes and has a headache at you .         demons have existed on the discworld for at least as long as the gods  who in many ways they closely resemble .  the difference is basically the same as that between terrorists and freedom fighters .   most of the demons occupy a spacious dimension close to reality  traditionally decorated in shades of flame and maintained at roasting point .  this isn   t actually necessary  but if there is one thing that your average demon is  it is a traditionalist .   in the center of the inferno  rising majestically from a lake of lava substitute and with unparalleled views of the eight circles  lies the city of pandemonium .    at the moment  it was living up to its name .   astfgl  the new king of the demons  was furious .  not simply because the air conditioning had broken down again  not because he felt surrounded by idiots and plotters on every side  and not even because no one could pronounce his name properly yet  but also because he had just been given bad news .  the demon who had been chosen by lottery to deliver it cowered in front of his throne with its tail between its legs .  it was immortally afraid that something wonderful was soon going to happen to it .       it did what .     said astfgl .      it  er  it opened  o lord .  the circle in pseudopolis .         ah .  the clever boy .  we have great hopes of him .         er .  then it closed again  lord .     the demon shut its eyes .      and who went through .         er .     the demon looked around at its colleagues  clustered at the far end of the mile long throne room .      i said  and who went through .         in point of fact  o lord           yes .         we don   t know .  someone .         i gave orders  did i not  that when the boy succeeded the duke vassenego was to materialize unto him  and offer him forbidden pleasures and dark delights to bend him to our will .      the king growled .  the problem with being evil  he   d been forced to admit  was that demons were not great innovatory thinkers and really needed the spice of human ingenuity .  and he   d really been looking forward to eric thursley  whose brand of superintelligent gormlessness was a rare delight .  hell needed horribly bright  self centered people like eric .  they were much better at being nasty than demons could ever manage .      indeed  lord     said the demon     and the duke has been awaiting the summons there for years  shunning all other temptations  steadfastly and patiently studying the world of men           so where was he .         er .  call of supernature  lord     the demon gabbled .     hadn   t turned his back for two minutes when           and someone went through .         we   re trying to find out        lord astfgl   s patience  which in any case had the tensile strength of putty  snapped at this point .  that just about summed it up .  he had the kind of subjects who used the words    find out    when they meant    ascertain .     damnation was too good for them .      get out     he whispered .     and i shall see to it that you get a commendation for this           o master  i plead           get out .      the king stamped along the glowing corridors to his private apartments .   his predecessors had favored shaggy hind legs and hoofs .  lord astfgl had rejected all that sort of thing out of hand .  he held that no one would ever get taken seriously by those stuck up bastards in dun manifestin when their rear end kept ruminating all the time  and so he favored a red silk cloak  crimson tights  a cowl with two rather sophisticated little horns on it  and a trident .  the end kept dropping off the trident but  he felt  it was the sort of get up in which a demon king could be taken seriously     in the coolness of his chambers   oh  by all the gods or  rather  not by all the gods  it had taken him ages to get them up to some sort of civilized standard  his predecessors had been quite content just to lounge around and tempt people  they had never heard of executive stress   he gently lifted the cover off the mirror of souls and watched it flicker into life .   its cool black surface was surrounded by an ornate frame  from which curls of greasy smoke constantly unfolded and drifted .   your wish  master .  it said .      show me the events around the pseudopolis gate over the last hour     said the king  and settled down to watch .   after a while he went and looked up the name    rincewind    in the filing cabinet he had recently had installed  in place of the distressingly bound old ledgers that had been there  the system still needed ironing out  though  because the bewildered demons filed everything under p for people .   then he sat watching the flickering pictures and absentmindedly played with the stuff on his desk  to soothe his nerves .   he had any amount of desk things  notepads with magnets for paperclips  handy devices for holding pens and those tiny jotters that always came in handy  incredibly funny statuettes with slogans like    you   re the boss .      and little chromium balls and spirals operated by a sort of ersatz and short lived perpetual motion .  no one looking at that desk could have any doubt that they were  in cold fact  truly damned .      i see     said lord astfgl  setting a selection of shiny balls swinging with one tap of a talon .   he couldn   t remember any demon called rincewind .  on the other hand  there were millions of the wretched things  swarming all over the place with no sense of order  and he hadn   t yet had time to carry out a proper census and retire the unnecessary ones .  this one seemed to have fewer appendages and more vowels in its name than most .  but it had to be a demon .   vassenego was a proud old fool  one of the elder demons who smiled and despised him and not quite obeyed him  just because the king   d worked hard over the millennia to get from humble beginnings to where he was today .  he wouldn   t put it past the old devil to do this on purpose  just to spite him .   well  he   d have to see about that later .  send him a memo or something .  too late to do anything about it now .  he   d have to take a personal interest .   eric thursley was too good a prospect to pass up .  getting eric thursley would really annoy the gods .   gods .  how he hated the gods .  he hated the gods even more than he hated the old guard like vassenego  even more than he hated humans .  he   d thrown a little soir  e last week  he   d put a lot of thought into it  he wanted to show that he was prepared to let bygones be bygones  work with them for a new  better and more efficient universe .  he   d called it a    getting to know you .     party .  there   d been sausages on sticks and everything  he   d done his best to make it nice .   they hadn   t even bothered to answer the invitations .  and he   d made a special point of putting rsvp on them .         demon .      eric peered around the door .      what shape are you .     he said .      pretty poor shape     said rincewind .      i   ve brought you some food .  you do eat  do you .      rincewind tried some .  it was a bowl of cereal  nuts  and dried fruit .  he didn   t have any quarrel with any of that .  it was just that somewhere in the preparation something had apparently done to these innocent ingredients what it takes a million gravities to do to a neutron star .  if you died of eating this sort of thing they wouldn   t have to bury you  they would just need to drop you somewhere where the ground was soft .   he managed to swallow it .  it wasn   t difficult .  the trick would have been preventing it from heading downward .      lovely     he choked .  the parrot did a splendid impersonation of someone being sick .      i   ve decided to let you go     said eric .     it   s pretty pointless keeping you  isn   t it .         absolutely .         you haven   t any powers at all .         sorry .  dead failure .         you don   t look too demonic  come to think about it     said eric .      they never do .  you can   t trust them wossnames     chortled the parrot .  it lost its balance again .     polly want a biscuit     it said  upside down .   rincewind spun around .     you stay out of this  beaky .      there was a sound behind them  like the universe clearing its throat .  the chalk marks of the magic circle grew terribly bright for a moment  became fiery lines against the scuffed planks  and something dropped out of the empty air and landed heavily on the floor .   it was a large  metal bound chest .  it had fallen on its curved lid .  after a while it started to rock violently  and then it extended hundreds of little pink legs and with considerable effort flipped itself over .   finally it shuffled around until it was watching the pair of them .  it was all the more disconcerting because it was staring without having any eyes to do it with .   eric moved first .  he grasped the home made magic sword  which flapped wildly .      you are a demon .     he said .     i nearly believed you when you said you weren   t .         wheee .     said the parrot .      it   s just my luggage     said rincewind desperately .     it   s a sort of   well  it goes everywhere with me  there   s nothing demonic about it   er .     he hesitated .     not much  anyway     he finished lamely .      avaunt .         oh  not again .      the boy looked at the open book .     my commands earlier resume     he said firmly .     the most beautiful woman who has ever lived  mastery of all the kingdoms of the world  and to live forever .  get on with it .      rincewind stood frozen .      well  go on     said eric .     you   re supposed to disappear in a puff of smoke .         listen  do you think i can just snap my fingers        rincewind snapped his fingers .   there was a puff of smoke .      rincewind gave his fingers a long shocked stare  as one might regard a gun that has been hanging on the wall for decades and has suddenly gone off and perforated the cat .      they   ve hardly ever done that before     he said .   he looked down .      aargh     he said  and closed his eyes .   it was a better world in the darkness behind his eyelids .  if he tapped his foot he could persuade himself that he could feel the floor  he could know that he was really standing in the room  and that the urgent signals from all his other senses  which were telling him that he was suspended in the air some thousand miles or so above the disc  were just a bad dream he   d wake up from .  he hastily canceled that thought .  if he was asleep he   d prefer to stay that way .  you could fly in dreams .  if he woke up  it was a long way to fall .   perhaps i have died and i really am a demon  he thought .   it was an interesting point .   he opened his eyes again .      wow .     said eric  his eyes gleaming .     can i have all of it .      the boy was standing in the same position as he had been in the room .  so was the luggage .  so  to rincewind   s annoyance  was the parrot .  it was perching in midair  looking speculatively at the cosmic panorama below .   the disc might almost have been designed to be seen from space  it hadn   t  rincewind was damn sure  been designed to be lived on .  but he had to admit that it was impressive .   the sun was about to rise on the far rim and made a line of fire that glittered around half the circumference .  a long slow dawn was just beginning its sweep across the dark  massive landscape .   below  harshly lit in the arid vacuum of space  great a   tuin the world turtle toiled under the weight of creation .  on his   or her  the matter had never really been resolved   carapace the four giant elephants strained to support the disc itself .   there might have been more efficient ways to build a world .  you might start with a ball of molten iron and then coat it with successive layers of rock  like an old fashioned gobstopper .  and you   d have a very efficient planet  but it wouldn   t look so nice .  besides  things would drop off the bottom .      pretty good     said the parrot .     polly want a continent .         it   s so big     breathed eric .      yes     said rincewind flatly .   he felt that something more was expected of him .      don   t break it     he added .   he had a nagging doubt about all this .  if he was for the sake of argument a demon  and so many things had happened to him recently he was prepared to concede that he might have died and not noticed it in the confusion   then he still didn   t quite see how the world was his to give away .  he was pretty sure that it had owners who felt the same way .   also  he was sure that a demon had to get something in writing .      i think you have to sign for it     he said .     in blood .         whose .     said eric .      yours  i think     said rincewind .     or bird blood will do  in a pinch .     he glared meaningfully at the parrot  which growled at him .      aren   t i allowed to try it out first .         what .         well  supposing it doesn   t work .  i   m not signing for it until i   ve seen it work .      rincewind stared at the boy .  then he looked down at the broad panorama of the kingdoms of the world .  i wonder if i was like him at his age .  he thought .  i wonder how i survived .      it   s the world     he said patiently .     of course it will bloody well work .  i mean  look at it .  hurricanes  continental drift  rainfall cycle   it   s all there .  all ticking over like a bloody watch .  it   ll last you a lifetime  a world like that .  used carefully .      eric gave the world a critical examination .  he wore the expression of someone who knows that all the best gifts in life seem to require the psychic equivalent of two u  batteries and the shops won   t be open until after the holidays .      there   s got to be tribute     he said flatly .      what .         the kings of the world     said eric .     they   ve got to pay me tribute .         you   ve really been studying this  haven   t you     said rincewind sarcastically .     just tribute .  you don   t fancy the moon while we   re up here .  this week   s special offer  one free satellite with every world dominated .         are there any useful minerals .         what .      eric gave a sigh of long suffering patience .      minerals     he said .     ores .  you know .      rincewind colored .     i don   t think a lad your age should be thinking of           i mean metal and things .  it   s no use to me if it   s just a load of rock .      rincewind looked down .  the discworld   s tiny moonlet was just rising over the far edge  and shed a pale radiance across the jigsaw pattern of land and sea .      oh  i don   t know .  it looks quite nice     he volunteered .     look  it   s dark now .  perhaps everyone can pay you tribute in the morning .         i want some tribute now .         i thought you might .      rincewind gave his fingers a careful examination .  it wasn   t as if he   d ever been particularly good at snapping them .   he gave it another try .   when he opened his eyes again he was standing up to his ankles in mud .   preeminent among rincewind   s talents was his skill in running away  which over the years he had elevated to the status of a genuinely pure science  it didn   t matter if you were fleeing from or to  so long as you were fleeing .  it was flight alone that counted .  i run  therefore i am  more correctly  i run  therefore with any luck i   ll still be .   but he was also skilled in languages and in practical geography .  he could shout    help .     in fourteen languages and scream for mercy in a further twelve .  he had passed through many of the countries on the disc  some of them at high speed  and during the long  lovely  boring hours when he   d worked in the library he   d whiled away the time by reading up on all the exotic and faraway places he   d never visited .  he remembered that at the time he   d sighed with relief that he   d never have to visit them .   and  now  here he was .   jungle surrounded him .  it wasn   t nice  interesting  open jungle  such as leopard skin clad heroes might swing through  but serious  real jungle  jungle that towered up like solid slabs of greenness  thorned and barbed  jungle in which every representative of the vegetable kingdom had really rolled up its bark and got down to the strenuous business of outgrowing all competitors .  the soil was hardly soil at all  but dead plants on the way to compost hood  water dripped from leaf to leaf  insects whined in the humid  spore laden air  and there was the terrible breathless silence made by the motors of photosynthesis running flat out .  any yodeling hero who tried to swing through that lot might just as well take his chances with a bean slicer .      how do you do that .     said eric .      it   s probably a knack     said rincewind .   eric subjected the wonders of nature to a cursory and disdainful glance .      this doesn   t look like a kingdom     he complained .     you said we could go to a kingdom .  do you call this a kingdom .         this is probably the rain forests of klatch     said rincewind .     they   re stuffed full of lost kingdoms .         you mean mysterious ancient races of amazonian princesses who subject all male prisoners to strange and exhausting progenitative rites .     said eric  his glasses beginning to fog .      haha     said rincewind stonily .     what an imagination the child has .         wossname  wossname  wossname .     shrieked the parrot .      i   ve read about them     said eric  peering into the greenery .     of course  i own those kingdoms as well .     he stared at some private inner vision .     gosh     he said  hungrily .      i should concentrate on the tribute if i was you     said rincewind  setting off down what was possibly a path .   the brightly colored blooms on a tree nearby turned to watch him go .   in the jungles of central klatch there are  indeed  lost kingdoms of mysterious amazonian princesses who capture male explorers for specifically masculine duties .  these are indeed rigorous and exhausting and the luckless victims do not last long .    there are also hidden plateaux where the reptilian monsters of a bygone epoch romp and play  as well as elephants    graveyards  lost diamond mines  and strange ruins decorated with hieroglyphs the very sight of which can freeze the most valiant heart .  on any reasonable map of the area there   s barely room for the trees .   the few explorers who have returned have passed on a number of handy hints to those who follow after  such as      avoid if possible any hanging  down creepers with beady eyes and a forked tongue at one end     don   t pick up any orange and black striped creepers that are apparently lying across the path  twitching  because there is often a tiger on the other end  and    don   t go .   if i   m a demon  rincewind thought hazily  why is everything stinging me and trying to trip me up .  i mean  surely i can only be harmed by a wooden dagger through my heart .  or do i mean garlic .   eventually the jungle opened out into a very wide  cleared area that stretched all the way to a distant blue range of volcanoes .  the land fell away below them to a patchwork of lakes and swampy fields  here and there punctuated by great stepped pyramids  each one crowned with a thin plume of smoke curling into the dawn air .  the jungle track opened out into a narrow  but paved  road .      where   s this  demon .     said eric .      it looks like one of the tezuman kingdoms     said rincewind .     they   re ruled over by the great muzuma  i think .         she   s an amazonian princess  is she .         strangely enough  no .  you   d be astonished how many kingdoms aren   t ruled by amazonian princesses  eric .         it looks pretty primitive  anyway .  a bit stone age .         the tezuman priests have a sophisticated calendar and an advanced horology     quoted rincewind .      ah     said eric     good .         no     said rincewind patiently .     it means time measurement .         oh .         you   d approve of them .  they   re superb mathematicians  apparently .         huh     said eric  blinking solemnly .     shouldn   t think they   ve got a lot to count in a backward civilization like this .      rincewind eyed the chariots that were heading rapidly toward them .      i think they usually count victims     he said .      the tezuman empire in the jungle valleys of central klatch is known for its organic market gardens  its exquisite craftsmanship in obsidian  feathers and jade  and its mass human sacrifices in honor of quezovercoatl  the feathered boa  god of mass human sacrifices .  as they said  you always knew where you stood with quezovercoatl .  it was generally with a lot of people on top of a great stepped pyramid with someone in an elegant feathered headdress chipping an exquisite obsidian knife for your very own personal use .   the tezumen are renowned on the continent for being the most suicidally gloomy  irritable and pessimistic people you could ever hope to meet  for reasons that may soon be made clear .  it was true about the time measurement as well .  the tezumen had realized long ago that everything was steadily getting worse and  having a terrible literal mindedness  had developed a complex system to keep track of how much worse each succeeding day was .   contrary to general belief  the tezumen did invent the wheel .  they just had radically different ideas about what you used it for .      it was the first chariot rincewind had ever seen that was pulled by llamas .  that wasn   t what was odd about it .  what was odd about it was that it was being carried by people  two holding each side of the axle and running after the animals  their sandaled feet flapping on the flagstones .      do you think it   s got the tribute in it .     said eric .   all the leading chariot seemed to contain  apart from the driver  was a squat  basically cube shaped man wearing a puma skin outfit and a feather headdress .   the runners panted to a halt  and rincewind saw that each man wore what would probably be described as a primitive sword  made by affixing shards of obsidian into a wooden club .  they looked to him no less deadly than sophisticated  extremely civilized swords .  in fact  they looked worse .      well .     said eric .      well what .     said rincewind .      tell him to give me my tribute .      the fat man got down ponderously  marched over to eric and  to rincewind   s extreme surprise  groveled .   rincewind felt something claw its way up his back and onto his shoulder  where a voice like a sheet of metal being torn in half said     that   s better .  very wossname  comfy .  if you try and knock me off  demon  you can wossname your ear goodbye .  what a turn up for the scrolls  eh .  they seemed to be expecting him .         why do you keep saying wossname .     said rincewind .      limited wossname .  doodah .  thingy .  you know .  it   s got words in it     said the parrot .      dictionary .     said rincewind .  the passengers in the other chariots had got out and were also groveling to eric  who was beaming like an idiot .   the parrot considered this .      yeah  probably     it said .     i   ve got to wing it to you     it went on .     i thought you were a bit of a wossname at the start  but you seem to be delivering the wossname .         demon .     said eric  airily .      yes .         what are they saying .  can   t you speak their language .         er  no     said rincewind .     i can read it  though     he called out  as eric turned away .     if you could just sort of make signs for them to write it down           it was around noon .  in the jungle behind rincewind creatures whooped and gibbered .  mosquitoes the size of hummingbirds whined around his head .      of course     he said  for the tenth time     they   ve never really got around to inventing paper .      the stonemason stood back  handed the latest blunted obsidian chisel to his assistant  and gave rincewind an expectant look .   rincewind stood back and examined the rock critically .      it   s very good     he said .     i mean  it   s a very good likeness .  you   ve got his hairstyle and everything .  of course  he   s not as  er  square as that normally but  yes  very good .  and here   s the chariot and there   s the step pyramids .  yes .  well  it looks as though they want you to go to the city with them     he said to eric .      tell them yes     said eric firmly .   rincewind turned to the headman .      yes     he said .         hunched figure in triple feathered headdress over three dots  .      rincewind sighed .  without saying a word  the stonemason put a fresh stone chisel into his unresisting fingers and manhandled a new slab of granite into position .   one of the problems of being a tezuman  apart from having a god like quezovercoatl  is that if you unexpectedly need to order an extra pint of milk tomorrow you probably should have started writing the note for the milkman last month .  tezumen are the only people who beat themselves to death with their own suicide notes .      it was late afternoon by the time the chariot trotted into the slab city around the largest pyramid  between lines of cheering tezumen .      this is more like it     said eric  graciously acknowledging the cheers .     they   re very pleased to see us .         yes     said rincewind  gloomily .     i wonder why .         well  because i   m the new ruler  of course .         hmm .     rincewind glanced sidelong at the parrot  who had been unnaturally silent for some time and was now cowering up against his ear like an elderly spinster in a strip club .  it was having serious thoughts about the exquisite feather headdresses .      wossname bastards     it croaked .     any wossnames lays a hand on me and that wossname is minus one finger  i   m telling you .         there   s something not right about this     said rincewind .      what   s that .     said the parrot .      everything .         i   m telling you  one feather out of place        rincewind wasn   t used to people being pleased to see him .  it was unnatural  and boded no good .  these people were not only cheering  they were throwing flowers and hats .  the hats were made out of stone  but the thought was there .   rincewind thought they were rather odd hats .  they didn   t have crowns .  they were  in fact  mere discs with holes in the middle .   the procession trotted up the wide avenues of the city to a cluster of buildings at the foot of the pyramid  where another group of civic dignitaries was waiting for them .   they were wearing lots of jewelry .  it was all basically the same .  there are quite a lot of uses to which you can put a stone disc with a hole in the middle  and the tezumen had explored all but one of them .   more important  though  were the boxes and boxes of treasure stacked in front of them .  they were stuffed with jewels .   eric   s eyes widened .      the tribute .     he said .   rincewind gave up .  it really was working .  he didn   t know how  he didn   t know why  but at last it was all going right .  the setting sun glinted off a dozen fortunes .  of course  it belonged to eric  presumably  but maybe there was enough for him  too        naturally     he said weakly .     what else did you expect .         and there was feasting  and long speeches that rincewind couldn   t understand but which were punctuated with cheers and nods and bows in eric   s direction .  and there were long recitals of tezuman music  which sounds like someone clearing a particularly difficult nostril .   rincewind left eric sitting proudly enthroned in the firelight and wandered disconsolately across to the pyramid .      i was enjoying the wossname     said the parrot reproachfully .      i can   t settle down     said rincewind .     i   m sorry  but this sort of thing has never happened to me before .  all the jewels and things .  everything going as expected .  it   s not right .      he looked up the monstrous face of the steep pyramid  red and flickering in the firelight .  every huge block was carved with a bas relief of tezumen doing terribly inventive things to their enemies .  it suggested that the tezumen  whatever sterling qualities they possessed  were not traditionally inclined to welcome perfect strangers and heap them with jewels .  the overall effect of the great heap of carvings was very artistic   it was just the details that were horrible .   while working his way along the wall he came to a huge door  which artistically portrayed a group of prisoners apparently being given a complete medical check up .    it opened into a short  torch lit tunnel .  rincewind took a few steps along it  telling himself he could always hurry out again  and came out into a lofty space which occupied most of the inside of the pyramid .   there were more torches all around the walls  which illuminated everything quite well .   that wasn   t really welcome because what they mainly illuminated was a giant sized statue of quezovercoatl  the feathered boa .   if you had to be in a room with that statue  you   d prefer it to be pitch dark .   or  then again  perhaps not .  a better option would be to put the thing in a darkened room while you had insomnia a thousand miles away  trying to forget what it looked like .   it   s just a statue  rincewind told himself .  it   s not real .  they   ve just used their imagination  that   s all .      what the wossname is it .     said the parrot .      it   s their god .         get away .         no  really .  it   s quezovercoatl .  half man  half chicken  half jaguar  half serpent  half scorpion and half mad .      the parrot   s beak moved as it worked this out .      that makes a wossname total of three homicidal maniacs     it said .      about right  yes     said the statue .      on the other hand     said rincewind instantly     i do think it   s frightfully important for people to have the right to worship in their own special way  and now i think we   ll just be going  so just           please don   t leave me here     said the statue .     please take me with you .         could be tricky  could be tricky     rincewind said hurriedly  backing away .     it   s not me  you understand  it   s just that where i come from everyone has this racial prejudice thing against thirty foot high people with fangs and talons and necklaces of skulls all over them .  i just think you   ll have trouble fitting in .      the parrot tweaked his ear .     it   s coming from behind the statue  you stupid wossname     it croaked .   it turned out to be coming from a hole in the floor .  a pale face peered shortsightedly up at rincewind from the depths of a pit .  it was an elderly  good natured face with a faintly worried expression .      hallo .     said rincewind .      you don   t know what it means to hear a friendly voice again     said the face  breaking into a grin .     if you could just sort of help me up    .         sorry .     said rincewind .     you   re a prisoner  are you .         alas  this is so .         i don   t know that i ought to go around rescuing prisoners just like that     said rincewind .     i mean  you might have done anything .         i am entirely innocent of all crimes  i assure you .         ah  well  so you say     said rincewind gravely .     but if the tezumen have judged           wossname  wossname  wossname .     shrieked the parrot in his ear as it bounced up and down on his shoulder .     haven   t you got the faintest .  where   ve you been .  he   s a prisoner .  a prisoner in a temple .  you   ve got to rescue prisoners in temples .  that   s what they   re bloody there for .         no it isn   t     snapped rincewind .     that   s all you know .  he   s probably here to be sacrificed .  isn   t that right .     he looked at the prisoner for confirmation .   the face nodded .     indeed  you are correct .  flayed alive  in fact .         there .     said rincewind to the parrot .     see .  you think you know everything .  he   s here to be flayed alive .         every inch of skin removed to the accompaniment of exquisite pain     added the prisoner  helpfully .   rincewind paused .  he thought he knew the meaning of the word    exquisite     and it didn   t seem to belong anywhere near    pain .         what  every bit .     he said .      this is apparently the case .         gosh .  what was it you did .      the prisoner sighed .     you   d never believe me       he said .      the demon king let the mirror darken and drummed his fingers on his desk for a moment .  then he picked up a speaking tube and blew into it .   eventually a distant voice said     yes  guv .         yes sir .     snapped the king .   the distant voice muttered something .     yes  sir .     it added .      do we have a quezovercoatl working here .         i   ll see  guv .     the voice faded  came back .     yes  guv .         is he a duke  earl  count or baron .     said the king .      no  guv .         well  what is he .      there was a long silence at the other end .      well .     said the king .      he   s no one much  guv .      the king glared at the tube for some time .  you try  he thought .  you make proper plans  you try to get organized  you try to help people  and this is what you get .      send him to see me     he said .      outside  the music rose to a crescendo and stopped .  the fires crackled .  from the distant jungles a thousand glowing eyes watched the proceedings .   the high priest stood up and made a speech .  eric beamed like a pumpkin .  a long line of tezumen brought baskets of jewels which they scattered before him .   then the high priest made a second speech .  this one seemed to end on a question .      fine     said eric .     jolly good .  keep it up .     he scratched his ear and ventured     you can all have a half holiday .      the high priest repeated the question again  in a slightly impatient tone of voice .      i   m the one  yes     said eric  just in case they were unclear .     you   ve got it exactly right .      the high priest spoke again .  this time there was no slightly about it .         let   s just run through this again  shall we .     said the demon king .  he leaned back in his throne .      you happened to find the tezumen one day and decided  i think i recall your words correctly  that they were    a bunch of stone age no hopers sitting around in a swamp being no trouble to anyone     am i right .  whereupon you entered the mind of one of their high priests   i believe at that time they worshipped a small stick   drove him insane and inspired the tribes to unite  terrorize their neighbors and bring forth upon the continent a new nation dedicated to the proposition that all men should be taken to the top of ceremonial pyramids and be chopped up with stone knives .     the king pulled his notes toward him .     oh yes  some of them were also to be flayed alive     he added .   quezovercoatl shuffled his feet .      whereupon     said the king     they immediately engaged in a prolonged war with just about everyone else  bringing death and destruction to thousands of moderately blameless people  ekcetra  ekcetra .  now  look  this sort of thing has got to stop .      quezovercoatl swayed back a bit .      it was only  you know  a hobby     said the imp .     i thought  you know  it was the right thing  sort of thing .  death and destruction and that .         you did  did you .     said the king .     thousands of more or less innocent people dying .  straight out of our hands     he snapped his fingers     just like that .  straight off to their happy hunting ground or whatever .  that   s the trouble with you people .  you don   t think of the big picture .  i mean  look at the tezumen .  gloomy  unimaginative  obsessive   by now they could have invented a whole bureaucracy and taxation system that could have turned the minds of the continent to slag .  instead of which  they   re just a bunch of second rate axe murderers .  what a waste .      quezovercoatl squirmed .   the king swiveled the throne back and forth a bit .      now  i want you to go straight back down there and tell them you   re sorry     he said .      pardon .         tell them you   ve changed your mind .  tell them that what you really wanted them to do was strive day and night to improve the lot of their fellow men .  it   ll be a winner .         what .     said quezovercoatl  looking extremely shifty .     you want me to manifest myself .         they   ve seen you already  haven   t they .  i saw the statue  it   s very lifelike .         well  yes .  i   ve appeared in dreams and that     said the demon uncertainly .      right  then .  get on with it .      quezovercoatl was clearly unhappy about something .      er     he said .     you want me to actually materialize  sort of thing .  i mean  actually sort of turn up on the spot .         yes .         oh .         the prisoner dusted himself down and extended a wrinkled hand to rincewind .      many thanks .  ponce da quirm     he said .      pardon .         it   s my name .         oh .         it   s a proud old name     said da quirm  searching rincewind   s eyes for any traces of mockery .      fine     said rincewind blankly .      we were searching for the fountain of youth     da quirm went on .   rincewind looked him up and down .      any luck .     he said politely .      not significantly  no .      rincewind peered back down into the pit .      you said we     he said .     where   s everyone else .         they got religion .      rincewind looked up at the statue of quezovercoatl .  it took no imagination whatsoever to imagine what kind .      i think     he said carefully     that we had better go .         too true     said the old man .     and quickly  too .  before the ruler of the world turns up .      rincewind went cold .  it starts  he thought .  i knew it was all going to turn out badly  and this is where it starts .  i must have an instinct for these things .      how do you know about that .     he said .      oh  they   ve got this prophecy .  well  not a prophecy  really  it   s more the entire history of the world  start to finish .  it   s written all over this pyramid     said da quirm  cheerfully .     my word  i wouldn   t like to be the ruler when he arrives .  they   ve got plans .         eric stood up .      now just you listen to me     he said .     i   m not going to stand for this sort of thing .  i   m your ruler  you know           rincewind stared at the blocks nearest the statue .  it had taken the tezumen two stories  twenty years and ten thousand tons of granite to explain what they intended to do to the ruler of the world  but the result was  well  graphic .  he would be left in no doubt that they were annoyed .  he might even go so far as to deduce that they were quite vexed .      but why do they give him all these jewels to start with .     he said  pointing .      well  he is the ruler     said da quirm .     he   s entitled to some respect  i suppose .      rincewind nodded .  there was a sort of justice in it .  if you were a tribe who lived in a swamp in the middle of a damp forest  didn   t have any metal  had been saddled with a god like quezovercoatl  and then found someone who said he was in charge of the whole affair  you probably would want to spend some time explaining to him how incredibly disappointed you were .  the tezumen had never seen any reason to be subtle in dealing with deities .   it was a very good likeness of eric .   his eye followed the story onto the next wall .   this block showed a very good likeness of rincewind .  he had a parrot on his shoulder .      hang on     he said .     that   s me .         you should see what they   re doing to you on the next block     said the parrot smugly .     it   ll turn your wossname .      rincewind looked at the block .  his wossname revolved .      we   ll just leave very quietly     he said firmly .     i mean  we won   t stop to thank them for the meal .  we can always send them a letter later .  you know  so   s not to be impolite .         just a moment     said da quirm  as rincewind dragged at his arm     i haven   t had a chance to read all the blocks yet .  i want to see how the world   s going to end           how it   s going to end for everyone else i don   t know     said rincewind grimly  dragging him down the tunnel .     i know how it   s going to end for me .      he stepped out into the dawn light  which was fine .  where he went wrong was stepping into a semicircle of tezumen .  they had spears .  they had exquisitely chipped obsidian spearheads  which  like their swords  were nowhere near as sophisticated as ordinary  coarse  inferior steel weapons .  was it better to know that you were going to be skewered by delicate examples of genuine ethnic origin rather than nasty forge made items hammered out by people not in contact with the cycles of nature .   probably not  rincewind decided .         i always say     said da quirm     that there is a good side to everything .      rincewind  trussed to the next slab  turned his head with difficulty .      where is it at the moment  precisely .     he said .   da quirm squinted down across the swamps and the forest roof .      well .  it   s a first class view from up here  to begin with .         oh  good     said rincewind .     you know  i never would have looked at it like that .  you   re absolutely right .  it   s the kind of view you   ll remember for the rest of your life  i expect .  i mean  it   s not as if it will be any great feat of recollection .         there   s no need to be sarcastic .  i was only passing a remark .         i want my mum     said eric  from the middle slab .      chin up  lad     said da quirm .     at least you   re being sacrificed for something worthwhile .  i just suggested they try using the wheels upright  so they   d roll .  i   m afraid they   re not very responsive to new ideas around here .  still  nil desperandum .  where there   s life there   s hope .      rincewind growled .  if there was one thing he couldn   t stand  it was people who were fearless in the face of death .  it seemed to strike at something absolutely fundamental in him .      in fact     said da quirm     i think       he rolled from side to side experimentally  tugging at the vines which were holding him down .     yes  i think when they did these ropes up   yes  definitely  they           what .  what .     said rincewind .      yes  definitely     said da quirm .     i   m absolutely sure about it .  they did them up very tightly and professionally .  not an inch of give in them anywhere .         thank you     said rincewind .   the flat top of the truncated pyramid was in fact quite large  with plenty of room for statues  priests  slabs  gutters  knife chipping production lines and all the other things the tezumen needed for the bulk disposal of religion .  in front of rincewind several priests were busily chanting a long list of complaints about swamps  mosquitoes  lack of metal ore  volcanoes  the weather  the way obsidian never kept its edge  the trouble with having a god like quezovercoatl  the way wheels never worked properly however often you laid them flat and pushed them  and so on .   the prayers of most religions generally praise and thank the gods involved  either out of general piety or in the hope that he or she will take the hint and start acting responsibly .  the tezumen  having taken a long hard look around their world and decided bluntly that things were just about as bad as they were ever going to get  had perfected the art of the plain chant winge .      won   t be long now     said the parrot  from its perch atop a statue of one of the tezumen   s lesser gods .   it had got there by a complicated sequence of events that had involved a lot of squawking  a cloud of feathers and three tezuman priests with badly swollen thumbs .      the high priest is just performing a wossname in honor of quezovercoatl     it went on  conversationally .     you   ve drawn quite a crowd .         i suppose you wouldn   t kind of hop down here and bite through these ropes  would you .     said rincewind .      not a chance .         thought so .         sun   s coming up soon     the parrot continued .  rincewind felt that it sounded unnecessarily cheerful .      i   m going to complain about this  demon     moaned eric .     you wait till my mother finds out .  my parents have got influence  you know .         oh  good     said rincewind weakly .     why don   t you tell the high priest that if he cuts your heart out she   ll be right down to the school tomorrow to complain .      the tezuman priests bowed toward the sun  and all eyes in the crowd below turned to the jungle .   where something was happening .  there was the sound of crackling undergrowth .  tropical birds erupted through the trees  shrieking .   rincewind  of course  could not see this .      you never should have wanted to be ruler of the world     he said .     i mean  what did you expect .  you can   t expect people to be happy about seeing you .  no one ever is when the landlord turns up .         but they   re going to kill me .         it   s just their way of saying that  metaphorically  they   re fed up with waiting for you to repaint the place and see to the drains .      the whole jungle was in an uproar now .  animals exploded out of the bushes as if running from a fire .  a few heavy thumps indicated that trees were falling over .   at last a frantic jaguar crashed through the undergrowth and loped down the causeway .  the luggage was a few feet behind it .   it was covered with creepers  leaves and the feathers of various rare jungle fowls  some of which were now even rarer .  the jaguar could have avoided it by zigging or zagging to either side  but sheer idiot terror prevented it .  it made the mistake of turning its head to see what was behind .   this was the last mistake it ever made .      you know that box of yours .     said the parrot .      what about it .     said rincewind .      it   s heading this way .      the priests peered down at the running figure far below .  the luggage had a straightforward way of dealing with things between it and its intended destination  it ignored them .   it was at this moment  against all his instincts  in great trepidation and  most unfortunately of all  in deep ignorance of what was happening  that quezovercoatl himself chose to materialize on top of the pyramid .   several of the priests noticed him .  the knives fell from their fingers .      er     squeaked the demon .   other priests turned around .      right .  now  i want you all to pay attention     squeaked quezovercoatl  cupping his tiny hands around his main mouth in an effort to be heard .   this was very embarrassing .  he   d enjoyed being the tezuman god  he   d been really impressed by their single minded devotion to duty  he   d been very gratified by the incredible lifelike statue in the pyramid  and it really hurt to have to reveal that  in one important particular  it was incorrect .   he was six inches high .      now then     he began     this is very important        unfortunately  no one ever found out why .  at that moment the luggage breasted the top of the pyramid  its legs whirring like propellers  and landed squarely on the slabs .   there was a brief  flat squeak .      it was a funny old world  said da quirm .  you had to laugh  really .  if you didn   t  you   d go mad  wouldn   t you .  one minute strapped to a slab and about to undergo exquisite torture  the next being given breakfast  a change of clothes  a hot tub and a free lift out of the kingdom .  it made you believe there was a god .  of course  the tezumen knew there was a god  and that he was currently a small and distressing greasy patch on top of the pyramid .  which left them with a bit of a problem .   the luggage squatted in the city   s main plaza .  the entire priesthood was sitting around it and watching it carefully  in case it did anything amusing or religious .      are you going to leave it behind .     said eric .      it   s not as simple as that     said rincewind .     it generally catches up .  let   s just go away quickly .         but we   ll take the tribute  won   t we .         i think that could be an amazingly bad idea     said rincewind .     let   s just quietly go  while they   re in a good temper .  the novelty will wear off soon  i expect .         and i   ve got to get on with my search for the fountain of youth     said da quirm .      oh  yes     said rincewind .      i   ve devoted my whole life to it  you know     said the old man proudly .   rincewind looked him up and down .     really .     he said .      oh  yes .  exclusively .  ever since i was a boy .      rincewind   s expression was one of acute puzzlement .      in that case     he began  in the manner of one talking to a child     wouldn   t it have been better   you know  more sensible   if you   d just got on with           what .     said da quirm .      oh  never mind     said rincewind .     i   ll tell you what  though     he added     i think  in order to prevent you getting  you know  bored  we should present you with this wonderful talking parrot .     he made a swift grab  while keeping his thumbs firmly out of harm   s way .     it   s a jungle fowl     he said .     cruel to subject it to city life  isn   t it .         i was born in a cage  you raving wossname .     screamed the parrot .  rincewind faced it  nose to beak .      it   s that or fricassee time     he said .  the parrot opened its beak to bite his nose  saw his expression  and thought better of it .      polly want a biscuit     it managed  adding  sotto voce     wossnamewossnamewossname .         a dear little bird of my very own     said da quirm .     i shall look after it .         wossnamewossname .      they reached the jungle .  a few minutes later the luggage trotted after them .      it was noon in the kingdom of tezuma .   from inside the main pyramid came the sounds of a very large statue being dismantled .   the priests sat around thoughtfully .  occasionally one of them stood up and made a short speech .   it was clear that points were being made .  for example  how the economics of the kingdom depended on a buoyant obsidian knife industry  how the enslaved neighboring kingdoms had come to rely on the smack of firm government  and incidentally on the hack  slash and disemboweling of firm government as well  and on the terrible fate that awaited any people who didn   t have gods .  godless people might get up to anything  they might turn against the fine old traditions of thrift and non self sacrifice that had made the kingdom what it was today  they might start wondering why  if they didn   t have a god  they needed all these priests  anything .   the point was well put by mazuma  the high priest  when he said      squashed figure with broken nose  jaguar claw  three feathers  stylized spiny anteater  .      after a while a vote was taken .   by nightfall  the kingdom   s leading stonemasons were at work on a new statue .   it was basically oblong  with lots of legs .      the demon king drummed his fingers on his desk .  it wasn   t that he was unhappy about the fate of quezovercoatl  who would now have to spend several centuries in one of the nether hells while he grew a new corporeal body .  serve him right  the ghastly little imp .  nor was it the broad trend of events on the pyramid .  after all  the whole point of the wish business was to see to it that what the client got was exactly what he asked for and exactly what he didn   t really want .   it was just that he didn   t feel in control of things .   which was of course ridiculous .  if the best came to the best he could always materialize and sort things out personally .  but he liked people to believe that all the bad things happening to them were just fate and destiny .  it was one of the few things that cheered him up .   he turned back to the mirror .  after a while he had to adjust the temporal control .      one minute the breathless  humid jungles of klatch  the next        i thought we were going to go back to my room     eric complained .      i thought that  too     said rincewind  shouting to be heard over the rumbling .      snap your fingers again  demon .         not on your life .  there   s plenty of places worse than this .         but it   s all hot and dark .      rincewind had to concede that .  it was also shaking and noisy .  when his eyes grew used to the blackness he could make out a few spots of light here and there  whose dim radiance suggested that they were inside something like a boat .  there was a definite feel of carpentry about everything  and a powerful smell of wood shavings and glue .  if it was a boat  then it was having an awfully painful launching down a slipway greased with rocks .   a jolt slung him heavily against a bulkhead .      i must say     complained eric     if this is where the most beautiful woman in the world lives i don   t think much of her choice of boodwah .  you   d think she   d put a few cushions or something around the place .         boodwah .     said rincewind .      she   s bound to have one     said eric smugly .     i   ve read about    em .  she reclines on it .         tell me     said rincewind     have you ever felt the need to have a cold bath and a brisk run around the playing fields .         never .         it could be worth a try .      the rumbling stopped abruptly .   there was a distant clanging noise  such as might be made by a pair of great big gates being shut .  rincewind thought he heard some voices fading into the distance  and a chuckle .  it wasn   t a particularly pleasant chuckle  it was more of a snigger  and it boded no good for someone .  rincewind had a pretty good idea who .   he   d stopped wondering how he   d come to be here  wherever it was .  malign forces  that was probably it .  at least nothing particularly dreadful was happening to him right now .  probably it was only a matter of time .   he groped around a bit until his fingers encountered what turned out to be  following an inspection by the light of the nearest knot hole  a rope ladder .  further probing at one end of the hull  or whatever it was  brought him in contact with a small  round hatchway .  it was bolted on the inside .   he crawled back to eric .      there   s a door     he whispered .      where does it go .         it stays where it is  i think     said rincewind .      find out where it leads to  demon .         could be a bad idea     said rincewind cautiously .      get on with it .      rincewind crawled gloomily to the hatch and grasped the bolt .   the hatch creaked open .   down below   quite a long way below   there were damp cobblestones  across which a breeze was driving a few shreds of morning mist .  with a little sigh  rincewind unrolled the ladder .   two minutes later they were standing in the gloom of what appeared to be a large plaza .  a few buildings showed through the mist .      where are we .     said eric .      search me .         you don   t know .         not a clue     said rincewind .   eric glared at the mist shrouded architecture .     fat chance of finding the most beautiful woman in the world in a dump like this     he said .   it occurred to rincewind to see what they had just climbed out of .  he looked up .   above them   a long way above them   and supported on four massive legs  which ran down to a huge wheeled platform  there was undoubtedly a huge wooden horse .  more correctly  the rear of a huge wooden horse .   the builder could have put the exit hatch in a more dignified place  but for humorous reasons of his own had apparently decided not to .      er     said rincewind .   someone coughed .   he looked down .   the evaporating mists now revealed a broad circle of armed men  many of them grinning and all of them carrying mass produced  soulless but above all sharp long spears .      ah     said rincewind .   he looked back up at the hatchway .  it said it all  really .         the only thing i don   t understand     said the captain of the guard     is  why two of you .  we were expecting maybe a hundred .      he leaned back on his stool  his great plumed helmet in his lap  a pleased smile on his face .      honestly  you ephebians .     he said .     talk about laugh .  you must think we was born yesterday .  all night nothing but sawing and hammering  the next thing there   s a damn great wooden horse outside the gates  so i think  that   s funny  a bloody great wooden horse with airholes .  that   s the kind of little detail i notice  see .  airholes .  so i muster all the lads and we nips out extra early and drag it in the gates  as per expectations  and then we bides quiet  like  around it  waiting to see what it coughs up .  in a manner of speaking .  now     he pushed his unshaven face close to rincewind     you   ve got a choice  see .  top seat or bottom seat  it   s up to you .  i just have to put the word in .  you play discus with me and i   ll play discus with you .          what seat .     said rincewind  reeling from the gusts of garlic .      it   s the war triremes     said the sergeant cheerfully .     three seats  see  one above the other .  triremes .  you get chained to the oars for years  see  and it   s all according whether you   re in the top seat  up in the fresh air and that  or the bottom seat where      he grinned      you   re not .  so it   s down to you  lads .  be cooperative and all you   ll need to worry about will be the seagulls .  now .  why only the two of you .      he leaned back again .      excuse me     said eric     is that tsort  by any chance .         you wouldn   t be trying to make fun of me  would you now  boy .  only there   s such a thing as quinquiremes  see .  you wouldn   t like that at all .         no  sir     said eric .     if you please  sir  i   m just a little lad led astray by bad companionship .         oh  thank you     said rincewind bitterly .     you just accidentally drew a lot of occult circles  did you  and           sarge .  sarge .     a soldier burst into the guardroom .  the sergeant looked up .      there   s another of    em  sarge .  right outside the gates this time .      the sergeant grinned triumphantly at rincewind .      oh  that   s it  is it .     he said .     you were just the advance party  come to open the gates or whatever .  right .  we   ll just go and sort your friends out  and we   ll be right back .     he indicated the captives .     you stay here .  if they move  do something horrible to them .      rincewind and eric were left alone with the guard .      you know what you   ve done  don   t you     said eric .     you   ve only taken us all the way back to the tsortean wars .  thousands of years .  we did it at school  the wooden horse  everything .  how the beautiful elenor was kidnaped from the ephebians   or maybe it was by the ephebians   and there was this siege to get her back and everything .     he paused .     hey  that means i   m going to meet her .     he paused again .     wow .     he said .   rincewind looked around the room .  it didn   t look ancient  but then it wouldn   t  because it wasn   t  yet .  everywhere in time was now  once you were there  or then .  he tried to remember what little he knew of classical history  but it was just a confusion of battles  one eyed giants and women launching thousands of ships with their faces .      don   t you see .     hissed eric  his glasses aglow .     they must have brought the horse in before the soldiers had hidden in it .  we know what   s going to happen .  we could make a fortune .         how  exactly .         well       the boy hesitated .     we could bet on horses  that sort of thing .         great idea     said rincewind .      yes  and           all we   ve got to do is escape  then find out if they have horse races here  and then really try hard to remember the names of the horses that won races in tsort thousands of years ago .      they went back to looking glumly at the floor .  that was the thing about time travel .  you were never ready for it .  about the only thing he could hope for  rincewind decided  was finding da quirm   s fountain of youth and managing to stay alive for a few thousand years so he   d be ready to kill his own grandfather  which was the only aspect of time travel that had ever remotely appealed to him .  he had always felt that his ancestors had it coming to them .   funny thing  though .  he could remember the famous wooden horse  which had been used to trick a way into the fortified city .  he didn   t remember anything about there being two of them .  there was something inevitable about the next thought that turned up .      excuse me     he said to the guard .     this  er  this second wooden thing outside the gate   it   s probably not a horse  i expect .         well  of course you   d know that  wouldn   t you .     said the guard .     you   re spies .         i bet it   s more oblong and sort of smaller .     said rincewind  his face a picture of innocent inquiry .      you bet .  pretty unimaginative bastards  aren   t you .         i see .     rincewind folded his hands on his lap .      try to escape     said the guard .     go on  just try it .  you try it and see what happens .         i expect your colleagues will be bringing it into the city     rincewind went on .      they might do that     the guard conceded .   eric began to giggle .   it had begun to dawn on the guard that there was a lot of shouting going on in the distance .  someone tried to blow a bugle  but the notes gurgled into silence after a few bars .      bit of a fight going on out there  by the sound of it     said rincewind .     people winning their spurs  doing heroic deeds of valor  being noticed by superior officers  that sort of thing .  and here   s you hanging around in here with us .         i   ve got to stick to my post     said the guard .      exactly the right attitude     said rincewind .     never mind about everyone else out there fighting valiantly to defend their city and womenfolk against the foe .  you stop in here and guard us .  that   s the spirit .  they   ll probably put up a statue to you in the city square  if there   s one left .     he did his duty     they   ll write on it .      the soldier appeared to think about this  and while he was doing so there was a terrible splintering creak from the direction of the main gates .      look     he said desperately     if i just pop out for a moment           don   t you worry about us     said rincewind encouragingly .     it   s not even as if we   re armed .         right     said the soldier .     thanks .      he gave rincewind a worried smile and hurried off in the direction of the noise .  eric looked at rincewind with something like admiration .      that was actually quite amazing     he said .      going to go a long way  that lad     said rincewind .     a sound military thinker if ever i saw one .  come on .  let   s run away .         where to .      rincewind sighed .  he   d tried to make his basic philosophy clear time and again  and people never got the message .      don   t you worry about to     he said .     in my experience that always takes care of itself .  the important word is away .         the captain raised his head cautiously over the barricade  and snarled .      it   s just a little box  sergeant     he snapped .     it   s not even as if it could hold one or two men .         beg pardon  sir     said the sergeant  and his face was the face of a man whose world has changed a lot in a few short minutes .     it holds at least four  sir .  corporal disuse and his squad  sir .  i sent them out to open it  sir .         are you drunk  sergeant .         not yet  sir     said the sergeant  with feeling .      little boxes don   t eat people  sergeant .         after that it got angry  sir .  you can see what it did to the gates .      the captain peered over the broken timbers again .      i suppose it grew legs and walked over there  did it .     he said sarcastically .   the sergeant broke into a relieved grin .  at last they seemed to be on the same wavelength .      got it in one  sir     he said .     legs .  hundreds of the little bleeders  sir .      the captain glared at him .  the sergeant put on the poker face that has been handed down from nco to nco ever since one protoamphibian told another  lower ranking protoamphibian to muster a squad of newts and take that beach .  the captain was eighteen and fresh from the academy  where he had passed with flying colors in such subjects as classical tactics  valedictory odes and military grammar .  the sergeant was fifty five  and instead of an education he had spent about forty years attacking or being attacked by harpies  humans  cyclopses  furies and horrible things on legs .  he felt put upon .      well  i   m going to have a look at it  sergeant              not a good plan  sir  if i may              and after i   ve had a look at it  sergeant  there is going to be trouble .      the sergeant threw him a salute .     right you are  sir     he predicted .   the captain snorted and climbed over the barricade toward the box which sat  silent and unmoving  in its circle of devastation .  the sergeant  meanwhile  slid into a sitting position behind the stoutest timber he could find and  with great determination  pulled his helmet down hard over his ears .      rincewind crept through the streets of the city  with eric tagging along behind .      are we going to find elenor .     the boy said .      no     said rincewind firmly .     what we   re going to do is  we   re going to find another way out .  and we   re going to go out through it .         that   s not fair .         she   s thousands of years older than you .  i mean  attraction of the mature woman  all right  but it   d never work out .         i demand that you take me to her     wailed eric .     avaunt .      rincewind stopped so sharply that eric walked into him .      listen     he said .     we   re in the middle of the most famously fatuous war there has ever been  any minute now thousands of warriors will be locked in mortal combat  and you want me to go and find this overrated female and say  my friend wants to know if you   ll go out with him .  well  i won   t .     rincewind stalked up to another gateway in the city wall  it was smaller than the main one  didn   t have any guards  and had a wicket gate in it .  rincewind slid back the bolts .      this isn   t anything to do with us     he said .     we haven   t even been born yet  we   re not old enough to fight  it isn   t our business and we   re not going to do anything more to upset the course of history  all right .      he opened the door  which saved the entire ephebian army a bit of effort .  they were just about to knock .      all day long the noise of battle raged .  this was chronicled by later historians  who went on at length about beautiful women being kidnaped  fleets being assembled  wooden animals being constructed  heroes fighting one another  and completely failed to mention the part played by rincewind  eric and the luggage .  the ephebians did notice  however  how enthusiastically the tsortean soldiery ran toward them   not so much keen to get into battle as very anxious to get away from something else .   the historians also failed to note another interesting fact about ancient klatchian warfare  which was that it was still at that stage quite primitive and just between soldiers and hadn   t yet been thrown open to the general public .  basically  everyone knew that one side or the other would win  a few unlucky generals would get their heads chopped off  large sums of money would be paid in tribute to the winners  everyone would go home for the harvest and that bloody woman would have to make up her mind whose side she was on  the hussy .   so tsortean street life went on more or less as normal  with the citizens stepping around the occasional knots of fighting men or trying to sell them kebabs .  several of the more enterprising ones began dismantling the wooden horse for souvenirs .   rincewind didn   t attempt to understand it .  he sat down at a street caf   and watched a spirited battle take place between market stalls  so that amid the cries of    ripe olives .     there were the screams of the wounded and shouts of    mind your backs please  m  l  e coming through .      the hard part was watching the soldiers apologize when they bumped into customers .  the even harder part was getting the caf   owner to accept a coin bearing the head of someone whose great great great grandfather wasn   t born yet .  fortunately  rincewind was able to persuade the man that the future was another country .      and a lemonade for the boy     he added .      my parents let me drink wine     said eric .     i   m allowed one glass .         i bet you are     said rincewind .   the owner industriously swabbed the tabletop  spreading its coating of dregs and spilt retsina into a thin varnish .      up for the fight  are you .     he said .      in a manner of speaking     said rincewind guardedly .      i shouldn   t wander around too much     said the owner .     they do say a civilian let the ephebians in   not that i   ve got anything against ephebians  a fine body of men     he added hurriedly  as a knot of soldiery jogged past .     a stranger  they say .  that   s cheating  using civilians .  there   s people out looking for him so   s they can explain .     he made a chopping motion with his hand .   rincewind stared at the hand as though hypnotized .   eric opened his mouth .  eric screeched and clutched at his shins .      have they got a description .     rincewind said .      don   t think so .         well  best of luck to them     said rincewind  rather more cheerfully .      what   s up with the lad .         cramp .      when the man had gone back behind his counter eric hissed     you didn   t have to go and kick me .         you   re quite right .  it was an entirely voluntary act on my part .      a heavy hand dropped onto rincewind   s shoulder .  he looked around and up into the face of an ephebian centurion .  a soldier beside him said     that   s the one  sarge .  i   d bet a year   s salt .         who   d of thought it .     said the sergeant .  he gave rincewind an evil grin .     up we come  chummy .  the chief would like a word with you .         some talk of alexander and some of hercules  of hector and lysander and such great names as these .  in fact  throughout the history of the multiverse people have said nice things about every cauliflower eared sword swinger  at least in their vicinity  on the basis that it is a lot safer that way .  it   s funny how the people have always respected the kind of commander who comes up with strategies like    i want fifty thousand of you chappies to rush at the enemy     whereas the more thoughtful commanders who say things like    why don   t we build a damn great wooden horse and then nip in at the back gate while they   re all around the thing waiting for us to come out    are considered only one step above common oiks and not the kind of person you   d lend money to .   this is because most of the first type of commander are brave men  whereas cowards make far better strategists .   rincewind was dragged before the ephebian leaders  who had set up a command post in the city   s main square so that they could oversee the storming of the central citadel  which loomed over the city on its vertiginous hill .  they were not too close  however  because the defenders were dropping rocks .   they were discussing strategy when rincewind arrived .  the consensus seemed to be that if really large numbers of men were sent to storm the mountain  then enough might survive the rocks to take the citadel .  this is essentially the basis of all military thinking .   several of the more impressively dressed chieftains glanced up when rincewind and eric approached  gave them a look which suggested that maggots were more interesting  and turned away again .  the only person who seemed pleased to see them        didn   t look like a soldier at all .  he had the armor  which was tarnished  and he had the helmet  which looked as though its plume had been used as a paintbrush  but he was skinny and had all the military bearing of a weasel .  there was something vaguely familiar about his face  though .  rincewind thought it looked quite handsome .      pleased to see them    was only a comparative description .  he was the only one who acknowledged their existence .   he was lounging in a chair and feeding the luggage with sandwiches .      oh  hallo     he said gloomily .     it   s you .      it was amazing how much information can be crammed into a couple of words .  to achieve the same effect the man could have said  it   s been a long night  i   m having to organize everything from wooden horse building to the laundry rota  these idiots are about as much help as a rubber hammer  i never wanted to be here anyway and  on top of all this  there   s you .  hallo  you .   he indicated the luggage  which opened its lid expectantly .      this yours .     he said .      sort of     said rincewind guardedly .     i can   t afford to pay for anything it   s done  mind you .         funny little thing  isn   t it .     said the soldier .     we found it herding fifty tsorteans into a corner .  why was it doing that  do you think .      rincewind thought quickly .     it has this amazing ability to know when people are thinking about harming me     he said .  he glared at the luggage as one might glare at a sly  evil tempered and generally reprehensible family pet who  after years of biting visitors  has rolled over on its scabby back and played at lovable puppy to impress the bailiffs .      yes .     said the man  without much surprise .     magic  is it .         yes .         something in the wood  is it .         yes .         good job we didn   t build the sodding horse out of it  then .         yes .         got into it by magic  did you .         yes .         thought so .     he threw another sandwich at the luggage .     where you from .      rincewind decided to come clean .     the future     he said .  this didn   t have the expected effect .  the man just nodded .      oh     he said  and then he said     did we win .         yes .         oh .  i suppose you can   t remember the results of any horse races .     said the man  without much hope .      no .         i thought you probably wouldn   t .  why did you open the gate for us .      it occurred to rincewind that saying it was because he had always been a firm admirer of the ephebian political position would not  strangely enough  be the right thing to do .  he decided to try the truth again .  it was a novel approach and worth experimenting with .      i was looking for a way out     he said .      to run away .         yes .         good man .  only sensible thing  in the circumstances .     he noticed eric  who was staring at the other captains clustered around their table and deep in argument .      you  lad     he said .     want to be a soldier when you grow up .         no  sir .      the man brightened a bit .      that   s the stuff     he said .      i want to be a eunuch  sir     eric added .   rincewind   s head turned as though it was being dragged .      why .     he said  and then came up with the obvious answer at the same time as eric     because you get to work in a harem all day long     they chorused slowly .   the captain coughed .      you   re not this boy   s teacher  are you .     he said .      no .         do you think anyone has explained to him    .         no .         perhaps it would be a good idea if i got one of the centurions to have a word .  you   d be amazed at the grasp of language those chaps have got .         do him the power of good  i expect     said rincewind .   the soldier picked up his helmet  sighed  nodded at the sergeant and smoothed out the creases in his cloak .  it was a grubby cloak .      i think i   m expected to tell you off  or something     he said .      what for .         spoiling the war  apparently .         spoiling the war .      the soldier sighed .     come on .  let   s go for a stroll .  sergeant   you and a couple of lads  please .      a stone whistled down from the fort high above them  and shattered .      they can hold out for bloody weeks  up there     said the soldier gloomily  as they walked away with the luggage padding patiently behind them .     i   m lavaeolus .  who   re you .         he   s my demon     said eric .   lavaeolus raised an eyebrow  the closest he ever came to expressing surprise at anything .      is he .  i suppose it takes all sorts .  any good at getting in places  is he .         he   s more the getting out kind     said eric .      right     said lavaeolus .  he stopped beside a building and walked up and down a bit with his hands in his pockets  tapping on the flagstones with the toe of his sandal .      just here  i think  sergeant     he said  after a while .      right you are  sir .         look at that lot  will you .     said lavaeolus  while the sergeant and his men started to lever up the stones .     that bunch around the table .  brave lads  i   ll grant you  but look at them .  too busy posing for triumphant statues and making sure the historians spell their names right .  bloody years we   ve been laying siege to this place .  more military  they said .  you know  they actually enjoy it .  i mean  when all   s said and done  who cares .  let   s just get it over with and go home  that   s what i say .         found it  sir     said the sergeant .      right .     lavaeolus didn   t look around .     o kay .     he rubbed his hands together .     let   s sort this out  and then we can get an early night .  would you care to accompany me .  your pet might be useful .         what are we going to do .     said rincewind suspiciously .      we   re just going to meet some people .         is it dangerous .      a stone smashed through the roof of a building nearby .      no  not really     said lavaeolus .     compared to staying out here  i mean .  and if the rest of them try to storm the place  you know  in a proper military way        the hole led into a tunnel .  the tunnel  after winding a bit  led to stairs .  lavaeolus mooched along it  occasionally kicking bits of fallen masonry as if he had a personal grudge against them .      er     said rincewind     where does this lead .         oh  it   s just a secret passageway into the center of the citadel .         you know  i thought it would be something like that     said rincewind .     i   ve got an instinct for it  you know .  and i expect all the really top tsorteans will be up there  will they .         i hope so     said lavaeolus  trudging up the steps .      with lots of guards .         dozens  i imagine .         highly trained  too .      lavaeolus nodded .     the best .         and this is where we   re going     said rincewind  determined to explore the full horror of the plan as one probes the site of a rotting tooth .      that   s right .         all six of us .         and your box  of course .         oh  yes     said rincewind  making a face in the darkness .   the sergeant tapped him gently on the shoulder and leaned forward .      don   t you worry about the captain  sir     he said .     he   s got the finest military brain on the continent .         how do you know .  has anyone ever seen it .     said rincewind .      you see  sir  what it is  he likes to get it over with without anyone getting hurt  sir  especially him .  that   s why he dreams up things like the horse  sir .  and bribing people and that .  we got into civvies last night and come in and got drunk in a pub with one of the palace cleaners  see  and found out about this tunnel .         yes  but secret passages .     said rincewind .     there   ll be guards and everything at the other end .         no  sir .  they use it to store the cleaning things  sir .      there was a clang in the darkness ahead of them .  lavaeolus had tripped over a mop .      sergeant .         sir .         just open the door  will you .      eric was tugging at rincewind   s robe .      what .     said rincewind testily .      you know who lavaeolus is  don   t you .     whispered eric .      well           he   s lavaeolus .         get away .         don   t you know the classics .         that isn   t one of these horse races we   re supposed to remember  is it .      eric rolled his eyes .     lavaeolus was responsible for the fall of tsort  on account of being so cunning     he said .     and then afterward it took him ten years to get home and he had all sorts of adventures with temptresses and sirens and sensual witches .         well  i can see why you   ve been studying him .  ten years  eh .  where did he live .         about two hundred miles away     said eric earnestly .      kept getting lost  did he .         and when he got home he fought his wife   s suitors and everything  and his dear old dog recognized him and died .         oh  dear .         it was the carrying his slippers in its mouth for fifteen years that killed it off .         shame .         and you know what  demon .  all this hasn   t happened yet .  we could save him all that trouble .      rincewind thought about this .     we could tell him to get a better navigator  for a start     he said .   there was a creak .  the soldiers had got the door open .      everyone fall in  or whatever the bloody stupid command is     said lavaeolus .     the magic box to the front  please .  no killing anyone unless it   s really necessary .  try not to damage things .  right .  forward .      the door led into a column lined corridor .  there was the distant murmur of voices .   the troop crept toward the sound until it reached a heavy curtain .  lavaeolus took a deep breath  pushed it aside and stepped forward and launched into a prepared speech .      now  i want to make myself absolutely clear     he said .     i don   t want there to be any unpleasantness of any kind  or any shouting for guards and so forth .  or indeed any shouting at all .  we will just take the young lady and go home  which is where anyone of any sense ought to be .  otherwise i shall really have to put everyone to the sword  and i hate having to do things like that .      the audience to this statement did not appear to be impressed .  this was because it was a small child on a potty .   lavaeolus changed mental gear and went on smoothly     on the other hand  if you don   t tell me where everyone is  i shall ask the sergeant here to give you a really hard smack .      the child took its thumb out of its mouth .     mummy is seeing to cassie     it said .     are you mr .  beekle .         i don   t think so     said lavaeolus .      mr .  beekle is a silly .     the child withdrew its thumb and  with the air of one concluding some exhaustive research  added     mr .  beekle is a poo .         sergeant .         sir .         guard this child .         yessir .  corporal .         sarge .         take care of the kid .         yes  sarge .  private archeios .         yes  corp     said the soldier  his voice gloomy with prescience .      see to the sprog .      private archeios looked around .  there were only rincewind and eric left and  while it was true that a civilian was in every respect the lowest possible rank there was  coming somewhere after the regimental donkey  the expressions on their faces suggested that they weren   t about to take any orders .   lavaeolus wandered across the room and listened at another curtain .      we could tell him all kinds of stuff about his future     hissed eric .     he had   i mean  he will have   all kinds of things happen to him .  shipwrecks and magic and all his crew turned into animals and stuff like that .         yes .  we could say    walk home        said rincewind .   the curtain swished aside .   there was a woman there   plump  good looking in a slightly faded way  wearing a black dress and the beginnings of a mustache .  a number of children of varying sizes were trying to hide behind her .  rincewind counted at least seven of them .      who   s that .     said eric .      ahem     said rincewind .     i rather think it   s elenor of tsort .         don   t be silly     whispered eric .     she looks like my mum .  elenor was much younger and was all       his voice gave out and he made several wavy motions with his hand  indicative of the shape of a woman who would probably be unable to keep her balance .   rincewind tried not to catch the sergeant   s eye .      yes     he said  going a bit red .     well  you see .  er .  you   re absolutely right  but well  it   s been a long siege  hasn   t it  what with one thing and another .         i don   t see what that   s got to do with it     said eric sternly .     the classics never said anything about children .  they said she spent all her time mooning around the towers of tsort and pining for her lost love .         well  yes  i expect she did pine a bit     said rincewind .     only  you know  you can only pine so much  and it must have been a bit chilly up on those towers .         you can catch your death  mooning     nodded the sergeant .   lavaeolus watched the woman thoughtfully .  then he bowed .      i expect you know why we   re here  my lady .     he said .      if you touch any of the children i shall scream     said elenor flatly .   once again lavaeolus showed that along with his guerrilla abilities was a marked reluctance to waste a prepared speech once he had it all sorted out in his head .      fair maiden     he began .     we have faced many dangers in order to rescue you and take you back to your loved       his voice faltered .        ones .  er .  this has all gone terribly wrong  hasn   t it .         i can   t help it     said elenor .     the siege seemed to go on for such a long time and king mausoleum was very kind and i never liked it much in ephebe anyway           where is everyone now .  the tsorteans  i mean .  apart from you .         they   re all out on the battlements throwing rocks  if you must know .      lavaeolus flung up his hands in desperation .      couldn   t you  you know  have slipped us a note or something .  or invited us to one of the christenings .         you all seemed to be enjoying yourselves so much     she said .   lavaeolus turned and shrugged gloomily .     all right     he said .     fine .  qed .  no problem .  i wanted to leave home and spend ten years sitting in a swamp with a bunch of meat headed morons .  it wasn   t as if i had anything important to do back home  just a little kingdom to rule  that sort of thing .  o kay .  well  then .  we might as well be off .  i   m sure i don   t know how i shall break it to everyone     he said bitterly     they were having such fun .  they   ll probably have a bloody great banquet and laugh about it and get drunk  it   d be their style .      he looked at rincewind and eric .      you might as well tell me what happens next     he said .     i   m sure you know .         um     said rincewind .      the city burns down     said eric .     especially the topless towers .  i didn   t get to see them     he added sulkily .      who did it .  their lot or our lot .     said lavaeolus .      your lot  i think     said eric .   lavaeolus sighed .     sounds like them     he said .  he turned to elenor .     our lot   that is  my lot   are going to burn down the city     he said .     it sounds very heroic .  it   s just the kind of thing they go for .  it might be a good idea to come with us .  bring the kids .  make it a day out for all the family  why don   t you .      eric pulled rincewind   s ear toward his mouth .      this is a joke  isn   t it .     he said .     she   s not really the fair elenor  you   re just having me on .         it   s always the same with these hot blooded types     said rincewind .     they definitely go downhill at thirty five .         it   s the pasta that does it     said the sergeant .      but i read where she was the most beautiful           ah  well     said the sergeant .     if you   re going to go around reading           the thing is     said rincewind quickly     it   s what they call dramatic necessity .  no one   s going to be interested in a war fought over a  a quite pleasant lady  moderately attractive in a good light .  are they .      eric was nearly in tears .      but it said her face launched a thousand ships           that   s what you call metaphor     said rincewind .      lying     the sergeant explained  kindly .      anyway  you shouldn   t believe everything you read in the classics     rincewind added .     they never check their facts .  they   re just out to sell legends .      lavaeolus  meanwhile  was deep in argument with elenor .      all right  all right     he said .     stay here if you like .  why should i care .  come on  you lot .  we   re going .  what are you doing  private archeios .         i   m being a horse  sir     explained the soldier .      he   s mr .  poo     said the child  who was wearing private archeios    helmet .      well  when you   ve finished being a horse  find us an oil lamp .  i caught my knees a right wallop in that tunnel .         flames roared over tsort .  the entire hubward sky was red .   rincewind and eric watched from a rock down by the beach .      they   re not topless towers  anyway     said eric after a while .     i can see the tops .         i think they meant toppleless towers     rincewind hazarded  as another one collapsed  red hot  into the ruins of the city .     and that was wrong  too .      they watched in silence for a while longer  and then eric said     funny  that .  the way you tripped over the luggage and dropped the lamp and everything .         yes     said rincewind shortly .      makes you think history is always going to find a way to work itself out .         yes .         good  though  the way your luggage rescued everyone .         yes .         funny to see all those kids riding on its back .         yes .         everyone seems quite pleased about it .      the opposing armies were  at any rate .  no one was bothering to ask the civilians  whose views on warfare were never very reliable .  among the soldiery  at least among the soldiery of a certain rank  there was a lot of back slapping and telling of anecdotes  jovial exchanging of shields and a general consensus that  what with fires and sieges and armadas and wooden horses and everything  it had been a jolly good war .  the sound of singing echoed across the wine dark sea .      hark at them     said lavaeolus  emerging from the gloom around the beached ephebian ships .     it   ll be fifteen choruses of    the ball of philodelphus    next  you mark my words .  lot of idiots with their brains in their jockstraps .      he sat down on the rock .     bastards     he said  with feeling .      do you think elenor will be able to explain it all to her boyfriend .     said eric .      i imagine so     said lavaeolus .     they usually can .         she did get married .  and she   s got lots of children     said eric .   lavaeolus shrugged .     a moment   s wild passion     he said .  he gave rincewind a sharp look .      hey  you  demon     he said .     i   d like a quiet word  if i may .      he led rincewind toward the boats  pacing heavily across the damp sand as if there was a lot weighing on his mind .      i   m going home tonight  on the tide     he said .     no sense in hanging about here  what with the war being over and everything .         good idea .         if there   s one thing i hate  it   s sea voyages     said lavaeolus .  he gave the nearest boat a kick .     it   s all idiots striding around and shouting  you know .  pull this  lower that  avast the other .  and i get seasick  too .         it   s heights with me     said rincewind  sympathetically .   lavaeolus kicked the boat again  obviously wrestling with some big emotional problem .      the thing is     he said  wretchedly .     you wouldn   t happen to know if i get home all right  would you .         what .         it   s only a few hundred miles  it shouldn   t take too long  should it .     said lavaeolus  radiating anxiety like a lighthouse .      oh .     rincewind looked at the man   s face .  ten years  he thought .  and all kinds of weird stuff with winged wossnames and sea monsters .  on the other hand  would it do him any good to know .      you get home okay     he said .     you   re well known for it  in fact .  there   s whole legends about you going home .         phew .     lavaeolus leaned against a hull  took off his helmet and wiped his forehead .     that   s a load off my mind  i   ll tell you .  i was afraid the gods might have a grudge against me .      rincewind said nothing .      they get a bit angry if you go around thinking up ideas like wooden horses and tunnels     said lavaeolus .     they   re traditionalists  you know .  they prefer people just to hack at one another .  i thought  you see  that if i could show people how to get what they wanted more easily they   d stop being so bloody stupid .      from further along the shoreline came the sound of male voices raised in song         vestal virgins  came down from heliodeliphilodelphiboschromenos  and when the ball was over  there were           it never works     said rincewind .      it   s got to be worth a try  though .  hasn   t it .         oh  yes .      lavaeolus slapped him on the back .     cheer up     he said .     things can only get better .      they walked out into the dark breakers where lavaeolus    ship was riding at anchor  and rincewind watched him swim out and climb aboard .  after a while the oars were shipped  or unshipped  or whatever they called it when they were stuck through the holes in the sides  and the boat moved slowly out into the bay .   a few voices floated back over the surf .      point the pointed end that way  sergeant .         aye aye  sir .         and don   t shout .  did i tell you to shout .  why do you all have to shout .  now i   m going downstairs for a lie down .      rincewind trudged back up the beach .     the trouble is     he said     is that things never get better  they just stay the same  only more so .  but he   s going to have enough to worry about .      behind him  eric blew his nose .      that was the saddest thing i   ve ever heard     he said .   from farther along the beach the ephebian and tsortean armies were still in full voice around their convivial campfires .         the village harpy she was there           come on     said rincewind .     let   s go home .         you know the funny thing about his name .     said eric  as they strolled along the sand .      no .  what do you mean .         lavaeolus means    rinser of winds .         rincewind looked at him .      he   s my ancestor .     he said .      who knows .     said eric .      oh .  gosh .     rincewind thought about this .     well  i wish i   d told him to avoid getting married .  or visiting ankh morpork .         it probably isn   t even built yet        rincewind tried snapping his fingers .   this time it worked .      astfgl sat back .  he wondered what did happen to lavaeolus .   gods and demons  being creatures outside of time  don   t move in it like bubbles in the stream .  everything happens at the same time for them .  this should mean that they know everything that is going to happen because  in a sense  it already has .  the reason they don   t is that reality is a big place with a lot of interesting things going on  and keeping track of all of them is like trying to use a very big video recorder with no freeze button or tape counter .  it   s usually easier just to wait and see .   one day he   d have to go and look .   right here and now  insofar as the words can be employed about an area outside of space and time  matters were not progressing well .  eric seemed marginally more likeable  which wasn   t acceptable .  he also appeared to have changed the course of history  although this is impossible since the only thing you can do to the course of history is facilitate it .   what was needed was something climactic .  something really soul destroying .   the demon king realized he was twirling his mustaches .      the trouble with snapping your fingers is that you never knew what it would lead to     everything around rincewind was black .  it wasn   t simply an absence of color .  it was a darkness that flatly denied any possibility that color might ever have existed .   his feet weren   t touching anything  and he appeared to be floating .  there was something else missing .  he couldn   t quite put his finger on it .      are you there  eric .     he ventured .   a clear voice nearby said     yes .  are you there  demon .         ye   ess .         where are we .  are we falling .         i don   t think so     said rincewind  speaking from experience .     there   s no rushing wind .  you get a rushing wind when you   re falling .  also your past life flashes before your eyes  and i haven   t seen anything i recognize yet .         rincewind .         yes .         when i open my mouth no sounds come out .         don   t be       rincewind hesitated .  he wasn   t making any sound either .  he knew what he was saying  it just wasn   t reaching the outside world .  but he could hear eric .  perhaps the words just gave up on his ears and went straight to his brain .      it   s probably some kind of magic  or something     he said .     there   s no air .  that   s why there   s no sound .  all the little bits of air sort of knock together  like marbles .  that   s how you get sound  you know .         is it .  gosh .         so we   re surrounded by absolutely nothing     said rincewind .     total nothing .     he hesitated .     there   s a word for it     he said .     it   s what you get when there   s nothing left and everything   s been used up .         yes .  i think it   s called the bill     said eric .   rincewind gave this some thought .  it sounded about right .     okay     he said .     the bill .  that   s where we are .  floating in absolute bill .  total  complete  rock hard bill .         astfgl was going frantic now .  he had spells that could find anyone anywhere  anywhen  and they weren   t anywhere .  one minute he was watching them on the beach  the next   nothing .   that left only two other places .   fortunately he chose the wrong one first .         even some stars would be nice     said eric .      there   s something very odd about all this     said rincewind .     i mean  do you feel cold .         no .         well  do you feel warm .         no .  i don   t feel anything much  really .         no hot  no cold  no light  no heat  no air     said rincewind .     just bill .  how long have we been here .         don   t know .  seems like ages  but           aha .  i   m not sure there   s any time  either .  not what you   d call proper time .  just the kind of time people make up as they go along .         well  i didn   t expect to see anyone else here     said a voice by rincewind   s ear .   it was a slightly put upon voice  a voice made for complaining in  but at least there was no hint of menace .  rincewind let himself float around .   a little rat faced man was sitting cross legged  watching him with vague suspicion .  he had a pencil behind one ear .      ah .  hallo     said rincewind .     and where is here  exactly .         nowhere .  s   whole point  innit .         nowhere at all .         not yet .         all right     said eric .     when is it going to be somewhere .         hard to say     said the little man .     looking at the pair of you  and taking one thing with another  metabolic rates and that  i   d say that this place is due to become somewhere in  well  give or take a bit  in about five hundred seconds .     he began to unwrap the pack in his lap .     fancy a sandwich while we   re waiting .         what .  would i       at this point rincewind   s stomach  aware that if his brain was allowed to make the running it was in danger of losing the initiative  cut in and prompted him to say     what sort .         search me .  what sort would you like it to be .         sorry .         don   t mess about .  just say what sort you   d like it to be .         oh .     rincewind stared at him .     well  if you   ve got egg and cress           let there be egg and cress  sort of thing     said the little man .  he reached into the package  and proffered a white triangle to rincewind .      gosh     said rincewind .     what a coincidence .         it should be starting any minute now     said the little man .     over   not that they   ve got any proper directions sorted out yet  of course  not them   there .         all i can see is darkness     said eric .      no you can   t     said the little man  triumphantly .     you   re just seeing what there is before the darkness has been installed  sort of thing .     he gave the not yet darkness a dirty look .     come on     he said .     why are we waiting  why eye are we waiting .         waiting for what .     said rincewind .      everything .         everything what .     said rincewind .      everything .  not everything what .  everything  sort of thing .         astfgl peered around through the swirling gas clouds .  at least he was in the right place .  the whole point about the end of the universe was that you couldn   t go past it accidentally .   the last few embers winked out .  time and space collided silently  and collapsed .   astfgl coughed .  it can get so very lonely  when you   re twenty million light years from home .      anyone there .     he said .   yes .   the voice was right by his ear .  even demon kings can shiver .      apart from you  i mean     he said .     have you seen anybody .      yes .      who .      everyone .   astfgl sighed .     i mean anyone recently .      it   s been very quiet  said death .      damn .      were you expecting someone else .      i thought there might be someone called rincewind  but       astfgl began .   death   s eyesockets flared red .  the wizard .  he said .      no  he   s a dem       astfgl stopped .  for what would have been several seconds  had time still existed  he floated in a state of horrible suspicion .      a human .     he growled .   it is stretching the term a little  but you are broadly correct .      well  i   ll be damned .     astfgl said .   i believe you already are .   the demon king extended a shaking hand .  his mounting fury was overriding his sense of style  his red silk gloves ripped as the talons unfolded .   and then  because it   s never a good idea to get on the wrong side of anyone with a scythe  astfgl said     sorry you   ve been troubled     and vanished .  only when he judged himself out of death   s extremely acute hearing did he scream his rage .   nothingness uncoiled its interminable length through the drafty spaces at the end of time .   death waited .  after a while his skeletal fingers began to drum on the handle of his scythe .   darkness lapped around him .  there wasn   t even any infinity anymore .   he attempted to whistle a few snatches of unpopular songs between his teeth  but the sound was simply sucked into nothingness .   forever was over .  all the sands had fallen .  the great race between entropy and energy had been run  and the favorite had been the winner after all .   perhaps he ought to sharpen the blade again .   no .   not much point  really .   great roils of absolutely nothing stretched into what would have been called the distance  if there had been a space time reference frame to give words like    distance    any sensible meaning anymore .   there didn   t seem to be much to do .   perhaps it   s time to call it a day  he thought .   death turned to go but  just as he did so  he heard the faintest of noises .  it was to sound what one photon is to light  so weak and feeble that it would have passed entirely unheard in the din of an operating universe .   it was a tiny piece of matter  popping into existence .   death stalked over to the point of arrival and watched carefully .   it was a paperclip .    well  it was a start .   there was another pop  which left a small white shirt button spinning gently in the vacuum .   death relaxed a little .  of course  it was going to take some time .  there was going to be an interlude before all this got complicated enough to produce gas clouds  galaxies  planets and continents  let alone tiny corkscrew shaped things wiggling around in slimy pools and wondering whether evolution was worth all the bother of growing fins and legs and things .  but it indicated the start of an unstoppable trend .   all he had to do was be patient  and he was good at that .  pretty soon there   d be living creatures  developing like mad  running and laughing in the new sunlight .  growing tired .  growing old .   death sat back .  he could wait .   whenever they needed him  he   d be there .      the universe came into being .   any created again cosmogonist will tell you that all the interesting stuff happened in the first couple of minutes  when nothingness bunched together to form space and time and lots of really tiny black holes appeared and so on .  after that  they say  it became just a matter of  well  matter .  it was basically all over bar the microwave radiation .   seen from close by  though  it had a certain gaudy attraction .   the little man sniffed .      too showy     he said .     you don   t need all that noise .  it could just as easily have been a big hiss  or a bit of music .         could it .     said rincewind .      yeah  and it looked pretty iffy around the two picosecond mark .  definitely a bit of ropey fillingin .  but that   s how it goes these days .  no craftsmanship .  when i was a lad it took days to make a universe .  you could take a bit of pride in it .  now they just throw it together and it   s back on the lorry and away .  and  you know what .         no .     said rincewind weakly .      they pinches stuff off the site .  they finds someone nearby who wants to expand their universe a bit  next thing you know they   ve had it away with a bunch of firmament and flogged it for an extension somewhere .      rincewind stared at him .      who are you .      the man took the pencil from behind his ear and looked reflectively at the space around rincewind .     i makes things     he said .      what sort of things .         what sort of things would you like .         you   re the creator .      the little man looked very embarrassed .     not the .  not the .  just a .  i don   t contract for the big stuff  the stars  the gas giants  the pulsars and so on .  i just specialize in what you might call the bespoke trade .     he gave them a look of defiant pride .     i do all my own trees  you know     he confided .     craftsmanship .  takes years to learn how to make a tree .  even the conifers .         oh     said rincewind .      i don   t get someone in to finish them off .  no subcontracting  that   s my motto .  the buggers always keep you hanging about while they   re installing stars or something for someone else .     the little man sighed .     you know  people think it must all be very easy  creating .  they think you just have to move on the face of the waters and wave your hands a bit .  it   s not like that at all .         it isn   t .      the little man scratched his nose again .     you soon run out of ideas for snowflakes  for example .         oh .         you start thinking it   d be a doddle to sneak in a few identical ones .         you do .         you thinks to yourself     there   s a billion trillion squillion of them  no one   s going to notice .     but that   s where professionalism comes in  sort of thing .         it does .         some people      and here the creator looked sharply at the unformed matter still streaming past      think it   s enough to install a few basic physical formulas and then take the money and run .  a billion years later you got leaks all over the sky  black holes the size of your head  and when you pray up to complain there   s just a girl on the counter who says she don   t know where the boss is .  i think people appreciate the personal touch  don   t you .         ah     said rincewind .     so   when people get struck by lightning   er   it   s not just because of all that stuff about electrical discharges and high points and everything   er   you actually mean it .         oh  not me .  i don   t run the things .  it   s a big enough job just building    em  you can   t expect me to operate them as well .  there   s a load of other universes  you know     he added  a slight note of accusation in his voice .     got a list of jobs as long as your arm .      he reached underneath him and produced a large  leather bound book  which he had apparently been sitting on .  it opened with a creak .   rincewind felt a tugging at his robe .      look     said eric .     this isn   t really   him  is it .         he says it is     said rincewind .      what are we doing here .         i don   t know .      the creator glared at him .     a little quiet there  please     he said .      but listen     hissed eric     if he really is the creator of the world  that sandwich is a religious relic .         gosh     said rincewind weakly .  he hadn   t eaten for ages .  he wondered what the penalty was for eating a venerated object .  it was probably severe .      you could put it in a temple somewhere and millions of people would come to look at it .      rincewind cautiously levered up the top slice of bread .      it   s got no mayonnaise in it     he said .     will that still count .      the creator cleared his throat  and began to read aloud .      astfgl surfed across the entropy slope  an angry red spark against the swirls of interspace .  he was so angry now that the last vestiges of self control were slipping away  his jaunty cap with its stylish hornlets had become a mere wisp of crimson dangling from the tip of one of the great coiled ramshorns that framed his skull .   with a rather sensuous ripping noise the red silk across his back tore open and his wings unfolded .   they are conventionally represented as leathery  but leather wouldn   t survive more than a few seconds in that environment .  besides  it doesn   t fold up very well .   these wings were made of magnetism and shaped space  and spread out until they were a faint curtain against the incandescent firmament and they beat as slowly and inexorably as the rise of civilizations .   they still looked batlike  but that was just for the sake of tradition .   somewhere around the   th millennium he was overtaken  quite without noticing  by something small and oblong and probably even angrier than he was .      eight spells go to make up the world .  rincewind knew that well enough .  he knew that the book which contained them was the octavo  because it still existed in the library of unseen university   currently inside a welded iron box at the bottom of a specially dug shaft  where its magical radiations could be kept under control .   rincewind had wondered how it had all started .  he   d imagined a sort of explosion in reverse  with interstellar gases roaring together to form great a   tuin  or at least a roll of thunder or something .   instead there was a faint  musical twang  and where the discworld hadn   t been  there the discworld was  as if it had been hiding somewhere the whole time .   he also realized that the feeling of falling he had so recently learned to live with was one he was probably going to die with  too .  as the world appeared beneath him it brought this eon   s special offer   gravity  available in a choice of strengths from your nearest massive planetary body .   he said  as so often happens on these occasions     aargh .      the creator  still sitting serenely in midair  appeared beside him as he plummeted .      nice clouds  don   t you think .  done a good job on the clouds     he said .      aargh     rincewind repeated .      something the matter .         aargh .         that   s humans for you     said the creator .     always rushing off somewhere .     he leaned closer .     it   s not up to me  of course  but i   ve often wondered what it is that goes through your heads .         it   s going to be my feet in a minute .     screamed rincewind .   eric  falling alongside him  tugged at his ankle .     that   s not the way to talk to the creator of the universe .     he shouted .     just tell him to do something  make the ground soft or something .         oh  i dunno if i could do that     said the creator .     it   s causality regulations .  i   d have the inspector down on me like a ton of  a ton of  a ton of weight     he added .     i could probably knock you up a really spongy bog .  or quicksand   s very popular at the moment .  i could do you a complete quicksand with marsh and swamp en suite  no problem .          .     said rincewind .      you   re going to have to speak up a bit  i   m sorry .  wait a moment .      there was another harmonious twanging noise .   when rincewind opened his eyes he was standing on a beach .  so was eric .  the creator floated nearby .   there was no rushing wind .  he hadn   t got so much as a bruise .      i just wedged a thingy in the velocities and positions     said the creator  noticing his expression .     now  what was it you were saying .         i rather wanted to stop plunging to my death     said rincewind .      oh .  good .  glad that   s sorted out  then .     the creator looked around distractedly .     you haven   t seen my book around  have you .  i thought i had it in my hand when i started .     he sighed .     lose me own head next .  i done a whole world once and completely left out the fingles .  not one of the buggers .  couldn   t get    em at the time  told myself i could nip back when they were in stock  completely forgot .  imagine that .  no one spotted it  of course  because obviously they just evolved there and they didn   t know there ought to be fingles  but it was definitely causing them deep  you know  psychological problems .  deep down inside they could tell there was something missing  sort of thing .      the creator pulled himself together .      anyway  i can   t hang about all day     he said .     like i said  i   ve got a lot of jobs on .         lots .     said eric .     i thought there was only one .         oh  no .  there   s masses of them     said the creator  beginning to fade away .     that   s quantum mechanics for you  see .  you don   t do it once and have it done .  no  they keep on branching off .  multiple choice they call it  it   s like painting the   painting the   painting something very big that you have to keep on painting  sort of thing .  it   s all very well saying you just have to change one little detail  but which one  that   s the real bugger .  well  nice to have met you .  if you need any extra work  you know  an extra moon or something           hey .      the creator reappeared  his eyebrows raised in polite surprise .      what happens now .     said rincewind .      now .  well  i imagine there   ll be some gods along soon .  they don   t wait long to move in  you know .  like flies around a   flies around a   like flies .  they tend to be a bit high spirited to start with  but they soon settle down .  i suppose they take care of all the people  ekcetra .     the creator leaned forward .     i   ve never been good at doing people .  never seem to get the arms and legs right .     he vanished .   they waited .      i think he   s really gone this time     said eric  after a while .     what a nice man .         you certainly understand a lot more about why the world is like it is after talking to him     said rincewind .      what   re quantum mechanics .         i don   t know .  people who repair quantums  i suppose .      rincewind looked at the egg and cress sandwich  still in his hand .  there was still no mayonnaise in it  and the bread was soggy  but it would be thousands of years before there was another one .  there had to be the dawn of agriculture  the domestication of animals  the evolution of the breadknife from its primitive flint ancestry  the development of dairy technology   and  if there was any desire to make a proper job of it  the cultivation of olive trees  pepper plants  salt pans  vinegar fermentation processes and the techniques of elementary food chemistry   before the world would see another one like it .  it was unique  a little white triangle full of anachronisms  lost and all alone in an unfriendly world .   he bit it anyway .  it wasn   t very nice .      what i don   t understand     said eric     is why we are here .         i take it that isn   t a philosophical question     said rincewind     i take it you mean  why are we here at the dawn of creation on this beach which has hardly been used .         yes .  that   s what i meant .      rincewind sat down on a rock and sighed .     i think it   s pretty obvious  isn   t it .     he said .     you wanted to live forever .         i didn   t say anything about traveling in time     said eric .     i was very clear about it so there   d be no tricks .         there isn   t a trick .  the wish is trying to be helpful .  i mean  it   s pretty obvious when you think about it .     forever    means the entire span of space and time .  forever .  for ever .  see .         you mean you have to sort of start at square one .         precisely .         but that   s no good .  it   s going to be years before there   s anyone else around .         centuries     corrected rincewind gloomily .     millennia .  iains .  and then there   s going to be all kinds of wars and monsters and stuff .  most of history is pretty appalling  when you look hard at it .  or even not very hard .         but what i meant was  i just wanted to go on living forever from now     said eric frantically .     i mean  from then .  i mean  look at this place .  no girls .  no people .  nothing to do on saturday nights           it won   t even have any saturday nights for thousands of years     said rincewind .     just nights .         you must take me back at once     said eric .     i order it .  avaunt .         you say that one more time and i will give you a thick ear     said rincewind .      but all you have to do is snap your fingers .         it won   t work .  you   ve had your three wishes .  sorry .         what shall i do .         well  if you see anything crawl out of the sea and try to breathe  you could try telling it not to bother .         you think this is funny  don   t you .         it is rather amusing  since you mention it     said rincewind  his face expressionless .      the joke   s going to be wearing pretty thin over the years  then     said eric .      what .         well  you   re not going to go anywhere  are you .  you   ll have to stay with me .         nonsense  i   ll       rincewind looked around desperately .  i   ll what .  he thought .   the waves rolled peacefully up the beach  not very strongly at the moment because they were still feeling their way .  the first high tide was coming in  cautiously .  there was no tideline  no streaky line of old seaweed and shells to give it some idea of what was expected of it .  the air had the clean  fresh smell of air that has yet to know the effusions of a forest floor or the ins and outs of a ruminant   s digestive system .   rincewind had grown up in ankh morpork .  he liked air that had been around a bit  had got to know people  had been lived in .      we   ve got to get back     he said urgently .      that   s what i   ve been saying     said eric  with strained patience .   rincewind took another bite of the sandwich .  he   d looked death in the face many times  or more precisely death had looked him in the back of his rapidly retreating head many times  and suddenly the prospect of living forever didn   t appeal .  there were of course great questions he might learn the answer to  such as how life evolved and all the rest of it  but looked at as a way of spending all your spare time for the next infinity it wasn   t a patch on a quiet evening strolling through the streets of ankh .   still  he   d acquired an ancestor .  that was something .  not everyone had an ancestor .  what would his ancestor have done in a situation like this .   he wouldn   t have been here .   well  yes  of course  but apart from that  he would have   he would have used his fine military mind to consider the tools available  that   s what he would have done .   he had  item  one half eaten egg and cress sandwich .  no help there .  he threw it away .   he had  item  himself .  he drew a tick in the sand .  he wasn   t certain what use he could be  but he could come back to that later .   he had  item  eric .  thirteen year old demonologist and acne attack ground zero .   that seemed to be about it .   he stared at the clean  fresh sand for a while  doodling in it .   then he said  quietly     eric .  come here a moment           the waves were a lot stronger now .  they had really got the hang of the tide thing  and were venturing a little ebb and flow .   astfgl materialized in a puff of blue smoke .      aha .     he said  but this fell rather flat because there was no one to hear it .   he looked down .  there were footprints in the sand .  hundreds of them .  they ran backward and forward  as if something had been frantically searching  and then vanished .   he leaned nearer .  it was hard to make out  what with all the footprints and the effects of the wind and the tide  but just on the edge of the encroaching surf were the unmistakable signs of a magic circle .   astfgl said a swearword that fused the sand around him into glass  and vanished .   the tide got on with things .  further down the beach the last surge poured into a hollow in the rocks  and the new sun beamed down on the soaking remains of a half eaten egg and cress sandwich .  tidal action turned it over .  thousands of bacteria suddenly found themselves in the midst of a taste explosion  and started to breed like mad .   if only there had been some mayonnaise  life might have turned out a whole lot different .  more piquant  and perhaps with a little extra cream in it .      traveling by magic always had major drawbacks .  there was the feeling that your stomach was lagging behind .  and your mind filled up with terror because the destination was always a little uncertain .  it wasn   t that you could come out anywhere .     anywhere    represented a very restricted range of choices compared to the kind of places magic could transport you to .  the actual traveling was easy .  it was achieving a destination which would  for example  allow you to survive in all four dimensions at once that took the real effort .   in fact the scope for error was so huge it seemed something of an anticlimax to emerge in a fairly ordinary  sandy floored cavern .   it contained  on the far wall  a door .   there was no doubt it was a forbidding door .  it looked as though its designer had studied all the cell doors he could find and had then gone away and produced a version for  as it were  full visual orchestra .  it was more of a portal .  some ancient and probably fearful warning was etched over its crumbling arch  but it was destined to remain unread because over it someone else had pasted a bright red and white notice which read     you don   t have to be    damned    to work here  but it helps .  .  .      rincewind squinted up at the notice .      of course i can read it     he said .     i just don   t happen to believe it .         multiple exclamation marks     he went on  shaking his head     are a sure sign of a diseased mind .      he looked behind him .  the glowing outlines of eric   s magic circle faded and winked out .      i   m not being picky  you understand     he said .     it   s just that i thought you said you could get us back to ankh .  this isn   t ankh .  i can tell by the little details  like the flickering red shadows and the distant screaming .  in ankh the screaming is usually much closer     he added .      i think i did very well to get it to work at all     said eric  bridling .     you   re not supposed to be able to run magic circles in reverse .  in theory it means you stay in the circle and reality moves around you .  i think i did very well .  you see     he added  his voice suddenly vibrating with enthusiasm     if you rewrite the source codex and  this is the difficult bit  you route it through a high level           yes  yes  very clever  what will you people think up next     said rincewind .     the only thing is  we   re  i think it   s quite possible that we   re in hell .         oh .      eric   s lack of reaction made rincewind curious .      you know     he added .     the place with all the demons in it .         oh .         not a good place to be  it   s generally felt     said rincewind .      you think we might be able to explain .      rincewind thought about this .  he wasn   t  when you got right down to it  quite sure what it was that demons did to you .  but he did know what humans did to you  and after a lifetime in ankh morpork this place could turn out to be an improvement .  warmer  at any rate .   he looked at the door knocker .  it was black and horrible  but that didn   t matter because it was also tied up so that it couldn   t be used .  beside it  with all the signs of being installed recently by someone who didn   t know what they were doing and didn   t want to do it  was a button set into the splintered woodwork .  rincewind gave it an experimental prod .   the sound it produced might once have been a popular tune  possibly even one written by a skilled composer to whom had been vouchsafed  for a brief ecstatic moment  the music of the spheres .  now  however  it just went bing bong ding dong .   and it would be a lazy use of language to say that the thing that answered the door was a nightmare .  nightmares are usually rather daft things and it   s very hard to explain to a listener what was so dreadful about your socks coming alive or giant carrots jumping out of the hedgerows .  this thing was the kind of terrifying thing that could only be created by someone sitting down and thinking horrible thoughts very clearly .  it had more tentacles than legs  but fewer arms than heads .   it also had a badge .   the badge said     my name is urglefloggah  spawn of the pit and loathly guardian of the dread portal  how may i help you .      it was not very happy about this .      yes .     it rasped .   rincewind was still reading the badge .      how may you help us .     he said  aghast .   urglefloggah  who bore a certain resemblance to the late quezovercoatl  ground some of its teeth .         hi   there        it intoned  in the manner of one who has had the script patiently explained to him by someone with a red hot branding iron .        my name is urglefloggah  spawn of the pit  and i am your host for today   may i be the first to welcome you to our luxuriously appointed              hang on a moment     said rincewind .            chosen for your convenience           urglefloggah rumbled .      there   s something not right here     said rincewind .            full regard for the wishes of you  the consumer           the demon continued stoically .      excuse me     said rincewind .            as pleasurable as possible        said urglefloggah .  it made a noise like a sigh of relief  from somewhere deep in its mandibles .  now it appeared to be listening for the first time .     yes .  what .     it said .      where are we .     said rincewind .   various mouths beamed .     quail  mortals .         what .  we   re in a bird .         grovel and cower  mortals .     the demon corrected itself     for you are condemned to everlast       it paused  and gave a little whimper .      there will be a period of corrective therapy     it corrected itself again  spitting out each word     which we hope to make as instructive and enjoyable as possible  with due regard to all the rights of you  the customer .      it eyed rincewind with several eyes .     dreadful  isn   t it .     it said  in a more normal voice .     don   t blame me .  if it was up to me it would be the old burning thingies up the whatsit  toot sweet .         this is hell  isn   t it     said eric .     i   ve seen pictures .         you   re right there     said the demon mournfully .  it sat down  or at least folded itself in some complicated way .     personal service  that   s what it used to be .  people used to feel that we were taking an interest  that they weren   t just numbers but  well  victims .  we had a tradition of service .  fat lot he cares .  but what am i telling you my troubles for .  it   s not as if you haven   t got plenty of your own  what with being dead and being here .  you   re not musicians  are you .         actually we   re not even dea       rincewind began .  the demon ignored him  but got up and began to plod ponderously down the dank corridor  beckoning them to follow .      you   d really hate it here if you was musicians .  hate it more  i mean .  the walls play music all day long  well  he calls it music  i   ve got nothing against a good tune  mark you  something to scream along with  but this isn   t it  i mean  i heard where we   re supposed to have all the best tunes  so why   ve we got all this stuff that sounds like someone turned on the piano and then walked away and left it .         in point of fact           and then there   s the potted plants .  don   t get me wrong  i like to see a bit of green around the place .  only some of the lads says these plants aren   t real but what i say is  they must be  no one in their right mind would make a plant that looks like dark green leather and smells like a dead sloth .  he says it gives the place a friendly and open aspect .  friendly and open aspect .  i   ve seen keen gardeners break down and cry .  i   m telling you  they said it made everything we did to them afterward seem like an improvement .         dead is not what we       said rincewind  trying to hammer the words into a gap in the thing   s endless monotone  but he was too late .      the coffee machine  now  the coffee machine   s a good one  i   ll grant you .  we only used to drown people in lakes of cat   s pee  we didn   t make them buy it by the cup .         we   re not dead .     eric shouted .   urglefloggah came to a quivering halt .      of course you   re dead     it said .     else you wouldn   t be here .  can   t imagine live people coming here .  they wouldn   t last five minutes .     it opened several of its mouths  showing a choice of fangs .     hur hur     it added .     if i was to catch any live people down here        not for nothing had rincewind survived for years in the paranoid complexities of unseen university .  he felt almost at home .  his reflexes operated with incredible precision .      you mean you weren   t told .     he said .   it was hard to see if urglefloggah   s expression changed  if only because it was hard to know what part of it was expression  but it definitely projected a familiar air of sudden and resentful uncertainty .      told what .     it said .   rincewind looked at eric .     you   d think they   d tell people  wouldn   t you .         tell them wh   argarg     said eric  clutching his ankle .      that   s modern management for you     said rincewind  his face radiating angry concern .     they go ahead and make all these changes  all these new arrangements  and do they consult the very people who form the backbone              exoskeleton       corrected the demon .         or other calcareous or chitinous structure  of the organization .     rincewind finished smoothly .  he waited expectantly for what he knew would have to come .      not them     said urglefloggah .     too busy sticking up notices  they are .         i think that   s pretty disgusting     said rincewind .      d   you know     said urglefloggah     they wouldn   t let me on the club                 holiday .  said i was too old .  said i would spoil the fun .         what   s the netherworld coming to .     said rincewind sympathetically .      they never come down here  you know     said the demon  sagging a bit .     they never tell me anything .  oh yes  very important  only keeping the bloody gate  most important  i don   t think .         look     said rincewind .     you wouldn   t like me to have a word  would you .         down here all hours  seeing    em in           perhaps if we spoke to someone .     said rincewind .   the demon sniffed  from several noses at once .      would you .     it said .      be happy to     said rincewind .   urglefloggah brightened a little  but not too much  just in case .     can   t do any harm  can it .     it said .   rincewind steeled himself and patted the thing on what he fervently hoped was its back .      don   t you worry about it     he said .      that   s very kind of you .      rincewind looked across the shuddering heap at eric .      we   d better go     he said .     so we   re not late for our appointment .     he made frantic signals over the demon   s head .   eric grinned .     yeah  right  appointment     he said .  they walked up the wide passage .   eric started to giggle hysterically .      this is where we run  right .     he said .      this is where we walk     said rincewind .     just walk .  the important thing is to act nonchalant .  the important thing is to get the timing right .      he looked at eric .   eric looked at him .   behind them  urglefloggah made a kind of i   ve just worked it out noise .      about now .     said eric .      about now i think would do it  yes .      they ran .      hell wasn   t what rincewind had been led to expect  although there were signs of what it might once have been   a few clinkers in a corner  a bad scorch mark on the ceiling .  it was hot  though  with the kind of heat that you get by boiling air inside an oven for years     hell  it has been suggested  is other people .   this has always come as a bit of a surprise to many working demons  who had always thought that hell was sticking sharp things into people and pushing them into lakes of blood and so on .   this is because demons  like most people  have failed to distinguish between the body and the soul .   the fact was that  as droves of demon kings had noticed  there was a limit to what you could do to a soul with  e . g .   red hot tweezers  because even fairly evil and corrupt souls were bright enough to realize that since they didn   t have the concomitant body and nerve endings attached to them there was no real reason  other than force of habit  why they should suffer excruciating agony .  so they didn   t .  demons went on doing it anyway  because numb and mindless stupidity is part of what being a demon is all about  but since no one was suffering they didn   t enjoy it much either and the whole thing was pointless .  centuries and centuries of pointlessness .   astfgl had adopted  without realizing what he was doing  a radically new approach .   demons can move interdimensionally  and so he   d found the basic ingredients for a very worthwhile lake of blood equivalent  as it were  for the soul .  learn from humans  he   d told the demon lords .  learn from humans .  it   s amazing what you can learn from humans .   you take  for example  a certain type of hotel .  it is probably an english version of an american hotel  but operated with that peculiarly english genius for taking something american and subtracting from it its one worthwhile aspect  so that you end up with slow fast food  west country and western music and  well  this hotel .   it   s early closing day .  the bar is really just a pastel pink paneled table with a silly ice bucket on it  set in one corner  and it won   t be open for hours yet .  and then you add rain  and let the one channel available on the only tv be  perhaps  welsh channel four  showing its usual mobius eisteddfod from pant y gyrdl .  and there is only one book in this hotel  left behind by a previous victim .  it is one of those where the name of the author is on the front in raised gold letters much bigger than the title  and it probably has a rose and a bullet on there too .  half the pages are missing .   and the only cinema in the town is showing something with subtitles and french umbrellas in it .   and then you stop time  but not experience  so that it seems as though the very fluff in the carpet is gradually rising up to fill the brain and your mouth starts to taste like an old denture .   and you make it last forever and ever .  that   s even longer than from now until opening time .   and then you distil it .   of course the discworld lacks a number of the items listed above  but boredom is universal and astfgl had achieved in hell a particularly high brand of boredom which is like the boredom you get which a  is costing you money  and b  is taking place while you should be having a nice time .   the caverns that opened before rincewind were full of mist and tasteful room dividers .  now and again screams of ennui rose from between the potted plants  but mainly there was the terrible numbing silence of the human brain being reduced to cream cheese from the inside out .      i don   t understand     said eric .     where are the furnaces .  where are the flames .  where     he added  hopefully     are the succubi .      rincewind peered at the nearest exhibit .   a disconsolate demon  whose badge proclaimed it to be azaremoth  the stench of dog breath  and moreover hoped that the reader would have a nice day  was sitting on the edge of a shallow pit wherein lay a rock on which a man was chained and spreadeagled .   a very tired looking bird was perched beside him .  rincewind thought that eric   s parrot had it bad  but this bird had definitely been through the mangle of life .  it looked as though it had been plucked first and then had its feathers stuck back on .   curiosity overcame rincewind   s usual cowardice .      what   s going on .     he said .     what   s happening to him .      the demon stopped kicking his heels on the edge of the pit .  it didn   t occur to it to question rincewind   s presence .  it assumed that he wouldn   t be here unless he had a right to be .  the alternative was unbelievable .      i don   t know what he done     it said     but when i first come here his punishment was to be chained to that rock and every day an eagle would come down and peck his liver out .  bit of an old favorite  that one .         it doesn   t look as though it   s attacking him now     said rincewind .      nah .  that   s all changed .  now it flies down every day and tells him about its hernia operation .  now it   s effective  i   ll grant you     said the demon sadly     but it   s not what i   d call torture .      rincewind turned away  but not before catching a glimpse of the look of terminal agony on the victim   s face .  it was terrible .   there was worse  however .  in the next pit several chained and groaning people were being shown a series of paintings .  a demon in front of them was reading from a script .         this is when we were in the fifth circle  only you can   t see where we stayed  it was just off to the left there  and this is that funny couple we met  you   d never believe it  they lived on the icy plains of doom just next door to        eric looked at rincewind .      it   s showing them pictures of itself on holiday .     he said .   they both shrugged and walked away  shaking their heads .   then there was a small hill .  at the bottom of the hill there was a round rock .  beside the rock sat a manacled man  his despairing head buried in his hands .  a squat green demon stood beside him  almost buckling under the weight of an enormous book .      i   ve heard of this one     said eric .     man who went and defied the gods or something .  got to keep pushing that rock up the hill even though it rolls back all the time        the demon looked up .      but first     it trilled     he must listen to the unhealthy and unsafety regulations governing the lifting and moving of large objects .         volume    of the commentaries  in fact .  the regulations themselves comprised a further       volumes .  part    that is .      rincewind had always liked boredom  treasuring it if only because of its rarity value .  it had always seemed to him that the only times in his life when he wasn   t being chased  imprisoned or hit were when he was being dropped from things  and while falling a long way always had a certain sameness about it  it did not really count as    boring .     the only time he could look back on with a certain amount of fondness was his brief spell as assistant librarian at unseen university  when there wasn   t much to do except read books  make sure the librarian   s banana supply wasn   t interrupted and  rarely  help him with a particularly recalcitrant grimoire .   now he realized what made boredom so attractive .  it was the knowledge that worse things  dangerously exciting things  were going on just around the corner and that you were well out of them .  for boredom to be enjoyable there had to be something to compare it with .   whereas this was just boredom on top of more boredom  winding in on itself until it became a great crushing sledgehammer which paralyzed all thought and experience and pounded eternity into something like flannel .      this is dreadful     he said .   the chained man raised a haggard face .     you   re telling me .     he said .     i used to like pushing the ball up the hill .  you could stop for a chat  you could see what was going on  you could try various holds and everything .  i was a bit of a tourist attraction  people used to point me out .  i wouldn   t say it was fun  but it gave you a purpose in the afterlife .         and i used to help him     said the demon  its voice raw with sullen indignation .     give you a bit of a hand  sometimes  didn   t i .  pass on a bit of gossip and that .  sort of encourage him when it rolled back and that .  i   d say things like    whoops  there goes the bleeder again     and he   d say    bugger it .     we had some times  dint we .  great times .     it blew its nose .   rincewind coughed .         sgetting too much     said the demon .     we used to be happy in the old days .  it wasn   t as if it used to hurt anyone much and  well  we was all in it together .         that   s it     said the chained man .     you knew if you kept your nose clean you   d stand a chance of getting out one day .  you know  once a week now i have to stop this for craft lessons .         that must be nice     said rincewind uncertainly .   the man   s eyes narrowed .     basketwork .     he said .      i been here eighteen millennia  demon and imp     grumbled the demon .     i learned my trade  i did .  eighteen thousand bloody years behind the pitchfork  and now this .  reading a        a sonic boom echoed the length of hell .      oi oi     said the demon .     he   s back .  he sounds angry  too .  we   d better get our heads down .     and indeed  all over the circles of hades  demons and damned were groaning in unison and getting back to their private hells .   the chained man broke into a sweat .      look  vizzimuth     he said     couldn   t we just sort of miss out one or two paragraphs           it   s my job     said the demon wretchedly .     you know he checks up  it   s more than my job   s worth       he broke off  gave rincewind a sad grimace  and patted the sobbing figure with a gentle talon .      tell you what     he said kindly     i   ll skip some of the subclauses .      rincewind took eric by an unresisting shoulder .      we   d better get along     he said quietly .      this is really horrible     said eric  as they walked away .     it gives evil a bad name .         um     said rincewind .  he didn   t like the sound of him being back and him being angry .  whenever something important enough to deserve capital letters was angry in the vicinity of rincewind  it was usually angry with him .      if you know such a lot about this place     he said     perhaps you can remember how to get out .      eric scratched his head .     it helps if one of you is a girl     he said .     according to ephebian mythology  there   s a girl who comes down here every winter .         to keep warm .         i think the story says she actually creates the winter  sort of .         i   ve known women like that     said rincewind  nodding wisely .      or it helps if you   ve got a lyre  i think .         ah .  we could be on firmer ground here     said rincewind .  he thought for a bit and then said     er .  my dog   my dog has six legs .         the kind you play     said eric patiently .      oh .         and  and  and when you do leave  if you look back   i think pomegranates come into it somewhere  or  or  or you turn into a piece of wood .         i never look back     said rincewind firmly .     one of the first rules of running away is  never look back .      there was a roar behind them .      especially when you hear loud noises     rincewind went on .     when it comes to cowardice  that   s what sorts out the men from the sheep .  you run straight away .     he grabbed the skirts of his robe .   and they ran and ran  until a familiar voice said     ho there  dear lads .  hop up .  it   s amazing how you meet old friends down here .      and another voice said     wossname .  wossnames .            where are they .      the sublords of hell trembled .  this was going to be dreadful .  it might even result in a memo .      they can   t have escaped     rasped astfgl .      they   re here somewhere .  why can you not find them .  am i surrounded by incompetents as well as fools .         my lord        the demon princes turned .   the speaker was duke vassenego  one of the oldest demons .  how old  no one knew .  but if he didn   t actually invent original sin  at least he made one of the first copies .  in terms of sheer enterprise and deviousness of mind he might even have passed for human and  in fact  generally took the form of an old  rather sad lawyer with an eagle somewhere in his ancestry .   and every demonic mind thought  poor old vassenego  he   s done it this time .  this won   t be just a memo  this will be a policy statement  c . c .    d to all departments and a copy for files .   astfgl turned slowly  as though mounted on a turntable .  he was back in his preferred form now but had pulled himself together  as it were  on a higher level of emotion .  the mere thought of living humans in his domain made him twang with fury like a violin string .  you couldn   t trust them .  they were unreliable .  the last human allowed down here alive had given the place a terribly bad press .  above all  they made him feel inferior .   now the full wattage of his anger focused on the old demon .      you had a point to make .     he said .      i was merely going to say  lord  that we have made an extensive search of all eight circles and i am really certain           silence .  don   t think i don   t know what   s going on     growled astfgl  circling the drawn figure .     i   ve seen you   and you  and you      his trident pointed at some of the other old lords      plotting in corners  encouraging rebellion .  i rule here  is that not so .  and i will be obeyed .      vassenego was pale .  his patrician nostrils flared like jet intakes .  everything about him said  you pompous little creature  of course we encourage rebellion  we   re demons .  and i was maddening the minds of princes when you were encouraging cats to leave dead mice under the bed  you small minded  paper worshipping nincompoop .  everything about him said this except for his voice  which said  calmly     no one is denying this  sire .         then search again .  and the demon who let them in is to be taken to the lowest pit and disassembled  is that clear .      vassenego   s eyebrows rose .     old urglefloggah  sire .  he was foolish  certainly  but he is a loyal           are you by any chance endeavoring to contradict me .      vassenego hesitated .  dreadful as he privately held the king to be  demons are strong believers in precedence and hierarchy .  there were too many young demons pressing below them for the senior lords to openly demonstrate the ways of regicide and coup  no matter what the provocation .  vassenego had plans of his own .  no sense in spoiling things now .      no  sire     he said .     but that will mean  sire  that the dread portal is no longer           do it .         the luggage arrived at the dread portal .   there was no way to describe how angry you can get running nearly twice the length of the space time continuum  and the luggage had been pretty annoyed to start with .   it looked at the hinges .  it looked at the locks .  it backed away a bit and appeared to read the new sign over the portal .   possibly this made it angrier  although with the luggage there wasn   t any reliable way of telling because it spent all its time beyond  in a manner of speaking  the hostility event horizon .   the doors of hell were ancient .  it wasn   t just time and heat that had baked their wood to something like black granite .  they   d picked up fear and dull evil .  they were more than mere things to fill a hole in the wall .  they were bright enough to be dimly aware of what their future was likely to hold .   they watched the luggage shuffle back across the sand  flex its legs and crouch down .   the lock clicked .  the bolts dragged themselves back hurriedly .  the great bars jerked from their sockets .  the doors flung themselves back against the wall .   the luggage untensed .  it straightened .  it stepped forward .  it almost strutted .  it passed between the straining hinges and  when it was nearly through  turned and gave the nearest door a damn good kick .      there was a great treadmill .  it didn   t power anything  and had particularly creaky bearings .  it was one of astfgl   s more inspired ideas  and had no use whatsoever except to show several hundred people that if they had thought their lives had been pretty pointless  they hadn   t seen anything yet .      we can   t stay here forever     said rincewind .     we need to do things .  like eat .         that   s one of the tremendous advantages of being a damned soul     said ponce da quirm .     all the old bodily cares fade away .  of course  you get a completely new set of cares  but i have always found it advisable to look for the silver lining .         wossname .     said the parrot  who was sitting on his shoulder .      fancy that     said rincewind .     i never knew animals could go to hell .  although i can quite see why they made an exception in this case .         up yours  wizard .         why don   t they look for us here  that   s what i don   t understand .     said eric .      shut up and keep walking     said rincewind .     they   re stupid  that   s why .  they can   t imagine that we would be doing something like this .         yes  they   re right there .  i can   t imagine that we are doing something like this  either     said eric .   rincewind treadled for a bit  watching a crowd of frantically searching demons hurry past .      so you didn   t find the fountain of youth  then     he said  feeling that he should make some conversation .      oh  but i did     said da quirm earnestly .     a clear spring  deep in the jungle .  it was very impressive .  i had a good long drink  too .  or draft  which i think is the more appropriate word .         and    .     said rincewind .      it definitely worked .  yes .  for a while there i could definitely feel myself getting younger .         but       rincewind waved a vague hand to take in da quirm  the treadmill  the towering circles of the pit .      ah     said the old man .     of course  that   s the really annoying bit .  i   d read so much about the fountain  and you   d have thought someone in all those books would have mentioned the really vital thing about the water  wouldn   t you .         which was    .         boil it first .  says it all  doesn   t it .  terrible shame  really .         the luggage trotted down the great spiral road that linked the circles of the pit .  even if conditions had been normal it probably would not have attracted much attention .  if anything  it was rather less astonishing than most of the denizens .         this is really boring     said eric .      that   s the point     said rincewind .      we shouldn   t be lurking here  we should be trying to find a way out .         well  yes  but there isn   t one .         there is  in fact     said a voice behind rincewind .  it was the voice of someone who had seen it all and hadn   t liked any of it very much .      lavaeolus .     said rincewind .  his ancestor was right behind them .         you   ll get home all right        said lavaeolus bitterly .     your very words .  huh .  ten years of one damn thing after another .  you might have told a chap .         er     said eric .     we didn   t want to upset the course of history .         you didn   t want to upset the course of history     said lavaeolus slowly .  he stared down at the woodwork of the treadmill .     oh .  good .  that makes it all all right .  i feel a lot better for knowing that .  speaking as the course of history  i   d like to say thank you very much .         excuse me     said rincewind .      yes .         you said there   s another way out .         oh  yes .  a back way .         where is it .      lavaeolus stopped treadling for a moment and pointed across the misty hollow .      see that arch over there .      rincewind peered into the distance .      just about     he said .     is that it .         yes .  a long steep climb .  don   t know where it comes out  though .         how did you find out about it .      lavaeolus shrugged .     i asked a demon     he said .      there   s always an easier way of doing everything  you know .         it   d take forever to get there     said eric .     it   s right on the other side  we   d never make it .      rincewind nodded  and glumly continued the endless walk .  after a few minutes he said     has it struck you we seem to be going faster .      eric turned around .   the luggage had stepped aboard and was trying to catch up with them .      astfgl stood in front of his mirror .      show me what they can see     he commanded .   yes  master .   astfgl inspected the whirring image for a moment .      tell me what this means     he said .   i   m just a mirror  master .  what do i know .   astfgl growled .     and i   m lord of hades     he said  gesturing with his trident .     and i   m prepared to risk another seven years    bad luck .      the mirror considered the available options .   i might be able to hear some creaking  lord  it ventured .      and .      i smell smoke .      no smoke .  i specifically banned all open fires .  a very old fashioned concept .  it gave the place a bad name .      nevertheless  master .      show me   hades .      the mirror gave of its best .  the king was just in time to see the treadwheel  its bearings glowing red hot  crash down from its mountings and roll  as deceptively slowly as an avalanche  across the country of the damned .   rincewind hung from the pushbar  watching the rungs whirr past at a speed that would have burned the soles off his sandals if he   d been foolish enough to let his feet down .  the dead  however  were taking it all with the cheerful aplomb of those who know that the worst has already happened to them .  cries of    pass the candyfloss     drifted down .  he heard lavaeolus commending the wheel   s splendid traction and explaining to da quirm how  if you have a vehicle which put down its road in front of it  just like the luggage was in fact doing  and then you covered it with armor  then wars would be less bloody  over in half the time and everyone could spend even longer going home .   the luggage made no comment at all .  it could see its master hanging a few feet away  and just kept going .  it may have occurred to it that the journey was taking some time  but that was time   s problem .  and so  flinging out the occasional screaming soul  bumping and gyrating and crushing the occasional luckless demon  the wheel bowled on .   it smashed against the opposite cliff .      lord vassenego smiled .      now     he said     it is time .      the other senior demons looked a bit shifty .  they were  of course  steeped in evil  and astfgl was definitely not one of us and the most revolting little oik ever to oil his way into the post     but   well  this   perhaps there were some things that were too           learn from the ways of humans        mimicked vassenego .     he bade me learn from humans .  me .  the impudence .  the arrogance .  but i watched  oh  yes .  i learned .  i planned .      the look on his face was unspeakable .  even the lords of the nethermost circles  who gloried in villainy  had to turn their heads .   duke drazometh the putrid raised a hesitant talon .      but if he even suspects     he said     i mean  he has a foul temper on him .  those memos       he shuddered .      but what are we doing .     vassenego spread his hands in a gesture of innocence .     where is the harm in it .  brothers  i ask you  where is the harm .      his fingers curled .  the knuckles shone white under the thin  blue veined skin as he surveyed the doubting faces .      or would you rather receive another statement of policy .     he said .   expressions twitched as the lords made up their minds like a row of dominoes falling over .  there were some things on which even they were united .  no more policy statements  no more consultative documents  no more morale boosting messages to all staff .  this was hell  but you had to draw the line somewhere .   earl beezlemoth rubbed one of his three noses .     and humans somewhere thought this up all by themselves .     he said .     we didn   t give them any  you know  hints .      vassenego shook his head .      all their own work     he said proudly  like a fond schoolmaster who has just seen a star pupil graduate summa cum laude .   the earl stared into infinity .     i thought we were supposed to be the ghastly ones     he said  his voice filled with awe .   the old lord nodded .  he   d waited a long time for this .  while others had talked of red hot revolution he   d just stared out into the world of men  and watched  and marveled .   this rincewind character had been extremely useful .  he   d managed to keep the king totally occupied .  he   d been worth all the effort .  the damn fool human still thought it was his fingers doing the business .  three wishes  indeed .      and thus it was  when rincewind pulled himself free of the wreckage of the wheel  he found astfgl  king of demons  lord of hell  master of the pit  standing over him .   astfgl had passed through the earlier stage of fury and was now in that calm lagoon of rage where the voice is steady  the manner is measured and polite  and only a faint trace of spittle at the corner of the mouth betrays the inner inferno .   eric crawled out from under a broken spar and looked up .      oh dear     he said .   the demon king twirled the trident .  suddenly  it didn   t look comical anymore .  it looked like a heavy metal stick with three horrible spikes on the end .   astfgl smiled  and looked around .     no     he said  apparently to himself .     not here .  it is not public enough .  come .      a hand grasped each of them by the shoulder .  they could no more resist it than a couple of nonidentical snowflakes could resist a flamethrower .  there was a moment   s disorientation  and rincewind found himself in the largest room in the universe .   it was the great hall .  you could have built moon rockets in it .  the kings of hell might have heard of words like    subtlety    and    discretion     but they had also heard that if you had it you should flaunt it and reasoned that  if you didn   t have it  you should flaunt it even more  and what they didn   t have was good taste .  astfgl had done what he could but even he had been unable to add much to the basic bad design  the clashing colors  and the terrible wallpaper .  he   d put in a few coffee tables and a bullfight poster  but they were more or less lost in the overall chaos  and the new antimacassar on the back of the throne of dread only served to highlight some of its more annoying bas reliefs .   the two humans sprawled on the floor .      and now       said astfgl .   but his voice was lost in a sudden cheering .   he looked up .   demons of every size and shape filled almost all the hall  piling up the walls and even hanging from the ceiling .  a demonic band struck up a choice of chords on a variety of instruments .  a banner  slung from one side of the hall to the other  read  hale to ther cheve .   astfgl   s brows knitted in instant paranoia as vassenego  trailed by the other lords  bore down on him .  the old demon   s face was split in a totally guileless grin  and the king nearly panicked and hit it with the trident before vassenego reached out and slapped him on the back .      well done .     he cried .      what .         oh  very well done .      astfgl looked down at rincewind .      oh     he said .     yes .  well .     he coughed .     it was nothing     he said  straightening up     i knew you people weren   t getting anywhere so i just           not these     sneered vassenego .     such trivial things .  no  sire .  i was referring to your elevation .         elevation .     said astfgl .      your promotion  sire .      a great cheer went up from the younger demons  who would cheer anything .      promotion .  but  but i am the king       astfgl protested weakly .  he could feel his grasp on events beginning to slip .      pfooie .     said vassenego expansively .      pfooie .         indeed  sire .  king .  king .  sire  i speak for us all when i say that is no title for a demon such as you  sire  a demon whose grasp of organizational matters and priorities  whose insight into the proper functions of our being  whose   if i may say so   sheer intellectual capabilities have taken us to new and greater depths  sire .      despite himself  astfgl preened .     well  you know       he began .      and yet we find  despite your position  that you interest yourself in the tiniest details of our work     said vassenego  looking down his nose at rincewind .     such dedication .  such devotion .      astfgl swelled .     of course  i   ve always felt        rincewind pulled himself up on his elbows  and thought  look out  behind you        and so     said vassenego  beaming like a coastful of lighthouses     the council met and has decided  and may i add  sire  has decided unanimously  to create an entirely new award in honor of your outstanding achievements .         the importance of proper paperwork has   what award .     said astfgl  the minnows of suspicion suddenly darting across the oceans of self esteem .      the position  sire  of supreme life president of hell .      the band struck up again .      with your own office   much bigger than the pokey thing you have had to suffer all these years  sire .  or rather  mr .  president .      the band had a go at another chord .   the demons waited .      will there be   potted plants .     said astfgl  slowly .      hosts .  plantations .  jungles .      astfgl appeared to be lit by a gentle  inner glow .      and carpets .  i mean  wall to wall    .         the walls have had to be moved apart especially to accommodate them all  sire .  and thick pile  sire .  whole tribes of pygmies are wondering why the light stays on at night  sire .      the bewildered king allowed himself to have an expansive arm thrown across his shoulder and was gently led  all thoughts of vengeance forgotten  through the cheering crowds .      i   ve always fancied one of those special things for making coffee     he murmured  as the last vestiges of self control were eroded .      a positive manufactory has been installed  sire .  and a speaking tube  sire  for you to communicate your instructions to your underlings .  and the very latest in diaries  two eons to a page  and a thing for           colored marker pens .  i   ve always held that           complete rainbows  sire     vassenego boomed .     and let us go there without delay  sire  for i suspect that with your normal keen insight you cannot wait to get to grips with the mighty tasks ahead of you  sire .         certainly  certainly .  time they were done  indeed       an expression of vague perplexity passed across astfgl   s flushed face .     these mighty tasks           nothing less than a complete  full  authoritative  searching and in depth analysis of our role  function  priorities and goals  sire .      vassenego stood back .   the demon lords held their breath .   astfgl frowned .  the universe appeared to slow down .  the stars halted momentarily in their courses .      with forward planning .     he said  at last .      a top priority  sire  which you have instantly pinpointed with your normal incisiveness     said vassenego quickly .   the demon lords breathed again .   astfgl   s chest expanded several inches .     i shall need special staff  of course  in order to formulate           formulate .  the very thing .     said vassenego  who was perhaps getting just a bit carried away .  astfgl gave him a faintly suspicious glance  but at that moment the band struck up again .   the last words that rincewind heard  as the king was led out of the hall  were     and in order to analyze information  i shall need        and then he was gone .   the rest of the demons  aware that the entertainment seemed to be over for the day  started to mill around and drift out of the great doors .  it was beginning to dawn on the brightest of them that the fires would soon be roaring again .   no one seemed to be taking any notice of the two humans .  rincewind tugged at eric   s robe .      this is where we run  right .     said eric .      where we walk     said rincewind firmly .     nonchalantly  calmly  and  er           fast .         you pick things up quickly  don   t you .         it is essential that the proper use of three wishes should bring happiness to the greatest available number of people  and this is what in fact had happened .   the tezumen were happy .  when no amount of worshipping caused the luggage to come back and trample their enemies they poisoned all their priests and tried enlightened atheism instead  which still meant they could kill as many people as they liked but didn   t have to get up so early to do it .   the people of tsort and ephebe were happy   at least  the ones who write and feature in the dramas of history were happy  which is all that mattered .  now their long war was over and they could get on with the proper concern of civilized nations  which is to prepare for the next one .   the people of hell were happy  or at least happier than hitherto .  the flames were flickering brightly again  the same old familiar tortures were being inflicted on ethereal bodies quite incapable of feeling them  and the damned had been given that insight which makes hardship so easy to bear   the absolute and certain knowledge that things could be worse .   the demon lords were happy   they stood around the magic mirror  enjoying a celebratory drink .  occasionally one of them would risk slapping vassenego on the back .      shall we let them go  sire .     said a duke  peering at the climbing figures in the mirror   s dark image .      oh  i think so     said vassenego airily .     it   s always a good thing to let a few tales spread  you know .  pour encouragy le   poor encoura   to make everyone sit up and damn well take notice .  and they have been useful  after their fashion .     he looked into the depths of his drink  exulting quietly .   and yet  and yet  in the depths of his curly mind he thought he could hear the tiny voice that would grow louder over the years  the voice that haunts all demon kings  everywhere  look out  behind you     it is hard to say whether the luggage was happy or not .  it had viciously attacked fourteen demons so far  and had three of them cornered in their own pit of boiling oil .  soon it would have to follow its master  but it didn   t have to rush .   one of the demons made a frantic grab for the bank .  the luggage stamped heavily on its fingers .   the creator of universes was happy .  he   d just inserted one seven sided snowflake into a blizzard as an experiment  and no one had noticed .  tomorrow he was half inclined to try small  delicately crystalized letters of the alphabet .  alphabet snow .  it could be a winner .   rincewind and eric were happy      i can see blue sky .     said eric .     where do you think we   ll come out .     he added .     and when .         anywhere     said rincewind .     anytime .      he looked down at the broad steps they were climbing .  they were something of a novelty  each one was built out of large stone letters .  the one he was just stepping on to  for example  read  i meant it for the best .   the next one was  i thought you   d like it .   eric was standing on  for the sake of the children .      weird  isn   t it .     he said .     why do it like this .         i think they   re meant to be good intentions     said rincewind .  this was a road to hell  and demons were  after all  traditionalists .   and  while they are of course irredeemably evil  they are not always bad .  and so rincewind stepped off we are equal opportunity employers and through a wall  which healed up behind him  and into the world .   it could  he had to admit  have been a lot worse .      president astfgl  sitting in a pool of light in his huge  dark office  blew into the speaking tube again .      hallo .     he said .     hallo .      there didn   t seem to be anyone answering .   strange .   he picked up one of his colored pens  and looked around at the stack of work behind him .  all those records  to be analyzed  considered  assessed and evaluated  and then suitable management directives to be arrived at  and an in depth policy document to be drafted and then  after due consideration  redrafted again     he tried the tube once more .      hallo .  hallo .      no one there .  still  not to worry  lots to do .  his time was far too important to waste .   he sank his feet into his thick  warm carpet .   he looked proudly at his potted plants .   he tapped a complicated assembly of chromed wire and balls  which began to swing and click executively .   he unscrewed the top of his pen with a firm  decisive hand .   he wrote  what business are we in .  .  .   he thought for a bit  and then carefully wrote  underneath  we are in the damnation business .  .  .   and this  too  was happiness .  of a sort .      just erotic .  nothing kinky .  it   s the difference between using a feather and using a chicken .      it took thirty years to subside .  the inhabitants spent a lot of the time wading .  it went down in history as the multiverse   s most embarrassing continental catastrophe .      old tom was the single cracked bronze bell in the university bell tower .  the clapper dropped out shortly after it was cast  but the bell still tolled out some tremendously sonorous silences every hour .      the bursar was referring obliquely to the difficult occasion when the university very nearly caused the end of the world  and would in fact have done so had it not been for a chain of events involving rincewind  a magic carpet and a half brick in a sock .   see sourcery .   the whole affair was very embarrassing to wizards  as it always is to people who find out afterward that they were on the wrong side all along    and it was remarkable how many of the university   s senior staff were now adamant that at the time they had been off sick  visiting their aunt  or doing research with the door locked while humming loudly and had had no idea of what was going on outside .  there had been some desultory talk about putting up a statue to rincewind but  by the curious alchemy that tends to apply in these sensitive issues  this quickly became a plaque  then a note on the roll of honor  and finally a motion of censure for being improperly dressed .       ie  the one that lost .      demons and their hell are quite different from the dungeon dimensions  those endless parallel wastelands outside space and time .  the sad  mad things in the dungeon dimensions have no understanding of the world but simply crave light and shape and try to warm themselves by the fires of reality  clustering around it with about the same effect   if they ever broke through   as an ocean trying to warm itself around a candle .  whereas demons belong to the same space time wossname  more or less  as humans  and have a deep and abiding interest in humanity   s day to day affairs .  interestingly enough  the gods of the disc have never bothered much about judging the souls of the dead  and so people only go to hell if that   s where they believe  in their deepest heart  that they deserve to go .  which they won   t do if they don   t know about it .  this explains why it is important to shoot missionaries on sight .      demons have a distorted sense of values .      rincewind had been told that death was just like going into another room .  the difference is  when you shout     where   s my clean socks .      no one answers .      this is because wiring plugs  putting up shelves  sorting out the funny noise in attics and mowing lawns can eventually reduce even the strongest constitution .      from a distance it did  anyway .  close to  no .      ball games were unknown in the discworld at this time .       many people think it should have been a hydrogen molecule  but this is against the observed facts .  everyone who has found a hitherto unknown egg whisk jamming an innocent kitchen drawer knows that raw matter is continually flowing into the universe in fairly developed forms  popping into existence normally in ashtrays  vases and glove compartments .  it chooses its shape to allay suspicion  and common manifestations are paperclips  the pins out of shirt packaging  the little keys for central heating radiators  marbles  bits of crayon  mysterious sections of herb chopping devices and old kate bush albums .  why matter does this is unclear  but it is evident that matter has plans .   it is also apparent that creators sometimes favor the big bang method of universe construction  and at other times use the more gentle methods of continuous creation .  this follows studies by cosmotherapists which have revealed that the violence of the big bang can give a universe serious psychological problems when it gets older .       about the author   terry pratchett is one of the most popular living authors in the world .
