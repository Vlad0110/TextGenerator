the early asimov   the quintessence of modem science fiction is thought by many to be contained in the novels and short stories of isaac asimov  and this new collection of twenty seven of his early stories again confirms his inexhaustible imagination and compelling style .   each story is prefaced by dr .  asimov with fascinating  and frequently amusing biographical details about how and when he came to write it as well as his own critical evaluations of it .  the result is a doubly rich science fiction treat  an assortment of tales that are thoroughly entertaining in their own right besides providing a first hand look at the development of the young author and promises of the things yet to come from this master writer .       the  early asimov  or   eleven years  of trying    isaac asimov    copyright         by isaac asimov      to the memory of john wood campbell  jr .            for reasons that this book will make amply obvious      stories included       the callistan menace  ring around the sun  the magnificent possession  trends  the weapon too dreadful to use  black friar of the flame  half breed  the secret sense  homo sol  half breeds on venus  the imaginary

connection  the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline  the red queen   s race  mother earth  appendix the sixty stories of the campbell years      although i have written over a hundred and twenty books  on almost every subject from astronomy to shakespeare and from mathematics to satire  it is probably as a science fiction writer that i am best known .   i began as a science fiction writer  and for the first eleven years of my literary career i wrote nothing but science fiction stories  for magazine publication only and for minute payment .  the thought of actually publishing honest to goodness books never entered my essentially humble mind .   but the time came when i did begin to produce books  and then i began to gather together the material i had earlier written for magazines .  between      and       ten collections appeared  all of which were published by doubleday  .  these contained eighty five stories  plus four pieces of comic verse  originally intended for  and published in  the science fiction magazines .  nearly a quarter of them came from those first eleven years .   for the record  these books are     i  robot         foundation         foundation and empire         second foundation         the martian way and other stories         earth is room enough         nine tomorrows         the rest of the robots         asimov   s mysteries         nightfall and other stories           it might be argued that this was quite enough  but in arguing so  one is omitting the ravenous appetites of my readers  bless them .   .  i am constantly getting letters requesting lists of ancient stories out of me so that the letter writers can haunt secondhand shops for old magazines .  there are people who prepare bibliographies of my science fiction  don   t ask me why  and who want to know all sorts of half forgotten details concerning them .  they even grow distinctly angry when they find that some early stories were never sold and no longer exist .  they want those  too  apparently  and seem to think i have negligently destroyed a natural resource .   so when panther books  in england  and doubleday suggested that i make a collection of those of my early stories not already collected in the ten books listed above  with the literary history of each  i could resist no further .  everyone who has ever met me knows just how amenable to flattery i am  and if you think i can withstand this kind of flattery for more than half a second  as a rough estimate   you are quite wrong .   fortunately i have a diary  which i have been keeping since january          the day before my eighteenth birthday   it can give me dates and details .    the diary began as the sort of thing a teen ager would write  but it quickly degenerated to a simple kind of literary record .  it is  to anyone but myself  utterly boring so boring  in fact  that i leave it around for anyone who wishes  to read .  no one ever reads more than two pages .  occasionally someone asks me if i have never felt that my diary ought to record my innermost feelings and emotions  and my answer is always     no .  never .     after all  what   s the point of being a writer if i have to waste my innermost feelings and emotions on a mere diary .       i began to write when i was very young eleven  i think .  the reasons are obscure  i might say it was the result of an unreasoning urge  but that would just indicate i could think of no reason .   perhaps it was because i was an avid reader in a family that was too poor to afford books  even the cheapest  and besides  a family that considered cheap books unfit reading .  i had to go to the library  my first library card was obtained for me by my father when i was six years old  and make do with two books per week .   this was simply not enough  and my craving drove me to extremes .  at the beginning of each school term  i eagerly read through every schoolbook i was assigned  going from cover to cover like a personified conflagration .  since i was blessed with a tenacious memory and with instant recall  that was all the studying i had to do for that school term  but i was through before the week was over  and then what .   so  when i was eleven  it occurred to me that if i wrote my own books  i could then reread them at my leisure .  i never really wrote a complete book  of course .  i would start one and keep rambling on with it till i outgrew it and then i would start another .  all these early writings are forever gone  though i remember some of the details quite clearly .   in the spring of      i took a special english course given at my high school  boys    high school in brooklyn  that placed the accent on writing .  the teacher was also faculty adviser for the semiannual literary magazine put out by the students  and it was his intention to gather material .  i took that course .   it was a humiliating experience .  i was fourteen at the time  and a rather green and innocent fourteen .  i wrote trifles  while everyone else in the class  who were sixteen apiece  wrote sophisticated  tragic mood pieces .  all of them made no particular secret of their scorn for me  and though i resented it bitterly there was nothing i could do about it .   for a moment i thought i had them when one of my products was accepted for the semiannual literary magazine while many of theirs were rejected .  unfortunately the teacher told me  with callous insensitivity  that mine was the only item submitted that was humorous and that since he had to have one non tragic piece he was forced to take it .   it was called    little brothers     dealt with the arrival of my own little brother five years earlier  and was my first piece of published material of any kind .  i suppose it can be located in the records at boys    high  but i don   t have it  sometimes i wonder what happened to all those great tragic writers in the class .  i don   t remember a single name and i have no intention of ever trying to find out but i sometimes wonder .     it was not until may           according to a date i once jotted down though that was before i began my diary  so i won   t swear to it   that the vague thought occurred to me that i ought to write something for professional publication  something that would be paid for .  naturally it would have to be a science fiction story  for i had been an avid science fiction fan since      and i recognized no other form of literature as in any way worthy of my efforts .   the story i began to compose for the purpose  the first story i ever wrote with a view to becoming a    writer     was entitled    cosmic corkscrew .      in it i viewed time as a helix  that is  something like a bedspring  .  someone could cut across from one turn directly to the next  thus moving into the future by some exact interval but being incapable of traveling one day less into the future .  my protagonist made the cut across time and found the earth deserted .  all animal life was gone  yet there was every sign that life had existed until very shortly before and no indication at all of what had brought about the disappearance .  it was told in the first person from a lunatic asylum  because the narrator had  of course  been placed in a madhouse after he returned and tried to tell his tale .   i wrote only a few pages in       then lost interest .  the mere fact that i had publication in mind must have paralyzed me .  as long as something i wrote was intended for my own eyes only  i could be carefree enough .  the thought of possible other readers weighed down heavily upon my every word .   so i abandoned it .   then  in may       the most important magazine in the field .  astounding science fiction  changed its publication schedule from the third wednesday of the month to the fourth friday .  when the june issue did not arrive on its accustomed day  i went into a decline .   by may     i could stand it no more and took the subway to    seventh avenue  where the publishing house .  street   smith publications  inc .   was then located .    i told this story in some detail in an article entitled    portrait of the writer as a boy     which was included as chapter    of my book of essays science  numbers and i  doubleday        .  in it  relying on memory alone  i said that i had called street   smith on the phone .  when i went back to my diary to check actual dates for this book  i was astonished to discover that i had actually made the subway trip an utterly daring venture for me in those days  and a measure of my desperation .    there  an official of the firm informed me of the changed schedule  and on may     the june issue arrived .   the near brush with doom  and the ecstatic relief that followed  reactivated my desire to write and publish .  i returned to    cosmic corkscrew    and by june    it was finished .   the next question was what to do with it .  i had absolutely no idea what one did with a manuscript intended for publication  and no one i knew had any idea either .  i discussed it with my father  whose knowledge of the real world was scarcely greater than my own  and he had no idea either .   but then it occurred to me that  the month before  i had gone to    seventh avenue merely to inquire about the nonappearance of astounding .  i had not been struck by lightning for doing so .  why not repeat the trip  then  and hand in the manuscript in person .   the thought was a frightening one .  it became even more frightening when my father further suggested that necessary preliminaries included a shave and my best suit .  that meant i would have to take additional time  and the day was already wearing on and i would have to be back in time to make the afternoon newspaper delivery .   my father had a candy store and newsstand  and life was very complicated in those days for a creative writer of artistic and sensitive bent such as myself .  for instance  we lived in an apartment in which all the rooms were in a line and the only way of getting from the living room to the bedroom of my parents  or of my sister  or of my brother  was by going through my bedroom .  my bedroom was therefore frequently gone through  and the fact that i might be in the throes of creation meant nothing to anyone .    i compromised .  i shaved  but did not bother changing suits  and off i went .  the date was june          .   i was convinced that  for daring to ask to see the editor of astounding science fiction  i would be thrown out of the building bodily  and that my manuscript would be torn up and thrown out after me in a shower of confetti .  my father  however  who had lofty notions  was convinced that a writer by which he meant anyone with a manuscript would be treated with the respect due an intellectual .  he had no fears at all  but i was the one who had to go into the building .   trying to mask panic  i asked to see the editor .  the girl behind the desk  i can see the scene in my mind   s eye right now exactly as it was  spoke briefly on the phone and said     mr .  campbell will see you .      she directed me through a large  loftlike room filled with huge rolls of paper and enormous piles of magazines and permeated with the heavenly smell of pulp  a smell that  to this day  will recall my youth in aching detail and reduce me to tears of nostalgia  .  and there  in a small room on the other side  was mr .  campbell .   john wood campbell  jr .   had been working for street   smith for a year and had taken over sole command of astounding stories  which he had promptly renamed astounding science fiction  a couple of months earlier .  he was only twenty eight years old then .  under his own name and under his pen name  don a .  stuart  he was one of the most famous and highly regarded authors of science fiction  but he was about to bury his writing reputation forever under the far greater renown he was to gain as editor .   he was to remain editor of astounding science fiction and of its successor  analog science fact science fiction  for a third of a century .  during all that time  he and i were to remain friends  but however old i grew and however venerable and respected a star of our mutual field i was to become  i never approached him with anything but that awe he inspired in me on the occasion of our first meeting .   he was a large man  an opinionated man  who smoked and talked constantly  and who enjoyed  above anything else  the production of outrageous ideas  which he bounced off his listener and dared him to refute .  it was difficult to refute campbell even when his ideas were absolutely and madly illogical .   we talked for over an hour that first time .  he showed me forthcoming issues of the magazine  actual future issues in the cellulose flesh  .  i found he had printed a    fan letter of mine in the issue about to be published  and another in the next so he knew the genuineness of my interest .   he told me about himself  about his pen name and about his opinions .  he told me that his father had sent in one of his manuscripts to amazing stories when he was seventeen and that it would have been published but the magazine lost it and he had no carbon .   i was ahead of him there .  i had brought in the story myself and i had a carbon .   he also promised to read my story that night and to send a letter  whether acceptance or rejection  the next day .  he promised also that in case of rejection he would tell me what was wrong with it so i could improve .   he lived up to every promise .  two days later  on june      i heard from him .  it was a rejection .   since this book deals with real events and is not a fantasy you can   t be surprised that my first story was instantly rejected .    here is what i said in my diary about the rejection      at      i received back    cosmic corkscrew    with a polite letter of rejection .  he didn   t like the slow beginning  the suicide at the end .      campbell also didn   t like the first person narration and the stiff dialog  and further pointed out that the length  nine thousand words  was inconvenient too long for a short story  too short for a novelette .  magazines had to be put together like jigsaw puzzles  you see  and certain lengths for individual stories were more convenient than others .   by that time  though  i was off and running .  the joy of having spent an hour and more with john campbell  the thrill of talking face to face and on even terms with an idol  had already filled me with the ambition to write another science fiction story  better than the first  so that i could try him again .  the pleasant letter of rejection two full pages in which he discussed my story seriously and with no trace of patronization or contempt  reinforced my joy .  before june    was over  i was halfway through the first draft of another story .   many years later i asked campbell  with whom i had by then grown to be on the closest terms  why he had bothered with me at all  since that first story was surely utterly impossible .      it was     he said frankly  for he never flattered .     on the other hand  i saw something in you .  you were eager and you listened and i knew you wouldn   t quit no matter how many rejections i handed you .  as long as you were willing to work hard at improving  i was willing to work with you .      that was john .  i wasn   t the only writer  whether newcomer or oldtimer  that he was to work with in this fashion .  patiently  and out of his own enormous vitality and talent  he built up a stable of the best s . f .  writers the world had  till then  ever seen .     what happened to    cosmic corkscrew    after that i don   t really know .  i abandoned it and never submitted it anywhere else .  i didn   t actually tear it up and throw it away  it simply languished in some desk drawer until eventually i lost track of it .  in any case  it no longer exists .   this seems to be one of the main sources of discomfort among the archivists they seem to think the first story i ever wrote for publication  however bad it might have been  was an important document .  all i can say  fellows  is that i   m sorry but there was no way of my telling in      that my first try might have historic interest someday .  i may be a monster of vanity and arrogance  but i   m not that much a monster of vanity and arrogance .   besides  before the month was out i had finished my second story     stowaway     and i was concentrating on that .  i brought it to campbell   s office on july           and he was just a trifle slower in returning it  but the rejection came on july    .  i said in my diary concerning the letter that accompanied it       .   .   .  it was the nicest possible rejection you could imagine .  indeed  the next best thing to an acceptance .  he told me the idea was good and the plot passable .  the dialog and handling  he continued  were neither stiff nor wooden  this was rather a delightful surprise to me  and that there was no one particular fault but merely a general air of amateurishness  constraint  forcing .  the story did not go smoothly .  this  he said  i would grow out of as soon as i had had sufficient experience .  he assured me that i would probably be able to sell my stories but it meant perhaps a year   s work and a dozen stories before i could click .   .   .   .      it is no wonder that such a    rejection letter    kept me hotly charged with enormous enthusiasm to write  and i got promptly to work on a third story .   what   s more  i was sufficiently encouraged to try to submit    stowaway    elsewhere .  in those days there were three science fiction magazines on the stands .  astounding was the aristocrat of the lot  a monthly with smooth edges and an appearance of class .  the other two .  amazing stories and thrilling wonder stories  were somewhat more primitive in appearance and printed stories  with more action and less sophisticated plots .  i sent    stowaway    to thrilling wonder stories  which  however  also rejected it promptly on august          with a form letter  .   by then  though  i was deeply engaged with my third story  which  as it happened  was fated to do better and do it faster .  in this book  however  i am including my stories not in the order of publication but in order of writing which i presume is more significant from the standpoint of literary development .  let me stay with    stowaway     therefore .   in the summer of       by which time i had gained my first few successes  i returned to    stowaway     refurbished it somewhat  and tried thrilling wonder stories again .  undoubtedly i had a small suspicion that the new luster of my name would cause them to read it with a different attitude than had been the case when i was a complete unknown .  i was quite wrong .  it was rejected again .   then i tried amazing  and again it was rejected .   that meant the story was dead  or would have meant so were it not for the fact that science fiction was entering a small    boom    as the     s approached their end .  new magazines were being founded  and toward the end of       plans were made to publish a magazine to be called astonishing stories  which would retail for the price of ten cents .   astounding cost twenty cents an issue .    the new magazine  together with a sister magazine .  super science stories  were to be edited on a shoestring by a young science fiction fan  frederik pohl  who was then just turning twenty  he was about a month older than myself   and who  in this way  made his entry into what was to be a distinguished professional career in science fiction .   pohl was a thin  soft spoken young man  with hair that was already thinning  a solemn face  and a pronounced overbite that gave him a rabbity look when he smiled .  the economic facts of his life kept him out of college  but he was far brighter  and knew more  than almost any college graduate i   ve ever met .   pohl was a friend of mine  and still is  and perhaps did more to help me start my literary career than anyone except  of course  campbell himself .  we had attended fan club meetings together .  he had read my manuscripts and praised them  and now he needed stories in a hurry  and at low rates  for his new magazines .   he asked to look through my manuscripts again .  he began by choosing one of my stories for his first issue .  on november           nearly a year and a half after    stowaway    was first written  pohl selected it for inclusion in his second issue of astonishing .  he was an inveterate title changer  however  and he plastered    the callistan menace    on the story and that was how it was published .   so here it is  the second story i ever wrote and the earliest story to see professional publication .  the reader can judge for himself whether campbell   s critique  given above  was overly kind and whether he was justified in foreseeing a professional writing career for me on the basis of this story .      the callistan menace    appears here  as will all the stories in this volume  exactly as it appeared in the magazine with only the editing and adjustment required to correct typographical errors .       the callistan menace         damn jupiter .     growled ambrose whitefield viciously  and i nodded agreement .      i   ve been on the jovian satellite run     i said     for fifteen years and i   ve heard those two words spoken maybe a million times .  it   s probably the most sincere curse in the solar system .      our watch at the controls of the scoutship ceres had just been relieved and we descended the two levels to our room with dragging steps .      damn jupiter and damn it again     insisted whitefield morosely .     it   s too big for the system .  it stays out there behind us and pulls and pulls and pulls .  we   ve got to keep the atomos firing all the way .  we   ve got to check our course  completely every hour .  no relaxation  no coasting  no taking it easy .  nothing but the rottenest kind of work .      there were tiny beads of perspiration on his forehead and he swabbed at them with the back of his hand .  he was a young fellow  scarcely thirty  and you could see in his eyes that he was nervous  and even a little frightened .   and it wasn   t jupiter that was bothering him  in spite of his profanity .  jupiter was the least of our worries .  it was callisto .  it was that little moon which gleamed a pale blue upon our visiplates that made whitefield sweat and that had spoiled four nights    sleep for me already .  callisto .  our destination .   even old mac steeden  gray mustachioed veteran who  in his youth  had sailed with the great peewee wilson himself  went about his duties with an absent stare .  four days out  and ten days more ahead of us and panic was reaching out with clammy fingers .   we were all brave enough in the ordinary course of events .  the eight of us on the ceres had faced the purple lectronics and stabbing disintos of pirates and rebels and the alien environments of half a dozen worlds .  but it takes more than run of the mill bravery to face the unknown  to face callisto  the    mystery world    of the solar system .   one fact was known about callisto one grim  bare fact .  over a period of twenty five years  seven ships  progressively better equipped  had landed and never been heard from again .  the sunday supplements peopled the satellite with anything from super dinosaurs to invisible ghosts of the fourth dimension  but that did not solve the mystery .   we were the eighth .  we had a better ship than any of those preceding .  we were the first to sport the newly developed beryl tungsten hull  twice as strong as the old steel shells .  we possessed super heavy armaments and the very latest atomic drive engines .   still we were only the eighth  and every man jack of us knew it .     whitefield entered our quarters silently and flopped down upon his bunk .  his fists were clenched under his chin and showed white at the knuckles .  it seemed to me that he wasn   t far from the breaking point .  it was a case for careful diplomacy .      what we need     said i     is a good  stiff drink .         what we need     he answered harshly     is a hell of a lot of good  stiff drinks .         well  what   s stopping us .      he looked at me suspiciously     you know there isn   t a drop of liquor aboard ship .  it   s against navy regulations .         sparkling green jabra water     i said slowly  letting the words drip from my mouth .     aged beneath the martian deserts .  melted emerald juice .  bottles of it .  cases of it .         where .         i know where .  what do you say .  a few drinks just a few will cheer us both up .      for a moment  his eyes sparkled  and then they dulled again     what if the captain finds out .  he   s a stickler for discipline  and on a trip like this  it   s liable to cost us our rating .      i winked and grinned     it   s the captain   s own cache .  he can   t discipline us without cutting his own throat the old hypocrite .  he   s the best damn captain there ever was  but he likes his emerald water .      whitefield stared at me long and hard     all right .  lead me to it .      we slipped down to the supply room  which was deserted  of course .  the captain and steeden were at the controls  brock and charney were at the engines  and harrigan and tuley were snoring their fool heads off in their own room .   moving as quietly as i could  through sheer habit  i pushed aside several crates of food tabs and slid open a hidden panel near the floor .  i reached in and drew out a dusty bottle  which  in the dim light  sparkled a dull sea green .      sit down     i said     and make yourself comfortable .     i produced two tiny cups and filled them .   whitefield sipped slowly and with every evidence of satisfaction .  he downed his second at one gulp .      how come you volunteered for this trip  anyway  whitey .     i asked     you   re a little green for a thing like this .      he waved his hand     you know how it is .  things get dull after a while .  i went in for zoology after getting out of college big field since interplanetary travel and had a nice comfortable position back on ganymede .  it was dull  though   i was bored blue .  so i joined the navy on an impulse  and on another i volunteered for this trip .     he sighed ruefully     i   m a little sorry i did .         that   s not the way to take it  kid .  i   m experienced and i know .  when you   re panicky  you   re as good as licked .  why  two months from now  we   ll be back on ganymede .         i   m not scared  if that   s what you   re thinking     he exclaimed angrily .     it   s it   s     there was a long pause in which he frowned at his third cupful .     well  i   m just worn out trying to imagine what the hell to expect .  my imagination is working overtime and my nerves are rubbing raw .         sure  sure     i soothed     i   m not blaming you .  it   s that way with all of us  i guess .  but you have to be careful .  why  i remember once on a mars titan trip  we had      whitefield interrupted what was one of my favorite yarns  and i could spin them as well as anyone in the service with a jab in the ribs that knocked the breath out of me .   he put down his jabra gingerly .      say  jenkins     he stuttered     i haven   t downed enough liquor to be imagining things  have i .         that depends on what you imagined .         i could swear i saw something move somewhere in the pile of empty crates in the far corner .         that   s a bad sign     and i took another swig as i said it .     your nerves are going to your eyes and now they   re going back on you .  ghosts  i suppose  or the callistan menace looking us over in advance .         i saw it  i tell you .  there   s something alive there .     he edged towards me his nerves were plenty shot and for a moment  in the dim  shadowy light even i felt a bit choked up .      you   re crazy     i said in a loud voice  and the echoes calmed me down a bit .  i put down my empty cup and got up just a wee bit unsteadily .     let   s go over and poke through the crates .      whitefield followed me and together we started shoving the light aluminum cubicles this way and that .  neither of us was quite one hundred per cent sober and we made a fair amount of noise .  out of the corner of my eye  i could see whitefield trying to move the case nearest the wall .      this one isn   t empty     he grunted  as it lifted very slightly off the floor .   muttering under his breath  he knocked off the cover and looked in .  for a half second he just stared and then he backed away slowly .  he tripped over something and fell into a sitting position  still gaping at the case .   i watched his actions with raised eyebrows  then glanced hastily at the case in question .  the glance froze into a steady glare  and i emitted a hoarse yell that rattled off each of the four walls .   a boy was sticking his head out of the case a red haired dirty faced kid of thirteen or thereabouts .      hello     said the boy as he clambered out into the open .  neither of us found the strength to answer him  so he continued     i   m glad you found me .  i was getting a cramp in my shoulder trying to curl up in there .      whitefield gulped audibly     good god .  a kid stowaway .  and on a voyage to callisto .         and we can   t turn back     i reminded in a stricken voice     without wrecking ourselves .  the jovian satellite run is poison .         look here     whitefield turned on the kid in a sudden belligerence .     who are you  you young nut  and what are you doing here .      the kid flinched .     i   m stanley fields     he answered  a bit scared .     i   m from new chicago on ganymede .  i i ran away to space  like they do in books .     he paused and then asked brightly     do you think we   ll have a fight with pirates on this trip  mister .      there was no doubt that the kid was filled to the brim with    dime spacers .     i used to read them myself as a youngster .      how about your parents .     asked whitefield  grimly .      oh  all i got   s an uncle .  he won   t care much  i guess .     he had gotten over his first uneasiness and stood grinning at us .      well  what   s to be done .     said whitefield  looking at me in complete helplessness .   i shrugged     take him to the captain .  let him worry .         and how will he take it .         anyway he wants .  it   s not our fault .  besides  there   s absolutely nothing to be done about the mess .      and grabbing an arm apiece  we walked away  dragging the kid between us .     captain bartlett is a capable officer and one of the deadpan type that very rarely displays emotion .  consequently  on those few occasions when he does  it   s like a mercurian volcano in full eruption and you haven   t lived until you   ve seen one of those .   it was a case of the final straw .  a satellite run is always wearing .  the image of callisto up ahead was harder on him than on any member of the crew .  and now there was this kid stowaway .   it wasn   t to be endured .  for half an hour  the captain shot off salvo after salvo of the very worst sort of profanity .  he started with the sun and ran down the list of planets  satellites  asteroids  comets  to the very meteors themselves .  he was starting on the nearer fixed stars  when he collapsed from sheer nervous exhaustion .  he was so excited that he never thought to ask us what we were doing in the storeroom in the first place  and for that whitefield and i were duly grateful .   but captain bartlett is no fool .  having purged his system of its nervous tension  he saw clearly that that which cannot be cured must be endured .      someone take him and wash him up     he growled wearily     and keep him out of my sight for a while .     then  softening a bit  he drew me towards him     don   t scare him by telling him where we   re going .  he   s in a bad spot  the poor kid .      when we left  the old soft hearted fraud was sending through an emergency message to ganymede trying to get in touch with the kid   s uncle .     of course  we didn   t know it at the time  but that kid was a godsend a genuine stroke of old man luck .  he took our minds off callisto .  he gave us something else to think about .  the tension  which at the end of four days had almost reached the breaking point  eased completely .   there was something refreshing in the kid   s natural gayety  in his bright ingenuousness .  he would meander about the ship asking the silliest kind of questions .  he insisted on expecting pirates at any moment .  and  most of all  he persisted in regarding each and every one of us as    dime spacer    heroes .   that last flattered our egos  of course  and put us on our mettle .  we vied with each other in chest puffing and tale telling  and old mac steeden  who in stanley   s eyes was a demi god  broke the all time record for plain and fancy lying .   i remember  particularly  the talk fest we had on the seventh day out .  we were just past the midpoint of the trip and were set to begin a cautious deceleration .  all of us  except harrigan and tuley  who were at the engines  were sitting in the control room .  whitefield  with half an eye on the mathematico  led off  and  as usual  talked zoology .      it   s a little slug like thing     he was saying     found only on europa .  it   s called the carolus europis but we always referred to it as the magnet worm .  it   s about six inches long and has a sort of a slate grey color most disgusting thing you could imagine .      we spent six months studying that worm  though  and i never saw old mornikoff so excited about anything before .  you see  it killed by some sort of magnetic field .  you put the magnet worm at one end of the room and a caterpillar  say  at the other .  you wait about five minutes and the caterpillar just curls up and dies .      and the funny thing is this .  it won   t touch a frog too big  but if you take that frog and put some sort of iron band about it  that magnet worm kills it just like that .  that   s why we know it   s some type of magnetic field that does it the presence of iron more than quadruples its strength .      his story made quite an impression on us .  joe brock   s deep bass voice sounded     i   m damn glad those things are only four inches long  if what you say is right .      mac steeden stretched and then pulled at his grey mustachios with exaggerated indifference     you call that worm unusual .  it isn   t a patch on some of the things i   ve seen in my day  .     he shook his head slowly and reminiscently  and we knew we were in for a long and gruesome tale .  someone groaned hollowly  but stanley brightened up the minute he saw the old veteran was in a story telling mood .   steeden noticed the kid   s sparkling eyes  and addressed himself to the little fellow     i was with peewee wilson when it happened you   ve heard of peewee wilson  haven   t you .         oh  yes     stanley   s eyes fairly exuded hero worship .     i   ve read books about him .  he was the greatest spacer there ever was .         you bet all the radium on titan he was  kid .  he wasn   t any taller than you  and didn   t scale much more than a hundred pounds  but he was worth five times his weight in venusian devils in any fight .  and me and him were just like that .  he never went anyplace but what i was with him .  when the going was toughest it was always me that he turned to .      he sighed lugubriously     i was with him to the very end .  it was only a broken leg that kept me from going with him on his last voyage        he choked off suddenly and a chilly silence swept over all of us .  whitefield   s face went gray  the captain   s mouth twisted in a funny sort of way  and i felt my heart skid all the way down to the soles of my feet .   no one spoke  but there was only one thought among the six of us .  peewee wilson   s last trip had been to callisto .  he had been the second and had never returned .  we were the eighth .   stanley stared from one to the other of us in astonishment  but we all avoided his eyes .   it was captain bartlett that recovered first .      say  steeden  you   ve got an old spacesuit of peewee wilson   s  haven   t you .     his voice was calm and steady but i could see that it took a great deal of effort to keep it so .   steeden brightened and looked up .  he had been chewing at the tips of his mustachios  he always did when nervous  and now they hung downwards in a bedraggled fashion .      sure thing .  captain .  he gave it to me with his own hand  he did .  it was back in       when the new steel suits were just being put out .  peewee didn   t have any more use for his old vitri rubber contraption  so he let me have it and i   ve kept it ever since .  it   s good luck for me .         well  i was thinking that we might fix up that old suit for the boy here .  no other suit   ll fit him  and he needs one bad .      the veteran   s faded eyes hardened and he shook his head vigorously     no sir .  captain .  no one touches that old suit peewee gave it to me himself .  with his own hand .  it   s it   s sacred  that   s what it is .      the rest of us chimed in immediately upon the captain   s side but steeden   s obstinacy grew and hardened .  again and again he would repeat tonelessly     that old suit stays where it is .     and he would emphasize the statement with a blow of his gnarled fist .   we were about to give up  when stanley  hitherto discreetly silent  took a hand .      please  mr .  steeden     there was just the suspicion of a quaver in his voice .     please let me have it .  i   ll take good care of it .  i   ll bet if peewee wilson were alive today he   d say i could have it .     his blue eyes misted up and his lower lip trembled a bit .  the kid was a perfect actor .   steeden looked irresolute and took to biting his mustachio again     well oh  hell  you   ve all got it in for me .  the kid can have it but don   t expect me to fix it up .  the rest of you can lose sleep i wash my hands of it .      and so captain bartlett killed two birds with one stone .  he took our minds off callisto at a time when the morale of the crew hung in the balance and he gave us something to think about for the remainder of the trip for renovating that ancient relic of a suit was almost a week   s job .   we worked over that antique with a concentration out of all proportion to the importance of the job .  in its pettiness  we forgot the steadily growing orb of callisto .  we soldered every   last crack and blister in that venerable suit .  we patched the inside with close meshed aluminum wire .  we refurbished the tiny heating unit and installed new tungsten oxygen containers .   even the captain was not above giving us a hand with the suit  and steeden  after the first day  in spite of his tirade at the beginning  threw himself into the job with a will .   we finished it the day before the scheduled landing  and stanley  when he tried it on  glowed with pride  while steeden stood by  grinning and twirling his mustachio .     and as the days passed  the pale blue circle that was callisto grew upon the visiplate until it took up most of the sky .  the last day was an uneasy one .  we went about our tasks abstractedly  and studiously avoided the sight of the hard  emotionless satellite ahead .   we dived in a long  gradually contracting spiral .  by this maneuvre  the captain had hoped to gain some preliminary knowledge of the nature of the planet and its inhabitants  but the information gained was almost entirely negative .  the large percentage of carbon dioxide present in the thin  cold atmosphere was congenial to plant life  so that vegetation was plentiful and diversified .  however  the three per cent oxygen content seemed to preclude the possibility of any animal life  other than the simplest and most sluggish species .  nor was there any evidence at all of cities or artificial structures of any kind .   five times we circled callisto before sighting a large lake  shaped something like a horse   s head .  it was towards that lake that we gently lowered ourselves  for the last message of the second expedition peewee wilson   s expedition spoke of landing near such a lake .   we were still half a mile in the air  when we located the gleaming metal ovoid that was the phobos  and when we finally thumped softly on to the green stubble of vegetation  we were scarcely five hundred yards from the unfortunate craft .      strange     muttered the captain  after we had all congregated in the control room  waiting for further orders     there seems to be no evidence of any violence at all .      it was true .  the phobos lay quietly  seemingly unharmed .  its old fashioned steel hull glistened brightly in the yellow light of a gibbous jupiter  for the scant oxygen of the atmosphere could make no rusty inroads upon its resistant exterior .   the captain came out of a brown study and turned to charney at the radio .      ganymede has answered .         yes  sir .  they wish us luck .     he said it simply  but a cold shiver ran down my spine .   not a muscle of the captain   s face flickered .     have you tried to communicate with the phobos .         no answer  sir .         three of us will investigate the phobos .  some of the answers  at least  should be there .         matchstickst    grunted brock  stolidly .   the captain nodded gravely .   he palmed eight matches  breaking three in half  and extended his arm towards us  without saying a word .   charney stepped forward and drew first .  it was broken and he stepped quietly towards the space suit rack .  tuley followed and after him harrigan and whitefield .  then i  and i drew the second broken match .  i grinned and followed charney  and in thirty seconds  old steeden himself joined us .      the ship will be backing you fellows     said the captain quietly  as he shook our hands .     if anything dangerous turns up  run for it no heroics now  for we can   t afford to lose men .        we inspected our pocket lectronics and left .  we didn   t know exactly what to expect and weren   t sure but that our first steps on callistan soil might not be our last  but none of us hesitated an instant .  in the    dime spacers     courage is a very cheap commodity  but it is rather more expensive in real life .  and it is with considerable pride that i recall the firm steps with which we three left the protection of the ceres .   i looked back only once and caught a glimpse of stanley   s face pressed white against the thick glass of the porthole .  even from a distance  his excitement was only too apparent .  poor kid .  for the last two days he had been convinced we were on our way to clean up a pirate stronghold and was almost dying with impatience for the fighting to begin .  of course  none of us cared to disillusion him .   the outer hull of the phobos rose before us and overshadowed us with its might .  the giant vessel lay in the dark green stubble  silent as death .  one of the seven that had attempted and failed .  and we were the eighth .   charney broke the uneasy silence     what are these white smears on the hull .      he put up a metal encased finger and rubbed it along the steel plate .  he withdrew it and gazed at the soft white pulp upon it .  with an involuntary shudder of disgust  he scraped it off upon the coarse grass beneath .      what do you think it is .      the entire ship as far as we could see except for that portion immediately next the ground was besmeared by a thin layer of the pulpy substance .  it looked like dried foam like   i said     it looks like slime left after a giant slug had come out of the lake and slithered over the ship .      i wasn   t serious in my statement  of course  but the other two cast hasty looks at the mirror smooth lake in which jupiter   s image lay unruffled .  charney drew his hand lectronic .      here .     cried steeden  suddenly  his voice harsh and metallic as it came over the radio     that   s no way to be talking .  we   ve got to find some way of getting into the ship  there must be some break in its hull somewhere .  you go around to the right  charney  and you  jenkins  to the left .  i   ll see if i can   t get atop of this thing somehow .      eyeing the smoothly round hull carefully  he drew back and jumped .  on callisto  of course  he weighed only twenty pounds or less  suit and all  so he rose upwards some thirty or forty feet .  he slammed against the hull lightly  and as he started sliding downwards  he grabbed a rivet head and scrambled to the top .   waving a parting to charney at this point  i left .      everything all right .     the captain   s voice sounded thinly in my ear .      all o . k .      i replied gruffly     so far .     and as i said so  the ceres disappeared behind the convex bulge of the dead phobos and i was entirely alone upon the mysterious moon .   i pursued my round silently thereafter .  the spaceship   s    skin    was entirely unbroken except for the dark  staring portholes  the lowest of which were still well above my head .  once or twice i thought i could see steeden scrambling monkey like on top of the smooth hulk  but perhaps that was only fancy .   i reached the prow at last which was bathed in the full light of jupiter .  there  the lowest row of portholes were low enough to see into and as i passed from one to the other  i felt as if i were gazing into a shipful of spectres  for in the ghostly light all objects appeared only as flickering shadows .   it was the last window in the line that proved to be of sudden  overpowering interest .  in the yellow rectangle of jupiter light stamped upon the floor  there sprawled what remained of a man .  his clothes were draped about him loosely and his shirt was ridged as if the ribs below had moulded it into position .  in the space between the open shirt collar and engineer   s cap  there showed a grinning  eyeless skull .  the cap  resting askew upon the smooth skullcase  seemed to add the last refinement of horror to the sight .   a shout in my ears caused my heart to leap .  it was steeden  exclaiming profanely somewhere above the ship .  almost at once  i caught sight of his ungainly steel clad body slipping and sliding down the side of the ship .   we raced towards him in long  floating leaps and he waved us on  running ahead of us  towards the lake .  at its very shores  he stopped and bent over some half buried object two bounds brought us to him  and we saw that the object was a space suited human  lying face downward .  over it was a thick layer of the same slimy smear that covered the phobos .      i caught sight of it from the heights of the ship     said steeden  somewhat breathlessly  as he turned the suited figure over .   what we saw caused all three of us to explode in a simultaneous cry .  through the glassy visor  there appeared a leprous countenance .  the features were putrescent  fallen apart  as if decay had set in and ceased because of the limited air supply .  here and there a bit of gray bone showed through .  it was the most repulsive sight i have ever witnessed  though i have seen many almost as bad .      my god .     charney   s voice was half a sob .     they simply die and decay .     i told steeden of the clothed skeleton i had seen through the porthole .      damn it  it   s a puzzle     growled steeden     and the answer must be inside the phobos .     there was a momentary silence     i tell you what .  one of us can go back and get the captain to dismount the disintegrator .  it ought to be light enough to handle on callisto  and at low power  we can draw it fine enough to cut a hole without blowing the entire ship to kingdom come .  you go  jenkins .  charney and i will see if we can   t find any more of the poor devils .      i set off for the ceres without further urging  covering the ground in space devouring leaps .  three quarters of the distance had been covered when a loud shout  ringing metallically in my ear  brought me to a skidding halt .  i wheeled  .  in dismay and remained petrified at the sight before my eyes .     the surface of the lake was broken into boiling foam  and from it there reared the fore parts of what appeared to be giant caterpillars .  they squirmed out upon land  dirty grey bodies dripping slime and water .  they were some four feet long  about one foot in thickness  and their method of locomotion was the slowest of oxygen conserving crawls .  except for one stalky growth upon their forward end  the tip of which glowed a faint red  they were absolutely featureless .   even as i watched  their numbers increased  until the shore became one heaving mass of sickly gray flesh .   charney and steeden were running towards the ceres  but less than half the distance had been covered when they stumbled  their run slowing to a blind stagger .  even that ceased  and almost together they fell to their knees .   charney   s voice sounded faintly in my ear     get help .  my head is splitting .  i can   t move .  i     both lay still now .   i started towards them automatically  but a sudden sharp pang just over my temples staggered me  and for a moment i stood confused .   then i heard a sudden unearthly shout from whitefield     get back to the ship  jenkins .  get back .  get back .      i turned to obey  for the pain had increased into a continuous tearing pain .  i weaved and reeled as i approached the yawning airlock  and i believe that i was at the point of collapse when i finally fell into it .  after that  i can recall only a jumble for quite a period .   my next clear impression was of the control room of the ceres .  someone had dragged the suit off me  and i gazed about me in dismay at a scene of the utmost confusion .  my brain was still somewhat addled and captain bartlett as he leant over me appeared double .      do you know what those damnable creatures are .     he pointed outwards at the giant caterpillars .   i shook my head mutely .      they   re the great grand daddies of the magnet worm whitefield was telling us of once .  do you remember the magnet worm .      i nodded     the one that kills by a magnetic field which is strengthened by surrounding iron .         damn it  yes     cried whitefield  interrupting suddenly .     i   ll swear to it .  if it wasn   t for the lucky chance that our hull is beryl tungsten and not steel like the phobos and the rest every last one of us would be unconscious by now and dead before long .         then that   s the callistan menace .     my voice rose in sudden dismay     but what of charney and steeden .         they   re sunk     muttered the captain grimly .     unconscious  maybe dead .  those filthy worms are crawling towards them and there   s nothing we can do about it .     he ticked off the points on his fingers .     we can   t go after them in a spacesuit without signing our own death warrant spacesuits are steel .  no one can last there and back without one .  we have no weapons with a beam fine enough to blast the worms without scorching charney and steeden as well .  i   ve thought of maneuvering the ceres nearer and making a dash for it  but one can   t handle a spaceship on planetary surfaces like that not without cracking up .  we         in short     i interrupted hollowly     we   ve got to stand here and watch them die .     he nodded and i turned away bitterly .   i felt a slight twitch upon my sleeve  and when i turned  it was to find stanley   s wide blue eyes staring up at me .  in the excitement  i had forgotten about him  and now i regarded him bad temperedly .      what is it .     i snapped .      mr .  jenkins     his eyes were red  and i think he would have preferred pirates to magnet worms by a good deal     mr .  jenkins  maybe i could go and get mr .  charney and mr .  steeden .      i sighed  and turned away .      but  mr .  jenkins  i could .  i heard what mr .  whitefield said  and my spacesuit isn   t steel .  it   s vitri rubber .         the kid   s right     whispered whitefield slowly  when stanley repeated his offer to the assembled men .     the unstrengthened field doesn   t harm us  that   s evident .  he   d be safe in a vitri rubber suit .         but it   s a wreck  that suit .     objected the captain .     i never really intended having the kid use it .     he ended raggedly and his manner was evidently irresolute .      we can   t leave neal and mac out there without trying  captain     said brock stolidly .     the captain made up his mind suddenly and became a whirlwind of action .  he dived into the space suit rack for the battered relic himself  and helped stanley into it .      get steeden first     said the captain  as he clipped shut the last bolt .     he   s older and has less resistance to the field .   good luck to you  kid  and if you can   t make it  come back right away .  right away  do you hear me .      stanley sprawled at the first step  but life on ganymede had inured him to below normal gravities and he recovered quickly .  there was no sign of hesitation  as he leaped towards the two prone figures  and we breathed easier .  evidently  the magnetic field was not affecting him yet .   he had one of the suited figures over his shoulders now and was proceeding back to the ship at an only slightly slower pace .  as he dropped his burden inside the airlock  he waved an arm to us at the window and we waved back .  he had scarcely left  when we had steeden inside .  we ripped the spacesuit off him and laid him out  a gaunt pale figure  on the couch .   the captain bent an ear to his chest and suddenly laughed aloud in sudden relief     the old geezer   s still going strong .      we crowded about happily at hearing that  all eager to place a finger upon his wrist and so assure ourselves of the life within him .  his face twitched  and when a low  blurred voice suddenly whispered     so i said to peewee  i said     our last doubts were put to rest .   it was a sudden  sharp cry from whitefield that drew us back to the window again     something   s wrong with the kid .      stanley was half way back to the ship with his second burden  but he was staggering now progressing erratically .      it can   t be     whispered whitefield  hoarsely     it can   t be .  the field can   t be getting him .         god .     the captain tore at his hair wildly     that damned antique has no radio .  he can   t tell us what   s wrong .     he wrenched away suddenly .     i   m going after him .  field or no field  i   m going to get him .         hold on .  captain     said tuley  grabbing him by the arm     he may make it .      stanley was running again  but in a curious weaving fashion that made it quite plain  he didn   t see where he was going .  two or three times he slipped and fell but each time he managed to scramble up again .  he fell against the hull of the ship  at last  and felt wildly about for the yawning airlock .  we shouted and prayed and sweated  but could help in no way .   and then he simply disappeared .  he had come up against the lock and fallen inside .   we had them both inside in record time  and divested them of their suits .  charney was alive  we saw that at a glance  and after that we deserted him unceremoniously for stanley .  the blue of his face  his swollen tongue  the line of fresh    blood running from nose to chin told its own story .      the suit sprung a leak     said harrigan .      get away from him     ordered the captain     give him air .      we waited .  finally  a soft moan from the kid betokened returning consciousness and we all grinned in concert .      spunky little kid     said the captain .     he travelled that last hundred yards on nerve and nothing else .     then  again .     spunky little kid .  he   s going to get a naval medal for this  if i have to give him my own .        callisto was a shrinking blue ball on the televisor an ordinary unmysterious world .  stanley fields  honorary captain of the good ship ceres  thumbed his nose at it  protruding his tongue at the same time .  an inelegant gesture  but the symbol of man   s triumph over a hostile solar system .     the end    as i reread the story now  it   s the first time i   ve reread it since it was published  i am amused to see that my stowaway youngster   s name is stanley .  that is the name of my younger brother  who was only nine when i wrote the story  the same younger brother who was the subject of my boys    high essay  and who is now assistant publisher of the long island newsday  .  why it is necessary to use    real names    i don   t know  but almost every beginning writer does so  i suspect .     you will notice that there are no girls in the story .  this is not really surprising .  at eighteen i was busy finishing college and working in my father   s candy store and handling a paper delivery route morning and evening  and i had actually never had time to have a date .  i didn   t know anything at all about girls  except for such biology as i got out of books and from other  more knowledgeable  boys  .   i eventually had dates and i eventually introduced girls into my stories  but the early imprinting had its effect .  to this very day  the romantic element in my stories is minor and the sexual element virtually nil .   on the other hand  i wonder if the above explanation for the lack of sex in my stories is not an oversimplification .  after all  i am also a teetotaler and yet i notice that my characters drink martian jabra water  whatever that is  .   my knowledge of astronomy was quite respectable but i let myself be overinfluenced by the conventions common in the science fiction of that era .  all worlds were earthlike and inhabited in those days  so i gave callisto an atmosphere containing a small quantity of free oxygen .  i also gave it running water  and both plant and animal life .  all of this is  of course  unlikely in the extreme  and what evidence we have seems to make of callisto an airless  waterless world like our moon  and  of course  i really knew this even back then  .     back to my third story  now   on july           only eight days after campbell   s second rejection  i had finished my third story     marooned off vesta .     i did not think it politic to see campbell oftener than once a month  however  since i suspected that i might easily wear out my welcome if i did .  i put    marooned off vesta    to one side  therefore  and began to write other stories .  by the end of the month i had two more     this irrational planet    and    ring around the sun .      my first three stories  including    marooned off vesta     had been typed on a very old  but completely serviceable underwood no .    typewriter  which my father had obtained for me in      for ten dollars .  after i had submitted my second story to campbell  however  my father decided that i was in earnest about a writing career  and feeling that my failure to sell was irrelevant and  in any case  temporary  he set about getting me a brand new typewriter .   on august           a smith corona portable entered the house and it was on the new typewriter that my fourth and fifth stories were written .   of the three  i felt    this irrational planet    to be the weakest  so i did not submit it to campbell .  i submitted it directly to thrilling wonder stories on august     and it was not rejected till september    .  campbell had spoiled me  and the four week interval between submission and rejection appalled me .  i even called during that interval to make an indignant inquiry not knowing that a mere four week wait was brief indeed for anyone but campbell .   but at least the rejection  when it came  was typewritten     and was not a printed form .  what   s more  it contained the sentence     try us again  won   t you .     that encouraged me .  perhaps i underestimated the story .  buoyantly  i tried campbell  and he rejected it in six days .  five other magazines rejected it afterward .  i never did sell it  and    this irrational planet    is also nonexistent now .  i don   t even remember the plot  except that i   m pretty certain that the planet of the title was earth itself .   the only other information i have about it is that it was quite short  only three thousand words long .  actually  most of the stories of those early years that i never sold  and no longer exist  were short .  the longest was the first     cosmic corkscrew .       the other two stories written in the same month were reserved for a better fate  but it didn   t seem so at first on august           i visited campbell for the third time and submitted both    marooned off vesta    and    ring around the sun    and both were returned to me on september   .   the very next day i shipped off    marooned off vesta     which i felt to be the better of the two  to amazing stories .  it took a month and a half to hear from them  but this time the wait was worth it .  on october           there came a letter of acceptance from raymond a .  palmer  who was then editor of amazing and who has since achieved his greatest fame as a leading figure in the flying saucers craze and in other forms of occultism .  to this day i have never met mr .  palmer personally .   it was my first acceptance  four months to the day after my first visit to john campbell .  by that time i had written six stories and had collected nine rejections from various magazines .  the check  for      one cent a word   followed on october     and that was the first money i ever earned as a professional writer .    in this book  i am going to pay considerable attention to the money i received for my stories .  this is not because i write primarily for money or regarded money as particularly important either then or now  my publishers will gladly bear witness to this  .  the money i received  however  was crucial in determining my career .  it paid enough to put me through school and not so much as to lure me out of it .  you   ll see as we go along  .    for a number of years i kept that first acceptance letter  from palmer  framed on my bedroom wall .  but in the vicissitudes of life  it  too  has disappeared and  yes  i   m sorry .   the story appeared in the march      issue of amazing stories  which reached the newsstands on january           just eight days after my nineteenth birthday .  it was the first occasion on which i ever appeared professionally  and i still have an intact copy of that issue of the magazine .  i did not save one at the time  my sense of historical importance  as i have already explained  is deficient  but eventually removed my story for binding and discarded the rest .  ordinarily  i don   t mind doing this and have done it ruthlessly through all the years  space is limited even in the best of apartments when one is as prolific as i have been   but the time came when i was sorry i hadn   t saved that first one intact .  the well known science fiction fan forrest j ackerman heard me express regret and kindly sent me a copy in excellent condition .   that copy  by the way  contains a little autobiographical squib in the rear  written by my teen age self .  on rereading  years later  it turned out to be exquisitely embarrassing .      marooned off vesta    is not included here  since it appeared in asimov   s mysteries .   this doesn   t mean it was a mystery .  the reason for its inclusion in that particular collection is explained there .   well  go ahead  buy the book and satisfy your curiosity .      as for    ring around the sun     it was rejected by thrilling wonder stories  but then  on february          it was accepted by future fiction  one of the new science fiction magazines that were springing up .   it appeared in the second issue of that magazine  which did not  however  reach the stands until nearly a year after the sale .  the payment  theoretically on publication  rather than on acceptance as was campbell   s more civilized procedure  was even more delayed .  what   s more  it was at the rate of only half a cent a word  so the check came to a mere twenty five dollars .  astonishing stories also paid only half a cent a word at that time  but    the callistan menace    was the longer story       words so it netted me     .    .   i didn   t feel put upon  however .  i well knew by that time that in the still earlier history of science fiction magazines  payment of a quarter of a cent a word was common  and that not on publication but  the saying went  on lawsuit .  besides  those were lean times  and twenty five dollars represented something like five months    pocket money to me  no kidding  .   the editor of future fiction was  at that time  charles d .  hornig .  i occasionally visited his office to inquire when a story might appear  or when a check might  but i don   t recall ever having found him in .  in fact  to this day i have never  to my knowledge  met him .       ring around the sun     jimmy turner was humming merrily  if a bit raucously  when he entered the reception room .      is old sourpuss in .     he asked  accompanying the question with a wink at which the pretty secretary blushed gratefully .      he is  and waiting for you .     she motioned him towards the door on which was written in fat  black letters     frank mccutcheon  general manager  united space mail .      jim entered .     hello  skipper  what now .         oh  it   s you  is it .     mccutcheon looked up from his desk  champing a foul smelling stogie .     sit down .      mccutcheon stared at him from under bushy gray eyebrows .     old sourpuss     as he was euphoniously known to all members of united space mail  had never been known to laugh within the memory of the oldest inmate  though rumor did have it that when a child he had smiled at the sight of his father falling out of an apple tree .  right now his expression made the rumor appear exaggerated .      now  listen .  turner     he barked     united space mail is inaugurating a new service and you   re elected to blaze the trail .     disregarding jimmy   s grimace  he continued     from now on the venerian mail is on an all year round basis .         what .  i   ve always thought that it was ruinous from a financial standpoint to deliver the venerian .  mail except when it was this side of the sun .         sure     admitted mccutcheon     if we follow the ordinary routes .  but we might cut straight across the system if we could only get near enough to the sun .  that   s where you come in .  they   ve put out a new ship equipped to approach within twenty million miles of the sun and which will be able to remain at that distance indefinitely .      jimmy interrupted nervously     wait a while  s mr .  mccutcheon  i don   t quite follow .  what kind of a ship is this .         how do you expect me to know .  i   m no fugitive from a laboratory .  from what they tell me  it emits some kind of a field that bends the radiations of the sun around the ship .  get it .  it   s all deflected .  no heat reaches you .  you can stay there forever and be cooler than in new york .         oh  is that so .     jimmy was skeptical .     has it been tested  or is that a little detail that has been left for me .         it   s been tested  of course  but not under actual solar conditions .         then it   s out .  i   ve done plenty for united  but this is the limit .  i   m not crazy  yet .      mccutcheon stiffened .     must i recall the oath you took upon entering the service .  turner .     our flight through space                 must ne   er be stopped by anything save death        finished jimmy .     i know that as well as you do and i also notice that it   s very easy to quote that from a comfortable armchair .  if you   re that idealistic  you can do it yourself .  it   s still out  as far as i   m concerned .  and if you want  you can kick me out .  i can get other jobs just like that     he snapped his fingers airily .   mccutcheon   s voice dropped to a silky whisper .     now  now .  turner  don   t be hasty .  you haven   t heard all i have to say yet .  roy snead is to be your mate .         huh .  snead .  why  that four flusher wouldn   t have the guts to take a job like this in a million years .  tell me some other fairy tale .         well  as a matter of fact  he has already accepted .  i thought you might accompany him  but i guess he was right .  he insisted you   d back down .  i thought at first you wouldn   t .      mccutcheon waved him away and bent his eyes unconcernedly on the report he had been scrutinizing at the time of jimmy   s entrance .  jimmy wheeled  hesitated  then returned .      wait a while  mr .  mccutcheon  do you mean to say that roy is actually going .     mccutcheon nodded  still apparently absorbed in other matters  and jimmy exploded     why  that low down  spindle shanked  dish faced mug .  so he thinks i   m too yellow to go .  well  i   ll show him .  i   ll take the job and i   ll put up ten dollars to a venerian nickel that he gets sick at the last minute .         good .     mccutcheon rose and shook hands     i thought you   d see reason .  major wade has all the details .  i think you leave in about six weeks and as i   m leaving for venus tomorrow  you   ll probably meet me there .      jimmy left  still boiling  and mccutcheon buzzed for the secretary .     oh  miss wilson  get roy snead on the    visor .      a few minutes    pause and then the red signal light shone .  the    visor was clicked on and the dark haired  dapper snead appeared on the visi plate .      hello  snead     mccutcheon growled .     you lose that bet  turner accepted that job .  i thought he   d laugh himself sick when i told him you said he wouldn   t go .  send over the twenty dollars  please .         wait a while  mr .  mccutcheon     snead   s face was dark with fury     what   s the idea of telling that punch drunk imbecile i   m not going .  you must have  you double crosser .  i   ll be there all right  but you can put up another twenty and i   ll bet he changes his mind yet .  but        be there .     roy snead was still spluttering when mccutcheon clicked off .   the general manager leaned back  threw away his mangled cigar  and lit a fresh one .  his face remained sour  but there was a definite note of satisfaction in his tone when he said     ha .  i thought that would get them .        it was a tired and sweaty pair that blasted the good ship helios across mercury   s orbit .  in spite of the perfunctory friendship enforced upon them by the weeks alone in space  jimmy turner and roy snead were scarcely on speaking terms .  add to this hidden hostility  the heat of the bloated sun and the torturing uncertainty of the final outcome of the trip and you have a miserable pair indeed .   jimmy peered tiredly at the maze of dials confronting him  and  brushing a damp lock of hair from his eyes  grunted     what   s the thermometer reading now  roy .         one hundred twenty five degrees fahrenheit and still climbing     was the growled response .   jimmy cursed fluently     the cooling system is on at maximum  the ship   s hull reflects     of the solar radiation  and it   s still in the hundred twenties .     he paused .     the gravometer indicates that we   re still some thirty five million miles from the sun .  fifteen millions miles to go before the deflection field becomes effective .  the temperature will probably scale     yet .  that   s a sweet prospect .  check the desiccators .  if the air isn   t kept absolutely dry  we   re not going to last long .         within mercury   s orbit  think of it .     snead   s voice was husky .     no one has ever been this close to the sun before .  and we   re going closer yet .         there have been many this close and closer     reminded jimmy     but they were out of control and landed in the sun .  friedlander  debuc  anton     his voice trailed into a brooding silence   roy stirred uneasily .     how effective is this deflection field anyway  jimmy .  your cheerful thoughts aren   t very soothing  you know .         well  it   s been tested under the harshest conditions laboratory technicians could devise .  i   ve watched them .  it   s been bathed in radiation approximating the sun   s at a distance of twenty million .  the field worked like a charm .  the light was bent about it so that the ship became invisible .  the men inside the ship claimed that everything outside became invisible and that no heat reached them .  a funny thing  though  the field will work only under certain radiation strengths .         well  i wish it were over one way or the other     roy glowered .     if old sourpuss is thinking of making this my regular run   well  he   ll lose his ace pilot .         he   ll lose his two ace pilots     jimmy corrected .   the two lapsed into silence and the helios blasted on .   the temperature climbed                .  then  three days later  with the mercury quivering at      roy announced that they were approaching the critical belt  the belt where the solar radiation reached sufficient intensity to energize the field .   the two waited  minds at feverish concentration  pulses pounding .      will it happen suddenly .         i don   t know .  we   ll have to wait .      from the portholes  only the stars were visible .  the sun  three times the size as seen from earth  poured its blinding rays upon opaque metal  for on this specially designed ship  portholes closed automatically when struck by powerful radiation .   and then the stars began disappearing .  slowly  at first  the dimmest faded then the brighter ones  polaris  regulus  arcturus  sirius .  space was uniformly black .      it   s working     breathed jimmy .  the words were scarcely out of his mouth  when the sunward portholes clicked open .  the sun was gone .      ha .  i feel cooler already     jimmy turner was jubilant .     boy  it worked like a charm .  you know  if they could adjust this deflection field to all radiation strengths  we would have perfected invisibility .  it would make a convenient war weapon .     he lit a cigarette and leaned back luxuriously .      but meanwhile we   re flying blind     roy insisted .   jimmy grinned patronizingly     you needn   t worry about that  dishface .  i   ve taken care of everything .  we   re in an orbit about the sun .  in two weeks  we   ll be on the opposite side and then i   ll let the rockets blast and out of this band we go  zooming towards venus .     he was very self satisfied indeed .      just leave it to jimmy    brains    turner .  i   ll have us through in two months  instead of the regulation six .  you   re with united   s ace pilot  now .      roy laughed nastily .     to listen to you  you   d think you did all the work .  all you   re doing is to run the ship on the course i   ve plotted .  you   re the mechanic  i   m the brains .         oh  is that so .  any damn pilot school rookie can plot a course .  it takes a man to navigate one .         well  that   s your opinion .  who   s paid more  though  the navigator or the course plotter .        jimmy gulped on that one and roy stalked triumphantly out of the pilot room .  unmindful of all this  the helios blasted on .   for two days  all was serene  then  on the third day .  jimmy inspected the thermometer  scratched his head and looked worried .  roy entered  watched the proceedings and raised his eyebrows in surprise .      is anything wrong .     he bent over and read the height of the thin  red column .     just     degrees .  that   s nothing to look like a sick goat over .  from your expression  i thought something had gone wrong with the deflection field and that it was rising again     he turned away with an ostentatious yawn .      oh  shut up  you senseless ape     jimmy   s foot lifted in a half hearted attempt at a kick .     i   d feel a lot better if the temperature were rising .  this deflection field is working a lot too good for my liking .         huh .  what do you mean .         i   ll explain  and if you listen carefully you may understand me .  this ship is built like a vacuum bottle .  it gains heat only with the greatest of difficulty and loses it likewise .     he paused and let his words sink in .     at ordinary temperatures this ship is not supposed to lose more than two degrees a day if no outside sources of heat are supplied .  perhaps at the temperature at which we were  the loss might amount to five degrees a day .  do you get me .      roy   s mouth was open wide and jimmy continued .     now this blasted ship has lost fifty degrees in less than three days .         but that   s impossible .         there it is .     jimmy pointed ironically .     i   ll tell you what   s wrong .  it   s that damn field .  it acts as a repulsive agent towards electromagnetic radiations and somehow is hastening the loss of heat of our ship .      roy sank into thought and did some rapid mental calculations .     if what you say is true     he said at length     we   ll hit freezing point in five days and then spend a week in what amounts to winter weather .         that   s right .  even allowing for the decrease in heat loss as the temperature is lowered  we   ll probably end up with the mercury anywhere between thirty and forty below .      roy gulped unhappily .     and at twenty million miles away from the sun .         that isn   t the worst     jimmy pointed out .     this ship  like all others used for travel within the orbit of mars  has no heating system .  with the sun shining like fury and no way to lose heat except by ineffectual radiation  mars and venus space ships have always specialized in cooling systems .  we  for instance  have a very efficient refrigeration device .         we   re in a devil of a fix  then .  the same applies to our space suits .      in spite of the still roasting temperature  the two were beginning to experience a few anticipatory chills .      say  i   m not going to stand this     roy burst out .     i vote we get out of here right now and head for earth .  they can   t expect more of us .         go ahead .  you   re the pilot .  can you plot a course at this distance from the sun and guarantee that we won   t fall into the sun .         hell .  i hadn   t thought of that .      the two were at their wits    end .  communication via radio had been impossible ever since they had passed mercury   s orbit .  the sun was at sunspot maximum and static had drowned out all attempts .   so they settled down to wait .   the next few days were taken up entirely with thermometer watching  with a few minutes taken out here and there when one of the two happened to think of an unused malediction to hurl at the head of mr .  frank mccutcheon .  eating and sleeping were indulged in  but not enjoyed .   and meanwhile  the helios  entirely unconcerned in the plight of its occupants  blasted on .   as roy had predicted  the temperature passed the red line marked    freezing    towards the end of their seventh day in the deflection belt .  the two were remarkably unhappy when this happened even though they had expected it .   jimmy had drawn off about a hundred gallons of water from the tank .  with this he had filled almost every vessel on board .      it might     he pointed out     save the pipes from bursting when the water freezes .  and if they do  as is probable  it is just as well that we supply ourselves with plenty of available water .  we have to stay here another week  you know .      and on the next day  the eighth  the water froze .  there were the buckets  overflowing with ice  standing chill and bluecold .  the two gazed at them forlornly .  jimmy broke one open .      frozen solid     he said bleakly and wrapped another sheet about himself .   it was hard to think of anything but the increasing cold now .  roy and jimmy had requisitioned every sheet and blanket on the ship  after having put on three or four shirts and a like number of pairs of pants .   they kept in bed for as long as they were able  and when forced to move out  they huddled near the small oil burner for warmth .  even this doubtful pleasure was soon denied them  for  as jimmy remarked     the oil supply is extremely limited and we will need the burner to thaw out the water and food .      tempers were short and clashes frequent  but the common misery kept them from actually jumping on each other   s throats .  it was on the tenth day  however  that the two  united by a common hatred  suddenly became friends .     the temperature was hovering down near the zero point  making up its mind to descend into the minus regions .  jimmy was huddled in a corner thinking of the times back in new york when he had complained of the august heat and wondered how he could have done so .  roy  meanwhile  had manipulated numb fingers long enough to calculate that they would have to endure the coldness for exactly      minutes more .   he regarded the figures with distaste and read them off to jimmy .  the latter scowled and grunted     the way i feel  i   m not going to last    minutes  let alone      .     then  impatiently     i wish you could manage to think of some way of getting us out of this .         if we weren   t so near the sun     suggested roy     we might start the rear blasts and hurry us up .         yes  and if we landed in the sun  we   d be nice and warm .  you   re a big help .         well  you   re the one that calls himself    brains    turner .  you think of something .  the way you talk  you   d think all this was my fault .         it certainly is  you donkey in human clothing .  my better judgment told me all along not to go on this fool trip .  when mccutcheon proposed it  i refused pointblank .  i know better .     jimmy was very bitter .     so what happened .  like the fool you are  you accept and rush in where sensible men fear to tread .  and then  of course .  i naturally had to tag along .      why  do you know what i should have done     jimmy   s voice ascended the scale     i should have let you go alone and freeze and then sat down by a roaring fire all by myself and gloated .  that is  if i had known what was going to happen .      a hurt and surprised look appeared on roy   s face .     is that so .  so that   s how it is .  well  all i can say is that you certainly have a genius for twisting facts  if for nothing else .  the fact of the matter is that you were unutterably stupid enough to accept and i the poor fellow raked in by the force of circumstances .      jimmy   s expression was one of the utmost disdain .     evidently the cold has driven you batty  though i admit it wouldn   t take much to knock the little sense you possess out of you .         listen     roy answered hotly .     on october   th  mccutcheon called me up on the    visor and told me you had accepted and laughed at me for a yellow belly for refusing to go .  do you deny that .         yes  i do  and unconditionally .  on october     sourpass told me that you had decided to go and had bet him that      jimmy   s voice faded away very suddenly and a shocked look spread over his face .     say   are you sure mccutcheon told you i had agreed to go .      a chill  clammy feeling clutched at roy   s heart when he caught jimmy   s drift  a feeling that drowned out the numbness of the cold .      absolutely     he answered .     i   ll swear to that .  that   s why i went .         but he told me you had accepted and that   s why   went .     jimmy felt very stupid all at once .   the two fell into a protracted and ominous silence which was broken at length by roy  who spoke in a voice that quivered with emotion .      jimmy  we   ve been the victims of a contemptible  dirty  lowdown  doublecrossing trick .     his eyes dilated with fury .     we   ve been cheated  robbed      words failed him but he kept on uttering meaningless sounds  indicative mainly of devouring rage .   jimmy was cooler  but none the less vindictive     you   re right  roy  mccutcheon has done us dirty .  he has plumbed the depths of human iniquity .  but we   ll get even .  when we get through in      odd minutes  we will have a score to settle with mr .  mccutcheon .         what are we going to do .     roy   s eyes were filled with a bloodthirsty joy .      on the spur of the moment  i suggest that we simply tear into him and rend him into tiny  little pieces .         not gruesome enough .  how about boiling him in oil .         that   s reasonable  yes  but it might take too long .  let   s give him a good old fashioned beating with brass knuckles .      roy rubbed his hands .     we   ll have lots of time to think up some really adequate measures .  the dirty .  god forsaken  yellow livered  leprous     the rest verged fluently into the unprintable .   and for four more days  the temperature dove .  it was on the fourteenth and last day that the mercury froze  the solid red shaft pointed its congealed finger at forty below .   on this terrible last day  they had lit the oil burner  using their entire scanty supply of oil .  shivering and more than half frozen  they crouched close  attempting to extract every last drop of heat .   jimmy had found a pair of ear muffs several days before in some obscure corner  and it now changed hands at the end of every hour .  both sat buried under a small mountain of blankets  chafing chilled hands and feet .  with every passing minute  their conversation  concerning mccutcheon almost exclusively  grew more vitriolic .      always quoting that triply damned slogan of the space mail     our flight through sp         jimmy choked with impotent fury .      yes  and always rubbing holes in chairs instead of coming out here and doing something like a man   s work  the rotten so and so     agreed roy .      well  we   re due to pass out of the deflection zone in two hours .  then three weeks and we   ll be on venus     said jimmy  sneezing .      that can   t be too soon for me     answered sneed  who had been sniffling for the last two days .     i   m never taking another space trip except maybe the one that takes me back to earth .  after this  i make my living growing bananas in central america .  a fellow can be decently warm out there at least .         we might not get off venus  after what we   re going to do to mccutcheon .         no  you   re right there .  but that   s all right .  venus is even warmer than central america and that   s all i care about .         we have no legal worries either     jimmy sneezed again .     on venus  life imprisonment   s the limit for first degree murder .  a nice  warm dry cell for the rest of my life .  what could be sweeter .      the second hand on the chronometer whirled at its even pace  the minutes ticked off .  roy   s hands hovered lovingly over the lever that would set off the right rear blasts which would drive the helios out away from the sun and from that terrible deflection zone .   and at last     go .     shouted jimmy eagerly .     let her blast .      with a deep reverberating roar  the rockets fired .  the helios trembled from stem to stern .  the pilots felt the acceleration press them back into their seats and were happy .  in a matter of minutes  the sun would shine again and they would be warm  feel the blessed heat once more .   it happened before they were aware of it .  there was a momentary flash of light and then a grinding and a click  as the sunward portholes closed .      look     cried roy     the stars .  we   re out of it .     he cast an ecstatically happy glance at the thermometer .     well  old boy  from now on we go up again .     he pulled the blankets about him closer  for the cold still lingered .     there were two men in frank mccutcheon   s office at the venus branch of the united space mail  mccutcheon himself and the elderly  white haired zebulon smith  inventor of the deflection field .  smith was talking .      but mr .  mccutcheon  it is really of great importance that i learn exactly how my deflection field worked .  surely they have transmitted all possible information to you .      mccutcheon   s face was a study in dourness as he bit the edge off one of his two for five cigars and lit it .      that  my dear mr .  smith     he said     is exactly what they did not do .  ever since they have receded far enough from the sun to render communication possible  i have been sending requests for information regarding the practicability of the field .  they just refuse to answer .  they say it worked and that they   re alive and that they   ll give the details when they reach venus .  that   s all .      zebulon smith sighed in disappointment .     isn   t that a bit unusual  insubordination  so to speak .  i thought they were required to be complete in their reports and to give any requested details .         so they are .  but these are my ace pilots and rather temperamental .  we have to extend some leeway .  besides  i tricked them into going on this trip  a very hazardous one  as you know  and so am inclined to be lenient .         well  then  i suppose i must wait .         oh  it won   t be for long     mccutcheon assured him .     they   re due today  and i assure you that as soon as i get in touch with them  i shall send you the full details .  after all  they survived for two weeks at a distance of twenty million miles from the sun  so your invention is a success .  that should satisfy you .      smith had scarcely left when mccutcheon   s secretary entered with a puzzled frown on her face .      something is wrong with the two pilots of the helios  mr .  mccutcheon     she informed him .     i have just received a bulletin from major wade at pallas city  where they landed .  they have refused to attend the celebration prepared for them  but instead immediately chartered a rocket to come here  refusing to state the reason .  when major wade tried to stop them  they became violent  he says .     she laid the communication down on his desk .   mccutcheon glanced at it perfunctorily .     hmm .  they do seem confoundedly temperamental .  well  send them to me when they come .  i   ll snap them out of it .      it was perhaps three hours later that the problem of the two misbehaving pilots again forced itself upon his mind  this time by a sudden commotion that had arisen in the reception room .  he heard the deep angry tones of two men and then the shrill remonstrances of his secretary .  suddenly the door burst open and jim turner and roy snead strode in .   roy coolly closed the door and planted his back against it .      don   t let anyone disturb me until i   m through     jimmy told him .      no one   s getting through this door for a while     roy answered grimly     but remember  you promised to leave some for me .      mccutcheon said nothing during all this  but when he saw turner casually draw a pair of brass knuckles from his pocket and put them on with a determined air  he decided that it was time to call a halt to the comedy .      hello  boys     he said  with a heartiness unusual in him .     glad to see you again .  take a seat .      jimmy ignored the offer .     have you anything to say  any last request  before i start operations .     he gritted his teeth with an unpleasant scraping noise .      well  if you put it that way     said mccutcheon     i might ask exactly what this is all about if i   m not being too unreasonable .  perhaps the deflector was inefficient and you had a hot trip .      the only answer to that was a loud snort from roy and a cold stare on the part of jimmy .      first     said the latter     what was the idea of that filthy  disgusting cheat you pulled on us .      mccutcheon   s eyebrows raised in surprise .     do you mean the little white lies i told you in order to get you to go .  why  that was nothing .  common business practice  that   s all .  why  i pull worse things than that every day and people consider it just routine .  besides  what harm did it do you .         tell him about our    pleasant trip     jimmy     urged roy .      that   s exactly what i   m going to do     was the response .  he turned to mccutcheon and assumed a martyr like air .     first  on this blasted trip  we fried in a temperature that reached     but that was to be expected and we   re not complaining  we were half mercury   s distance from the sun .      but after that  we entered this zone where the light bends around us  incoming radiation sank to zero and we started losing heat and not just a degree a day the way we learned it in pilot school .     he paused to breathe a few novel curses he had just thought of  then continued .         in three days  we were down to a hundred and in a week down to freezing .  then for one entire week  seven long days  we drove through our course at sub freezing temperature .  it was so cold the last day that the mercury froze .     turner   s voice rose till it cracked  and at the door  a fit of self pity caused roy to catch his breath with an audible gulp .  mccutcheon remained inscrutable .     jimmy continued .     there we were without a heating system  in fact  no heat of any kind  not even any warm clothing .  we froze  damn it  we had to thaw out our food and melt our water .  we were stiff  couldn   t move .  it was hell  i tell you  in reverse temperature .     he paused  at a loss for words .   roy snead took up the burden .     we were twenty million miles away from the sun and i had a case of frost bitten ears .  frost bitten  i say .     he shook his fist viciously under mccutcheon   s nose .     and it was your fault .  you tricked us into it .  while we were freezing  we promised ourselves that we   d come back and get you and we   re going to keep that promise .     he turned to jimmy .     go ahead  start it  will you .  we   ve wasted enough time .         hold it  hoys     mccutcheon spoke at last .     let me get this straight .  you mean to say that the deflection field worked so well that it kept all the radiation away and sucked out what heat there was in the ship in the first place .     jimmy grunted a curt assent .      and you froze for a week because of that .     mccutcheon continued .   again the grunt .   and then a very strange and unusual thing happened .  mccutcheon     old  sourpuss     the man without the    risus    muscle  smiled .  he actually bared his teeth in a grin .  and what   s more  the grin grew wider and wider until finally a rusty  long unused chuckle was heard louder and louder  until it developed into a full fledged laugh  and the laugh into a bellow .  in one stentorian burst  mccutcheon made up for a lifetime of sour gloom .   the walls reverberated  the windowpanes rattled  and still the homeric laughter continued .  roy and jimmy stood openmouthed  entirely non plussed .  a puzzled bookkeeper thrust his head inside the door in a fit of temerity and remained frozen in his tracks .  others crowded about the door  conversing in awed whispers .  mccutcheon had laughed .   gradually  the risibilities of the old general manager subsided .  he ended in a fit of choking and finally turned a purple face towards his ace pilots  whose surprise had long since given way to indignation .      boys     he told them     that was the best joke i ever heard .  you can consider your pay doubled  both of you .     he was still grinning away like clockwork and had developed a beautiful case of hiccoughs .   the two pilots were left cold at the handsome proposal .     what   s so killingly funny .     jimmy wanted to know     i don   t see anything to laugh at  myself .      mcclutcheon   s voice dripped honey     now  fellows  before i left i gave each of you several mimeographed sheets containing special instructions .  what happened to them .      there was sudden embarrassment in the air .      i don   t know .  i must have mislaid mine     gulped roy .      i never looked at mine  i forgot about it .     jimmy was genuinely dismayed .      you see     exclaimed mccutcheon triumphantly     it was all the fault of your own stupidity .         how do you figure that out .     jimmy wanted to know .     major wade told us all we had to know about the ship  and besides  i guess there   s nothing you could tell us about running one .         oh  isn   t there .  wade evidently forgot to inform you of one minor point which you would have found on my instructions .  the strength of the deflection field was adjustable .  it happened to be set at maximum strength when you started  that   s all .     he was now beginning to chuckle faintly once more .     now  if you had taken the trouble to read the sheets  you would have known that a simple movement of a small lever     he made the appropriate gesture with his thumb     would have weakened the field any desired amount and allowed as much radiation to leak through as was wanted .      and now the chuckle was becoming louder .     and you froze for a week because you didn   t have the brains to pull a lever .  and then you ace pilots come here and blame me .  what a laugh .     and off he went again while a pair of very sheepish young men glanced askance at each other .   when mccutcheon came around to normal  jimmy and roy were gone .   down in an alley adjoining the building  a little ten year old boy watched  with open mouth and intense absorption  two young men who were engaged in the strange and rather startling occupation of kicking each other alternately .  they were vicious kicks  too .     the end    when i wrote    ring around the sun    i was much taken by the two protagonists .  turner and snead .  it was in my mind  i recall  to write other stories about the pair .  this was a natural thought  for in the late     s there were a number of    series    of stories about a given character or characters .  campbell himself had written some delightful stories featuring two men named penton and blake  and i longed to do a penton blake imitation .     there was a practical value to writing a    series .     for one thing  you had a definite background that was carried on from story to story  so that half your work was done for you .  secondly  if the    series    became popular  it would be difficult to reject new stories that fit into it .   i didn   t make it with turner and snead .  in fact  i never tried .  the time was to come  two years later  when i was to have a pair of very similar characters  powell and donovan  who were to be in four stories and who were to be part of a very successful    series    indeed .     by the end of august       then  i had written five stories  of which three were eventually published .  not bad .   however  there followed a dry spell .  i was finishing my third year of college and was trying  without success  to get admission into medical school .  the situation in europe was disturbing .  it was the time of the surrender at munich  and for a jewish teen ager there was something unsettling about the rapid  sure fire victories of hitler .   the next three stories took not one month  as had the previous three  but three months .  and all were clearly well below the limits of salability even in the most permissive market .  they were    the weapon        paths of destiny     and    knossos in its glory .     campbell rejected each one in very short order  and all made the rounds without luck .  there came a time  nearly three years later  when astonishing seemed interested in    the weapon     but that fell through and the other two didn   t even come that close .   all three stories are now gone forever .  i remember nothing at all about two of them  but    knossos in its glory    was an ambitious attempt to retell the theseus myth in science fiction terms .  the minotaur was an extraterrestrial who landed in ancient crete with only the kindliest of intentions  and i remember writing terribly stilted prose in an attempt to make my cretans sound as i imagined characters in homer ought to sound .  campbell  always kind  said in rejecting it that my work    was definitely improving  especially where i was not straining for effect .      by the time i was writing    knossos in its glory    i had just received my check for    marooned off vesta    and i was a professional .  my spirits rose accordingly  and toward the end of november i wrote    ammonium     which was another attempt  like    ring around the sun     at humor .   i had a pretty good notion that campbell wouldn   t like it  however  and i never showed it to him .  i sent it to thrilling wonder stories instead .  when they rejected it  i lost heart and retired it .  it was only after future fiction had taken    ring around the sun    that i thought i would chance this other one  too .   on august           i sent it in to future fiction  which took it  altering its name to    the magnificent possession .          the magnificent possession     walter sills reflected now  as he had reflected often before  that life was hard and joyless .  he surveyed his dingy chemical laboratory and grinned cynically working in a dirty hole of a place  living on occasional ore analyses that barely paid for absolutely indispensable equipment  while others  not half his worth perhaps  were working for big industrial concerns and taking life easy .   he looked out the window at the hudson river  ruddied in the flame of the dying sun  and wondered moodily whether these last experiments would finally bring him the fame and success he was after  or if they were merely some more false alarms .   the unlocked door creaked open a crack and the cheerful face of eugene taylor burst into view .  sills waved and taylor   s body followed his head and entered the laboratory .      hello  old soak     came the loud and carefree hail .     how go things .      sills shook his head at the other   s exuberance .     i wish i had your foolish outlook on life .  gene .  for your information  things are bad .  i need money  and the more i need it  the less i have .         well  i haven   t any money either  have i .     demanded taylor .     but why worry about it .  you   re fifty  and worry hasn   t got you anything except a bald head .  i   m thirty  and i want to keep my beautiful brown hair .      the chemist grinned .     i   ll get my money yet .  gene .  just leave it to me .         your new ideas shaping out well .         are they .  i haven   t told you much about it  have i .  well  come here and i   ll show you what progress i   ve made .      taylor followed sills to a small table  on which stood a rack of test tubes  in one of which was about half an inch of a shiny metallic substance .      sodium mercury mixture  or sodium amalgam  as it is called     explained sills pointing to it .   he took a bottle labeled    ammonium chloride sol .     from the shelf and poured a little into the tube .  immediately the sodium amalgam began changing into a loosely packed  spongy substance .      that     observed sills     is ammonium amalgam .  the ammonium radical  nh   acts as a metal here and combines with mercury .     he waited for the action to go to completion and then poured off the supernatant liquid .      ammonium amalgam isn   t very stable     he informed taylor     so i   ll have to work fast .     he grasped a flask of straw colored  pleasant smelling liquid and filled the test tube with it .  upon shaking  the loosely packed ammonium amalgam vanished and in its stead a small drop of metallic liquid rolled about the bottom .   taylor gazed at the test tube  open mouthed .     what happened .         this liquid is a complex derivative of hydrazine which i   ve discovered and named ammonaline .  i haven   t worked out its formula yet  but that doesn   t matter .  the point about it is that it has the property of dissolving the ammonium out of the amalgam .  those few drops at the bottom are pure mercury  the ammonium is in solution .      taylor remained unresponsive and sills waxed enthusiastic .     don   t you see the implications .  i   ve gone half way towards isolating pure ammonium  a thing which has never been done before .  once accomplished it means fame  success  the nobel prize  and who knows what else .         wow .     taylor   s gaze became more respectful .     that yellow stuff doesn   t look so important to me .     he snatched for it  but sills withheld it .      i haven   t finished  by any means  gene .  i   ve got to get it in its free metallic state  and i can   t do that so far .  every time i try to evaporate the ammonaline  the ammonium breaks down to everlasting ammonia and hydrogen .   .   .   .  but i   ll get it i   ll get it .        two weeks later  the epilogue to the previous scene was enacted .  taylor received a hurried and emphatic call from his chemist friend and appeared at the laboratory in a flurry of anticipation .      you   ve got it .         i   ve got it and it   s bigger than i thought .  there   s millions in it  really     sills    eyes shone with rapture .      i   ve been working from the wrong angle up to now     he explained .     heating the solvent always broke down the dissolved ammonium  so i separated it out by freezing .  it works the same way as brine  which  when frozen slowly  freezes into fresh ice  the salt crystallizing out .  luckily  the ammonaline freezes at    degrees centigrade and doesn   t require much cooling .      he pointed dramatically to a small beaker  inside a glasswalled case .  the beaker contained pale  straw colored  needlelike crystals and  covering the top of this  a thin layer of a dullish  yellow substance .      why the case .     asked taylor .      i   ve got it filled with argon to keep the ammonium  which is the yellow substance on top of the ammonaline  pure .  it is so active that it will react with anything else but a helium type gas .      taylor marveled and pounded his complacently smiling friend on the back .      wait  gene  the best is yet to come .      taylor was led to the other end of the room and sills    trembling finger pointed out another airtight case containing a lump of metal of a gleaming  yellow that sparkled and glistened .      that  my friend  is ammonium oxide  nh         formed by passing absolutely dry air over free ammonium metal .  it is perfectly inert  the sealed case contains quite a bit of chlorine  for instance  and yet there is no reaction  .  it can be made as cheaply as aluminum  if not more so  and yet it looks more like gold than gold does itself .  do you see the possibilities .         do i .     exploded taylor .     it will sweep the country .  you can have ammonium jewelry  and ammonium plated tableware  and a million other things .  then again  who knows how many countless industrial applications it may have .  you   re rich  walt you   re rich .         we   re rich     corrected sills gently .  he moved towards the telephone     the newspapers are going to hear of this .  i   m going to begin to cash in on fame right now .      taylor frowned     maybe you   d better keep it a secret  walt .         oh  i   m not breathing a hint as to the process .  i   ll just give them the general idea .  besides  we   re safe  the patent application is in washington right now .      but sills was wrong .  the article in the paper ushered in a very  very hectic two days for the two of them .     j .  throgmorton bankhead is what is commonly known as a    captain of industry .     as head of the acme chromium and silver plating corporation he no doubt deserved the title  but to his patient and long suffering wife  he was merely a dyspeptic and grouchy husband  especially at the breakfast table  .   .  .  and he was at the breakfast table now .   rustling his morning paper angrily  he sputtered between bites of buttered toast     this man is ruining the country .     he pointed aghast at big  black headlines .     i said before and i   ll say again that the man is as crazy as a bedbug .  he won   t be satisfied  .   .   .         joseph  please     pleaded his wife     you   re getting purple in the face .  remember your high blood pressure .  you know the doctor told you to stop reading the news from washington if it annoys you so .  now  listen dear  about the cook .  she   s  .   .   .         the doctor   s a damn fool  and so are you     shouted j .  throgmorton bankhead .     i   ll read all the news i please and get purple in the face too  if i want to .      he raised the cup of coffee to his mouth and took a critical sip .  while he did so  his eyes fell upon a more insignificant headline towards the bottom of the page     savant discovers gold substitute .     the coffee cup remained in the air while he scanned the article quickly .     this new metal     it ran in part     is claimed by its discoverer to be far superior to chromium  nickel  or silver for cheap and beautiful jewelry .  the twenty dollar a week clerk     said professor sills     will eat off ammonium plate more impressive in appearance than the gold plate of the indian nabob .     there is no  .  .  .      but j .  throgmorton bankhead had stopped reading .  visions of a ruined acme chromium and silver plating corporation danced before his eyes  and as they danced  the cup of coffee dropped from his hand  and splashed hot liquid over his trousers .   his wife rose to her feet in alarm     what is it  joseph  what is it .         nothing     bankhead shouted .     nothing .  for god   s sake  go away  will you .      he strode angrily out of the room  leaving his wife to search the paper for anything that could have disturbed him .        bob   s tavern    on fifteenth street is usually pretty well filled at all times  but on the morning we are speaking of  it was empty except for four or five rather poorly dressed men who clustered about the portly and dignified form of peter q .  hornswoggle  eminent ex congressman .   peter q .  hornswoggle was  as usual  speaking fluently .  his subject  again as usual  concerned the life of a congressman .      i remember a case in point     he was saying     when that same argument was brought up in the house  and which i answered as follows  the eminent gentleman from nevada in his statements overlooks one very important aspect of the problem .  he does not realize that it is to the interest of the entire nation that the apple parers of this country be attended to promptly  for  gentlemen  on the welfare of the apple parers depends the future of the entire fruit industry and on the fruit industry is based the entire economy of this great and glorious nation  the united states of america .          hornswoggle paused  swallowed half a pint of beer at once  and then smiled in triumph     i have no hesitation in saying  gentlemen  that at that statement  the entire house burst into wild and tumultuous applause .      one of the assembled listeners shook his head slowly and marvelled .     it must be great to be able to spiel like that  senator .  you musta been a sensation .         yeah     agreed the bartender     it   s a dirty shame you were beat last election .      the ex congressman winced and in a very dignified tone began     i have been reliably informed that the use of bribery in that campaign reached unprecedented prop  .   .   .     his voice died away suddenly as he caught sight of a certain article in the newspaper of one of his listeners .  he snatched at it and read it through in silence and thereupon his eyes gleamed with a sudden idea .      my friends     he said turning to them again     i find i must leave you .  there is pressing work that must be done immediately at city hall .     he leant over to whisper to the barkeeper     you haven   t got twenty five cents  have you .  i find i left my wallet in the mayor   s office by mistake .  i will surely repay you tomorrow .      clutching the quarter  reluctantly given  peter q .  hornswoggle left .     in a small and dimly lit room somewhere in the lower reaches of first avenue  michael maguire  known to the police by the far more euphonious name of mike the slug  cleaned his trusty revolver and hummed a tuneless song .  the door opened a crack and mike looked up .      that you  slappy .         yeh     a short  wizened person sidled in     i brung ye de evenin    sheet .  de cops are still tinkin    bragoni pulled de job .         yeh .  that   s good .     he bent unconcernedly over the revolver .     anything else doing .         naw .  some dippy dame killed herself  but dat   s all .      he tossed the newspaper to mike and left .  mike leaned back and flipped the pages in a bored manner .   a headline attracted his eye and he read the short article that followed .  having finished  he threw aside the paper  lit a cigarette  and did some heavy thinking .  then he opened the door .      hey  slappy  c   mere .  there   s a job that   s got to be done .        walter sills was happy  deliriously so .  he walked about his laboratory king of all he surveyed  strutting like a peacock  basking in his new found glory .  eugene taylor sat and watched him  scarcely less happy himself .      how does it feel to be famous .     taylor wanted to know .      like a million dollars  and that   s what i   m going to sell the secret of ammonium metal for .  it   s the fat of the land for me from now on .         you leave the practical details to me  walt .  i   m getting in touch with staples of eagle steel today .  you   ll get a decent price from him .      the bell rang  and sills jumped .  he ran to open the door .      is this the home of walter sills .     the large  scowling visitor gazed about him superciliously .      yes  i   m sills .  do you wish to see me .         yes .  my name is j .  throgmorton bankhead and i represent the acme chromium and silver plating corporation .  i would like to have a moment   s discussion with you .         come right in .  come right in .  this is eugene taylor  my associate .  you may speak freely before him .         very well .     bankhead seated himself heavily .     i suppose you surmise the reason for my visit .         i take it that you have read of the new ammonium metal in the papers .         that   s right .  i have come to see whether there is any truth in the story and to buy your process if there is .         you can see for yourself  sir     sills led the magnate to where the argon filled container of the few grams of pure ammonium were .     that is the metal .  over here to the right  i   ve got the oxide  an oxide which is more metallic than the metal itself  strangely enough .  it is the oxide that is what the papers call    substitute gold .          bankhead   s face showed not an atom of the sinking feeling within him as he viewed the oxide with dismay .     take it out in the open     he said     and let   s see it .      sills shook his head .     i can   t  mr .  bankhead .  those are the first samples of ammonium and ammonium oxide that ever existed .  they   re museum pieces .  i can easily make more for you  if you wish .         you   ll have to  if you expect me to sink my money in it you satisfy me and i   ll be willing to buy your patent for as much as oh  say a thousand dollars .         a thousand dollars .     exclaimed sills and taylor together .      a very fair price  gentlemen .         a million would be more like it     shouted taylor in an outraged tone .     this discovery is a goldmine .           a million  indeed .  you are dreaming  gentlemen .  the fact of the matter is that my company has been on the track of ammonium for years now  and we are just at the point of solving the problem .  unfortunately you beat us by a week or so  and so i wish to buy up your patent in order to save my company a great deal of annoyance .  you realize  of course  that if you refuse my price  i could just go ahead and manufacture the metal  using my own process .         we   ll sue if you do     said taylor .      have you got the money for a long  protracted and expensive lawsuit .     bankhead smiled nastily .     i have  you know .  to prove  however  that i am not unreasonable  i will make the price two thousand .         you   ve heard our price     answered taylor stonily     and we have nothing further to say .         all right  gentlemen     bankhead walked towards the door     think it over .  you   ll see it my way  i   m sure .      he opened the door and revealed the symmetrical form of peter q .  hornswoggle bent in rapt concentration at the keyhole .  bankhead sneered audibly and the ex congressman jumped to his feet in consternation  bowing rapidly two or three times  for want of anything better to do .   the financier passed by disdainfully and hornswoggle entered  slammed the door behind him  and faced the two bewildered friends .      that man  my dear sirs  is a malefactor of great wealth  an economic royalist .  he is the type of predatory interest that is the ruination of this country .  you did quite right in refusing his offer .     he placed his hand on his ample chest and smiled at them benignantly .      who the devil are you .     rasped taylor  suddenly recovering from his initial surprise .      i .     hornswoggle was taken aback .     why er i am peter quintus hornswoggle .  surely you know me .  i was in the house of representatives last year .         never heard of you .  what do you want .         why  bless me .  i read in the papers of your wonderful discovery and have come to place my services at your feet .         what services .         well  after all  you two are not men of the world .  with your new invention  you are prey for every self seeking unscrupulous person that comes along like bankhead  for instance .  now  a practical man of affairs  such as i  one with experience of the world  would be of inestimable use to you .  i could handle your affairs  attend to details  see that         all for nothing  of course  eh .     taylor asked  sardonically .   hornswoggle coughed convulsively .     well  naturally  i thought that a small interest in your discovery might fittingly be assigned to me .      sills  who had remained silent during all this  rose to his feet suddenly .     get out of here .  did you hear me .  get out  before i call the police .         now  professor sills  pray don   t get excited     hornswoggle retreated towards the door which taylor held open for him .  he passed out  still protesting  and swore softly to himself when the door slammed in his face .   sills sank wearily into the nearest chair .     what are we to do  gene .  he offers only two thousand .  a week ago that would have been beyond anything i could have hoped for  but now         forget it .  the fellow was only bluffing .  listen  i   m going right now to call on staples .  we   ll sell to him for what we can get  it ought to be plenty  and then if there   s any trouble with bankhead well  that   s staples    worry .     he patted the other on the shoulder .     our troubles are practically over .      unfortunately  however  taylor was wrong  their troubles were only beginning .     across the street  a furtive figure  with beady eyes peering from upturned coat collar  surveyed the house carefully .  a curious policeman might have identified him as    slappy    egan if he had bothered to look  but no one did and    slappy    remained unmolested .      cripes     he muttered to himself     dis is gonna be a cinch .  de whole woiks on    the bottom floor  back window can be jimmied wid a toot   pick  no alarms  no nuttin    .     he chuckled and walked away .   nor was    slappy    alone with his ideas .  peter q .  hornswoggle  as he walked away  found strange thoughts wandering through his massive cranium thoughts which involved a certain amount of unorthodox action .   and j .  throgmorton bankhead was likewise active .  belonging to that virile class known as    go getters    and being not at all scrupulous as to how he    go got     and certainly not intending to pay a million dollars for the secret of ammonium  he found it necessary to call on a certain one of his acquaintances .   this acquaintance  while a very useful one  was a bit unsavory  and bankhead found it advisable to be very careful and cautious while visiting him .  however  the conversation that ensued ended in a pleasing manner for both of them .     walter sills snapped out of an uneasy sleep with startled suddenness .  he listened anxiously for a while and then leaned over and nudged taylor .  he was rewarded by a few incoherent snuffles .      gene  gene  wake up .  come on  get up .         eh .  what is it .  what are you bothering         shut up .  listen  do you hear it .         i don   t hear anything .  leave me alone  will you .      sills put his finger on his lips  and the other quieted .  there was a distinct shuffling noise down below  in the laboratory .   taylor   s eyes widened and sleep left them entirely .     burglars .     he whispered .   the two crept out of bed  donned bathrobe and slippers  and tiptoed to the door .  taylor had a revolver and took the lead in descending the stairs .   they had traversed perhaps half the flight  when there was a sudden  surprised shout from below  followed by a series of loud  threshing noises .  this continued for a few moments and then there was a loud crash of glassware .      my ammonium .     cried sills in a stricken voice and rushed head long down the stairs evading taylor   s clutching arms .   the chemist burst into the laboratory  followed closely by his cursing associate  and clicked the lights on .  two struggling figures bunked owlishly in the sudden illumination  and separated .   taylor   s gun covered them .     well  isn   t this nice     he said .   one of the two lurched to his feet from amid a tangle of broken beakers and flasks  and  nursing a cut on his wrist  bent his portly body in a still dignified bow .  it was peter q .  hornswoggle .      no doubt     he said  eyeing the unwavering firearm nervously     the circumstances seem suspicious  but i can explain very easily .  you see  in spite of the very rough treatment i received after having made my reasonable proposal  i still felt a great deal of kindly interest in you two .      therefore  being a man of the world  and knowing the iniquities of mankind  i just decided to keep an eye on your house tonight  for i saw you had neglected to take precautions against house breakers .  judge my surprise to see this dastardly creature     he pointed to the flat nosed  plug ugly  who still remained on the floor in a daze     creeping in at the back window .      immediately  i risked life and limb in following the criminal  attempting desperately to save your great discovery .  i really feel i deserve great credit for what i have done .  i   m sure you will feel that i am a valuable person to deal with and reconsider your answers to my earlier proposals .      taylor listened to all this with a cynical smile .     you can certainly lie fluently  can   t you p . q .  .      he would have continued at greater length and with greater forcefulness had not the other burglar suddenly raised his voice in loud protest    cripes  boss  dis fat slob here is only tryin    to get me in bad .  i   m just followin    orders  boss .  a fellow hired me to come in here and rifle the safe and i   m just oinin    a bit o    honest money .  just plain safe crackin     boss  i ain   t out to hurt no one .      den  just as i was gettin    down to de job wannin    up  so to say in crawls dis little guy wid a chisel and blowtorch and makes for de safe .  well  naturally  i don   t like no competition  so i lays for him and then      but hornswoggle had drawn himself up in icy hauteur .     it remains to be seen whether the word of a gangster is to be taken before the word of one  who  i may truthfully say  was  in his time  one of the most eminent members of the great         quiet  both of you     shouted taylor  waving the gun threateningly .     i   m calling the police and you can annoy them with your stories .  say  walt  is everything all right .         i think so .     sills returned from his inspection of the laboratory .     they only knocked over empty glassware .  everything else is unharmed .         that   s good     taylor began  and then choked in dismay .   from the hallway  a cool individual  hat drawn well over his eyes  entered .  a revolver  expertly handled  changed the situation considerably .      o .  k .      he grunted at taylor     drop the gat .     the other   s weapon slipped from reluctant fingers and hit the floor with a clank .   the new menace surveyed the four others with a sardonic glance .     well .  so there were two others trying to beat me to it this seems to be a very popular place .        sills and taylor stared stupidly  while hornswoggle   s teeth chattered energetically .  the first mobster moved back uneasily  muttering as he did so     for pete   s sake  it   s mike the slug .         yeah     mike rasped     mike the slug .  there   s lots of guys who know me and who know i ain   t afraid to pull the trigger anytime i feel like .  come on  baldy  hand over the works .  you know the stuff about your fake gold .  come on  before i count five .      sills moved slowly toward the old safe in the corner .  mike stepped back carelessly to give him room  and in so doing  his coat sleeve brushed against a shelf .  a small vial of sodium sulphate solution tottered and fell .   with sudden inspiration .  sills yelled     my god  watch out .  it   s nitroglycerine .      the vial hit the floor with a smashing tinkle of broken glass  and involuntarily  mike yelled and jumped in wild dismay .  and as he did so  taylor crashed into him with a beautiful flying tackle .  at the same time .  sills lunged for taylor   s fallen weapon to cover the other two .  for this  however  there was no longer need .  at the very beginning of the confusion  both had faded hurriedly into the night from whence they came .   taylor and mike the slug rolled round and round the laboratory floor  locked in desperate struggle while sills hopped over and about them  praying for a moment of comparative quiet that he might bring the revolver into sharp and sudden contact with the gangster   s skull .   but no such moment came .  suddenly mike lunged  caught taylor stunningly under the chin  and jerked free .  sills yelled in consternation and pulled the trigger at the fleeing figure .  the shot was wild and mike escaped unharmed .  sills made no attempt to follow .   a sluicing stream of cold water brought taylor back to his senses .  he shook his head dazedly as he surveyed the surrounding shambles .      whew .     he said     what a night .      sills groaned     what are we going to do now .  gene .  our very lives are in danger .  i never thought of the possibility of thieves  or i would never have told of the discovery to the newspapers .         oh  well  the harm   s done  no use weeping over it now  listen  the first thing we have to do now is to get back to sleep .  they won   t bother us again tonight tomorrow you   ll go to the bank and put the papers outlining the details of the process in the vault  which you should have done long ago  .  staples will be here at   p . m .   well close the deal  and then  at least  we   ll live happily ever after .      the chemist shook his head dolefully .     ammonium has certainly proved to be very upsetting so far .  i almost wish i had never heard of it i   d almost rather be back doing ore analysis .        as walter sills rattled cross town towards his bank  he found no reason to change his wish .  even the comforting and homely jiggling of his ancient and battered automobile failed to cheer him .  from a life characterized by peaceful monotony  he had entered a period of bedlam  and he was not at all satisfied with the change .      riches  like poverty  has its own peculiar problems     he remarked sententiously to himself as he braked the car before the two story  marble edifice that was the bank .  he stepped out carefully  stretched his cramped legs  and headed for the revolving door .   he didn   t get there right away  though .  two husky specimens of the human race stepped up  one at each side  and sills felt a very hard object pressing with painful intensity against his ribs .  he opened his mouth involuntarily  and was rewarded by an icy voice in his ears     quiet  baldy  or you   ll get what you deserve for the damn trick you pulled on me last night .      sills shivered and subsided .  he recognized mike the slug   s voice very easily .      where   s the details .     asked mike     and make it quick .         inside jacket pocket     croaked sills tremulously .   mike   s companion passed his hand dexterously into the indicated pocket and flicked out three or four folded sheets of foolscap .      dat it  mike .      a hasty appraisal and a nod     yeh  we got it .  all right  baldy  on your way .     a sudden shove and the two gangsters jumped into their car and drove away rapidly  while the chemist sprawled on the sidewalk .  kindly hands raised him up .      it   s all right     he managed to gasp .     i just tripped  that   s all .  i   m not hurt .     he found himself alone again  passed into the bank  and dropped into the nearest bench  in near collapse .  there was no doubt about it  the new life was not for him .   but he should have been prepared for it .  taylor had foreseen a possibility of this sort of thing happening .  he  himself  had thought a car had been trailing him .  yet  in his surprise and fright  he had almost ruined everything .   he shrugged his thin shoulders and  taking off his hat  abstracted a few folded sheets of paper from the sweatband .  it was the work of five minutes to deposit them in a vault  and see the immensely strong steel door swing shut .  he felt relieved .      i wonder what they   ll do     he muttered to himself on the way home     when they try to follow the instructions on the paper they did get .     he pursed his lips and shook his head .     if they do  there   s going to be one heck of an explosion .      sills arrived home to find three policemen pacing leisurely up and down the sidewalk in front of the house .      police guard     explained taylor shortly     so that we have no more trouble like last night .      the chemist related the events at the bank and taylor nodded grimly .     well  it   s checkmate for them now .  staples will be here in two hours  and until then the police will take care of things .  afterwards     he shrugged     it will be staples    affair .         listen  gene     the chemist put in suddenly     i   m worried about the ammonium .  i haven   t tested its plating abilities and those are the most important things  you know .  what if staples comes  and we find that all we have is pigeon milk .         hmm     taylor stroked his chin     you   re right there .  but i   ll tell you what we can do .  before staples comes  let   s plate something a spoon  suppose for our own satisfaction .         it   s really very annoying     sills complained fretfully .     if it weren   t for these troublesome hooligans  we wouldn   t have to proceed in this slipshod and unscientific manner .         well  let   s eat dinner first       after the mid day meal  they began .  the apparatus was set up in feverish haste .  in a cubic vat  a foot each way  a saturated solution of ammonaline was poured .  an old  battered spoon was the cathode and a mass of ammonium amalgam  separated from the rest of the solution by a perforated glass partition  was the anode .  three batteries in series provided the current .   sills explained animatedly     it works on the same principle as ordinary copper plating .  the ammonium ion  once the electric current is run through  is attracted to the cathode  which is in the spoon .  ordinarily it would break up  being unstable  but this is not the case when it is dissolved in ammonaline .  this ammonaline is itself very slightly ionized and oxygen is given off at the anode .      this much i know from theory .  let us see what happens in practice .      he closed the key while taylor watched with breathless interest .  for a moment  no effect was visible .  taylor looked disappointed .   then sills grasped his sleeve .     see .     he hissed .     watch the anode .      sure enough  bubbles of gas were slowly forming upon the spongy ammonium amalgam .  they shifted their attention to the spoon .   gradually  they noticed a change .  the metallic appearance became dulled  the silver color slowly losing its whiteness .  a layer of distinct  if dull  yellow was being built up .  for fifteen minutes  the current ran and then sills broke the circuit with a contented sigh .      it plates perfectly     he said .      good .  take it out .  let   s see it .         what .     sills was aghast .     take it out .  why  that   s pure ammonium .  if i were to expose it to ordinary air  the water vapor would dissolve it to nh oh in no time .  we can   t do that .      he dragged a rather bulky piece of apparatus to the table .     this     he said     is a compressed air container .  i run it through calcium chloride dryers and then bubble the perfectly dry oxygen  safely diluted with four times its own volume of nitrogen  directly into the solvent .      he introduced the nozzle into the solution just beneath the spoon and turned on a slow stream of air .  it worked like magic .  with almost lightning speed  the yellow coating began to glitter and gleam  to shine with almost ethereal beauty .   the two men watched it with beating heart and panting breath .  sills shut the air off  and for a while they watched the wonderful spoon and said nothing .   then taylor whispered hoarsely     take it out .  let me feel it .  my god .  it   s beautiful .      with reverent awe  sills approached the spoon  grasped it with forceps  and withdrew it from the surrounding liquid .   what followed immediately after that can never be fully described .  later on  when excited newspaper reporters pressed them unmercifully  neither taylor nor sills had the least recollection of the happenings of the next few minutes .   what happened was that the moment the ammoniumplated spoon was exposed to open air  the most horrible odor ever conceived assailed their nostrils .  an odor that cannot be described  a terrible broth of hell that plunged the room into sheer  horrible nightmare .   with one strangled gasp .  sills dropped the spoon .  both were coughing and retching  tearing wildly at their throats and mouths  yelling  weeping  sneezing .   taylor pounced upon the spoon and looked about wildly .  the odor grew steadily more powerful and their wild exertions to escape it had already succeeded in wrecking the laboratory and had upset the vat of ammonaline .  there was only one thing to do  and sills did it .  the spoon went flying out the open window in the middle of twelfth avenue .  it hit the sidewalk right at the feet of one of the policemen  but taylor didn   t care .      take off your clothes .  we   ll have to burn them     sills was gasping .     then spray something over the laboratory anything with a strong smell .  burn sulphur .  get some liquid bromine .        both were tearing at their clothes in distraction when they realized that someone had walked in through the unlocked door .  the bell had rung  but neither had heard it .  it was staples  six foot  lion maned steel king .   one step into the hall ruined his dignity utterly .  he collapsed in one tearing sob and twelfth avenue was treated to the spectacle of an elderly  richly dressed gentleman tearing uptown as fast as his feet would carry him  shedding as much of his clothes as he dared while doing so .   the spoon continued its deadly work .  the three policemen had long since retired in abject rout  and now to the numbed and tortured senses of the two innocent and suffering causes of the entire mess came a roaring and confused shouting from the street  men and women were pouring out of the neighboring houses  horses were bolting .  fire engines clanged down the street  only to be abandoned by their riders .  squadrons of police came and left .   sills and taylor finally gave up  and clad only in trousers  ran pell mell for the hudson .  they did not stop until they found themselves neck deep in water  with blessed  pure air above them .   taylor turned bewildered eyes to sills .     but how could it emit that horrible odor .  you said it was stable and stable solids have no odors .  it takes vapor for that  doesn   t it .         have you ever smelled musk .     groaned sills .     it will give off an aroma for an indefinite period without losing any appreciable weight .  we   ve come up against something like that .      the two ruminated in silence for a while  wincing whenever the wind brought a vagrant waft of ammonium vapor to them  and then taylor said in a low voice     when they finally trace the trouble to the spoon  and find out who made it  i   m afraid we   ll be sued or maybe thrown in jail .      sills    face lengthened .     i wish i   d never seen the damned stuff .  it   s brought nothing but trouble .     his tortured spirit gave way and he sobbed loudly .   taylor patted him on the back mournfully .     it   s not as bad as all that  of course .  the discovery will make you famous and you   ll be able to demand your own price  working at any industrial lab in the country .  then  too  you   re a cinch to win the nobel prize .         that   s right     sills smiled again     and i may find a way to counteract the odor  too .  i hope so .         i hope so  too     said taylor feelingly .     let   s go back .  i think they   ve managed to remove the spoon by now .        the end    it should be quite obvious to anyone reading    the magnificent possession    that i was majoring in chemistry in college at the time .  as supposed humor  it is much more embarrassing on rereading than    ring around the sun    is .  imagine having a congressman named    hornswoggle    and having gangsters speak in a ridiculous  misspelled version of brooklyn slang .        the magnificent possession    was the only one of the first nine stories i wrote that campbell never saw  and i   m glad of that .   in early december i wrote a story i called    ad astra     and on december           my father   s forty second birthday  though i don   t recall thinking of it as an omen one way or the other   i went in to submit it to campbell .  it was my seventh visit to his office  for i had not yet missed a month  and it was the ninth story i submitted to him .      ad astra    is the first story i wrote for which i remember  even after all this time  the exact circumstances of the initiating inspiration .  that fall  i applied for and received a national youth administration  nya  job designed to help me through college .  i received fifteen dollars a month  if memory serves me  in return for a few hours of typing .  the typing i did was for a sociologist who was writing a book on the subject of social resistance to technological innovation .  this included everything from the resistance of the early mesopotamian priesthood to the dissemination of the knowledge of reading and writing among the general population  down to objections to the airplane by those who said heavier than air flight was impossible .   naturally it occurred to me that a story might be written in which social resistance to space flight might play a small part .  it was because of that that i used    ad astra    as the title .  this was from the latin proverb    per aspera ad astra        through difficulties to the stars     .   for the first time  campbell did more than simply send a rejection .  on december     i received a letter from him asking me to come in for a conference to discuss the story in detail .   on january          i went to see campbell for the eighth time and for the first time at his specific request .  it turned out that what he liked in the story was the social resistance to space flight the space flight itself was  of course  run of the mill .   rather daunted  for i had never before had to revise a story to meet editorial specification  i went to work .  i brought in the revised story on january     and on january    i discovered the system used by campbell in accepting stories .  though his rejections were usually accompanied by long and useful letters  his acceptances consisted of a check only  without a single accompanying word .  it was his feeling that the check was eloquent enough .  in this case it was for sixty nine dollars  since the story was       words long and campbell paid one cent a word in those days .   it was my first sale to campbell  after seven months of trying and after eight consecutive rejections .  the story appeared half a year later  and i then found that campbell had changed the title  on the whole justifiably  i think  to    trends .          trends     john harman was sitting at his desk  brooding  when i entered the office that day .  it had become a common sight  by then  to see him staring out at the hudson  head in hand  a scowl contorting his face all too common .  it seemed unfair for the little bantam to be eating his heart out like that day after day  when by rights he should have been receiving the praise and adulation of the world .   i flopped down into a chair .     did you see the editorial in today   s clarion  boss .      he turned weary  bloodshot eyes to me .     no  i haven   t .  what do they say .  are they calling the vengeance of god down upon me again .     his voice dripped with bitter sarcasm .      they   re going a little farther now  boss     i answered .     listen to this           tomorrow is the day of john harman   s attempt at profaning the heavens .  tomorrow  in defiance of world opinion and world conscience  this man will defy god .         it is not given to man to go wheresoever ambition and desire lead him .  there are things forever denied him  and aspiring to the stars is one of these .  like eve  john harman wishes to eat of the forbidden fruit  and like eve he will suffer due punishment therefor .         but it is not enough  this mere talk .  if we allow him thus to brook the vengeance of god  the trespass is mankind   s and not harman   s alone .  in allowing him to carry out his evil designs  we make ourselves accessory to the crime  and divine vengeance will fall on all alike .         it is  therefore  essential that immediate steps be taken to prevent harman from taking off in his so called rocketship tomorrow .  the government in refusing to take such steps may force violent action .  if it will make no move to confiscate the rocketship  or to imprison harman  our enraged citizenry may have to take matters into their own hands           harman sprang from his seat in a rage and  snatching the paper from my hands  threw it into the corner furiously .     it   s an open call to a lynching     he raved .     look at this .      he cast five or six envelopes in my direction .  one glance sufficed to tell what they were .      more death threats .     i    asked .      yes  exactly that .  i   ve had to arrange for another increase in the police patrol outside the building and for motorcycle police escort when i cross the river to the testing ground tomorrow .      he marched up and down the room with agitated stride .     i don   t know what to do  clifford .  i   ve worked on the prometheus almost ten years .  i   ve slaved  spent a fortune of money  given up all that makes life worth while and for what .  so that a bunch of fool revivalists can whip up public sentiment against me until my very life isn   t safe .         you   re in advance of the times  boss     i shrugged my shoulders in a resigned gesture which made him whirl upon me in a fury .      what do you mean    in advance of the times    .  this is      .  the world has been ready for space travel for half a century now .  fifty years ago  people were talking  dreaming of the day when man could free himself of earth and plumb the depths of space .  for fifty years  science has inched toward   this goal  and now  .   .   .  now i finally have it  and behold .  you say the world is not ready for me .         the      s and      s were years of anarchy  decadence  and misrule  if you remember your history     i reminded him gently .     you cannot accept them as criteria .         i know  i know .  you   re going to tell me of the first war of       and the second of      .  it   s an old story to me  my father fought in the second and my grandfather in the first .  nevertheless  those were the days when science flourished .  men were not afraid then  somehow they dreamed and dared .  there was no such thing as conservatism when it came to matters mechanical and scientific .  no theory was too radical to advance  no discovery too revolutionary to publish .  today  dry rot has seized the world when a great vision  such as space travel  is hailed as    defiance of god .          his head sank slowly down  and he turned away to hide his trembling lips and the tears in his eyes .  then he suddenly straightened again  eyes blazing     but i   ll show them .  i   m going through with it  in spite of hell  heaven and earth .  i   ve put too much into it to quit now .         take it easy  boss     i advised .     this isn   t going to do you any good tomorrow  when you get into that ship .  your chances of coming out alive aren   t too good now  so what will they be if you start out worn to pieces with excitement and worry .         you   re right .  let   s not think of it any more .  where   s shelton .         over at the institute arranging for the special photographic plates to be sent us .         he   s been gone a long time  hasn   t he .         not especially  but listen  boss  there   s something wrong with him .  i don   t like him .         poppycock .  he   s been with me two years  and i have no complaints .         all right .     i spread my hands in resignation .     if you won   t listen to me  you won   t .  just the same i caught him reading one of those infernal pamphlets otis eldredge puts out .  you know the kind     beware  o mankind  for judgment draws near .  punishment for your sins is at hand .  repent and be saved .     and all the rest of the time honoured junk .      harman snorted in disgust .     cheap tub thumping revivalist .  i suppose the world will never outgrow his type not while sufficient morons exist .  still you can   t condemn shelton just because he reads it .  i   ve read them myself on occasion .         he says he picked it up on the sidewalk and read it in    idle curiosity     but i   m pretty sure that i saw him take it out of his wallet .  besides  he goes to church every sunday .         is that a crime .  everyone does  nowadays .         yes  but not to the twentieth century evangelical society .  that   s eldredge   s .      that jolted harman .  evidently  it was the first he had heard of it .     say  that is something  isn   t it .  we   ll have to keep an eye on him  then .      but after that  things started to happen  and we forgot all about shelton until it was too late .     there was nothing much left to do that last day before the test  and i wandered into the next room  where i went over harman   s final report to the institute .  it was my job to correct any errors or mistakes that crept in  but i   m afraid i wasn   t very thorough .  to tell the truth  i couldn   t concentrate .  every few minutes  i   d fall into a brown study .   it seemed queer  all this fuss over a space travel .  when harman had first announced the approaching perfection of the prometheus  some six months before  scientific circles had been jubilant .  of course  they were cautious in their statements and qualified everything they said  but there was real enthusiasm .   however  the masses didn   t take it that way .  it seems strange  perhaps  to you of the twenty first century  but perhaps we should have expected it in those days of       .  people weren   t very progressive then .  for years there had been a swing toward religion  and when the churches came out unanimously against harman   s rocket well  there you were .   at first  the opposition confined itself to the churches and we thought it might play itself out .  but it didn   t the papers got hold of it  and literally spread the gospel .  poor harman became an anathema to the world in a remarkably short time  and then his troubles began .   he received death threats  and warnings of divine vengeance every day .  he couldn   t walk the streets in safety .  dozens of sects  to none of which he belonged he was one of the very rare free thinkers of the day  which was another count against him excommunicated him and placed him under special interdict .  and  worst of all  otis eldredge and his evangelical society began stirring up the populace .   eldredge was a queer character one of those geniuses  in their way  that arise every so often .  gifted with a golden tongue and a sulphurous vocabulary  he could fairly hypnotize a crowd .  twenty thousand people were so much putty in his hands  could he only bring them within earshot and for four months  he thundered against harman  for four months  a pouring stream of denunciation rolled forth in oratorical frenzy .  and for four months  the temper of the world rose .   but harman was not to be daunted .  in his tiny  five foot two body  he had enough spirit for five six footers .  the more the wolves howled  the firmer he held his ground .  with almost divine his enemies said  diabolical obstinacy  he refused to yield an inch .  yet his outward firmness was to me  who knew him  but an imperfect concealment of the great sorrow and bitter disappointment within .   the ring of the doorbell interrupted my thoughts at that point and brought me to my feet in surprise .  visitors were very few those days .   i looked out the window and saw a tall  portly figure talking with police sergeant cassidy .  i recognized him at once as howard winstead  head of the institute .  harman was hurrying out to greet him  and after a short exchange of phrases  the two entered the office .  i followed them in  being rather curious as to what could have brought winstead  who was more politician than scientist  here .   winstead didn   t seem very comfortable  at first  not his usual suave self .  he avoided harman   s eyes in an embarrassed manner and mumbled a few conventionalities concerning the weather .  then he came to the point with direct  undiplomatic bluntness .      john     he said     how about postponing the trial for a time .         you really mean abandoning it altogether  don   t you .  well  i won   t  and that   s final .      winstead lifted his hand .     wait now  john  don   t get excited .  let me state my case .  i know the institute agreed to give you a free hand  and i know that you paid at least half the expenses out of your own pocket  but you can   t go through with it .         oh  can   t i  though .     herman snorted derisively .      now listen  john  you know your science  but you don   t know your human nature  and i do .  this is not the world of the    mad decades     whether you realize it or not .  there have been profound changes since      .     he swung into what was evidently a carefully prepared speech .      after the first world war  you know  the world as a whole swung away from religion and toward freedom from convention .  people were disgusted and disillusioned  cynical and sophisticated .  eldredge calls them    wicked and sinful .     in spite of that  science flourished some say it always fares best in such an unconventional period .  from its standpoint it was a    golden age .         however  you know the political and economic history of the period .  it was a time of political chaos and international anarchy  a suicidal  brainless  insane period and it culminated in the second world war .  and just as the first war led to a period of sophistication  so the second initiated a return to religion .      people were disgusted with the    mad decades .     they had had enough of it  and feared  beyond all else  a return to it to remove that possibility  they put the ways of those decades behind them .  their motives  you see  were understandable and laudable .  all the freedom  all the sophistication  all the lack of convention were gone swept away clean .  we are living now in a second victorian age  and naturally so  because human history goes by swings of the pendulum and this is the swing toward religion and convention .      one thing only is left over since those days of half a century ago .  that one thing is the respect of humanity for science .  we have prohibition  smoking for women is outlawed  cosmetics are forbidden  low dresses and short skirts are unheard of  divorce is frowned upon .  but science has not been confined as yet .      it behoves science  then  to be circumspect  to refrain from arousing the people .  it will be very easy to make them believe and otis eldredge has come perilously close to doing it in some of his speeches that it was science that brought about the horrors of the second world war .  science outstripped culture  they will say  technology outstripped sociology  and it was that unbalance that came so near to destroying the world .  somehow  i am inclined to believe they are not so far wrong  at that .      but do you know what would happen  if it ever did come to that .  scientific research may be forbidden  or  if they don   t go that far  it will certainly be so strictly regulated as to stifle in its own decay .  it will be a calamity from which humanity would not recover for a millennium .      and it is your trial flight that may precipitate all this .  you are arousing the public to a stage where it will be difficult to calm them .  i warn you  john .  the consequences will be on your head .        there was absolute silence for a moment and then harman forced a smile .     come  howard  you   re letting yourself be frightened by shadows on the wall .  are you trying to tell me that it is your serious belief that the world as a whole is ready to plunge into a second dark ages .  after all  the intelligent men are on the side of science  aren   t they .         if they are  there aren   t many of them left from what i see .     winstead drew a pipe from his pocket and filled it slowly with tobacco as he continued     eldredge formed a league of the righteous two months ago they call it the l .  r .  and it has grown unbelievably .  twenty million is its membership in the united states alone .  eldredge boasts that after the next election congress will be his  and there seems to be more truth than bluff in that .  already there has been strenuous lobbying in favour of a bill outlawing rocket experiments  and laws of that type have been enacted in poland  portugal and rumania .  yes  john  we are perilously close to open persecution of science .     he was smoking now in rapid  nervous puffs .      but if i succeed  howard  if i succeed .  what then .         bah .  you know the chances for that .  your own estimate gives you only one chance in ten of coming out alive .         what does that signify .  the next experimenter will learn by my mistakes  and the odds will improve .  that   s the scientific method .         the mob doesn   t know anything about the scientific method  and they don   t want to know .  well  what do you say .  will you call it off .      harman sprang to his feet  his chair tumbling over with a crash .     do you know what you ask .  do you want me to give up my life   s work  my dream  just like that .  do you think i   m going to sit back and wait for your dear public to become benevolent .  do you think they   ll change in my lifetime .      here   s my answer  i have an inalienable right to pursue knowledge .  science has an inalienable right to progress and develop without interference .  the world  in interfering with me  is wrong  i am right .  and it shall go hard  but i  will not abandon my rights .      winstead shook his head sorrowfully .     you   re wrong  john  when you speak of    inalienable    rights .  what you call a    right    is merely a privilege  generally agreed upon .  what society accepts  is right  what it does not  is wrong .         would your friend  eldredge  agree to such a definition of his    righteousness    .     questioned harman bitterly .      no  he would not  but that   s irrelevant .  take the case of those african tribes who used to be cannibals .  they were brought up as cannibals  have the long tradition of cannibalism  and their society accepts the practice .  to them  cannibalism is right  and why shouldn   t it be .  so you see how relative the whole notion is  and how inane your conception of    inalienable    rights to perform experiments is .         you know  howard  you missed your calling when you didn   t become a lawyer .     harman was really growing angry .     you   ve been bringing out every moth eaten argument you can think of .  for god   s sake  man  are you trying to pretend that it is a crime to refuse to run with the crowd .  do you stand for absolute uniformity  ordinariness  orthodoxy  commonplaceness .  science would die far sooner under the programme you outline than under governmental prohibition .      harman stood up and pointed an accusing finger at the other .     you   re betraying science and the tradition of those glorious rebels  galileo  darwin  einstein and their kind .  my rocket leaves tomorrow on schedule in spite of you and every other stuffed shirt in the united states .  that   s that  and i refuse to listen to you any longer .  so you can just get out .      the head of the institute  red in the face  turned to me .     you   re my witness  young man  that i warned this obstinate nitwit  this  .   .   .  this hare brained fanatic .     he spluttered a bit  and then strode out  the picture of fiery indignation .   harman turned to me when he had    gone     well  what do you think .  i suppose you agree with him .      there was only one possible answer and i made it     you   re not paying me to do anything else but follow orders  boss .  i   m sticking with you .      just then shelton came in and harman packed us both off to go over the calculations of the orbit of flight for the umpteenth time  while he himself went off to bed .   the next day  july   th  dawned in matchless splendour  and harman  shelton  and myself were in an almost gay mood as we crossed the hudson to where the prometheus surrounded by an adequate police guard lay in gleaming grandeur .   around it  roped off at an apparently safe distance  rolled a crowd of gigantic proportions .  most of them were hostile  raucously so .  in fact  for one fleeting moment  as our motorcycle police escort parted the crowds for us  the shouts and imprecations that reached our ears almost convinced me that we should have listened to winstead .   but harman paid no attention to them at all  after one supercilious sneer at a shout of     there goes john harman  son of belial .     calmly  he directed us about our task of inspection .  i tested the foot thick outer walls and the air locks for leaks  then made sure the air purifier worked .  shelton checked up on the repellent screen and the fuel tanks .  finally  hal man tried on the clumsy spacesuit  found it suitable  and announced himself ready .   the crowd stirred .  upon a hastily erected platform of wooden planks piled in confusion by some in the mob  there rose up a striking figure .  tall and lean  with thin  ascetic countenance  deep set  burning eyes  peering and half closed  a thick  white mane crowning all it was otis eldredge .  the crowd recognized him at once and many cheered .  enthusiasm waxed and soon the entire turbulent mass of people shouted themselves hoarse over him .   he raised a hand for silence  turned to harman  who regarded him with surprise and distaste  and pointed a long  bony finger at him      john  harman  son of the devil  spawn of satan  you are here for an evil purpose .  you are about to set out upon a blasphemous attempt to pierce the veil beyond which man is forbidden to go .  you are tasting of the forbidden fruit of eden and beware that you taste not of the fruits of sin .      the crowd cheered him to the echo and he continued     the finger of god is upon you  john harman .  he shall not allow his works to be defiled .  you die today  john harman .     his voice rose in intensity and his last words were uttered in truly prophetlike fervour .   harman turned away in disdain .  in a loud  clear voice  he addressed the police sergeant     is there any way  officer  of removing these spectators .  the trial flight may be attended by some destruction because of the rocket blasts  and they   re crowding too close .      the policeman answered in a crisp  unfriendly tone     if you   re afraid of being mobbed  say so  mr .  harman .  you don   t have to worry  though  we   ll hold them back .  and as for danger from that contraption     he sniffed loudly in the direction of the prometheus  evoking a torrent of jeers and yells .   harman said nothing further  but climbed into the ship in silence .  and when he did so  a queer sort of stillness fell over the mob  a palpable tension .  there was no attempt at rushing the ship  an attempt i had thought inevitable .  on the contrary  otis eldredge himself shouted to everyone to move back .      leave the sinner to his sins     he shouted .         vengeance is mine     saith the lord .      as the moment approached  shelton nudged me .     let   s get out of here     he whispered in a strained voice .     those rocket blasts are poison .     saying this  he broke into a run  beckoning anxiously for me to follow .   we had not yet reached the fringes of the crowd when there was a terrific roar behind me .  a wave of heated air swept over me .  there was the frightening hiss of some speeding object past my ear  and i was thrown violently to the ground .  for a few moments i lay dazed  my ears ringing and my head reeling .     when i staggered drunkenly to my feet again  it was to view a dreadful sight .  evidently  the entire fuel supply of the prometheus had exploded at once  and where it had lain a moment ago there was now only a yawning hole .  the ground was strewn with wreckage .  the cries of the hurt were heartrending  and the mangled bodies but i won   t try to describe those .   a weak groan at my feet attracted my attention .  one look  and i gasped in horror  for it was shelton  the back of his head a bloody mass .      i did it .     his voice was hoarse and triumphant but withal so low that i could scarcely hear it .     i did it .  i broke open the liquid oxygen compartments and when the spark went through the acetylide mixture the whole cursed thing exploded .     he gasped a bit and tried to move but failed .     a piece of wreckage must have hit me  but i don   t care .  i   ll die knowing that      his voice was nothing more than a rasping rattle  and on his face was the ecstatic look of martyr .  he died then  and i could not find it in my heart to condemn him .   it was then i first thought of harman .  ambulances from manhattan and from jersey city were on the scene  and one had sped to a wooden patch some five hundred yards distant  where  caught in the treetops  lay a splintered fragment of the prometheus    forward compartment .  i limped there as fast as i could  but they had dragged out harman and clanged away long before i could reach them .   after that  i didn   t stay .  the disorganized crowd had no thought but for the dead and wounded now  but when they recovered  and bent their thoughts to revenge  my life would not be worth a straw .  i followed the dictates of the better part of valour and quietly disappeared .   the next week was a hectic one for me .  during that time  i lay in hiding at the home of a friend  for it would have been more than my life was worth to allow myself to be seen and recognized .  harman  himself  lay in a jersey city hospital  with nothing more than superficial cuts and bruises thanks to the backward force of the explosion and the saving clump of trees which cushioned the fall of the prometheus .  it was on him that the brunt of the world   s wrath fell .   new york  and the rest of the world also  just about went crazy .  every last paper in the city came out with gigantic headlines        killed     wounded the price of sin     printed in blood red letters .  the editorials howled for harman   s life  demanding he be arrested and tried for first degree murder .   the dreaded cry of    lynch him .     was raised throughout the five boroughs  and milling thousands crossed the river and converged on jersey city .  at their head was otis eldredge  both legs in splints  addressing the crowd from an open automobile as they marched .  it was a veritable army .   mayor carson of jersey city called out every available policeman and phoned frantically to trenton for the state militia .  new york clamped down on every bridge and tunnel leaving the city but not till after many thousands had left .   there were pitched battles on the jersey coast that sixteenth of july .  the vastly outnumbered police clubbed indiscriminately but were gradually pushed back and back .  mounties rode down upon the mob relentlessly but were swallowed up and pulled down by sheer force of numbers .  not until tear gas was used  did the crowd halt and even then they did not retreat .   the next day  martial law was declared  and the state militia entered jersey city .  that was the end for the lynchers .  eldredge was called to confer with the mayor  and after the conferences ordered his followers to disperse .   in a statement to the newspapers .  mayor carson said     john harman must needs suffer for his crime  but it is essential that he do so legally .  justice must take its course  and the state of new jersey will take all necessary measures .        by the end of the week  normality of a sort had returned and harman slipped out of the public spotlight .  two more weeks and there was scarcely a word about him in the newspapers  excepting such casual references to him in the discussion of the new zittman antirocketry bill that had just passed both houses of congress by unanimous votes .   yet he remained in the hospital still .  no legal action had been taken against him  but it began to appear that a sort of indefinite imprisonment    for his own protection    might be his eventual fate .  therefore  i bestirred myself to action .   temple hospital is situated in a lonely and outlying district of jersey city  and on a dark  moonless night i experienced no difficulty at all in invading the grounds unobserved .  with a facility that surprised me  i sneaked in through a basement window  slugged a sleepy interne into insensibility and proceeded to room   e  which was listed in the books as harman   s .      who   s there .     harman   s surprised shout was music in my ears .      sh .  quiet .  it   s i  cliff mckenny .         you .  what are you doing here .         trying to get you out .  if i don   t  you   re liable to stay here the rest of your life .  come on  let   s go .      i was hustling him into his clothes while we were speaking  and in no time at all we were sneaking down the corridor .  we were out safely and into my waiting car before harman collected his scattered wits sufficiently to begin asking questions .      what   s happened since that day .     was the first question .     i don   t remember a thing after starting the rocket blasts until i woke up in the hospital .         didn   t they tell you anything .         not a damn thing     he swore .     i asked until i was hoarse .      so i told him the whole story from the explosion on .  his eyes were wide with shocked surprise when i told of the dead and wounded  and filled with wild rage when he heard of shelton   s treachery .  the story of the riots and attempted lynching evoked a muffled curse from between set lips .      of course  the papers howled    murder         i concluded     but they couldn   t pin that on you .  they tried manslaughter  but there were too many eye witnesses that had heard your request for the removal of the crowd and the police sergeant   s absolute refusal to do so .  that  of course  absolved you from all blame .  the police sergeant himself died in the explosion  and they couldn   t make him the goat .      still  with eldredge yelling for your hide  you   re never safe .  it would be best to leave while able .      harman nodded his head in agreement    eldredge survived the explosion  did he .         yes  worse luck .  he broke both legs  but it takes more than that to shut his mouth .      another week had passed before i reached our future haven my uncle   s farm in minnesota .  there  in a lonely and out of the way rural community  we stayed while the hullabaloo over harman   s disappearance gradually died down and the perfunctory search for us faded away .  the search  by the way  was short indeed  for the authorities seemed more relieved than concerned over the disappearance .     peace and quiet did wonders with harman .  in six months he seemed a new man quite ready to consider a second attempt at space travel .  not all the misfortunes in the world could stop him  it seemed  once he had his heart set on something .      my mistake the first time     he told me one winter   s day     lay in announcing the experiment .  i should have taken the temper of the people into account  as winstead said .  this time  however    he rubbed his hands and gazed thoughtfully into the distance    i   ll steal a march on them .  the experiment will he performed in secrecy absolute secrecy .      i laughed grimly     it would have to be .  do you know that all future experiment in rocketry  even entirely theoretical research is a crime punishable by death .         are you afraid  then .         of course not  boss .  i   m merely stating a fact .  and here   s another plain fact .  we two can   t build a ship all by ourselves  you know .         i   ve thought of that and figured a way out  cliff .  what   s more  i can take care of the money angle  too .  you   ll have to do some traveling  though .      first  you   ll have to go to chicago and look up the firm of roberts   scranton and withdraw everything that   s left of my father   s inheritance  which     he added in a rueful aside     is more than half gone on the first ship .  then  locate as many of the old crowd as you can  harry jenkins  joe o   brien  neil stanton all of them .  and get back as quickly as you can .  i am tired of delay .      two days later  i left for chicago .  obtaining my uncle   s consent to the entire business was a simple affair .     might as well be strung up for a herd of sheep as for a lamb     he grunted     so go ahead .  i   m in enough of a mess now and can afford a bit more  i guess .      it took quite a bit of travelling and even more smooth talk and persuasion before i managed to get four men to come  the three mentioned by harman and one other  a saul simonoff .  with that skeleton force and with the half million    still left harman out of the reputed millions left him by his father  we began work .   the building of the new prometheus is a story in itself a long story of five years of discouragement and insecurity .  little by little  buying girders in chicago  beryl steel plates in new york  a vanadium cell in san francisco  miscellaneous items in scattered comers of the nation  we constructed the sister ship to the ill fated prometheus .   the difficulties in the way were all but insuperable .  to prevent drawing suspicion down upon us  we had to spread our purchases over periods of time  and to see to it  as well  that the orders were made out to various places .  for this we required the co operation of various friends  who  to be sure  did not know at the time for exactly what purpose the purchases were being used .   we had to synthesize our own fuel  ten tons of it  and that was perhaps the hardest job of all  certainly it took the most time .  and finally  as harman   s money dwindled  we came up against our biggest problem the necessity of economizing .  from the beginning we had known that we could never make the new prometheus as large or as elaborate as the first ship had been  but it soon developed that we would have to reduce its equipment to a point perilously close to the danger line .  the repulsion screen was barely satisfactory and all attempts at radio communication were perforce abandoned .   and as we labored through the years  there in the backwoods of northern minnesota  the world moved on  and winstead   s prophecies proved to have hit amazingly near the mark .     the events of those five years from      to      are well known to the schoolboys of today  the period being the climax of what we now call the    neo victorian age .     the happenings of those years seem well nigh unbelievable as we look back upon them now .   the outlawing of all research on space travel came in the very beginning  but was a bare start compared to the antiscientific measures taken in the ensuing years .  the next congressional elections  those of       resulted in a congress in which eldredge controlled the house and held the balance of power in the senate .   hence  no time was lost .  at the first session of the ninety third congress  the famous stonely carter bill was passed .  it established the federal scientific research investigatory bureau the fsrib which was given full power to pass on the legality of all research in the country .  every laboratory  industrial or scholastic  was required to file information  in advance  on all projected research before this new bureau  which could  and did  ban absolutely all such as it disapproved of .   the inevitable appeal to the supreme court came on november          in the case of westly vs .  simmons  in which joseph westly of stanford upheld his right to continue his investigations on atomic power on the grounds that the stonelycarter act was unconstitutional .   how we five  isolated amid the snowdrifts of the middle west  followed that case .  we had all the minneapolis and st .  paul papers sent to us always reaching us two days late  and devoured every word of print concerning it .  for the two months of suspense work ceased entirely on the new prometheus .   it was rumoured at first that the court would declare the act unconstitutional  and monster parades were held in every large town against this eventuality .  the league of the righteous brought its powerful influence to bear and even the supreme court submitted .  it was five to four for constitutionality .  science strangled by the vote of one man .   and it was strangled beyond a doubt .  the members of the bureau were eldredge men  heart and soul  and nothing that would not have immediate industrial use was passed .      science has gone too far     said eldredge in a famous speech at about that time .     we must halt it indefinitely  and allow the world to catch up .  only through that and trust in god may we hope to achieve universal and permanent prosperity .      but this was one of eldridge   s last statements .  he had never fully recovered from the broken legs he received that fateful day in july of        and his strenuous life since then had strained his constitution past the breaking point .  on february          he passed away amid a burst of mourning unequalled since lincoln   s assassination .   his death had no immediate effect on the course of events .  the rules of the fsrib grew  in fact  in stringency as the years passed .  so starved and choked did science become  that once more colleges found themselves forced to reinstate philosophy and the classics as the chief studies and at that the student body fell to the lowest point since the beginning of the twentieth century .   these conditions prevailed more or less throughout the civilized world  reaching even lower depths in england  and perhaps least depressing in germany  which was the last to fall under the    neo victorian    influence .   the nadir of science came in the spring of       a bare month before the completion of the new prometheus  with the passing of the    easter edict    it was issued the day before easter .  by it  all independent research or experimentation was absolutely forbidden .  the fsrib thereafter reserved the right to allow only such research as it specifically requested .     john harman and i stood before the gleaming metal of the new prometheus that easter sunday  i in the deepest gloom  and he in an almost jovial mood .      well  clifford  my boy     said he     the last ton of fuel  a few polishing touches  and i am ready for my second attempt .  this time there will be no sheltons among us .     he hummed a hymn .  that was all the radio played those days  and even we rebels sang them from sheer frequency of repetition .   i grunted sourly     it   s no use  boss .  ten to one  you end up somewhere in space  and even if you come back  you   ll most likely be hung by the neck .  we can   t win .     my head shook dolefully from side to side .      bah .  this state of affairs can   t last  cliff .         i think it will .  winstead was right that time .  the pendulum swings  and since      it   s been swinging against us .  we   re ahead of the times or behind them .         don   t speak of that fool  winstead .  you   re making the same mistake he did .  trends are things of centuries and millenniums  not years or decades .  for five hundred years we have been moving toward science .  you can   t reverse that in thirty years .         then what are we doing .     i asked sarcastically .      we   re going through a momentary reaction following a period of too rapid advance in the mad decades .  just such a reaction took place in the romantic age the first victorian period following the too rapid advance of the eighteenth century age of reason .         do you really think so .     i was shaken by his evident self assurance .      of course .  this period has a perfect analogy in the spasmodic    revivals    that used to hit the small towns in america   s bible belt a century or so ago .  for a week  perhaps everyone would get religion  and virtue would reign triumphant .  then  one by one  they would backslide and the devil would resume his sway .      in fact  there are symptoms of backsliding even now .  the l .  r .  has indulged in one squabble after another since eldredge   s death .  there have been half a dozen schisms already .  the very extremities to which those in power are going are helping us  for the country is rapidly tiring of it .      and that ended the argument i in total defeat  as usual .   a month later  the new prometheus was complete .  it was nowhere near as glittering and as beautiful as the original  and bore many a trace of makeshift workmanship  but we were proud of it proud and triumphant .      i   m going to try again  men    harman   s voice was husky  and his little frame vibrant with happiness    and i may not make it  but for that i don   t care .     his eyes shone in anticipation .     i   ll be shooting through the void at last  and the dream of mankind will come true .  out around the moon and back  the first to see the other side .  it   s worth the chance         you won   t have fuel enough to land on the moon  boss  which is a pity     i said .   at that a pessimistic whisper ran through the little group surrounding him  to which he paid no attention .      good bye     he said .     i   ll be seeing you .     and with a cheerful grin he climbed into the ship .   fifteen minutes later  the five of us sat about the living room table  frowning  lost in thought  eyes gazing out of the building at the spot where a burned section of soil marked the spot where a few minutes earlier the new prometheus had lain .   simonoff voiced the thought that was in the mind of each one of us     maybe it would be better for him not to come back .  he won   t be treated very well if he does  i think .     and we all nodded in gloomy assent .   how foolish that prediction seems to me now from the hindsight of three decades .   the rest of the story is really not mine  for i did not see harman again until a month after his eventful trip ended in a safe landing .   it was almost thirty six hours after the take off that a screaming projectile shot its way over washington and buried itself in the mud just across the potomac .   investigators were at the scene of the landing within fifteen minutes  and in another fifteen minutes the police were there  for it was found that the projectile was a rocketship .  they stared in involuntary awe at the tired  dishevelled man who staggered out in near collapse .   there was utter silence while he shook his fist at the staring spectators and shouted     go ahead  hang me  fools .  but i   ve reached the moon  and you can   t hang that .  get the fsrib .  maybe they   ll declare the flight illegal and  therefore  nonexistent .     he laughed weakly and suddenly collapsed .   someone shouted     take him to a hospital .  he   s sick .     in stiff unconsciousness harman was bundled into a police car and carried away  while the police formed a guard about the rocketship .   government officials arrived and investigated the ship  read the log  inspected the drawings and photographs he had taken of the moon  and finally departed in silence .  the crowd grew and the word spread that a man had reached the moon .   curiously enough  there was little resentment of the fact .  men were impressed and awed  the crowd whispered and cast inquisitive glances at the dim crescent of luna  scarcely seen in the bright sunlight .  over all  an uneasy pall of silence  the silence of indecision  lay .   then  at the hospital  harman revealed his identity  and the fickle world went wild .  even harman himself was stunned in surprise at the rapid change in the world   s temper .  it seemed almost incredible  and yet it was true .  secret discontent  combined with a heroic tale of man against overwhelming odds  the sort of tale that had stirred man   s soul since the beginning of time served to sweep everyone into an ever swelling current of anti victorianism .  and eldredge was dead no other could replace him .   i saw harman at the hospital shortly after that .  he was propped up and still half buried with papers  telegrams and letters .  he grinned at me and nodded .     well  cliff     he whispered     the pendulum swung back again .        the end    actually  though    trends    was the second story i sold  it was the third to be published .  ahead of it was not only    marooned off vesta     but another story  to be mentioned shortly  that was written and sold after    trends    but was rushed into print sooner .  both earlier stories were  however  published in amazing and  somehow  i find it difficult to count them .  to me  the first story i sold to campbell and published in astounding is my first significant published story .  this is rather ungrateful of me toward amazing  but i can   t help it .     the july      issue of astounding is sometimes considered by later fans to mark the beginning of science fiction   s so called golden age  a period stretching through most of the     s .  in that period  campbefl   s views were in full force in the magazine  and the authors he trained and developed were writing with the full ardor of youth .  i wish i could say that    trends    was what marked the beginning of that golden age  but i can   t .  its appearance in that issue was pure coincidence .   what really counted was that the lead novelette in the july      issue was    black destroyer     by a .  e .  van vogt  a first story by a new author  while in the next issue  august       was a short story     lifeline     by robert a .  heinlein  another first story by a new author .   in time to come  van vogt  heinlein  and i would be universally listed among the top authors of the golden age  but van vogt and heinlein were that from the very beginning .  each blazed forth as a first magazine star at the moment his first story appeared  and their status never flagged throughout the remainder of the golden age .  i  on the other hand  and this is not false modesty   came up only gradually .  i was very little noticed for a while and came to be considered a major author by such gradual steps that despite the healthy helping of vanity with which i am blessed  i myself was the last to notice .      trends    is an amusing story in some respects .  it sets the initial space flights to the moon in the     s .  i thought at the time i was being daring indeed  but it has turned out that i was behind the eventual reality by a full decade  since what i described was done  and with immensely greater sophistication  in the     s .  my description of the first attempts at space flight was  of course  incredibly naive  in hindsight .   in one respect  however  the story is unusual .  in recent years phil klas  a science fiction writer who publishes under the pseudonym    william tenn     pointed out to me that this was the first story in history that predicted resistance of any kind to the notion of space exploration .  in all other stories  the general public was either indifferent or enthusiastic .  this makes me sound enormously and uniquely perceptive  but having explained the nature of the book i was doing my nya work on  i can   t take credit for brilliance .   heck .    notice also the reference to the    second  world war  of      .     the story  remember  was written two months after munich .  i did not believe at the time that this meant    peace in our time     as neville chamberlain had maintained .  i estimated that there would be war in a year and a half  and again  .  was too conservative .      trends     incidentally  is one of the few stories i have written in the first person  and the narrator is named clifford mckenny .   why my penchant for irish last names in those days i haven   t been able to figure out .   behind the first name  though  lies a story .   after my may      scare concerning the demise of astounding  i began sending monthly letters to the magazine  carefully rating the stories .   i stopped after i began selling stories myself .   these were all published  and  in fact  i had sent a letter to astounding  which was published  back in      .  two established science fiction writers wrote me personally in response to remarks i made concerning their stories .  these were russell r .  winterbotham and clifford d .  simak .   with both  i maintained a correspondence  quite regular at first  and with long dry intervals in later years .  the friendship that resulted  though long distance  was enduring .  i met russ winterbotham in person only once  and that was at the world science fiction convention in cleveland in      .  he died in      .  i have met cliff simak three times  the most recent occasion being at the world science fiction convention in boston in       where he was guest of honor .   simak   s first letter to me was in response to a letter of mine printed in astounding that had given a low rating to his story    rule        in the july      issue .  simak wrote to ask details so that he might consider my criticisms and perhaps profit from them .   would that i would react so gently and rationally to adverse criticism .    i reread the story in order to be able to answer properly and found  to my surprise  that there was nothing wrong with it at all .  what he had done was to write the story in separate scenes with no explicit transition passages between .  i wasn   t used to that technique  so the story seemed choppy and incoherent .  the second time around  i recognized what he was doing and realized that not only was the story not in the least incoherent but it moved with a slick speed that would have been impossible if all the dull  breadand butter transitions had been inserted .   i wrote simak to explain  and adopted the same device in my own stories .  what   s more  i attempted  as far as possible  to make use of something similar to simak   s cool and unadorned style   i have sometimes heard science fiction writers speak of the influence upon their style of such high prestige literary figures as kafka  proust  and joyce .  this may be pose or it may be reality  but  for myself  i make no such claim .  i learned how to write science fiction by the attentive reading of science fiction  and among the major influences on my style was clifford simak .   simak was particularly encouraging in those anxious months during which i was trying to sell a story .  on the day i made my first sale  i had a letter  all sealed and addressed and stamped  waiting to be mailed to him .  i tore it open to add the news  and destroying a stamped envelope  which represented a clear loss of several cents  was not something i did lightly in those days .   it has always pleased me  therefore  that my first sale to campbell had  as its first person narrator  a character named in clifford simak   s honor .   one more point about    trends      in my early sessions with campbell  he had occasionally pointed out the value of having a name that wasn   t odd and hard to pronounce  and suggested the use of a common anglo saxon name as a pseudonym .  on this point  i clearly expressed intransigence .  my name was my name and it would go on my stories .   when    trends    was sold  i steeled myself for what i thought might be a struggle with campbell that might even cost me my precious sale .   it never happened .  perhaps it was because my name had already appeared on two stories in amazing  or perhaps campbell recognized i would not agree to a pseudonym  but he never raised the point .   as it happened  my disinclination for a pseudonym was lucky indeed  for the name isaac asimov proved highly visible .  no one could see the name for the first time without smiling at its oddness  and anyone seeing it the second time would instantly remember the first time .  i   m convinced that at least part of my eventual popularity came about because the readers recognized the name quickly and became aware of my stories as a group .   indeed  matters came full circle .  in later years  i frequently met readers who were convinced the name was a pseudonym designed to achieve visibility and that my real name must be something like john smith .  it was sometimes hard to disabuse them .     while i was revising    trends    for campbell  i was also working on another story     the weapon too dreadful to use .     that one i did not submit to campbell .  either i did not wish to push him too hard immediately after i had made a sale to him  or i suspected the story wasn   t good enough for him and didn   t want to spoil the impression    trends    might have made .  in either case  and i don   t really remember the motive  i decided to try it on amazing first .  it was also a one cent market  after all  and perhaps i thought i owed them another chance  now that i had made my campbell sale .   i mailed    the weapon too dreadful to use    to amazing on february          and on february    received notice of acceptance .  amazing may have bought it because it needed a story in a hurry  for it appeared in the may issue  which reached the newsstands only three weeks after the sale .  that made it my second published story  for it appeared two months before    trends .          the weapon too dreadful to use     karl frantor found the prospect a terribly dismal one .  from low hanging clouds  fell eternal misty rain  squat  rubbery vegetation with its dull  reddish brown colour stretched away in all directions .  now and then a hop scotch bird fluttered wildly above them  emitting plaintive squawks as it went .   karl turned his head to gaze at the tiny dome of aphrodopolis  largest city on venus .      god     he muttered     even the dome is better than this awful world out here .     he pulled the rubberized fabric of his coat closer about him .     i   ll be glad to get back to earth again .      he turned to the slight figure of antil  the venusian     when are we coming to the ruins  antil .      there was no answer and karl noticed the tear that rolled down the venusian   s green  puckered cheeks .  another glistened in the large  lemur like eyes  soft  incredibly beautiful eyes .   the earthman   s voice softened .     sorry  antil  i didn   t mean to say anything against venus .      antil turned his green face toward karl     it was not that  my friend .  naturally  you would not find much to admire in an alien world .  i  however  love venus  and i weep because i am overcome with its beauty .     the words came fluently but with the inevitable distortion caused by vocal cords unfitted for harsh languages .      i know its seems incomprehensible to you     antil continued     but to me venus is a paradise  a golden land i cannot express my feelings for it properly .         yet there are some that say only earthmen can love .     karl   s sympathy was strong and sincere .   the venusian shook his head sadly .     there is much besides the capacity to feel emotion that your people deny us .      karl changed the subject hurriedly .     tell me  antil  doesn   t venus present a dull aspect even to you .  you   ve been to earth and should know .  how can this eternity of brown and grey compare t   the living  warm colours of earth .         it is far more beautiful to me .  you forget that my colour sense is so enormously different from yours .   the venusian eye can distinguish between two tints  the wavelengths of which differ by as little as five angstrom units .  they see thousands of colours to which earthmen are blind .  author .   how can i explain the beauties  the wealth of colour in which this landscape abounds .     he fell silent  lost in the wonders he spoke of  while to the terrestrial the deadly  melancholy grey remained unchanged .      someday     antil   s voice came as from a person in a dream     venus will once more belong to the venusians .  the earthlings shall no longer rule us  and the glory of our ancestors shall return to us .      karl laughed .     come  now  antil  you speak like a member of the green bands  that are giving the government so much trouble .  i thought you didn   t believe in violence .         i don   t  karl     antil   s eyes were grave and rather frightened     but the extremists are gaining power  and i fear the worst .  and if if open rebellion against earth breaks out  i must join them .         but you disagree with them .         yes  of course     he shrugged his shoulders  a gesture he had learned from earthmen     we can gain nothing by violence .  there are five billion of you and scarcely a hundred million of us .  you have resources and weapons while we have none .  it would be a fool   s venture  and even should we win  we might leave such a heritage of hatred that there could never be peace among our two planets .         then why join them .         because i am a venusian .      the earthman burst into laughter again .     patriotism  it seems  is as irrational on venus as on earth .  but come  let us proceed to the ruins of your ancient city .  are we nearly there .         yes     answered antil     it   s a matter of little more than an earth mile now .  remember  however  that you are to disturb nothing .  the ruins of ash taz .  zor are sacred to us  as the sole existing remnant of the time when we  too  were a great race  rather than the degenerate remains of one .      they walked on in silence  slogging through the soft earth beneath  dodging the writhing roots of the snaketree  and giving the occasional tumbling vines they passed a wide berth .   it was antil who resumed the conversation .      poor venus .     his quiet  wistful voice was sad .     fifty years ago the earthman came with promises of peace and plenty and we believed .  we showed them the emerald mines and the juju weed and their eyes glittered with desire .  more and more came  and their arrogance grew .  and now         it   s too bad  antil     karl said     but you really feel too strongly about it .         too strongly .  are we allowed to vote .  have we any representation at all in the venusian provincial congress .  aren   t there laws against venusians riding in the same stratocars as earthlings  or eating in the same hotel  or living in the same house .  are not all colleges closed to us .  aren   t the best and most fertile parts of the planet pre empted by earthlings .  are there any rights at all that terrestrials allow us upon our own planet .         what you say is perfectly true  and i deplore it .  but similar conditions once existed on earth with regard to certain so called    inferior races     and in time  all those disabilities were removed until today total equality reigns .  remember  too  that the intelligent people of earth are on your side .  have i  for instance  ever displayed any prejudice against a venusian .         no  karl  you know you haven   t .  but how many intelligent men are there .  on earth  it took long and weary millennia  filled with war and suffering  before equality was established .  what if venus refuses to wait those millennia .      karl frowned     you   re right  of course  but you must wait what else can you do .         i don   t know i don   t know     antil   s voice trailed into silence .   suddenly  karl wished he hadn   t started on this trip to the ruins of mysterious ash taz zor .  the maddeningly monotonous terrain  the just grievances of antil had served to depress him greatly .  he was about to call the whole thing on when the venusian raised his webbed fingers to point out a mound of earth ahead .      that   s the entrance     he said     ash taz zor has been buried under the soil for uncounted thousands of years  and only venusians know of it .  you   re the first earthman ever to see it .         i shall keep it absolutely secret  antil .  i have promised .         come  then .      antil brushed aside the lush vegetation to reveal a narrow entrance between two boulders and beckoned to karl to follow .  into a narrow  damp corridor they crept .  antil drew from his pouch a small atomite lamp  which cast its pearly white glow upon walls of dripping stone .      these corridors and burrows     he said     were dug three centuries ago by our ancestors who considered the city a holy place .  of late  however  we have neglected it .  i was the first to visit it in a long  long time .  perhaps that is another sign of our degeneracy .      for over a hundred yards they walked on straight ahead  then the corridors flared out into a lofty dome .  karl gasped at the view before him .  there were the remains of buildings  architectural marvels unrivalled on earth since the days of periclean athens .  but all lay in shattered ruins  so that only a hint of the city   s magnificence remained .   antil led the way across the open space and plunged into another burrow that twisted its way for half a mile through soil and rock .  here and there  side corridors branched off  and once or twice karl caught glimpses of ruined structures .  he would have investigated had not antil kept him on the path .   again they emerged  this time before a low  sprawling building constructed of a smooth  green stone .  its right wing was utterly smashed  but the rest seemed scarcely touched .   the venusian   s eyes shone  his slight form straightened with pride .     this is what corresponds to a modern museum of arts and sciences .  in this you shall see the past greatness and culture of venus .        with high excitement  karl entered the first earthman ever to see these ancient achievements .  the interior  he found  was divided into a series of deep alcoves  branching out from the long central colonnade .  the ceiling was one great painting that showed dimly in the light of the atomite lamp .   lost in wonder  the earthman wandered through the alcoves .  there was an extraordinary sense of strangeness to the sculptures and paintings about him  an unearthliness that doubled their beauty .   karl realized that he missed something vital in venusian art simply because of the lack of common ground between his own culture and theirs  but he could appreciate the technical excellence of the work .  especially  did he admire the colour work of the paintings which went far beyond anything he had ever seen on earth .  cracked  faded  and scaling though they were  there was a blending and a harmony about them that was superb .      what wouldn   t michelangelo have given     he said to antil     to have the marvellous colour perception of the venusian eye .      antil inflated his chest with happiness .     every race has its own attributes .  i have often wished my ears could distinguish the slight tones and pitches of sound the way it is said earthmen can .  perhaps i would then be able to understand what it is that is so pleasing about your terrestrial music .  as it is  its noise is dreadfully monotonous to me .      they passed on  and every minute karl   s opinion of venusian culture mounted higher .  there were long  narrow strips of thin metal  bound together  covered with the lines and ovals of venusian script thousands upon thousands of them .  in them  karl knew  might lie such secrets as the scientists of earth would give half their lives to know .   then  when antil pointed out a tiny  six inch high affair  and said that  according to the inscription  it was some type of atomic converter with an efficiency several times any of the current terrestrial models  karl exploded .      why don   t you reveal these secrets to earth .  if they only knew your accomplishments in ages past  venusians would occupy a far higher place than they do now .         they would make use of our knowledge of former days  yes     antil replied bitterly     but they would never release their stranglehold on venus and its people .  i hope you are not forgetting your promise of absolute secrecy .         no  i   ll keep quiet  but i think you   re making a mistake .         i think not     antil turned to leave the alcove  but karl called to him to wait .      aren   t we going into this little room here .     he asked .   antil whirled  eyes staring     room .  what room are you talking about .  there   s no room here .      karl   s eyebrows shot up in surprise as he mutely pointed out the narrow crack that extended half way up the rear wall .   the venusian muttered something beneath his breath and fell to his knees  delicate fingers probing the crack .      help me  karl .  this door was never meant to be opened  i think .  at least there is no record of its being here  and i know the ruins of ash taz zor perhaps better than any other of my people .      the two pushed against the section of the wall  which gave backward with groaning reluctance for a short distance  then yielded suddenly so as to catapult them into the tiny  almost empty cubicle beyond .  they regained their feet and stared about .     the earthman pointed out broken  ragged rust streaks on the floor  and along the line where door joined wall .     your people seem to have sealed this room up pretty effectively .  only the rust of eons broke the bonds .  you   d think they had some sort of secret stored here .      antil shook his green head .     there was no evidence of a door last time i was here .  however     he raised the atomite lamp up high and surveyed the room rapidly     there doesn   t seem to be anything here  anyway .      he was right .  aside from a nondescript oblong chest that squatted on six stubby legs  the place contained only unbelievable quantities of dust and the musty  almost suffocating smell of long shut up tombs .   karl approached the chest  tried to move it from the corner where it stood .  it didn   t budge  but the cover slipped under his pressing fingers .      the cover   s removable  antil .  look .     he pointed to a shallow compartment within  which contained a square slab of some glassy substance and five six inch long cylinders resembling fountain pens .   antil shrieked with delight when he saw these objects and for the first time since karl knew him  lapsed into sibilant venusian gibberish .  he removed the glassy slab and inspected it closely .  karl  his curiosity aroused  did likewise .  it was covered with closely spaced  varicoloured dots  but there seemed no reason for antil   s extreme glee .      what is it  antil .         it is a complete document in our ancient ceremonial language .  up to now we have never had more than disjointed fragments .  this is a great find .         can you decipher it .     karl regarded the object with more respect .      i think i can .  it is a dead language and i know little more than a smattering .  you see  it is a colour language .  each word is designated by a combination of two  and sometimes three  coloured dots .  the colours are finely differentiated  though  and a terrestrial  even if he had the key to the language  would have to use a spectroscope to read it .         can you work on it now .         i think so  karl .  the atomite lamp approximates normal daylight very closely  and i ought to have no trouble with it .  however  it may take me quite a time  so perhaps you   d better continue your investigation .  there   s no danger of your getting lost  provided you remain inside this building .      karl left  taking a second atomite lamp with him  left antil  the venusian  bent over the ancient manuscript  deciphering it slowly and painfully .     two hours passed before the earthman returned  but when he did  anti .  had scarcely changed his position .  yet  now  there was a look of horror on the venusian   s face that had not been there before .  the    colour    message lay at his feet  disregarded .  the noisy entrance of the earthman made no impression    upon him .  as if ossified  he sat in unmoving  staring fright .   karl jumped to his side .     antil  antil  what   s wrong .      antil   s head turned slowly  as though moving through viscous liquid  and his eyes gazed unseeingly at his friend .  karl grasped the other   s thin shoulders and shook him unmercifuily .   the venusian came to his senses .  writhing out of karl   s grasp he sprang to his feet .  from the desk in the corner he removed the five cylindrical objects  handling them with a queer sort of reluctance  placing them in his pouch .  there  likewise  did he put the slab he had deciphered .   having done this  he replaced the cover on the chest and motioned karl out of the room .     we must go now .  already we have stayed too long .     his voice had an odd  frightened tone about it that made the earthman uncomfortable .   silently  they retraced their steps until once more they stood    upon the soaked surface of venus .  it was still day  but twilight was near .  karl felt a growing hunger .  they would need to hurry if they expected to reach aphrodopolis before the coming of night .  karl turned up the collar of his slicker  pulled his rubberized cap low over his forehead and set out     mile after mile passed by and the domed city once more rose upon the grey horizon .  the earthman chewed at damp ham sandwiches  wished fervently for the comfortable dryness of aphrodopolis .  through it all  the normally friendly venusian maintained a stony silence  vouchsafing not so much as a glance upon his companion .   karl accepted this philosophically .  he had a far higher regard for venusians than the great majority of earthmen  but even he experienced a faint disdain for the ultra emotional character of antil and his kind .  this brooding silence was but a manifestation of feelings that in karl would perhaps have resulted in no more than a sigh or a frown .  realizing this  antil   s mood scarcely affected him .   yet the memory of the haunting fright in antil   s eyes aroused a faint unease .  it had come after the translation of that queer slab .  what secret could have been revealed in that message by those scientific progenitors of the venusians .   it was with some diffidence that karl finally persuaded himself to ask     what did the slab say  antil .  it must be interesting  i judge  considering that you   ve taken it with you .      antil   s reply was simply a sign to hurry  and the venusian thereupon plunged into the gathering darkness with redoubled speed .  karl was puzzled and rather hurt .  he made no further attempt at conversation for the duration of the trip .   when they reached aphrodopolis  however  the venusian broke his silence .  his puckered face  drawn and haggard  turned to karl with the expression of one who has come to a painful decision .      karl     he said     we have been friends  so i wish to give you a bit of friendly advice .  you are going to leave for earth next week .  i know your father is high in the councils of the planetary president .  you yourself will probably be a personage of importance in the not too distant future .  since this is so  i beg you earnestly to use every atom of your influence to a moderation of earth   s attitude toward venus .  i  in my turn  being a hereditary noble of the largest tribe on venus  shall do my utmost to repress all attempts at violence .      the other frowned .     there seems to be something behind all this .  i don   t get it at all .  what are you trying to say .         just this .  unless conditions are bettered and soon  venus will rise in revolt .  in that case  i will have no choice but to place my services at her feet  and then venus will no longer be defenceless .      these words served only to amuse the earthman .     come  antil  your patriotism is admirable  and your grievances justified  but melodrama and chauvinism don   t go with me .  i am  above all  a realist .      there was a terrible earnestness in the venusian   s voice .     believe me  karl  when i say nothing is more real than what i tell you now .  in case of a venusian revolt  i cannot vouch for earth   s safety .         earth   s safety .     the enormity of this stunned karl .      yes     continued antil     for i may be forced to destroy earth .  there you have it .     with this  he wheeled and plunged into the underbrush on the way back to the little venusian village outside the great dome .     five years passed years of turbulent unrest  and venus stirred in its sleep like an awakening volcano .  the shortsighted terrestrial masters of aphrodopolis  venusia  and other domed cities cheerfully disregarded all danger signals .  when they thought of the little green venusians at all  it was with a disdainful grimace as if to say     oh  those things .      but    those things    were finally pushed beyond endurance  and the nationalistic green bands became increasingly vociferous with every passing day .  then  on one grey day  not unlike the grey days preceding  crowds of natives swarmed upon the cities in organized rebellion .   the smaller domes  caught by surprise  succumbed .  in rapid succession new washington  mount vulcan  and st .  denis were taken  together with the entire eastern continent  before the reeling terrestrials realized what was happening  half of venus was no longer theirs .   earth  shocked and stunned by this sudden emergency  which  of course  should have been foreseen sent arms and supplies to the inhabitants of the remaining beleaguered towns and began to equip a great space fleet for the recovery of the lost territory .   earth was annoyed but not frightened  knowing that ground lost by surprise could easily be regained at leisure  and that ground not now lost would never be lost .  or such  at least  was the belief .   imagine  then  the stupefaction of earth   s leaders as no pause came in the venusian advance .  venusia city had been amply stocked with weapons and food  her outer defences were up  the men at their posts .  a tiny army of naked  unarmed natives approached and demanded unconditional surrender .  venusia refused haughtily  and the messages to earth were mirthful in their references to the unarmed natives who had become so recklessly flushed with success .   then  suddenly  no more messages were received  and the natives took over venusia .   the events at venusia were duplicated  over and over again  at what should have been impregnable fortresses .  even aphrodopolis itself  with half a million population  fell to a pitiful five hundred venusians .  this  in spite of the fact that every weapon known to earth was available to the defenders .   the terrestrial government suppressed the facts  and earth itself remained unsuspecting of the strange events on venus  but in the inner councils  statesmen frowned as they listened to the strange words of karl frantor  son of the minister of education .     jan heersen  minister of war  rose in anger at the conclusion of the report .      do you wish us to take seriously the random statement of a half mad greenie and make our peace with venus on its own terms .  that is definitely and absolutely impossible .  what those damned beasts need is the mailed fist .  our fleet will blast them out of the universe  and it is time that it were done .         the blasting may not be so simple  heersen     said the gray haired  elder frantor  rushing to his son   s defence .     there are many of us who have all along claimed that the government policy toward the venusians was all wrong .  who knows what means of attack they have found and what  in revenge  they will do with it .         fairy tales .     exclaimed heersen .     you treat the greenies as if they were people .  they   re animals and should be thankful for the benefits of civilization we brought them .  remember  we   re treating them much better than some of our own earth races were treated in our early history  the red indians for example .      karl frantor burst in once more in an agitated voice .     we must investigate  sirs .  antil   s threat is too serious to disregard  no matter how silly it sounds and in the light of the venusian conquests  it sounds anything but silly .  i propose that you send me with admiral von blumdorff  as a sort of envoy .  let me get to the bottom of this before we attack them .      the saturnine earth president  jules debuc  spoke now for the first time .     frantor   s proposal is reasonable  at least .  it shall be done .  are there any objections .      there were none  though heersen scowled and snorted angrily .  thus  a week later  karl frantor accompanied the space armada of earth when it set off for the inner planet .     it was a strange venus that greeted karl after his five years    absence .  it was still its old soaking self  its old dreary  monotony of white and grey  its scattering of domed cities and yet how different .   where before the haughty terrestrials had moved in disdainful splendour among the cowering venusians  now the natives maintained undisputed sway .  aphrodopolis was a native city entirely  and in the office of the former governor sat  antil .   karl eyed him doubtfully  scarcely knowing what to say .     i rather thought you might be king pin     he managed at length .     you the pacifist .         the choice was not mine .  it was that of circumstance     antil replied .     but you  i did not expect you to be your planet   s spokesman .         it was to me that you made your silly threat years ago  and so it is i who was most pessimistic concerning your rebellion .  i come  you see  but not unaccompanied .     his hand motioned vaguely upward  where spaceships lazed motionless and threatening .      you come to menace me .         no .  to hear your aims and your terms .         that is easily accomplished .  venus demands its independence and we promise friendship  together with free and unrestricted trade .         and you expect us to accept all that without a struggle .         i hope you do for earth   s own sake .      karl scowled and threw himself back in his chair in annoyance     for god   s sake  antil  the time for mysterious hints and bogies has passed .  show your hand .  how did you overcome aphrodopolis and the other cities so easily .         we were forced to it  karl .  we did not desire it .     antil   s voice was shrill with agitation .     they would not accept our fair terms of surrender and began to shoot their tonite guns .  we we had to use the the weapon .  we had to kill most of them afterward out of mercy .         i don   t follow .  what weapon are you talking about .         do you remember that time in the ruins of ash tai wr  karl .  the hidden room  the ancient inscription  the five little rods .      karl nodded sombrely .     i thought so  but i wasn   t sure .         it was a horrible weapon  karl .     antil hurried on as if the mere thought of it were not to be endured .     the ancients discovered it but never used it .  they hid it instead  and why they did not destroy it  i can   t imagine .  i wish they had destroyed it  i really do .  but they didn   t and i found it and i must use it for the good of venus .      his voice sank to a whisper  but with a manifest effort he nerved himself to the task of explanation .     the little harmless rods you saw then  karl  were capable of producing a force field of some unknown nature  the ancients wisely refused to be explicit there  which has the power of disconnecting brain from mind .         what .     karl stared in open mouthed surprise .     what are you talking about .         why  you must know that the brain is merely the seat of the mind  and not the mind itself .  the nature of    mind    is a mystery  unknown even to our ancients  but whatever it is  it uses the brain as its intermediary to the world of matter .         i see .  and your weapon divorces mind from brain  renders mind helpless a space pilot without his controls .      antil nodded solemnly .     have you ever seen a decerebrated animal .     he asked suddenly .      why  yes  a dog in my bio course back in college .         come  then  i will show you a decerebrated human .        karl followed the venusian to an elevator .  as he shot downward to the lowest level the prison level his mind was in a turmoil .  tom between horror and fury  he had alternate impulses of unreasoning desire to escape and almost insuperable yearnings to slay the venusian at his side .  in a daze  he left the cubicle and followed antil down a gloomy corridor  winding its way between rows of tiny  barred cells .   there .     antil   s voice roused karl as would a sudden stream of cold water .  he followed the pointing webbed hand and stared in fascinated revulsion at the human figure revealed .   it was human  undoubtedly  in form but inhuman  nevertheless .  it  karl could not imagine it as    he     sat dumbly on the floor  large staring eyes never leaving the blank wall before him .  eyes that were empty of soul  loose lips from which saliva drooled  fingers that moved aimlessly .  nauseated  karl turned his head hastily .      he is not exactly decerebrated .     antil   s voice was low .     organically  his brain is perfect and unharmed .  it is merely  disconnected .         how does it live  antil .  why doesn   t it die .         because the autonomic system is untouched .  stand him up and he will remain balanced .  push him and he will regain his balance .  his heart beats .  he breathes .  if you put food in his mouth  he will swallow  though he would die of starvation before performing the voluntary act of eating food that has been placed before him .  it is life of a sort  but it were better dead  for the disconnection is permanent .         it is horrible horrible .         it is worse than you think .  i feel convinced that somewhere within the shell of humanity  the mind  unharmed  still exists .  imprisoned helplessly in a body it cannot control  what must be that mind   s torture .      karl stiffened suddenly .     you shan   t overcome earth by sheer unspeakable brutality .  it is an unbelievably cruel weapon but no more deadly than any of a dozen of ours .  you shall pay for this .         please  karl  you have no conception of one millionth of the deadliness of the    disconnection field    .  the field is independent of space  and perhaps of time  too  so that its range can be extended almost indefinitely .  do you know that it required merely one discharge of the weapon to render every warm blooded creature in aphrodopolis helpless .     antil   s voice rose tensely .     do you know that i am able to bathe all earth in the field to render all your teeming billions the duplicate of that dead alive hulk in there at one stroke .      karl did not recognize his own voice as he rasped     fiend .  are you the only one who knows the secret of this damnable field .      antil burst into a hollow laugh     yes  karl  the blame rests on me  alone .  yet killing me will not help .  if i die  there are others who know where to find the inscription  others who have not my sympathy for earth .  i am perfectly safe from you  karl  for my death would be the end of your world .      the earthman was broken utterly .  not a fragment of doubt as to the venusian   s power was left within him .     i yield     he muttered     i yield .  what shall i tell my people .         tell them of my terms  and of what i could do if i wished .      karl shrank from the venusian as if his very touch was death     i will tell them that .         tell them also  that venus is not vindictive .  we do not wish to use our weapon  for it it too dreadful to use .  if they will give us our independence on our own terms  and allow us certain wise precautions against future re enslavement  we will hurl each of our five guns and the explanatory inscription explaining it into the sun .      the terrestrial   s voice did not change from its toneless whisper .     i will tell them that .        admiral von blumdorff was as prussian as his name  and his military code was the simple one of brute force .  so it was quite natural that his reactions to karl   s report were explosive in their sarcastic derision .      you forsaken fool     he raved at the young man .     this is what comes of talk  of words  of tomfoolery .  you dare come back to me with this old wives    tale of mysterious weapons  of untold force .  without any proof at all  you accept all that this damned greenie tells you at absolute face value  and surrender abjectly .  couldn   t you threaten  couldn   t you bluff  couldn   t you lie .         he didn   t threaten  bluff  or lie     karl answered warmly .     what he said was the gospel truth .  if you had seen the decerebrated man         bah .  that is the most inexcusable part of the whole cursed business .  to exhibit a lunatic to you  some perfectly normal mental defective  and to say     this is our weapon .     and for you to accept that without question .  did they do anything but talk .  did they demonstrate the weapon .  did they even show it to you .         naturally not .  the weapon is deadly .  they   re not going to kill a venusian to satisfy me .  as for showing me the weapon  well  would you show your ace in the hole to the enemy .  now you answer me a few questions .  why is antil so cocksure of himself .  how did he conquer all venus so easily .         i can   t explain it i admit  but does that prove that theirs is the correct explanation .  anyhow  i   m sick of this talk .  we   re attacking now  and to hell with theories .  i   ll face them with tonite projectiles and you can watch their bluff backfire in their ugly faces .         but  admiral  you must communicate my report to the president .         i will after i blow aphrodopolis into kingdom come .      he turned on the central broadcasting unit .     attention  all ships .  battle formation .  we dive at aphrodopolis with all tonites blasting in fifteen minutes .     then he turned to the orderly .     have captain larsen inform aphrodopolis that they have fifteen minutes to hoist the white flag .      the minutes that ticked by after that were tense and nervewracking for karl frantor .  he sat in bent silence  head buried in his hands and the faint click of the chronometer at the end of every minute sounded like a thunder clap in his ears .  he counted those clicks in a mumbling whisper        .  god .   only five minutes to certain death .  or was it certain death .  was von blumdorff right .  were the venusians putting over a daring bluff .   an orderly catapulted into the room and saluted .     the greenies have just answered  sir .         well     von blumdorff leaned forward eagerly .      they say     urgently request fleet not to attack .  if done  we shall not be responsible for the consequences .            is that all .     came the outraged shout     yes  sir .      the admiral burst into a sulphurous stream of profanity .     why  the infernal gall of them     he shouted .     they dare bluff to the very end .      and as he finished  the fifteenth minute clicked off  and the mighty armada burst into motion .  in streaking  orderly flight they shot down toward the cloudy shroud of the second planet .  von blumdorff grinned in a grisly appreciation of the awesome view spread over the televisor until the mathematically precise battle formation suddenly broke .     the admiral stared and rubbed his eyes .  the entire further half of the fleet had suddenly gone crazy .  first  the ships wavered  then they veered and shot off at mad angles .   then calls came in from the sane half of the fleet reports that the left wing had ceased to respond to radio .   the attack on aphrodopolis was immediately disrupted as the order went out to capture the ships that had run amok .  von blumdorff stamped up and down and tore his hair .  karl frantor cried out dully     it is their weapon     and lapsed back into his former silence .   from aphrodopolis came no word at all .   for two solid hours the remnant of the terrestrial fleet battled their own ships .  following the aimless courses of the stricken vessels  they approached and grappled .  bound together then by rigid force  rocket blasts were applied until the insane flight of the others had been balanced and stopped   fully twenty of the fleet were never caught  some continuing on some orbit about the sun  some shooting off into unknown space  a few crashing down to venus .   when the remaining ships of the left wing were boarded  the unsuspecting boarding parties stopped short in horror .  seventy five staring witless shells of humanity in each ship .  not a single human being left .   some of the first to enter screamed in horror and fled in a panic .  others merely retched and turned away their eyes .  one officer took in the situation at a glance  calmly drew his atomo pistol and rayed every decerebrate in sight .   admiral von blumdorff was a stricken man  a pitiful  limp wreck of his former proud and blustering self  when he heard the worst .  one of the decerebrates was brought to him  and he reeled back .   karl frantor gazed at him with red rimmed eyes     well  admiral  are you satisfied .      but the admiral made no answer .  he drew his gun  and before anyone could stop him  shot himself through the head .     once again karl frantor stood before a meeting of the president and his cabinet  before a dispirited  frightened group of men .  his report was definite and left no doubt as to the course that must now be followed .   president debuc stared at the decerebrate brought in as an exhibit .     we are finished     he said .     we must surrender unconditionally  throw ourselves upon their mercy .  but someday      his eyes kindled in retribution .      no  mr .  president .     karl   s voice rang out     there shall be no someday .  we must give the venusians their simple due  liberty and independence .  bygones must be bygones our dead have but paid for the half century of venusian slavery .  after this  there must be a new order in the solar system  the birth of a new day .      the president lowered his head in thought and then raised it again .     you are right     he answered with decision     there shall be no thought of revenge .      two months later the peace treaty was signed and venus became what it has remained ever since an independent and sovereign power .  and with the signing of the treaty  a whirling speck shot out toward the sun .  it was the weapon too dreadful to use .     the end    amazing stories was  at that time  heavily slanted toward adventure and action and disapproved of too much scientific exposition in the course of the story .  i  of course  even then was writing the kind of science fiction that involved scientific extrapolation that was specifically described .  what raymond palmer did in this case was to omit some of my scientific discussion and to place in footnotes a condensed version of passages that he could not omit without damaging the plot .  this was an extraordinarily inept device  at which i chafed at the time .  i took the only retaliation available to me .  i placed amazing at the bottom of the list  as far as the order in which to submit stories was concerned .     what i remember most clearly about the story  though  is fred pohl   s remark concerning it .  the story ends with earth and venus at peace  with earth promising to respect venus    independence and venus destroying its weapon .  fred said  upon reading the published story     and after the weapon was destroyed  earth wiped the venusians off the face of their planet .      he was quite right .  i was naive enough then to suppose that words and good intentions are sufficient .   fred also remarked that the weapon that was too dreadful to be used was  in fact  used .  he was right in that case  too  and that helped sour me on titles that were too long and elaborate .  i have tended toward shorter titles since  even one word titles  something campbell consistently encouraged  perhaps because short titles fit better on the cover and on the title page of a magazine .      if i thought that my sale to campbell had made me an expert in knowing what he wanted and in being able to supply that want  i was quite wrong .  in february      i wrote a story called    the decline and fall .     i submitted it to campbell on february    and it was back in my lap  quite promptly  on the twenty fifth .  it made the rounds thereafter without results and was never published .  it no longer exists and i remember nothing at all about it .     on march          i began my most ambitious writing project to that date .  it was a novelette  in which i named an important character after russell winterbotham  that was intended to be at least twice as long as any of my previous stories .  i called the story    pilgrimage .     it was my first attempt to write    future history     that is  a tale about a far future time written as though it were a historical novel .  i was also my first attempt to write a story on a galactic scale .   i was very excited while working at it and felt somehow that it was an    epic .      i remember  though  that winterbotham was rather dubious about it when i described the plot to him in a letter .   i brought it in to campbell on march           with high hopes  but it was back on the twenty fourth with a letter that said     you have a basic idea which might be made into an interesting yarn  but as it is  it is not strong enough .      this time i would not let go .  i was in to see campbell again on the twenty seventh and talked him into letting me revise it in order to strengthen the weaknesses he found in it .  i brought in the second version on april     and it  too  was found wanting  but this time it was campbell who asked for a revision .  i tried again and the third version was submitted on may   and rejected on the seventeenth .  campbell admitted there was still the possibility of saving it  but  after three tries  he said  i should put it to one side for some months and then look at it from a fresh viewpoint .   i did as he said and waited two months  the minimum time i could interpret as    some months     and brought in the fourth version on august   .   this time  campbell hesitated over it till september    and then rejected it permanently on the ground that robert a .  heinlein had just submitted an important short novel  later published as    if this goes on      that had a religious theme .  since    pilgrimage    also had a religious theme  john couldn   t use it .  two stories on so sensitive a subject in rapid succession were one too many .   i had written the story four times  but i saw campbell   s point .  campbell said heinlein   s story was the better of the two and i could see that an editor could scarcely be expected to take the worse and reject the better simply because writing the worse had been such hard work .   there was nothing  however  to prevent me from trying to sell it elsewhere .  i kept trying for two years  during which time i rewrote it twice more and retitled it    galactic crusade .      eventually i sold it to another of the magazines that were springing up in the wake of campbell   s success with astounding .  this was planet stories  which during the     s was to make its mark as a home for the    space opera     the blood and thunder tale of interplanetary war .  my story was of this type  and the editor of planet  malcolm reiss  was attracted .   the religious angle worried him  too  however .  would i go through the story  he asked during luncheon on august           and remove any direct reference to religion .  would i  in particular  refrain from referring to any of my characters as    priests .     sighing  i agreed  and the story was revised for a sixth time .  on october          he accepted it and  after two and a half years that included ten rejections  the story was finally placed .   but  having put me to the trouble of that particular remove the religion revision  what did reiss do .  why  he retitled it  without consulting me  of course  and called the story    black friar of the flame .      i might mention two points about this story before presenting it .   first  it was the only story i ever sold to planet .   second  it was illustrated by frank r .  paul .  paul was the most prominent of all the science fiction illustrators of the pre campbell era  and  to the best of my knowledge  this is the only time our paths crossed professionally .   i did see him once from a distance  though .  on july          i attended the first world science fiction convention  which was held in manhattan .  frank paul was guest of honor .  it was the first occasion on which i was publicly recognized as a professional  rather than as merely a fan .  with three published stories under my belt     trends    had just appeared  i was pushed up to the platform to take a bow .  campbell was sitting in an aisle seat and he waved me toward the platform delightedly  i remember .   i said a few words  referring to myself as the    worst science fiction writer unlynched .     i didn   t mean it  of course  and i doubt that anyone thought for a moment that i did .       black friar of the flame     russell tymball   s eyes were filled with gloomy satisfaction as they gazed at the blackened ruins of what had been a cruiser of the lhasinuic fleet a few hours before .  the twisted girders  scattered in all directions  were ample witness of the terrific force of the crash .   the pudgy earthman re entered his own sleek strato rocket and waited .  fingers twisted a long cigar aimlessly for minutes before lighting it .  through the up drifting smoke  his eyes narrowed and he remained lost in thought  he came to his feet at the sound of a cautious hail .  two men darted in with one last fugitive glance behind them .  the door closed softly  and one stepped immediately to the controls .  the desolate desert landscape was far beneath them almost at once  and the silver prow of the strato rocket pointed for the ancient metropolis of new york .   minutes passed before tymball spoke     all clear .      the man at the controls nodded .     not a tyrant ship about .  it   s quite evident the    grahul    had not been able to radio for help .         you have the dispatch .     the other asked eagerly .      we found it easily enough .  it is unharmed .         we also found     said the second man bitterly     one other thing the last report of sidi peller .      for a moment  tymball   s round face softened and something almost like pain entered his expression .  and then it hardened again     he died .  but it was for earth  and so it was not death .  it was martyrdom .      silence  and then sadly     let me see the report  petri .      he took the single  folded sheet handed him and held it before him .  slowly  he read aloud      on september    made successful entry into    grahul    cruiser of the tyrant fleet .  maintained self in hiding during passage from pluto to earth .  on september    located dispatch in question and assumed possession .  have just shorted rocket jets .  am sealing this report in with dispatch .  long live earth .      tymball   s voice was strangely moved as he read the last word .     the lhasinuic tyrants have never martyrized a greater man than sidi peller .  but we   ll be repaid  and with interest the human race is not quite decadent yet .      petri stared out the window .     how did peller do it all .  one man to stow away successfully upon a cruiser of the fleet and in the face of the entire crew to steal the dispatch and wreck the fleet .  how was it done .  and we   ll never know  except for the bare facts in his report .         he had his orders        said willums  as he locked controls and turned about .     i carried them to him on pluto myself .  get the dispatch .  wreck the    grahul    in the gobi .  he did it .  that   s all .     he shrugged his shoulders wearily .   the atmosphere of depression deepened until tymball himself broke it was a growl .     forget it .  did you take care of everything at the wreck .      the other two nodded in unison .  petri   s voice was businesslike     all traces of peller were removed and de atomized .  they will never detect the presence of a human among the wreckage .  the document itself was replaced by the prepared copy  and carefully burnt beyond recognition .  it was even impregnated with silver salts to the exact amount contained in the official seal of the tyrant emperor .  i   ll stake my head that no lhasinu will suspect that the crash was no accident or that the dispatch was not destroyed by it .         good .  they won   t locate the wreck for twenty four hours at least .  it   s an airtight job .  let me have the dispatch now .      he fondled the metalloid container almost with reverence .  it was blackened and twisted  still faintly warm .  and then with a savage twist of the wrist  he tore off the lid .   the document that he lifted out unrolled with a rustling sound .  at the lower left hand corner was the huge silver seal of the lhasinuic emperor himself the tyrant  who from vega  ruled one third of the galaxy .  it was addressed to the viceroy of sol .   the three earthmen regarded the fine print solemnly .  the harshly angular lhasinuic script glinted redly in the rays of the setting sun .      was i right .     whispered tymball .      as always     assented petri .     night did not really fall .  the sky   s black purple deepened ever so slightly and the stars brightened imperceptibly  but aside from that the stratosphere did not differentiate between the absence and the presence of the sun .      have you decided upon the next step .     asked willums  hesitantly .      yes long ago .  i   m going to visit paul kane tomorrow  with this     and he indicated the dispatch .      loara paul kane .     cried petri .      that that loarist .     came simultaneously from willums .     the loarist     agreed tymball .     he is our man .         say rather that he is the lackey of the lhasinu     ground out willums .     kane the head of loarism consequently the head of the traitor humans who preach submission to the lhasinu .         that   s right     petri was pale but more calm .     the lhasinu are our known enemies and are to be met in fair fight but the loarists are vermin .  great space .  i would rather throw myself on the mercy of the tyrant viceroy himself than have anything to do with those snuffling students of ancient history  who praise the ancient glory of earth and encompass its present degradation .         you judge too harshly .     there was the trace of a smile about tymball   s lips .     i have had dealings with this leader of loarism before .  oh     he checked the cries of startled dismay that rose     i was quite discreet about it .  even you two didn   t know  and  as you see  kane has not yet betrayed me .  i failed in those dealings  but i learned a little bit .  listen to me .      petri and willums edged nearer  and tymball continued in crisp  matter of fact tones     the first galactic drive of the lhasinu ended two thousand years ago just after the capture of earth .  since then  the aggression has not been resumed  and the independent human planets of the galaxy are quite satisfied at the maintenance of the status quo .  they are too divided among themselves to welcome a return of the struggle .  loarism itself is only interested in its own survival against the encroachments of newer ways of thought  and it is no great moment to them whether lhasinu or human rules earth as long as loarism itself prospers .  as a matter of fact  we the nationalists are perhaps a greater danger to them in that respect than the lhasinu .      willums smiled grimly     i   ll say we are .         then  granting that  it is natural that loarism assume the role of appeasement .  yet  if it were to their interests  they would join us at a second   s notice .  and this     he slapped the document before him     is what will convince them where their interests lie .      the other two were silent .   tymball continued     our time is short .  not more than three years  perhaps not more than two .  and yet you know what the chances of success for a rebellion today are .         we   d do it     snarled petri  and then in a muffled tone     if the only lhasinu we had to deal with were those of earth .         exactly .  but they can call upon vega for help  and we can call upon no one .  no one of the human planets would stir in our defense  any more than they did five hundred years ago .  and that   s why we must have loarism on our side .         and what did loarism do five hundred years ago during the bloody rebellion .     asked willums  bitter hatred in his voice .     they abandoned us to save their own precious hides .         we are in no position to remember that     said tymball .     we will have their help now and then  when all is over  our reckoning with them      willums returned to the controls     new york in fifteen minutes .     and then     but i still don   t like it .  what can those filthy loarists do .  dried out husks fit for nothing but treason and platitudes .         they are the last unifying force of humanity     answered tymball .     weak enough now and helpless enough  but earth   s only chance .      they were slanting downwards now into the thicker  lower atmosphere  and the whistling of the air as it streamed past them became shriller in pitch .  willums fired the braking rockets as they pierced a gray layer of clouds .  there upon the horizon was the great diffuse glow of new york city .      see that our passes are in perfect order for the lhasinuic inspection and hide the document .  they won   t search us  anyway .        loara paul kane leaned back in his ornate chair .  the slender fingers of one hand played with the ivory paperweight upon his desk .  his eyes avoided those of the smaller  rounder man before him  and his voice  as he spoke  took on solemn inflections .      i cannot risk shielding you longer  tymball .  i have done so until now because of the bond of common humanity between us  but     his voice trailed away .      but .     prompted tymball .   kane   s fingers turned his paperweight over and over .     the lhasinu are growing harsher this past year .  they are almost arrogant .     he looked up suddenly .     i am not quite a free agent  you know  and haven   t the influence and power you seem to think i have .      his eyes dropped again  and a troubled note entered his voice     the lhasinu suspect .  they are beginning to detect the workings of a tightly knit conspiracy underground  and we cannot afford to become entangled in it .         i know .  if necessary  you are quite willing to sacrifice us as your predecessor sacrificed the patriots five centuries ago .  once again  loarism shall play its noble part .         what good are your rebellions .     came the weary reply .     are the lhasinu so much more terrible than the oligarchy of humans that rules santanni or the dictator that rules trantor .  if the lhasinu are not human  they are at least intelligent loarism must live at peace with the rulers .      and now tymball smiled .  there was no humor in it  rather mocking irony  and from his sleeve  he drew forth a small card .      you think so  do you .  here  read this .  it is a reduced photostat of no  don   t touch it read it as   hold it  and      his further remarks were drowned in the sudden hoarse cry from the other .  kane   s face twisted alarmingly into a mask of horror  as he snatched desperately at the reproduction held out to him .      where did you get this .     he scarcely recognized his own voice .      what odds .  i have it  haven   t i .  and yet it cost the life of a brave man  and a ship of his reptilian eminence   s navy .  i believe you can see that there is no doubt as to the genuineness of this .         no no .     kane put a shaking hand to his forehead .     that is the emperor   s signature and seal .  it is impossible to forge them .         you see .  excellency     there was sarcasm in the title     the renewal of the galactic drive is a matter of two years or three in the future .  the first step in the drive comes within the year and it is concerning that first step     his voice took on a poisonous sweetness     that this order has been issued to the viceroy .         let me think a second .  let me think .     kane dropped into his chair .      is there the necessity .     cried tymball  remorselessly .     this is nothing but the fulfillment of my prediction of six months ago  to which you would not listen .  earth  as a human world  is to be destroyed  its population scattered in groups throughout the lhasinuic portions of the galaxy  every trace of human occupancy destroyed .         but earth  earth  the home of the human race  the beginning of our civilization .         exactly .  loarism is dying and the destruction of earth will kill it and with loarism gone  the last unifying force is destroyed  and the human planets  invincible when united  shall be wiped out  one by one  in the second galactic drive .  unless      the other   s voice was toneless .      i know what you   re going to say .         no more than i said before .  humanity must unite  and can do so only about loarism .  it must have a cause for which to fight  and that cause must be the liberation of earth .  i shall fire the spark here on earth and you must convert the human portion of the galaxy into a powder keg .         you wish a total war a galactic crusade     kane spoke in a whisper     yet who should know better than i that a total war has been impossible for these thousand years .     he laughed suddenly  harshly     do you know how weak loarism is today .         nothing is so weak that it cannot be strengthened .  although loarism has weakened since its great days during the first galactic drive  you still have your organization and your discipline  the best in the galaxy .  and your leaders are  as a whole  capable men  i must say that for you .  a thoroughly centralized group of capable men  working desperately  can do much .  it must do much  for it has no choice .         leave me     said kane  brokenly     i can do no more now .  i must think .     his voice trailed away  but one finger pointed toward the door .      what good are thoughts .     cried tymball  irritably .     we need deeds .     and with that  he left .     the night had been a horrible one for kane .  his face was pale and drawn  his eyes hollow and feverishly brilliant .  yet he spoke loudly and firmly .      we are allies  tymball .      tymball smiled bleakly  took kane   s outstretched hand for a moment  and dropped it     by necessity .  excellency  only .  i am not your friend .         nor i yours .  yet we may work together .  my initial orders have gone out and the central council will ratify them .  in that direction  at least  i anticipate no trouble .         how quickly may i expect results .         who knows .  loarism still has its facilities for propaganda .  there are still those who will listen from respect and others from fear  and still others from the mere force of the propaganda itself .  but who can say .  humanity has slept  and loarism as well .  there is little anti lhasinuic feeling  and it will be hard to drum it up out of nothing .         hate is never hard to drum up     and tymball   s moon face seemed oddly harsh .     emotionalism .  propaganda .  frank and unscrupulous opportunism .  and even in its weakened state  loarism is rich .  the masses may be corrupted by words  but those in high places  the important ones  will require a bit of the yellow metal .      kane waved a weary hand     you preach nothing new .  that line of dishonor was human policy far back in the misty dawn of history when only this poor earth was human and even it split into warring segments .     then  bitterly     to think that we must return to the tactics of that barbarous age .      the conspirator shrugged his shoulders cynically     do you know any better .         and even so  with all that foulness  we may yet fail .         not if our plans are well laid .      loara paul kane rose to his feet and his hands clenched before him     fool .  you and your plans .  your subtle  secret  snaky  tortuous plans .  do you think that conspiracy is rebellion  or rebellion  victory .  what can you do .  you can ferret out information and dig quietly at the roots  but you can   t lead a rebellion .  i can organize and prepare  but i can   t lead a rebellion .      tymball winced     preparation perfect preparation          is nothing  i tell you .  you can have every chemical ingredient necessary  and all the proper conditions  and yet there may be no reaction .  in psychology particularly mob psychology as in chemistry  one must have a catalyst .         what in space do you mean .         can you lead a rebellion .     cried kane .     a crusade is a war of emotion .  can you control the emotions .  why  you conspirator  you could not stand the light of open warfare an instant .  can i lead the rebellion .  i  old and a man of peace .  then who is to be the leader  the psychological catalyst  that can take the dull worthless clay of your precious    preparation    and breathe life into it .      russell tymball   s jaw muscles quivered     defeatism .  so soon .      the answer was harsh     no .  realism .      there was angry silence and tymball turned on his heel and left .     it was midnight  ship time  and the evening   s festivities were reaching their high point .  the grand salon of the superliner flaming nova was filled with whirling  laughing  glittering figures  growing more convivial as the night wore on .      this reminds me of the triply damned affairs my wife makes me attend back on lacto     muttered sammel maronni to his companion .     i thought i   d be getting away from some of it  at least out here in hyperspace  but evidently i didn   t .     he groaned softly and gazed at the assemblage with a faintly disapproving stare .   maronni was dressed in the peak of fashion  from purple headsash to sky blue sandals  and looked exceedingly uncomfortable .  his portly figure was crammed into a brilliantly red and terribly tight tunic and the occasional jerks at his wide belt showed that he was only too conscious of its ill fit .   his companion  taller and slimmer  bore his spotless white uniform with an ease born of long experience  and his imposing figure contrasted strongly with the slightly ridiculous appearance of sammel maronnl  the lactonian exporter was conscious of this fact .     blast it  drake  you   ve got one fine job here .  you dress like a nob and do nothing but look pleasant and answer salutes .  how much do you get paid  anyway .         not enough .     captain drake lifted one gray eyebrow and stared quizzically at the lactonian .     i wish you had my job for a week or so .  you   d sing mighty small after that .  if you think taking care of fat dowager damsels and curly headed society snobs is a bed of roses  you   re welcome to it .     he muttered viciously to himself for a moment and then bowed politely to a bejeweled harridan who simpered past .     it   s what   s grayed my hair and furrowed my brow  by rigel .      maronni drew a long karen smoke out of his waist pouch and lit up luxuriously .  he blew a cloud of apple green smoke into the captain   s face and smiled impishly .      i   ve never heard the man yet who didn   t knock his own job  even when it was the pushover yours is  you hoary old fraud .  ah  if i   m not mistaken  the gorgeous ylen surat is bearing down upon us .         oh  pink devils of sirius .  i   m afraid to look .  is that old hag actually moving in our direction .         she certainly is and aren   t you the lucky one .  she   s one of the richest women on santanni and a widow  too .  the uniform gets them  i suppose .  what a pity i   m married .      captain drake twisted his face into a most frightful grimace     i hope a chandelier falls on her .      and with that he turned  his expression metamorphosed into one of bland delight in an instant     why  madam surat  i thought i   d never get the chance to see you tonight .      ylen surat  for whom the age of sixty was past experience  giggled girlishly     be still  you old flirt  or you   ll make me forget that i   ve come here to scold you .         nothing is wrong  i hope .     drake felt a sinking of the heart .  he had had previous experience with madam surat   s complaints .  things usually were wrong .      a great deal is wrong .  i   ve just been told that in fifty hours  we shall land on earth if that   s the way you pronounce the word .         perfectly correct     answered captain drake  a bit more at ease .      but it wasn   t listed as a stop when we boarded .         no  it wasn   t .  but then  you see  it   s  . quite a routine affair .  we leave ten hours after landing .         but this is insupportable .  it will delay me an entire day .  it is necessary for me to reach santanni within the week  and days are precious .  now  i   ve never heard of earth .  my guide book     she extracted a leather covered volume from her reticule and flipped its pages angrily     doesn   t even mention the place .  no one  i feel sure  has any interest in a halt there .  if you persist in wasting the passengers    time in a perfectly useless stop  i shall take it up with the president of the line .  i   ll remind you that i have some little influence back home .      captain drake sighed inaudibly .  it had not been the first time he had been reminded of ylen surat   s    little influence .        my dear madam  you are right  entirely right  perfectly right but i can do nothing .  all ships on the sirius  alpha centauri  and    cygni lines must stop at earth .  it is by interstellar agreement  and even the president of the line  no matter how stimulated he may be by your argument  could do nothing .         besides     interrupted maronni  who thought it time to come to the aid of the beleaguered captain     i believe that we have two passengers who are actually headed for earth .         that   s right .  i had forgotten .     captain drake   s face brightened a bit .     there .  we have concrete reason for the stop as well .         two passengers out of over fifteen hundred .  reason  indeed .         you are unfair     said maronni  lightly .     after all  it was on earth that the human race originated .  you know that  i suppose .      ylen surat lifted patently false eyebrows     did we .      the blank look on her face twisted to one of disdain     oh  well  that was all thousands and thousands of years ago .  it doesn   t matter any more .         it does to the loarists and the two who wish to land are loarists .         do you mean to say     sneered the widow     that there are still people in this enlightened age who go about studying    our ancient culture .     isn   t that what they   re always talking about .         that   s what filip sanat is always talking about     laughed maronni .     he gave me a long sermon only a few days ago on that very subject .  and it was interesting  too .  there was a lot to what he said .      he nodded lightly and continued     he   s got a good head on him  that filip sanat .  he might have made a good scientist or businessman .         speak of meteors and hear them whizz     said the captain  suddenly  and nodded his head to the right .      well .     gasped maronni .     there he is .  but but what in space is he doing here .      filip sanat did make a rather incongruous picture as he stood framed in the far doorway .  his long  dark purple tunic  mark of the loarist was a sombre splotch upon an otherwise gay scene .  his grave eyes turned toward maronni and he lifted his hand in immediate recognition .   astonished dancers made way automatically as he passed  staring at him long and curiously afterwards .  one could hear the wake of whispering that he left in his path .  filip sanat  however  took no notice of this .  eyes fixed stonily ahead of him and expression stolidly immobile  he reached captain drake  sammel maronni  and ylen surat    filip sanat greeted the two men warmly and then  in response to an introduction  bowed gravely to the widow  who regarded him with surprise and open disdain .      pardon me for disturbing you .  captain drake     said the young man  in a low tone .     i only want to know at what time we are leaving hyperspace .      the captain yanked out a corpulent pocket chromo .     an hour from now .  not more .         and we shall then be  .         just outside the orbit of planet ix .         that would be pluto .  sol will then be in sight as we enter normal space .         if you   re looking in the right direction  it will be toward the prow of the ship .         thank you     filip sanat made as if to depart  but maronni detained him .      hold on there  filip  you   re not going to leave us  are you .  i   m sure madam surat here is fairly dying to ask you several questions .  she has displayed a great interest in loarism .     there was more than the suspicion of a twinkle in the lactonian   s eye .   filip sanat turned politely to the widow  who  taken aback for the moment  remained speechless  and then recovered .      tell me  young man     she burst forth     are there really still people like you left .  loarists  i mean .      filip sanat started and stared quite rudely at his questioner  but did lose his tongue .  with calm distinctness  he said     there are still people left who try to maintain the culture and way of life of ancient earth .      captain drake could not forbear a tiny bit of irony     even down to the culture of the lhasinuic masters .      ylen surat uttered a stifled scream     do you mean to say earth is a lhasinuic world .  is it .     her voice rose to a frightened squeak .      why  certainly     answered the puzzled captain  sorry that he had spoken .     didn   t you know .         captain     there was hysteria in the woman   s voice .     you must not land .  if you do  i shall make trouble plenty of trouble .  i will not be exposed to hordes of those terrible lhasinu those awful reptiles from vega .         you need not fear .  madam surat     observed filip sanat  coldly .     the vast majority of earth   s population is very much human .  it is only the one percent that rules that is lhasinuic .         oh     a pause  and then  in a wounded manner     well  i don   t think earth can be so important  if it is not even ruled by humans .  loarism indeed .  silly waste of time  i call it .      sanat   s face flushed suddenly  and for a moment he seemed to struggle vainly for speech .  when he did speak  it was in an agitated tone     you have a very superficial view .  the fact that the lhasinu control earth has nothing to do with the fundamental problem of loarism which      he turned on his heel and left .   sammel maronni drew a long breath as he watched the retreating figure .     you hit him in a sore spot  madam surat  i never saw him squirm away from an argument or an attempt at an explanation in that way before .         he   s not a bad looking chap     said captain drake .   maronni chuckled     not by a long shot .  we   re from the same planet  that young fellow and i .  he   s a typical lactonian  like me .      the widow cleared her throat grumpily     oh  let us change the subject by all means .  that person seems to have cast a shadow over the entire room .  why do they wear those awful purple robes .  so unstylish .        loara broos porin glanced up as his young acolyte entered .      well .         in less than forty five minutes  loara broos .      and throwing himself into a chair  sanat leaned a flushed and frowning face upon one balled fist .   porin regarded the other with an affectionate smile     have you been arguing with sammel maronni again  filip .         no  not exactly .     he jerked himself upright .     but what   s the use  loara broos .  there  on the upper level  are hundreds of humans  thoughtless  gaily dressed  laughing  frolicking  and there outside is earth  disregarded .  only we two of the entire ship   s company are stopping there to view the world of our ancient days .      his eyes avoided those of the older man and his voice took on a bitter tinge     and once thousands of humans from every corner of the galaxy landed on earth every day .  the great days of loarism are over .      loara broos laughed .  one would not have thought such a hearty laugh to be in his spindly figure .     that is at least the hundredth time i have heard that said by you .  foolish .  the day will come when earth will once more be remembered .  people will yet again flock .  by the thousands and millions they   ll come .         no .  it is over .         bah .  the croaking prophets of doom have said that over and over again through history .  they have yet to prove themselves right .         this time they will .     sanat   s eyes blazed suddenly     do you know why .  it is because earth is profaned by the reptile conquerors .  a woman has just said to me a vain  stupid  shallow woman that t don   t think earth can be so important if it is not even ruled by humans .     she said what billions must say unconsciously  and i hadn   t the words to refute her .  it was one argument i couldn   t answer .         and what would your solution be  filip .  come  have you thought it out .         drive them from earth .  make it a human planet once more .  we fought them once during the first galactic drive two thousand years ago  and stopped them when it seemed as if they might absorb the galaxy .  let us make a second drive of our own and hurl them back to vega .      porin sighed and shook his head     you young hothead .  there never was a young loarist who didn   t eat fire on the subject .  you   ll outgrow it .  you   ll outgrow it .         look  my boy .     loara broos arose and grasped the other by the shoulders     man and lhasinu have intelligence  and are the only two intelligent races of the galaxy .  they are brothers in mind and spirit .  be at peace with them .  don   t hate  it is the most unreasoning emotion .  instead  strive to understand .      filip sanat stared stonily at the ground and made no indication that he heard .  his mentor clicked his tongue in gentle rebuke .      well  when you are older  you will understand .  now  forget all this  filip .  remember that the ambition of every real loarist is about to be fulfilled for you .  in two days  we shall reach earth and its soil shall be under your feet .  isn   t that enough to make you happy .  just think .  when you return  you shall be awarded the title    loara .     you shall be one who has visited earth .  the golden sun will be pinned to your shoulder .      porin   s hand crept to the staring yellow orb upon his own tunic  mute witness of his three previous visits to earth .      loara filip sanat     said sanat slowly  eyes glistening .     loara filip sanat .  it has a wonderful sound  hasn   t it .  and only a little ways off .         now  then  you feel better .  but come  in a few moments we shall leave hyperspace and we will see sol .      already  even as he spoke  the thick  choking cloak of hyper stuff that clung so closely to the sides of the flaming nova was going through those curious changes that marked the beginning of the shift to normal space .  the blackness lightened a bit and concentric rings of various shades of gray chased each other across the port view with gradually hastening speed .  it was a weird and beautiful optical illusion that science has never succeeded in explaining .   porin clicked off the lights in the room  and the two sat quietly in the dark  watching the feeble phosphorescence of the racing ripples as they sped into a blur .  then  with a terrifying silent suddenness  the whole structure of hyper stuff seemed to burst apart in a whirling madhouse of brilliant color .  and then all was peaceful again .  the stars sparkled quietly  against the curved backdrop of normal space .   and up in the corner of the port blazed the brightest spark of the sky with a luminous yellow flame that lit up the faces of the two men into pale  waxen masks .  it was sol .   the birth star of man was so distant that it lacked a perceptible disc  yet it was incomparably the brightest object to be seen .  in its feeble yellow light  the two remained in quiet thought  and filip sanat grew calmer .   in two days  the flaming nova landed on earth .     filip sanat forgot the delicious thrill that had seized him .  at the moment when his sandals first came into contact with the firm green sod of earth  when he caught his first glimpse of a lhasinuic official .   they seemed actually human or humanoid  at least .   at first glance  the predominantly manlike characteristics drowned out all else .  the body plan differed in no essential from man   s .  the four limbed  bipedal body  the middling well proportioned arms and legs  the well defined neck  were all astonishingly in evidence .  it was only after a few minutes that the smaller details marking the difference between the two races were noticed at all .   chief of these were the scales covering the bead and a thick line down the backbone  halfway to the hips .  the face itself  with its flat  broad  thinly scaled nose and lidless eyes was rather repulsive  but in no way bestial .  their clothes were few and simple  and their speech quite pleasant to the ear .  and  what was most important  there was no masking the intelligence that showed forth in their dark  luminous eyes .   porin noted sanat   s surprise at this first glimpse of the vegan reptiles with every sign of satisfaction .      you see     he remarked     their appearance is not at all monstrous .  why should hate exist between human and lhasinu  then .      sanat didn   t answer .  of course  his old friend was right .  the word    lhasinu    had so long been coupled with the words    alien    and    monster    in his mind  that against all knowledge and reason  he had subconsciously expected to see some weird life form .   yet  overlying the foolish feeling this realization induced was the same haunting hate that clung closely to him  growing to fury as they passed inspection by an over bearing english speaking lhasinu .   the next morning  the two left for new york  the largest city of the planet in the historic lore of the unbelievably ancient metropolis  sanat forgot for a day the troubles of the galaxy outside .  it was a great moment for him when he finally stood before a towering structure and said to himself     this is the memorial .      the memorial was earth   s greatest monument  dedicated to the birthplace of the human race  and this was wednesday  the day of the week when two men    guarded the flame .     two men  alone in the memorial  watched over the flickering yellow fire that symbolized human courage arid human initiative and porin had already arranged that the choice should fall that day upon himself and sanat  as being two newly arrived loarists .   and so  in the fading twilight  the two sat alone in the spacious flame room of the memorial .  in the murky semidarkness  lit only by the fitful glare of a dancing yellow flame  a quiet peace descended upon them .   there was something about the brooding aura of the place that wiped all mental disturbance clean away .  there was something about the wavering shadows as they weaved through the pillars of the long colonnade on either side  that cast a hypnotic spell .   gradually  he fell into a half doze  and out of sleepy eyes regarded the flame intently  until it became a living being of light weaving a dim  silent figure beside him .   but tiny sounds are sufficient to disturb a reverie  especially when contrasted with a hitherto deep silence .  sanat stiffened suddenly  and grasped porin   s elbow in a fierce grip .      listen     he hissed the warning quietly .   porin started violently out of a peaceful day dream  regarded his young companion with uneasy intentness  then  without a word  trumpeted one ear .  the silence was thicker than ever also a tangible cloak .  then the faintest possible scraping of feet upon marble  far off .  a low whisper  down at the limits of audibility  and then silence again .      what is it .     he asked bewilderedly of sanat  who had already risen to his feet .      lhasinu .     ground out sanat  face a mask of hate filled indignation .      impossible .     porin strove to keep his voice coldly steady  but it trembled in spite of itself .     it would be an unheard of event .  we are just imagining things  now .  our nerves are rubbed raw by this silence  that is all .  perhaps it is some official of the memorial .         after sunset  on wednesday .     came sanat   s strident voice .     that is as illegal as the entrance of lhasinuic lizards  and far more unlikely .  it is my duty as a guardian of the flame to investigate this .      he made as if to walk toward the shadowed door  and porin caught his wrist fearfully     don   t filip .  let us forget this until sunrise .  one can never tell what will happen .  what can you do  even supposing that lhasinu have entered the memorial .  if you      but sanat was no longer listening .  roughly  he shook off the other   s desperate grasp     stay here .  the flame must be guarded .  i shall be back soon .      he was already half way across the wide  marble floored hall .  cautiously  he approached the glass paned door to the dark  twisting staircase that circled its way upwards through the twilit gloom into the desert recesses of the tower .   slipping off his sandals  he crept up the stairs  casting one last look back toward the softly luminous flame  and toward the nervous  frightened figure standing beside it .     the two lhasinu stared about them in the pearly light of the atomo lamp .      dreary old place     said threg ban sola .  his wrist camera clicked three times .     take down a few of those books on the walls .  they   ll serve as additional proof .         do you think we ought to     asked cor wen hasta .     these human apes may miss them .         let them .     came the cool response .     what can they do .  here  sit down .     he flicked a hasty glance upon his chronometer .     we   ll get fifty credits for every minute we stay  so we might as well pile up enough to last us for a while .         pirat for is a fool .  what made him think we wouldn   t take the bet .             i think     said ban sola     he   s heard about the soldier torn to pieces last year for looting a european museum .  the humans didn   t like it  though loarism is filthy rich  vega knows .  the humans were disciplined  of course  but the soldier was dead .  anyway  what pirat for doesn   t know is that the memorial is deserted wednesdays .  this is going to cost him money .         fifty credits a minute .  and it   s been seven minutes now .         three hundred and fifty credits .  sit down .  we   ll play a game of cards and watch our money mount .      threg ban sola drew forth a worn pack of cards from his pouch which  though they were typically and essentially lhasinuic  bore unmistakable traces of their human derivation .      put the atomo light on the table and i   ll sit between it and the window     he continued peremptorily  shuffling the cards as he spoke .     hah .  i   ll warrant no lhasinu ever gamed in such an atmosphere .  why  it will triple the zest of the play .      cor wen hasta seated himself  and then rose again     did you hear anything .     he stared into the shadows beyond the half open door .      no     ban sola frowned and continued shuffling .     you   re not getting nervous  are you .         of course not .  still  if they were to catch us here in this blasted tower  it might not be pleasant .         not a chance .  the shadows are making you jumpy .     he dealt the hands .      do you know     said wen hasta  studying his cards carefully     it wouldn   t be so nice if the viceroy were to get wind of this  either .  i imagine he wouldn   t deal lightly with offenders of the loarists  as a matter of policy .  back on sirius  where i served before i was shifted  the scum         scum  all right     grunted ban sola .     they breed like flies and fight each other like mad bulls .  look at the creatures .     he turned his cards downward and grew argumentative .     i mean  look at them scientifically and impartially .  what are they .  only mammals .  mammals that can think  in a way  but mammals just the same .  that   s all .         i know .  did you ever visit one of the human worlds .      ban sola smiled     i may  pretty soon .         furlough .     wen hasta registered polite astonishment .      furlough  my scales .  with my ship .  and with guns shooting .         what do you mean .     there was a sudden glint in wen hasta   s eyes .   ban sola   s grin grew mysterious .     this isn   t supposed to be known  even among us officers  but you know how things leak out .      wen hasta nodded     i know .     both had lowered their voices instinctively .      well .  the second drive will be on  now  any time .         no .         fact .  and we   re starting right here .  by vega  the viceregal palace is buzzing with nothing else .  some of the officers have even started a lottery on the exact date of the first move .  i   ve got a hundred credits at twenty to one myself .  but then  i drew only to the nearest week .  you can get a hundred and fifty to one  if you   re nervy enough to pick a particular day .         but why here on this galaxy forsaken planet .         strategy on the part of the home office .     ban sola leaned forward .     the position we   re in now has us facing a numerically superior enemy hopelessly divided amongst itself .  if we can keep them so  we can take them over one by one .  the human worlds would just naturally rather cut their own throats than co operate with each other .      wen hasta grinned agreement     that   s typical mammalian behavior for you .  evolution must have laughed when she gave a brain to an ape .         but earth has particular significance .  it   s the center of loarism  because the humans originated here .  it corresponds to our own vegan system .         do you mean that .  but you couldn   t .  this little two by four flyspeck .         that   s what they say .  i wasn   t here at the time  so i wouldn   t know .  but anyway  if we can destroy earth  we can destroy loarism  which is centered here .  it was loarism  the historians say  that united the worlds against us at the end of the first drive .  no loarism  the last fear of enemy unification is gone  and victory is easy .         damned clever .  how are we going to go about it .         well  the word is that they   re going to pack up every last human on earth and scatter them through the subject worlds .  then we can remove everything else on earth that smells of the mammals and make it an entirely lhasinuic world .         but when .         we don   t know  hence the lottery .  but no one has placed his bet at a period more than two years in the future .         hurrah for vega .  i   ll give you two to one i riddle a human cruiser before you do  when the time comes .         done     cried ban sola .     i   ll put up fifty credits .      they rose to touch fists in token and wen hasta grinned at his chronometer     another minute and we   ll have an even thousand credits coming to us .  poor pirat for .  he   ll groan .  let   s go now  more would be extortionate .      there was low laughter as the two lhasinu left  long cloaks swishing softly behind them .  they did not notice the slightly darker shadow hugging the wall at the head of the stairs  though they almost brushed it as they passed .  nor did they sense the burning eyes focused upon them as they descended noiselessly .     loara broos porin jerked to his feet with a sob of relief as he saw the figure of filip sanat stumble across the hall toward him .  he ran to him eagerly  grasping both hands tightly .      what kept you  filip .  you don   t know what wild thoughts have passed through my head this past hour .  if you had been gone another five minutes  i would have gone mad for sheer suspense and uncertainty .  but what   s wrong .      it took several moments for loara broos    wild relief to subside sufficiently to note the other   s trembling hands  his disheveled hair  his feverishly glinting eyes  but when it did  all his fears returned .   he watched sanat in dismay  scarcely daring to press his question for fear of the answer .  but sanat needed no urging .  in short  jerky sentences he related the conversation he had overheard and his last words trailed into a despairing silence .   loara broos    pallor was almost frightening  and twice he tried to talk with no success other than a few hoarse gasps .  then  finally     but it is the death of loarism .  what is to be done .      filip sanat laughed  as men laugh when they are at last convinced that nothing remains to laugh at .     what can be done .  can we inform the central council .  you know only too well how helpless they are .  the various human governments .  you can imagine how effective those divided fools would be .         but it can   t be true .  it simply can   t be .      sanat remained silent for seconds  and then his face twisted agonizedly and in a voice thick with passion  he shouted     i won   t have it .  do you hear .  it shan   t be .  i   ll stop it .      it was easy to see that he had lost control of himself  that wild emotion was driving him .  porin  large drops of perspiration on his brow  grasped him about the waist     sit down  filip  sit down .  are you going crazy .         no .     with a sudden push  he sent porin stumbling backwards into a sitting position  while the flame wavered and flickered madly in the rush of air     i   m going sane .  the time for idealism and compromise and subservience is gone .  the time for force has come .  we will fight and  by space  we will win .      he was leaving the room at a dead run .   porin limped after     filip .  filip .     he stopped at the doorway in frightened despair .  he could go no further .  though the heavens fell  someone must guard the flame .   but but what was filip sanat going to do .  and through porin   s tortured mind flickered visions of a certain night  five hundred years before  when a careless word  a blow  a shot  had lit a fire over earth that was finally drowned in human blood .     loara paul kane was alone that night .  the inner office was empty  the dim  blue light upon the severely simple desk the only illumination in the room .  his thin face was bathed in the ghastly light  and his chin buried musingly between his hands .   and then there was a crashing interruption as the door was flung open and a disheveled russell tymball knocked off the restraining hands of half a dozen men and catapulted in .  kane whirled in dismay at the intrusion and one hand flew up to his throat as his eyes widened in apprehension .  his face was one startled question .   tymball waved his arm in a quieting gesture .     it   s all right .  just let me catch my breath .     he wheezed a bit and seated himself gently before continuing     your catalyst has turned up  loara paul and guess where .  here on earth .  here in new york .  not half a mile from where we   re sitting now .      loara paul kane eyed tymball narrowly     are you mad .         not so you can notice it .  i   ll tell you about it  if you don   t mind turning on a light or  . two .  you look like a ghost in the blue .     the room whitened under the glare of atomos  and tymball continued     femi and i were returning from the meeting .  we were passing the memorial when it happened  and you can thank fate for the lucky coincidence that led us to the right spot at the right moment .      as we passed  a figure shot out the side entrance  jumped on the marble steps in front  and shouted     men of earth .     everyone turned to look you know how filled memorial sector is at eleven and inside of two seconds  he had a crowd .         who was the speaker  and what was he doing inside the memorial .  this is wednesday night  you know .         why     tymball paused to consider     now that you mention it  he must have been one of the two guardians .  he was a loarist you couldn   t mistake the tunic .  he wasn   t terrestrial  either .         did he wear the yellow orb .         no .         then i know who he was .  he   s porin   s young friend .  go ahead .         there he stood .     tymball was warming to his task .     he was some twenty feet above street level .  you have no idea what an impressive figure he made with the glare of the luxites lighting his face .  he was handsome  but not in an athletic  brawny way .  he was the ascetic type  if you know what i mean .  pale  thin face  burning eyes  long  brown hair .      and when he spoke .  it   s no use describing it  in order to appreciate it really  you would have to hear him .  he began telling the crowd of the lhasinuic designs  shouting what i had been whispering .  evidently  he had gotten them from a good source  for he went into details and how he put them .  he made them sound real and frightening .  he frightened me with them  had me standing there scared blue at what he was saying  and as for the crowd  after the second sentence  they were hypnotized .  every one of them had had    lhasinuic menace    drilled into them over and over again  but this was the first time they listened actually listened .      then he began damning the lhasinu .  he rang the changes on their bestiality  their perfidy  their criminality only he had a vocabulary that raked them into the lowest mud of a venusian ocean .  and every time he let loose with an epithet  the crowd stood upon its hind legs and let out a roar .  it began to sound like a catechism .     shall we allow this to go on .     cried he .     never .     yelled the crowd .     must we yield .        never .        shall we resist .        to the end .        down with the lhasinu .     he shouted .  kill them .     they howled .      i howled as loud as any of them forgot myself entirely .      i don   t know how long it lasted before lhasinuic guards began closing in .  the crowd turned on them  with the loarist urging them on .  did you ever hear a mob yell for blood .  no .  it   s the most awful sound you can imagine .  the guards thought so  too  for one look at what was before them made them turn and run for their lives  in spite of the fact that they were armed .  the mob had grown into a matter of thousands and thousands by then .      but in two minutes  the alarm siren sounded for the first time in a hundred years .  i came to my senses at last and made for the loarist  who had not stopped his tirade a moment it was plain that we couldn   t let him fall into the hands of the lhasinu .      the rest is pretty much of a mixup .  squadrons of motorized police were charging down on us  but somehow  ferni and i managed between the two of us to grab the loarist  slip out  and bring him here .  i have him in the outer room  gagged and tied  to keep him quiet .      during all the last half of the narrative  kane had paced the floor nervously  pausing every once in a while in deep consideration .  little flecks of blood appeared on his lower lip .      you don   t think     he asked     that the riot will get out of hand .  a premature explosion      tymball shook his head vigorously     they   re mopping up already .  once the young fellow disappeared  the crowd lost its spirit  anyway .         there will be many killed or hurt  but  well  bring in the young firebrand .     kane seated himself behind his desk and composed his face into a semblance of tranquility .   filip sanat was in sad shape as he kneeled before his superior .  his tunic was in tatters  and his face scratched and bloody  but the fire of determination shone as brilliantly as ever in his fierce eyes .  russell tymball regarded him breathlessly as though the previous hour   s magic still lingered .   kane extended his arm gently     i have heard of your wild escapade  my boy .  what was it that impelled you to do so foolish an act .  it might very well have cost you your life  to say nothing of the lives of thousands of others .         for the second time that night  sanat repeated the conversation he had overheard dramatically and in the minutest detail .      just so  just so     said kane  with a grim smile  upon the conclusion of the tale     and did you think we knew nothing of this .  for a long time we have been preparing against this danger  and you have come near to upsetting all our carefully laid plans .  by your premature appeal  you might have worked irreparable harm to our cause .      filip sanat reddened     pardon my inexperienced enthusiasm         exactly     exclaimed kane .     yet  properly directed  you might be of great aid to us .  your oratory and youthful fire might work wonders if well managed .  would you be willing to dedicate yourself to the task .      sanat   s eyes flashed     need you ask .      loara paul kane laughed and cast a jubilant side glance at russell tymball     you   ll do .  in two days  you shall leave for the outer stars .  with you  will go several of my own men .  and now  you are tired .  you will be taken to where you may wash and treat your cuts .  then  you had better sleep  for you shall need your strength in the days to come .         but but loara broos porin my companion at the flame .         i shall send a messenger to the memorial immediately .  he will tell loara broos of your safety and serve as the second guardian for the remainder of the night .  go  now .      but even as sanat  relieved and deliriously happy  rose to go  russell tymball leaped from his chair and grasped the older loarist   s wrist in a convulsive grip .      great space .  listen .      the shrill  keening whine that pierced to the inner sanctum of kane   s offices told its own story .  kane   s face turned haggard .      it   s martial law .      tymball   s very lips had turned bloodless     we lost out  after all .  they   re using tonight   s disturbance to strike the first blow .  they   re after sanat  and they   ll have him .  a mouse couldn   t get through the cordon they   re going to throw about the city now .         but they mustn   t have him .     kane   s eyes glittered .     we   ll take him to the memorial by the passageway .  they won   t dare violate the memorial .         they have done it once already     came sanat   s impassioned cry .     i won   t hide from the lizards .  let us fight .         quiet     said kane     and follow silently .      a panel in the wall had slid aside  and toward it kane motioned .   and as the panel closed noiselessly behind them  leaving them in the cold glow of a pocket atomo lamp  tymball muttered softly     if they are ready  even the memorial will yield no protection .        new york was in ferment .  the lhasinuic garrison had mustered its full strength and placed it in a state of siege .  no one might enter .  no one might leave .  through the key avenues  rolled the ground cars of the army  while overhead poised the strato cars that guarded the airways .   the human population stirred restlessly .  they percolated through the streets  gathering in little knots that broke up at the approach of the lhasinu .  the spell of sanat lingered  and here and there frowning men exchanged angry whispers .   the atmosphere crackled with tension .   the viceroy of new york realized that as he sat behind his desk in the palace  which raised its spires upon washington heights .  he stared out the window at the hudson river  flowing darkly beneath  and addressed the uniformed lhasinu before him .      there must be positive action .  captain .  you are right in that .  and yet  if possible  an outright break must be avoided .  we are woefully undermanned and we haven   t more than five third rate war vessels on the entire planet .         it is not our strength but their own fear that keeps them helpless .  excellency .  their spirit has been thoroughly broken in these last centuries .  the rabble would break before a single unit of guardsmen .  that is precisely the reason why we must strike hard now .  the population has reared and they must feel the whip immediately .  the second drive may as well begin tonight .         yes     the viceroy grimaced wryly .     we are caught offstride  but the er rabble rouser must be made an example of .  you have him  of course .      the captain smiled grimly     no .  the human dog had powerful friends .  he is a loarist  you know .  kane         is kane standing against us .     two red spots burnt over the viceroy   s eyes .     the fool presumes .  the troops are to arrest the rebel in spite of him  and him  too  if he objects .         excellency .     the captain   s voice rang metallically .     we have reason to believe the rebel may be skulking in the memorial .      the viceroy half rose to his feet .  he scowled in indecision and seated himself once more     the memorial .  that presents difficulties .         not necessarily .         there are some things those humans won   t stand .     his voice trailed off uncertainly .   the captain spoke decisively     the nettle seized firmly does not sting .  quickly done a criminal could be dragged from the hall of the flame itself and we kill loarism at a stroke .  there could be no struggle after that supreme defiance .         by vega .  blast me  if you   re not right .  good .  storm the memorial .      the captain bowed stiffly  turned on his heel  and left the palace .     filip sanat re entered the hall of flame  thin face set angrily     the entire sector is patrolled by the lizards .  all avenues of approach to the memorial have been shut off .      russell tymball rubbed his jaw     oh  they   re not fools  they   ve treed us  and the memorial won   t stop them .  as a matter of fact  they may have decided to make this the day .      filip frowned and his voice was thickly furious .     and we   re to wait here  are we .  better to die fighting  than to die hiding .         better not to die at all  filip .     responded tymball quietly .   there was a moment of silence .  loara paul kane sat staring at his fingers .   finally  he said     if you were to give the signal to strike now  tymball  how long could you hold out .         until lhasinuic reinforcements could arrive in sufficient numbers to crush us .  the terrestrial garrison  including  the entire solar patrol  is not enough to stop us .  without outside help  we can fight effectively for six months at the very least .  unfortunately it   s out of the question .     his composure was unruffled .      why is it out of the question .      and his face reddened suddenly  as he sprang angrily to his feet     because you can   t just push buttons .  the lhasinu are weak .  my men know that  but earth doesn   t .  the lizards have one weapon  fear .  we can   t defeat them  unless the populace is with us  at least passively .     his mouth twisted     you don   t know the practical difficulties involved .  ten years  now  i   ve been planning  working  trying .  i have an army  and a respectable fleet in the appalachians .  i could set the wheels in motion in all five continents simultaneously .  but what good would it do .  it would be useless .  if i had new york  now if i were able to prove to the rest of earth that the lhasinu were not invincible .         if i could banish fear from the hearts of humans .     said kane softly .      i would have new york by dawn .  but it would take a miracle .         perhaps .  do you think you can get through the cordon and reach your men .         i could if i had to .  what are you going to do .         you will know when it happens .     kane was smiling fiercely .     and when it does happen  strike .      there was a tonite gun in tymball   s hand suddenly  as he backed away .  his plump face was not at all gentle     i   ll take a chance  kane .  good bye         the captain strode up the deserted marble steps of the memorial arrogantly .  he was flanked on each side by an armed adjutant .   he paused an instant before the huge double door that loomed up before him and stared at the slender pillars that soared gracefully upwards at its sides .   there was faint sarcasm in his smile     impressive  all this  isn   t it .         yes  captain .     was the double reply .      and mysteriously dark  too  except for the dim yellow of their flame .  you see its light .     he pointed toward the stained glass of the bottom windows  which glinted flickeringly .      yes  captain .         it   s dark  and mysterious  and impressive and it is about to fall in ruins .     he laughed  and suddenly brought the butt end of his saber down upon the metal carvings on the door in a clanging salvo .   it echoed through the emptiness within and sounded hollowly in the night  but there was no answer .   the adjutant at his left raised his televisor to his ear and caught the faint words issuing therefrom .  he saluted     captain  the humans are crowding into the sector .      the captain sneered     let them .  order the guns placed in readiness and aimed along the avenues .  any human attempting to pass the cordon is to be rayed mercilessly .      his barked command was murmured into the televisor  and a hundred yards beyond  lhasinuic guardsmen put guns in order and aimed them carefully .  a low  inchoate murmur went up a murmur of fear .  men pressed back .      if the door does not open     said the captain  grimly     it is to be broken down .     he raised his saber again  and again there was the thunder of metal on metal .   slowly  noiselessly  the door yawned wide  and the captain recognized the stem  purple clad figure that stood before him .      who disturbs the memorial on the night of the guarding of the flame .     demanded loara paul kane solemnly .      very dramatic  kane .  stand aside .         back .     the words rang out loudly and clearly .     the memorial may not be approached by the lhasinu .         yield us our prisoner  and we leave .  refuse  and we will take him by force .         the memorial yields no prisoner .  it is inviolate .  you may not enter .         make way .         stand back .      the lhasinu growled throatily and became aware of a dim roaring .  the streets about him were empty  but a block away in every direction was the thin line of lhasinuic troops  stationed at their guns  and beyond were the humans .  they were massed in noisy thickness and the whites of their faces shone palely in the chrome lights .      what     gritted the captain to himself     do the scum yet snarl .     his tough skin ridged at the jaws and the scales upon his head uptilted sharply .  he turned to the adjutant with the televisor .     order a round over their heads .      the night was split in two by the purple blasts of energy and the lhasinu laughed aloud at the silence that followed .   he turned to kane  who remained standing upon the threshold .     so you see that if you expect help from your people  you will be disappointed .  the next round will be aimed at head level .  if you think that bluff  try me .      teeth clicked together sharply     make way .     a tonite was leveled in his hand  and thumb was firm upon the trigger .   loara paul kane retreated slowly  eyes upon the gun .  the captain followed .  and as he did so  the inner door of the anteroom swung open and the hall of the flame stood revealed .  in the sudden draft  the flame staggered  and at the sight of it  there came a huge shout from the distant spectators .   kane turned toward it  face raised upwards .  the motion of one of his hands was all but imperceptible .   and the flame suddenly changed .  it steadied and roared up to the vaulted ceiling  a blazing shaft fifty feet high .  loara paul kane   s hand moved again  and as it did so  the flame turned carmine .  the color deepened and the crimson light of that flaming pillar streamed out into the city and turned the memorial   s windows into staring  bloody eyes .   long seconds passed  while the captain froze in bewilderment  while the distant mass of humanity fell into awed silence .   and then there was a confused murmur  which strengthened and grew and split itself into one vast shout .      down with the lhasinu .      there was the purple flash of a tonite from somewhere high above  and the captain came to life an instant too late .  caught squarely  he bent slowly to his death  cold  reptilian face a mask of contempt to the last .     russell tymball brought down his gun and smiled sardonically     a perfect target against the flame .  good for kanel the changing of the flame was just the emotion stirring thing we needed .  let   s go .      from the roof of kane   s dwelling he aimed down upon the lhasinu below .  and as he did  all hell erupted .  men mushroomed from the very ground  it seemed  weapons in hand .  tonites blazed from every side  before the startled lhasinu could spring to their triggers .   and when they did so  it was too late  for the mob  white hot with flaring rage  broke its bounds .  someone shrieked     kill the lizards .     and the cry was taken up in one roaring ululation that swelled to the sky .   like a many headed monster  the stream of humanity surged forward  weaponless .  hundreds withered under the belated fury of the defending guns  and tens of thousands scrambled over the corpses  charging to the very muzzles .   the lhasinu never wavered .  their ranks thinned steadily under the deadly sharp shooting of the tymballists  and those that remained were caught by the human flood that surged over them and tore them to horrible death .   the memorial sector gleamed in the crimson of the bloody flame and echoed to the agony of the dying  and the shrieking fury of the triumphant .   it was the first battle of the great rebellion  but it was not really a battle  or even madness .  it was concentrated anarchy .   throughout the city  from the tip of long island to the mid jersey flatlands  rebels sprang from nowhere and lhasinu went to their death .  and as quickly as tymball   s orders spread to raise the snipers  so did the news of the changing of the flame speed from mouth to mouth and grow in the telling .  all new york heaved  and poured its separate lives into the single giant crucible of the    mob .      it was uncontrollable  unanswerable  irresistible .  the tymballists followed helplessly where it led  all efforts at direction hopeless from the start .   like a mighty river  it lashed its way through the metropolis  and where it passed no living lhasinu remained .   the sun of that fateful morning arose to find the masters of earth occupying a shrinking circle in upper manhattan .  with the cool courage of born soldiers  they linked arms and withstood the charging  shrieking millions .  slowly  they backed away  each building a skirmish  each block a desperate battle .  they split into isolated groups  defending first a building  and then its upper stories  and finally its roof .   with the noonday sun boiling down  only the palace itself remained .  its last desperate stand held the humans at bay .  the withering circle of fire about it paved the grounds with blackened bodies .  the viceroy himself from his throneroom directed the defense  his own hand upon the butt of a semiportable .   and then  when the mob had finally come to a pause  tymball seized his opportunity and took the lead .  heavy guns clanked to the front atomos and delta rays  from the rebel stock and from the stores captured the previous night  pointed their death laden muzzles at the palace .   gun answered gun  and the first organized battle of machines flared into desperate fury .  tymball was an omnipresent figure  shouting  directing  leaping from gun emplacement to gun emplacement  firing his own band tonite defiantly at the palace .   under a barrage of the heaviest fire  the humans charged once more and pierced to the walls as the defenders fell back .  an atomo projectile smashed its way into the central tower and there was a sudden inferno of fire .   that blaze was the funeral pyre of the last of the lhasinu in new york .  the blackening walls of the palace crumbled in  in one vast crash  but to the very last  room blazing about him  face horribly cut  the viceroy stood his ground  aiming into the thick of the besieging force .  and when his semi portable expended the last dregs of its power and expired  he heaved it out the window in a last futile gesture of defiance  and plunged into the burning hell at his back .   above the palace grounds at sunset  with a yet roaring furnace as the background  there floated the green flag of independent earth .   new york was once more human .     russell tymball was a sorry figure when he entered the memorial once more that night .  clothes in tatters  and bloody from head to foot from the undressed cut on his cheek  he surveyed the carnage about him with sated eyes .   volunteer squads  occupied in removing the dead and tending to the wounded had not yet succeeded in making more than a dent in the deadly work of the rebellion .   the memorial was an improvised hospital .  there were few wounded  for energy weapons deal death  and of these few  almost none slightly .  it was a scene of indescribable confusion  and the moans of the hurt and dying mingled horribly with the distant yells of celebrating war drunk survivors .   loara paul kane pushed through the crowding attendants to tymball .      tell me  is it over .     his face was haggard .      the beginning is .  the terrestrial flag flies over the ruins of the palace .         it was horrible .  the day has has     he shuddered and closed his eyes     if i had known in advance  i would rather have seen earth dehumanized and loarism destroyed .         yes  it was bad .  but the results might have been much more dearly bought  and yet have remained cheap at the price .  where   s sanat .         in the courtyard helping with the wounded .  we all are .  it it     again his voice failed him .   there was impatience in tymball   s eyes  and he shrugged weary shoulders     i   m not a callous monster  but it had to be done  and as yet it is only the beginning .  today   s events mean little .  the uprising has taken place over most of earth  but without the fanatic enthusiasm of the rebellion in new york .  the lhasinu aren   t defeated  or anywhere near defeated  make no mistake about that even now the solar guard is flashing to earth  and the forces on the outer planets are being called back .  in no time at all  the entire lhasinuic empire will converge upon earth and the reckoning will be a terrible and bloody one .  we must have help .      he grasped kane by the shoulders and shook him roughly .     do you understand .  we must have help .  even here in new york the first flush of victory will fade by tomorrow .  we must have help .         i know     said kane tonelessly .     i   ll get sanat and he can leave today .     he sighed     if today   s action was any criterion of his power as a catalyst  we may expect great events .        sanat climbed into the little two man cruiser half an hour later and took his seat beside petri at the controls .   he extended his hand to kane a last time     when i come back it will be with a navy behind me .      kane grasped the young man   s hand tightly     we depend upon you  filip .     he paused and said slowly     good luck  loara filip sanat .      sanat flushed with pleasure at the title as he resumed his seat once more .  petri waved and tymball called out     watch out for the solar guard .      the airlock clanged shut  and then  with a coughing roar  the pigmy cruiser was off into the heavens .   tymball followed it to where it dwindled into a speck and less and then turned to kane .     all is now in the hands of fate .  and  kane  just how was that changing of the flame worked .  don   t tell me the flame turned red of itself .      kane shook his head slowly     no .  that carmine blaze was the result of opening a hidden pocket of strontium salts  originally placed there to impress the lhasinu in case of need .  the rest was chemistry .      tymball laughed grimly     you mean the rest was mob psychology .  and the lhasinu  i think  were impressed and how .        space itself gave no warning  but the mass detector buzzed .  it buzzed peremptorily and insistently .  petri stiffened in his seat and said     we   re in none of the meteor zones .      filip sanat held his breath as the other turned the knob that rotated the peri rotor .  the star field in the    visor shifted with slow dignity  and then they saw it .   it glinted in the sun like half a tiny  orange football  and petri growled     if they   ve spotted us  we   re sunk .         lhasinuic ship .         ship .  that   s no ship .  that   s a fifty thousand ton battle cruiser .  what in the galaxy it   s doing here  i don   t know .  tymball said the patrol bad made for earth .      sanat   s voice was calm     that one hasn   t .  can we outrage it .         fat chance .     petri   s fist clenched white on the g stick .     they   re coming closer .      the words might have been a signal .  the audiomitter jiggled and the harsh lhasinuic voice started from a whisper and rose to stridence as the radio beam sharpened     fire reverse motors and prepare for boarding .      petri released the controls and shot a look at sanat     i   m only the chauffeur .  what do you want to do .  we haven   t the chance of a meteor against the sun but if you like the gamble         well     said sanat  simply     we   re not going to surrender  are we .      the other grinned  as the decelerating rockets blasted     not bad for a loarist .  can you shoot a mounted tonite .         i   ve never tried .         well  then  learn how .  grab that little wheel over there and keep your eye on the small    visor above .  see anything .     speed was steadily dropping and the enemy ship was approaching .      just stars .         all right  rotate the wheel go ahead  further .  try the other direction .  do you see the ship now .         yes .  there it is .         good .  now center it .  get it where the hairlines cross  and for the sake of sol  keep it there .  now i   m going to turn toward the lizard scum     siderockets blasted as he spoke     and you keep it centered .      the lhasinuic ship was bloating steadily  and petri   s voice descended to a tense whisper     i   m dropping our screen and lunging directly at her .  it   s a gamble .  if they   re sufficiently startled  they may drop their screen and shoot  and if they shoot in a hurry  they may miss .      sanat nodded silently .      now the second you see the purple flash of the tonite  pull back on the wheel .  pull back hard  and pull back fast .  if you   re the tiniest trifle late  we   re through .     he shrugged     it   s a gamble .      with that  he slammed the g stick forward hard and shouted     keep it centered .      acceleration pushed sanat back gaspingly  and the wheel in his sweating hands responded reluctantly to pressure .  the orange football wobbled at the center of the    visor .  he could feel his hands trembling  and that didn   t help any .  eyes winced with tension .   the lhasinuic ship was swelling terribly now  and then  from its prow  a purple sword leaped toward them .  sanat closed his eyes and jerked backwards .   he kept his eyes closed and waited .  there was no sound .   he opened them and started to his feet  for petri  arms akimbo  was laughing down upon him .      a beginner   s own luck     he laughed .     never held a gun before in his life and knocks out a heavy cruiser in as pretty a pink as i ever saw .         i hit it .     gasped sanat .      not on the button  but you did disable it .  that   s good enough .  and now  just as soon as we get far enough away from the sun  we   re going into hyperspace .        the tall  purple clad figure standing by the central portview gazed longingly at the silent globe without .  it was earth  huge  gibbous  glorious .   perhaps his thoughts were just a trifle bitter as he considered the six month period that had just passed .  it had begun with a nova blaze .  enthusiasm kindled to white heat and spread  leaping the stellar gulfs from planet to planet as fast as the hyper atomic beam .  squabbling governments  sudden putty before the outraged clamoring of their peoples  outfitted fleets .  enemies of centuries made sudden peace and flew under the same green flag of earth .   perhaps it would have been too much to expect this love feast to continue .  while it did the humans were irresistible  one fleet was not two parsecs from vega itself  another had captured luna and hovered one light second above the earth  where tymball   s ragged revolutionaries still held on doggedly .   filip sanat sighed and turned at the sound of a step .  white haired ion smitt of the lactonian contingent entered .      your face tells the story     said sanat .   smitt shook his head     it seems hopeless .      sanat turned away again     did you know that we   ve gotten word from tymball today .  they   re fighting on what they can filch from the lhasinu .  the lizards have captured buenos aires  and all south america seems likely to go under their heel .  they   re disheartened the tymballists and disgusted  and i am  too .     he whirled suddenly     you say that our new needle ships insure victory .  then  why don   t we attack .         well  for one thing     the grizzled soldier planted one booted leg on the chair next to him     the reinforcements from santanni are not coming .      sanat started     i thought they were on their way .  what happened .         the santannian government has decided its fleet is required for home defense .     a wry smile accompanied his words .      what home defense .  why  the lhasinu are five hundred parsecs away from them .      smitt shrugged     an excuse is an excuse and need not make sense .  i didn   t say that was the real reason .      sanat brushed his hair back and his fingers strayed to the yellow sun upon his shoulder     even so .  we could still fight  with over a hundred ships .  the enemy outnumbers us two to one  but with the needle ships and with lunar base at our backs and the rebels harassing them in the rear     he fell into a brooding reverie .      you won   t get them to fight  filip .  the trantorian squadron favors retreat .     his voice was suddenly savage     of the entire fleet  i can trust only the twenty ships of my own squadron the lactonian .  oh  filip  you don   t know the dirt of it you never have known .  you   ve won the people to the cause  but you   ve never won the governments .  popular opinion forced them in  but now that they are in  they   re in only for what they can get .         i can   t believe that  smitt .  with victory in their grasp         victory .  victory for whom .  it is exactly over that bone that the planets are squabbling .  at a secret convention of the nations  santanni demanded control of all the lhasinuic worlds of the sirius sector none of which have been recognized as yet and was refused .  ah  you didn   t know that consequently  she decides that she must take care of her home defense  and withdraws her various squadrons .      filip sanat turned away in pain  but ion smitt   s voice hammered on  hard  unmerciful .      and then trantor realizes that she hates and fears santanni more than ever she did the lhasinu and any day now she will withdraw her fleet to refrain from crippling them while her enemy   s ships remain quietly and safely in port .  the human nations are falling apart     the soldier   s fist came down upon the table     like rotten cloth .  it was a fool   s dream to think that the selfish idiots could ever unite for any worthy purpose long .      sanat   s eyes were suddenly calculating slits     wait a while .  things will yet work out all right  if we can only manage to seize control of earth .  earth is the key to the whole situation .     his fingers drummed upon the table edge .     its capture would provide the vital spark .  it would drum up human enthusiasm  now lagging  to the boiling point  and the governments  well  they would either have to ride the wave  or be dashed to pieces .         i know that .  if we fought today  you have a soldier   s word we   d be on earth tomorrow .  they realize it  too  but they won   t fight        then then they must be made to fight .  the only way they can be made to fight is to leave no alternative .  they won   t fight now  because they can retreat whenever they wish  but if      he suddenly looked up  face aglow     you know  i haven   t been out of the loarist tunic in years .  do you suppose your clothes will fit me .      ion smitt looked down upon his ample girth and grinned     well  they might not fit you  but they   ll cover you all right .   what are you thinking of doing .         i   ll tell you .  it   s a terrible chance  but  relay the following orders immediately to the lunar base garrison        the admiral of the lhasinuic solar squadron was a warscarred veteran who hated two things above all else  humans and civilians .  the combination  in the person of the tall  slender human in ill fitted clothing  put a scowl of dislike upon his face .   sanat wriggled in the grasp of the two lhasinuic soldiers .     tell them to let go     he cried in the vegan tongue .     i am unarmed .         speak     ordered the admiral in english .     they do not understand your language .     then  in lhasinuic to the soldiers     shoot when i give the word .      sanat subsided     i came to discuss terms .         i judged as much when you hoisted the white flag .  yet you come in a one man cruiser from the night side of your own fleet  like a fugitive .  surely  you cannot speak for your fleet .         i speak for myself .         then i give you one minute .  if i am not interested by the end of that time  you will be shot .     his expression was stony .   sanat tried once more to free himself  with little success .  his captors tightened their grips .      your situation     said the earthman     is this .  you can   t attack the human squadron as long as they control lunar base  without serious damage to your own fleet  and you can   t risk that with a hostile earth behind you .  at the same time  i happen to know that the order from vega is to drive the humans from the solar system at all costs  and that the emperor dislikes failures .         you have ten seconds left     said the admiral  but tell tale red spots appeared above his eyes .      all right  then     came the hurried response     how   s this .  what if i offer you the entire human fleet caught in a trap .      there was silence .  sanat went on     what if i show you how you can take over lunar base  and surround the humans .         go on .     it was the first sign of interest the admiral had permitted himself .      i am in command of one of the squadrons and i have certain powers .  if you   ll agree to our terms  we can have the base deserted within twelve hours .  two ships     the human raised two fingers impressively     will take it        interesting     said the lhasinu  slowly     but your motive .  what is your reason for doing this .      sanat thrust out a surly under lip     that would not interest you .  i have been ill treated and deprived of my rights .  besides     his eyes glittered     humanity   s is a lost cause  anyway .  for this i shall expect payment ample payment .  swear to that  and the fleet is yours .      the admiral glared his contempt    there is a lhasinuic proverb  the human is steadfast in nothing but his treachery .  arrange your treason  and i shall repay .  i swear by the word of a lhasinuic soldier .  you may return to your ships .      with a motion  he dismissed the soldiers and then stopped them at the doorway     but remember  i risk two ships .  they mean little as far as my fleet   s strength is concerned  but  nevertheless  if harm comes to a lhasinuic head through human treachery     the scales on his head were stiffly erect and sanat   s eyes dropped beneath the other   s cold stare .   for a long while  the admiral sat alone and motionless .  then he spat    this human filth .  it is a disgrace even to fight them .        the flagship of the human fleet lazed one hundred miles above luna  and within it the captains of the squadrons sat about the table and listened to ion smitt   s shouted indictment .       i tell you your actions amount to treason .  the battle off vega is progressing  and if the lhasinu win  their solar squadron will be strengthened to the point where we must retreat .  and if the humans win  our treachery here exposes their flank and renders the victory worthless .  we can win  i tell you .  with these new needle ships      the sleepy eyed trantorian leader spoke up .     the needleships have never been tried before .  we cannot risk a major battle on an experiment  when the odds are against us .         that wasn   t your original view  porcut .  you yes  and the rest of you as well are a cowardly traitor .  cowards .  cravens .      a chair crashed backwards as one arose in anger and others followed .  loara filip sanat  from his vantage point at the central port  from where he watched the bleak landscape of luna below with devouring concentration  turned in alarm .  but jem porcut raised a gnarled hand for order .      let   s stop fencing     he said .     i represent trantor  and i take orders only from her .  we have eleven ships here  and space knows how many at vega .  how many has santanni got .  none .  why is she keeping them at home .  perhaps to take advantage of trantor   s preoccupation .  is there anyone who hasn   t heard of her designs against us .  we   re not going to destroy our ships here for her benefit .  trantor will not fight .  my division leaves tomorrow .  under the circumstances  the lhasinu will be glad to let us go in peace .      another spoke up     and poritta  too .  the treaty of draconis has hung like neutronium around our neck these twenty years .  the imperialist planets refuse revision  and we will not fight a war which is to their interest only .      one after another  surly exclamations dinned the perpetual refrain     our interests are against it .  we will not fight .      and suddenly  loara filip sanat smiled .  he had turned away from luna and laughed at the snarling arguers .      sirs     he said     no one is leaving .      ion smitt sighed with relief and sank back in his chair .      who will stop us .     asked porcut with disdain .      the lhasinu .  they have just taken lunar base and we are surrounded .      the room was a babble of dismay .  shouting confusion held sway and then one roared above the rest     what of the garrison .         the garrison had destroyed the fortifications and evacuated hours before the lhasinu took over .  the enemy met with no resistance .      the silence that followed was much more terrifying than the cries that had preceded .     treason     whispered someone .      who is at the bottom of this .     one by one they approached sanat .  fists clenched .  faces flushed .     who did this .         i did     said sanat  calmly .   a moment of stunned disbelief .     dog .        pig of a loarist .        tear his guts out .      and then they shrank back at the pair of tonite guns that appeared in ion smitt   s fists .  the burly lactonian stepped before the younger man .      i was in on this  too     he snarled .     you   ll have to fight now .  it is necessary to fight fire with fire sometimes  and sanat fought treason with treason .      jem porcut regarded his knuckles carefully and suddenly chuckled     well  we can   t wriggle out now  so we might as well fight .  except for orders  i wouldn   t mind taking a crack at the damn lizards .      the reluctant pause was followed by shamefaced shouts  proof positive of the willingness of the rest .   in two hours  the lhasinuic demand for surrender had been scornfully rejected and the hundred ships of the human squadron spread outwards on the expanding surface of an imaginary sphere the standard defense formation of a surrounded fleet and the battle for earth was on .     a space battle between approximately equal forces resembles in almost every detail a gigantic fencing match in which controlled shafts of deadly radiation are the rapiers and impermeable walls of etheric inertia are the shields .   the two forces advance to battle and maneuver for position .  then the pale purple of a tonite beam lashes out in a blaze of fury against the screen of an enemy ship  and in so doing  its own screen is forced to blink out .  for that one instant it is vulnerable and is a perfect target for an enemy ray  which  when loosed  renders its ship open to attack for the moment .  in widening circles  it spreads .  each unit of the fleet  combining speed of mechanism with speed of human reaction  attempts to slip through at the crucial moment and yet maintain its own safety .   loara filip sanat knew all this and more .  since his encounter with the battle cruiser on the way out from earth  he had studied space war  and now  as the battle fleets fell into line  he felt his very fingers twitch for action .   he turned and said to smitt     i   m going down to the big guns .      smitt   s eye was on the grand    visor  his hand on the etherwave sender     go ahead  if you wish  but don   t get in the way .      sanat smiled .  the captain   s private elevator carried him to the gun levels  and from there it was five hundred feet through an orderly mob of gunners and engineers to tonite one .  space is at a premium in a battleship .  sanat could feel the crampedness of the room in which individual humans dovetailed their work smoothly to create the gigantic machine that was a giant dreadnaught .   he mounted the six steep steps to tonite one and motioned the gunner away .  the gunner hesitated  his eye fell upon the purple tunic  and then he saluted and backed reluctantly down the steps .   sanat turned to the co ordinator at the gun   s visiplate     do     you mind working with me .  my speed of reaction has been tested and grouped   a .  i have my rating card  if you   d care to see it .      the co ordinator flushed and stammered     no  sir .  it   s an honor to work with you  sir .      the amplifying system thundered     to your stations .     and a deep silence fell  in which the cold purr of machinery sounded its ominous note .   sanat spoke to the co ordinator in a whisper     this gun covers a full quadrant of space  doesn   t it .         yes  sir .         good  see if you can locate a dreadnaught with the sign of a double sun in partial eclipse .      there was a long silence .  the co ordinator   s sensitive hands were on the wheel  delicate pressure turning it this way and that  so that the field in view on the visiplate shifted .  keen eyes scanned the ordered array of enemy ships .      there it is     he said .     why  it   s the flagship .         exactly .  center that ship .      as the wheel turned  the space field reeled  and the enemy flagship wobbled toward the point where the hairlines crossed .  the pressure of the co ordinator   s fingers became lighter and more expert .      centered .     he said .  where the hairlines crossed the tiny oval globe remained impaled .      keep it that way .     ordered sanat  grimly .     don   t lose it for a second as long as it stays in our quadrant .  the enemy admiral is on that ship and we   re going to get him  you and i .      the ships were getting within range of each other and sanat felt tense .  he knew it was going to be close very close .  the humans had the edge in speed  but the lhasinu were two to one in numbers .   a flickering beam shot out  another  ten more .   there was a sudden blinding flash of purple intensity .      first hit     breathed sanat .  he relaxed .  one of the enemy ships drifted off helplessly  its stem a mass of fused and glowing metal .   the opposing ships were not at close grips .  shots were being exchanged at blinding speed .  twice  a purple beam showed at the extreme limits of the visiplate and sanat realized with a queer sort of shiver down his spine that it was one of the adjacent tonites of their own ship that was firing .   the fencing match was approaching a climax .  two flashes blazed into being  almost simultaneously  and sanat groaned .  one of the two had been a human ship .  and three times there came that disquieting hum as atomo engines in the lower level shot into high gear and that meant that an enemy beam directed at their own ship had been stopped by the screen .   and  always  the co ordinator kept the enemy flagship centered .  an hour passed  an hour in which six lhasinu and four human ships had been whiffed to destruction  an hour in which the wheel turned fractions of a degree this way  that way  in which it swivelled on its universal socket mere hairlines in half a dozen directions .   sweat matted the co ordinator   s hair and got into his eyes  his fingers half lost all sensation  but that flagship never left the ominous spot where the hairlines crossed .   and sanat watched  finger on trigger watched and waited .   twice the flagship had glowed into purple luminosity  its guns blazing and its defensive screen down  and twice sanat   s finger had quivered on the trigger and refrained .  he hadn   t been quick enough .   and then sanat rammed it home and rose to his feet tensely .  the co ordinator yelled and dropped the wheel .   in a gigantic funeral pyre of purple hued energy  the flagship with the lhasinuic admiral inside had ceased to exist .   sanat laughed .  his hand went out  and the co ordinator   s came to meet it in a firm grasp of triumph .   but the triumph did not last long enough for the co ordinator to speak the first jubilant words that were welling up in his throat  for the visiplate burst into a purple bombshell as five human ships detonated simultaneously at the touch of deadly energy shafts .   the amplifiers thundered     up screens .  cease firing .  ease into needle formation .      sanat felt the deadly pall of uncertainty squeeze his throat .  he knew what had happened .  the lhasinu had finally managed to set up their big guns on lunar base  big guns with three times the range of even the largest ship guns big guns that could pick off human ships with no fear of reprisal .   and so the fencing match was over  and the real battle was to start .  but it was to be a real battle of a type never before fought  and sanat knew that that was the thought in every man   s mind .  he could see it in their grim expressions and feel it in their silence .   it might work .  and it might not .     the earth squadron had resumed its spherical formation and drifted slowly outwards  its offensive batteries silent .  the lhasinu swept in for the kill .  cut off from power supply as the earthmen were  and unable to retaliate with the gigantic guns of the lunar batteries commanding near by space  it seemed only a matter of time before either surrender or annihilation .   the enemy tonite beams lashed out in continuous blasts of energy  and tortured screens on human ships sparked and fluoresced under the harsh whips of radiation .   sanat could hear the buzz of the atomo engines rise to a protesting squeal .  against his will  his eye flicked to the energy gauge  and the quivering needle sank as he watched  moving down the dial at perceptible speed .   the co ordinator licked dry ups     do you think we   ll make it  sir .         certainly .     sanat was far from feeling his expressed confidence .     we need hold out for an hour provided they don   t fall back .      and the lhasinu didn   t .  to have fallen back would have meant a thinning of the lines  with a possible break through and escape on the part of the humans .   the human ships were down to crawling speed scarcely above a hundred miles an hour .  idling along  they crept up the purple beams of energy  the imaginary sphere increasing in size  the distance between the opposing forces ever narrowing .   but inside the ship  the gauge needle was dropping rapidly  and sanat   s heart dropped with it .  he crossed the gun level to where hard bitten soldiers waited at a gigantic and gleaming lever  in anticipation of an order that had to come soon or never .   the distance between opponents was now only a matter of one or two miles almost contact from the viewpoint of space warfare and then that order shot over the shielded etheric beams from ship to ship .   it reverberated through the gun level      out needles .      a score of hands reached for the lever  sanat   s among them  and jerked downwards .  majestically  the lever bent in a curving are to the floor and as it did so  there was a vast scraping noise and a sharp thud that shook the ship .   the dreadnaught had become a    needle ship .      at the prow  a section of armor plate had slid aside and a glittering shaft of metal had lunged outward viciously .  one hundred feet long  it narrowed gracefully from a base ten feet in diameter to a needle sharp diamond point .  in the sunlight  the chrome steel of the shaft gleamed in flaming splendor .   and every other ship of the human squadron was likewise equipped .  each had become ten  fifteen  twenty  fifty thousand tons of driving rapier .   swordfish of space .   somewhere in the lhasinuic fleet  frantic orders must have been issued .  against this oldest of all naval tactics old even in the dim dawn of history when rival triremes had maneuvered and rammed each other to destruction with pointed prows the super modem equipment of a space fleet has no defense .   sanat forced his way to the visiplate and strapped himself into an anti acceleration seat  and he felt the springs absorb the backward jerk as the ship sprang into sudden acceleration .   he didn   t bother with that  though .  he wanted to watch the battle .  there wasn   t one here  nor anywhere in the galaxy  that risked what he did .  they risked only their lives  and he risked a dream that he had  almost single handed  created out of nothing .   he had taken an apathetic galaxy and driven it into revolt against the reptile .  he had taken an earth on the point of destruction and dragged it from the brink  almost unaided .  a human victory would be a victory for loara filip sanat and no one else .   he  and earth  and the galaxy were now lumped into one and thrown into the scale .  and against it was weighed the outcome of this last battle  a battle hopelessly lost by his own purposeful treachery  unless the needles won .   and if they lost  the gigantic defeat the ruin of humanity was also his .   the lhasinuic ships were jumping aside  but not fast enough .  while they were slowly gathering momentum and drifting away  the human ships had cut the distance by three quarters .  on the screen  a lhasinuic ship had grown to colossal proportions .  its purple whip of energy had gone out as every ounce of power had gone into a man killing attempt at rapid acceleration .   and nevertheless its image grew and the shining point that could be seen at the lower end of the screen aimed like a glittering javelin at its heart .   sanat felt he could not bear the tension .  five minutes and he would take his place as the galaxy   s greatest hero or its greatest traitor .  there was a horrible  unbearable pounding of blood in his temples .   then it came .   contact .  .   the screen went wild in a chaotic fury of twisted metal .  the anti acceleration seats shrieked as springs absorbed the shock .  things cleared slowly .  the screenview veered wildly as the ship slowly steadied .  the ship   s needle had broken  the jagged stump twisted awry  but the enemy vessel it had pierced was a gutted wreck .   sanat held his breath as he scanned space .  it was a vast sea of wrecked ships  and on the outskirts tattered remnants of the enemy were in flight  with human ships in pursuit .   there was the sound of colossal cheering behind him and a pair of strong hands on his shoulders .   he turned .  it was smitt smitt  the veteran of five wars  with tears in his eyes .      filip     he said     we   ve won .  we   ve just received word from vega .  the lhasinuic home fleet has been smashed  and also with the needles .  the war is over  and we   ve woo  you   ve won  filip .  you .      his grip was painful  but loara filip sanat did not mind that .  for a single  ecstatic moment  he stood motionless  face transfigured .   earth was free .  humanity was saved .     the end    for some reason  possibly because of the awful title  for which i emphatically disclaim responsibility     black friar of the flame    is taken as the quintessence of my early incompetence .  at least  fans who come across a copy think they can embarrass me by referring to it .     well  it isn   t good  i admit  but it has its interesting points .   for one thing  it is an obvious precursor to my successful    foundation    series .  in    black friar of the flame     as in the    foundation    series  human beings occupy many planets  and two worlds mentioned in the former  trantor and santanni  also play important roles in the latter .   indeed  the first of the    foundation    series was to appear only a couple of months after    black friar of the flame     thanks to the delay in selling the latter .    furthermore  there is also a strong suggestion in    black friar of the flame    of my first book length novel .  pebble in the sky  which was to appear eight years later .  in both  the situation i pictured on earth was inspired by that of judea under the romans .  the climactic battle in    black friar of the flame     however  was inspired by that of the battle of salamis  the great victory of the greeks over the persians .   in telling future history i always felt it wisest to be guided by past history .  this was true in the    foundation    series  too .       black friar of the flame    cured me forever  by the way  of attempting repeated revisions .  there may well be a connection between the consensus that the story is a poor one and the fact that it was revised six times .  i know that there are writers who revise and revise and revise  polishing everything to a high gloss  but i can   t do that .   it is my habit now to begin by typing a first draft without an outline .  i compose freely on the typewriter though i am frequently questioned about this by readers who seem to think an initial draft can be only in pencil .  actually  writing by hand begins to hurt my wrist after fifteen minutes or so  is very slow  and is hard to read .  i can type  on the other hand  ninety words a minute and keep that up for hours without difficulty .  as for outlines  i tried one once and it was disastrous  like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket .   having completed the first draft  i go over it and correct it in pen and ink .  i then retype the whole thing as the final copy .  i revise no more  of my own volition .  if ah editor asks for a clearly defined revision of a minor nature  with the philosophy of which i agree  i oblige .  a request for a major  top to bottom revision  or a second revision after the first  is another matter altogether .  then i do refuse .   this is not out of arrogance or temperament .  it is just that too large a revision  or too many revisions  indicate that the piece of writing is a failure .  in the time it would take to salvage such a failure  i could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process .   doing a revision is something like chewing used gum .   failures are therefore put to one side and held for possible sale elsewhere for what is a failure to one editor is not necessarily a failure to another .     about the time i was working on    black friar of the flame    i was becoming enmeshed in fan activities .  i had joined an organization called    the futurians     which contained a group of ardent science fiction readers  almost all of whom were to become important in the field as writers or editors or both .  included among them were frederik pohl  donald a .  wollheim  cyril kornbluth  richard wilson  damon knight  and so on .   as i had occasion to say before  i became particularly friendly with pohl .  during the spring and summer of       he visited me periodically  looking over my manuscripts and announcing that i had the    best bunch of rejected stories    he had ever seen .   the possibility began to arise that he might be my agent .  he was no older than myself  but he had a great deal more practical experience with editors and knew a great deal more about the field .  i was tempted  but was afraid this might mean i would not be allowed to see campbell any more  and i valued my monthly visits with him too much to risk it .   in may      i wrote a story i called    robbie     and on the twenty third of that month i submitted it to campbell .  it was the first robot story i had ever written and it contained the germ of what later came to be known as the    three laws of robotics .     fred read my carbon and at once said it was a good story but that campbell would reject it because it had a weak ending plus other shortcomings .  campbell did reject it on june    for precisely the reasons pohl had given me .   i was very impressed by that  and any hesitation i had with respect to letting him represent me vanished but i specified that his agentship must be confined to editors other than campbell .   i gave him    robbie    after the rejection  but he didn   t succeed in selling it either  though he even submitted it to a british science fiction magazine  something i would myself never have thought of doing  .  in october       however  he himself became editor of astonishing stories and super science stories  and he therefore ceased being my agent .   a decade later he became my agent again for a few years .  i never enjoyed being represented  however  and except for pohl on these two occasions  i have never had an agent  despite the vast and complicated nature of my writing commitments .  nor do i intend ever having one .    on march           however  he did as editor what he couldn   t do as agent .  he placed the story by taking it himself .   it appeared in super science stories under a changed title .   pohl was always changing titles .   he called the story    strange playfellow     a miserable choice  in my opinion .  eventually the story was included as the first of the nine connected    positronic robot    series that made up my book i  robot .  in the book  i restored the title to the original    robbie     and it has appeared as    robbie    in every form in which the story has been published since .   fifteen years later  a daughter was born to me .  she was named robyn and i call her robbie .  i have been asked more than once whether there is a connection .  did i deliberately give her a name close to    robot    because i made such a success of my robot stories .  the answer is a flat negative .  the whole thing is pure coincidence .   one more thing  in the course of my meeting with campbell on june          the one in which he rejected    robbie      i met a by then quite well established science fiction writer  l .  sprague de camp .  that started a close friendship  perhaps my closest within the science fiction fraternity     that has continued to this day .     in june      i wrote    half breed    and decided to give fred pohl a fair chance .  i did not submit it to campbell  but gave it to pohl directly to see what he could do with it .  he tried amazing  which rejected it .  so i took it back and tried campbell in the usual direct fashion .  campbell rejected it  too .   when pohl became an editor  however  he announced the fact to me  on october           by saying that he was taking    half breed .     in later months he also took first    robbie     then    the callistan menace .     he bought seven stories from me altogether during his editorial tenure .       half breed     jefferson scanlon wiped a perspiring brow and took a deep breath .  with trembling finger  he reached for the switch and changed his mind .  his latest model  representing over three months of solid work  was very nearly his last hope .  a good part of the fifteen thousand dollars he had been able to borrow was in it .  and now the closing of a switch would show whether he won or lost  scanlon cursed himself for a coward and grasped the switch firmly .  he snapped it down and flicked it open again with one swift movement .  and nothing happened his eyes  strain though they might  caught no flash of surging power .  the pit of his stomach froze  and he closed the switch again  savagely  and left it closed .  nothing happened  the machine  again  was a failure .   he buried his aching head in his hands  and groaned .     oh  god .  it should work it should .  my math is right and i   ve produced the fields i want .  by every law of science  those fields should crack the atom .     he arose  opening the useless switch  and paced the floor in deep thought .   his theory was right .  his equipment was cut neatly to the pattern of his equations .  if the theory was right  the equipment must be wrong .  but the equipment was right  so the theory must .  .  .   .     i   m getting out of here before i go crazy     he said to the four walls .   he snatched his hat and coat from the peg behind the door and was out of the house in a whirlwind of motion  slamming the door behind him in a gust of fury .         atomic power .  atomic power .  atomic power .   the two words repeated themselves over and over again  singing a monotonous  maddening song in his brain .  a siren song .  it was luring him to destruction  for this dream he had given up a safe and comfortable professorship at m . i . t .  for it  he had become a middle aged man at thirty the first flush of youth long gone  an apparent failure .   and now his money was vanishing rapidly .  if the love of money is the root of all evil  the need of money is most certainly the root of all despair .  scanlon smiled a little at the thought rather neat .   of course  there were the beautiful prospects in store if he could ever bridge the gap he had found between theory and practice .  the whole world would be his mars too  and even the unvisited planets .  all his .  all he had to do was to find out what was wrong with his mathematics no  he   d checked that  it was in the equipment .  although  he groaned aloud once more .   the gloomy train of his thoughts was broken as he suddenly became aware of a tumult of boyish shouts not far off .  scanlon frowned .  he hated noise especially when he was in the dumps .   the shouts became louder and dissolved into scraps of words     get him  johnny .        whee look at him run .      a dozen boys careened out from behind a large frame building  not two hundred yards away  and ran pell mell in scanlon   s general direction .   in spite of himself  scanlon regarded the yelling group curiously .  they were chasing something or other  with the heartless glee of children .  in the dimness he couldn   t make out just what it was .  he screened his eyes and squinted .  a sudden motion and a lone figure disengaged itself from the crowd and ran frantically .   scanlon almost dropped his solacing pipe in astonishment  for the fugitive was a tweenie an earth mars half breed .  there was no mistaking that brush of wiry  dead white hair that rose stiffly in all directions like porcupine quills .  scanlon marvelled what was one of those things doing outside an asylum .   the boys had caught up with the tweenie again  and the fugitive was lost to sight .  the yells increased in volume  scanlon  shocked  saw a heavy board rise and fall with a thud .  a profound sense of the enormity of his own actions in standing idly by while a helpless creature was being hounded by a crew of gamins came to him  and before he quite realized it he was charging down upon them  fists waving threateningly in the air .      seat  you heathens .  get out of here before i     the point of his foot came into violent contact with the seat of the nearest hoodlum  and his arms sent two more tumbling .   the entrance of the new force changed the situation considerably .  boys  whatever their superiority in numbers  have an instinctive fear of adults  especially such a shouting  ferocious adult as scanlon appeared to be .  in less time than it took scanlon to realize it they were gone  and he was left alone with the tweenie  who lay half prone  and who between panting sobs cast fearful and uncertain glances at his deliverer .      are you hurt .     asked scanlon gruffly .      no  sir .     the tweenie rose unsteadily  his high silver crest of hair swaying incongruously .     i twisted my ankle a bit  but i can walk .  i   ll go now .  thank you very much for helping me .         hold on .  wait .     scanlon   s voice was much softer  for it dawned on him that the tweenie  though almost full grown  was incredibly gaunt  that his clothes were a mere mass of dirty rags  and that there was a heart rending look of utter weariness on his thin face .      here     he said  as the tweenie turned towards him again        are you hungry .      the tweenie   s face twisted as though he were fighting a battle within himself .  when he spoke it was in a low  embarrassed voice .     yes i am  a little .         you look it .  come with me to my house     he jerked a thumb over his shoulder .     you ought to eat looks like you can do with a wash and a change of clothes  too .     he turned and led the way .   he didn   t speak again until he had opened his front door and entered the hall .     i think you   d better take a bath first  boy .  there   s the bathroom .  hurry into it and lock the door before beulah sees you .      his admonition came too late .  a sudden  startled gasp caused scanlon to whirl about  the picture of guilt  and the tweenie to shrink backwards into the shadow of a hat rack .   beulah  seanlon   s housekeeper  scurried towards them  her mild face aflame with indignation and her short  plump body exuding exasperation at every pore .      jefferson scanlon .  jefferson .     she glared at the tweenie with shocked disgust .     how can you bring such a thing into this house .  have you lost your sense of morals .      the poor tweenie was washed away with the flow of her anger  but scanlon  after his first momentary panic  collected himself .     come come  beulah .  this isn   t like you .  here   s a poor fellow creature  starved  tired  beaten by a crowd of boys  and you have no pity for him .  i   m really disappointed in you  beulah .         disappointed .     sniffed the housekeeper  though touched .     because of that disgraceful thing .  he should be in an institution where they keep such monsters .         all right  we   ll talk about it later .  go ahead  boy  take your bath .  and  beulah  see if you can   t rustle up some old clothes of mine .      with a last look of disapproval  beulah flounced out of the room .      don   t mind her  boy     scanlon said when she left    she was my nurse once and she still has a sort of proprietary interest in me .  she won   t harm you .  go take your bath .        the tweenie was a different person altogether when he finally seated himself at the dining room table .  now that the layer of grime was removed  there was something quite handsome about his thin face  and his high  clear forehead gave him a markedly intellectual look .  his hair still stood erect  a foot tall  in spite of the moistening it had received .  in the light its brilliant whiteness took an imposing dignity  and to scanlon it seemed to lose all ugliness .      do you like cold chicken .     asked scanlon .      oh  yes .     enthusiastically .      then pitch in .  and when you finish that  you can have more .  take anything on the table .      the tweenie   s eyes glistened as he set his jaws to work  and  between the two of them  the table was bare in a few minutes .      well  now     exclaimed scanlon when the repast had reached its end     i think you might answer some questions now .  what   s your name .         they called me max .         ah .  and your last name .      the tweenie shrugged his shoulders .     they never called me anything but max when they spoke to me at all .  i don   t suppose a half breed needs a name .     there was no mistaking the bitterness in his voice .      but what were you doing running wild through the country .  why aren   t you where you live .         i was in a home .  anything is better than being in a home even the world outside  which i had never seen .  especially after tom died .         who was tom  max .     scanlon spoke softly .      he was the only other one like me .  he was younger  fifteen but he died .     he looked up from the table  fury in his eyes .     they killed him  mr .  scanlon .  he was such a young fellow  and so friendly .  he couldn   t stand being alone the way i could .  he needed friends and fun  and all he had was me .  no one else would speak to him  because he was a half breed .  and when he died i couldn   t stand it anymore either .  i left        they meant to be kind .  max .  you shouldn   t have done that you   re not like other people  they don   t understand you .  and they must have done something for you .  you talk as though you   ve had some education .         i could attend classes  all right     he assented gloomily .     but i had to sit in a corner away from all the others .  they let me read all i wanted  though  and i   m thankful for that .         well  there you are .  max .  you weren   t so badly off  were you .      max lifted his head and stared at the other suspiciously .     you   re not going to send me back  are you .     he half rose  as though ready for instant flight .   scanlon coughed uneasily .     of course  if you don   t want to go back i won   t make you .  but it would be the best thing for you .         it wouldn   t .     max cried vehemently .      well  have it your own way .  anyway  i think you   d better go to sleep now .  you need it .  we   ll talk in the morning .      he led the still suspicious tweenie up to the second floor  and pointed out a small bedroom .     that   s yours for the night i   ll be in the next room later on  and if you need anything just shout .     he turned to leave  then thought of something .     but remember  you mustn   t try to run away during the night        word of honor .  i won   t     scanlon retired thoughtfully to the room he called his study .  he lit a dim lamp and seated himself in a worn armchair .  for ten minutes he sat without moving  and for the first time in six years thought about something besides his dream of atomic power .   a quiet knock sounded  and at his grunted acknowledgment beulah entered .  she was frowning  her lips pursed .  she planted herself firmly before him .      oh  jefferson .  to think that you should do this .  if your dear mother knew .  .  .         sit down  beulah     scanlon waved at another chair     and don   t worry about my mother .  she wouldn   t have minded .         no .  your father was a good hearted simpleton  too .  you   re just like him  jefferson .  first you spend all your money on silly machines that might blow the house up any day and now you pick up that awful creature from the streets .   .   .   .  tell me  jefferson     there was a solemn and fearful pause     are you thinking of keeping it .      scanlon smiled moodily .     i think i am  beulah .  i can   t very well do anything else .        a week later scanlon was in his workshop .  during the night before  his brain  rested by the change in the monotony brought about by the presence of max  had thought of a possible solution to the puzzle of why his machine wouldn   t work .  perhaps some of the parts were defective  he thought .  even a very slight flaw in some of the parts could render the machine inoperative .   he plunged into work ardently .  at the end of half an hour the machine lay scattered on his workbench  and scanlon was sitting on a high stool  eying it disconsolately .   he scarcely heard the door softly open and close .  it wasn   t until the intruder had coughed twice that the absorbed inventor realized another was present .      oh it   s max .     his abstracted gaze gave way to recognition .     did you want to see me .         if you   re busy i can wait  mr .  scanlon .     the week had not removed his shyness .     but there were a lot of books in my room .   .   .         books .  oh  i   ll have them cleaned out  if you don   t want them .  i don   t suppose you do  they   re mostly textbooks  as i remember .  a bit too advanced for you just now .         oh  it   s not too difficult     max assured him .  he pointed to a book he was carrying .     i just wanted you to explain a bit here in quantum mechanics .  there   s some math with integral calculus that i don   t quite understand .  it bothers me .  here  wait till i find it .      he ruffled the pages  but stopped suddenly as he became aware of his surroundings .     oh say are you breaking up your model .      the question brought the hard facts back to scanlon at a bound .  he smiled bitterly .     no  not yet .  i just thought there might be something wrong with the insulation or the connections that kept it from functioning .  there isn   t i   ve made a mistake somewhere .         that   s too bad  mr .  scanlon .     the tweenie   s smooth brow wrinkled mournfully .      the worst of it is that i can   t imagine what   s wrong .  i   m positive the theory   s perfect i   ve checked every way i can .  i   ve gone over the mathematics time and time again  and each time it says the same thing .  space distortion fields of such and such an intensity will smash the atom to smithereens .  only they don   t .         may i see the equations .      scanlon gazed at his ward quizzically  but could see nothing in his face other than the most serious interest he shrugged his shoulders .     there they are under that ream of yellow paper on the desk .  i don   t know if you can read them  though .  i   ve been too lazy to type them out  and my handwriting is pretty bad .      max scrutinized them carefully and flipped the sheets one by one .     it   s a bit over my head  i guess .      the inventor smiled a little .     i rather thought they would be .  max .      he looked around the littered room  and a sudden sense of anger came over him .  why wouldn   t the thing work .  abruptly he got up and snatched his coat    i   m going out of here .  max     he said .     tell beulah not to make me anything hot for lunch .  it would be cold before i got back .        it was afternoon when he opened the front door  and hunger was sharp enough to prevent him from realizing with a puzzled start that someone was at work in his laboratory .  there came to his ears a sharp buzzing sound followed by a momentary silence and then again the buzz which this time merged into a sharp crackling that lasted an instant and was gone .   he bounded down the hall and threw open the laboratory door .  the sight that met his eyes froze him into an attitude of sheer astonishment stunned incomprehension .   slowly  he understood the message of his senses .  his precious atomic motor had been put together again  but this time in a manner so strange as to be senseless  for even his trained eye could see no reasonable relationship among the various parts .   he wondered stupidly if it were a nightmare or a practical joke  and then everything became clear to him at one bound  for there at the other end of the room was the unmistakable sight of a brush of silver hair protruding from above a bench  swaying gently from side to side as the hidden owner of the brush moved .      max .     shouted the distraught inventor  in tones of fury .  evidently the foolish boy had allowed his interest to inveigle him into idle and dangerous experiments .   at the sound  max lifted a pale face which upon the sight of his guardian turned a dull red .  he approached scanlon with reluctant steps .      what have you done .     cried scanlon  staring about him angrily .     do you know what you   ve been playing with .  there   s enough juice running through this thing to electrocute you twice over .         i   m sorry  mr .  scanlon .  i had a rather silly idea about all this when i looked over the equations  but i was afraid to say anything because you know so much more than i do .  after you went away  i couldn   t resist the temptation to try it out  though i didn   t intend to go this far .  i thought i   d have it apart again before you came back .      there was a silence that lasted a long time .  when scanlon spoke again  his voice was curiously mild     well  what have you done .         you won   t be angry .         it   s a little too late for that .  you couldn   t have made it much worse  anyway .         well  i noticed here in your equations     he extracted one sheet and then another and pointed     that whenever the expression representing the space distortion fields occurs  it is always referred to as a function of x  plus y    plus z    .  since the fields  as far as i could see  were always referred to as constants  that would give you the equation of a sphere .      scanlon nodded     i noticed that  but it has nothing to do with the problem .         well  i thought it might indicate the necessary arrangement of the individual fields  so i disconnected the distorters and hooked them up again in a sphere .      the inventor   s mouth fell open .  the mysterious rearrangement of his device seemed clear now and what was more  eminently sensible .      does it work .     he asked .      i   m not quite sure .  the parts haven   t been made to fit this arrangement so that it   s only a rough set up at best .  then there   s the constant error         but does it work .  close the switch  damn it .     scanlon was all fire and impatience once more .      all right  stand back .  i cut the power to one tenth normal so we won   t get more output than we can handle .        he closed the switch slowly  and at the moment of contact  a glowing ball of blue white flame leaped into being from the recesses of the central quartz chamber .  scanlon screened his eyes automatically  and sought the output gauge .  the needle was climbing steadily and did not stop until it was pressing the upper limit .  the flame burned continuously  releasing no heat seemingly  though beside its light  more intensely brilliant than a magnesium flare  the electric lights faded into dingy yellowness .   max opened the switch once more and the ball of flame reddened and died  leaving the room comparatively dark and red .  the output gauge sank to zero once more and scanlon felt his knees give beneath him as he sprawled onto a chair .   he fastened his gaze on the flustered tweenie and in that look there was respect and awe  and something more  too  for there was fear .  never before had he really realized that the tweenie was not of earth or mars but a member of a race apart .  he noticed the difference now  not in the comparatively minor physical changes  but in the profound and searching mental gulf that he only now comprehended .      atomic power .     he croaked hoarsely .     and solved by a boy  not yet twenty years old .      max   s confusion was painful     you did all the real work  mr .  scanlon  years and years of it .  i just happened to notice a little detail that you might have caught yourself the next day .     his voice died before the fixed and steady stare of the inventor .      atomic power the greatest achievement of man so far  and we actually have it  we two .      both guardian and ward seemed awed at the grandeur and power of the thing they had created .   and in that moment the age of electricity died .     jefferson scanlon sucked at his pipe contentedly .  outside  the snow was falling and the chill of winter was in the air  but inside  in the comfortable warmth  scanlon sat and smoked and smiled to himself .  across the way  beulah  likewise quietly happy  hummed softly in time to clicking knitting needles  stopping only occasionally as her fingers flew through an unusually intricate portion of the pattern .  in the corner next the window sat max  occupied in his usual pastime of reading  and scanlon reflected with faint surprise that of late max had confined his reading to light novels .   much had happened since that well remembered day over a year ago .  for one thing  scanlon was now a world famous and world adored scientist  and it would have been strange had he not been sufficiently human to be proud of it .  secondly  and scarcely less important  atomic power was remaking the world .   scanlon thanked all the powers that were  over and over again  for the fact that war was a thing of two centuries past  for otherwise atomic power would have been the final ruination of civilization .  as it was  the coalition of world powers that now controlled the great force of atomic power proved it a real blessing and were introducing it into man   s life in the slow  gradual stages necessary to prevent economic upheaval  already  interplanetary travel had been revolutionized .  from hazardous gambles  trips to mars and venus had become holiday jaunts to be negotiated in a third of the previous time  and trips to the outer planets were at last feasible .   scanlon settled back further in his chair  and pondered once more upon the only fly in his wonderful pot of ointment max had refused all credit  stormily and violently refused to have his name as much as mentioned .  the injustice of it galled scanlon  but aside from a vague mention of    capable assistants    he had said nothing  and the thought of it still made him feel an ace of a cad .   a sharp explosive noise brought him out of his reverie and he turned startled eyes towards max  who had suddenly closed his book with a peevish slap .      hello     exclaimed scanlon     and what   s wrong now .      max tossed the book aside and stood up  his underlip thrust out in a pout     i   m lonely  that   s all .      scanlon   s face fell  and he felt at an uncomfortable loss for words .     i guess i know that .  max     he said softly  at length .     i   m sorry for you  but the conditions are so      max relented  and brightening up  placed an affectionate arm about his foster father   s shoulder     i didn   t mean it that way  you know .  it   s just well  i can   t say it but it   s that you get to wishing you had someone your own age to talk to  someone of your own kind .      beulah looked up and bestowed a penetrating glance upon the young tweenie but said nothing .   scanlon considered     you   re right  son  in a way .  a friend and companion is the best thing a fellow can have  and i   m afraid beulah and i don   t qualify in that respect .  one of your own kind  as you say  would be the ideal solution  but that   s a tough proposition .     he rubbed his nose with one finger and gazed at the ceiling thoughtfully .   max opened his mouth as if he were going to say something more  but changed his mind and turned pink for no evident reason .  then he muttered  barely loud enough for scanlon to hear     i   m being silly .     with an abrupt turn he marched out of the room  banging the door loudly as he left .   the older man gazed after him with undisguised surprise     well .  what a funny way to act .  what   s got into him lately  anyway .      beulah halted the nimbly leaping needles long enough to remark acidly     men are born fools and blind into the bargain .         is that so .     was the somewhat nettled response     and do you know what   s biting him .         i certainly do .  it   s as plain as that terrible tie you   re wearing .  i   ve seen it for months now .  poor fellow .      scanlon shook his head     you   re speaking in riddles  beulah .      the housekeeper laid her knitting aside and glanced at the inventor wearily     it   s very simple .  the boy is twenty .  he needs company .         but that   s just what he said .  is that your marvelous penetration .         good land  jefferson .  has it been so long since you were twenty yourself .  do you mean to say that you honestly think he   s referring to male company .         oh     said scanlon  and then brightening suddenly     oh .     he giggled in an inane manner .      well  what are you going to do about it .         why why  nothing .  what can be done .         that   s a fine way to speak of our ward  when you   re rich enough to buy five hundred orphan asylums from basement to roof and never miss the money .  it should be the easiest thing in the world to find a likely looking young lady tweenie to keep him company .      scanlon gazed at her  a look of intense horror on his face     are you serious  beulah .  are you trying to suggest that i go shopping for a female tweenie for max .  why why  what do i know about women especially tweenie women .  i don   t know his standards .  i   m liable to pick one he   ll consider an ugly hag .         don   t raise silly objections  jefferson .  outside of the hair  they   re the same in looks as anyone else  and i   ll leave it to you to pick a pretty one .  there never was a bachelor old and crabbed enough not to be able to do that .         no .  i won   t do it .  of all the horrible ideas         jefferson .  you   re his guardian .  you owe it to him .      the words struck the inventor forcibly     i owe it to him     he repeated .     you   re right there  more right than you know .     he sighed     i guess it   s got to be done .        scanlon shifted uneasily from one trembling foot to the other under the piercing stare of the vinegar faced official  whose name board proclaimed in large letters miss martin  superintendent .      sit down  sir     she said sourly .     what do you wish .      scanlon cleared his throat .  he had lost count of the asylums visited up to now and the task was rapidly becoming too much for him .  he made a mental vow that this would be the last either they would have a tweenie of the proper sex  age  and appearance or he would throw up the whole thing as a bad job .      i have come to see     he began  in a carefully prepared  but stammered speech     if there are any twee martian half breeds in your asylum .  it is  .         we have three     interrupted the superintendent sharply .      any females .     asked scanlon  eagerly .      all females     she replied  and her eye glittered with disapproving suspicion .      oh  good .  do you mind if i see them .  it is  .      miss martin   s cold glance did not weaver     pardon me  but before we go any further  i would like to know whether you   re thinking of adopting a half breed .         i would like to take out guardianship papers if i am suited .  is that so very unusual .         it certainly is     was the prompt retort .     you understand that in any such case  we must first make a thorough investigation of the family   s status  both financial and social .  it is the opinion of the government that these creatures are better off under state supervision  and adoption would be a difficult matter .         i know  madam  i know .  i   ve had practical experience in this matter about fifteen months ago  i believe i can give you satisfaction as to my financial and social status without much trouble .  my name is jefferson scanlon  .         jefferson scanlon .     her exclamation was half a scream .  in a trice  her face expanded into a servile smile     why of course .  i should have recognized you from the many pictures i   ve seen of you .  how stupid of me .  pray do not trouble yourself with any further references .  i   m sure that in your case     this with a particularly genial expression     no red tape need be necessary .      she sounded a desk bell furiously .     bring down madeline and the two little ones as soon as you can     she snapped at the frightened maid who answered .     have them cleaned up and warn them to be on their best behavior .      with this  she turned to scanlon once more     it will not take long  mr .  scanlon .  it is really such a great honor to have you here with us  and i am so ashamed at my abrupt treatment of you earlier .  at first i didn   t recognize you  though i saw immediately that you were someone of importance .      if scanlon had been upset by the superintendent   s former harsh haughtiness  he was entirely unnerved by her effusive geniality .  he wiped his profusely perspiring brow time and time again  answering in incoherent monosyllables the vivacious questions put to him .  it was just as he had come to the wild decision of taking to his heels and escaping from the she dragon by flight that the maid announced the three tweenies and saved the situation .   scanlon surveyed the three half breeds with interest and sudden satisfaction .  two were mere children  perhaps ten years of age  but the third  some eighteen years old  was eligible from every point of view .     her slight form was lithe and graceful even in the quiet attitude of waiting that she had assumed  and scanlon     dried up  dyed in the wool bachelor    though he was  could not restrain a light nod of approval .   her face was certainly what beulah would call    likely looking    and her eyes  now bent towards the floor in shy confusion  were of a deep blue  which seemed a great point to scanlon .   even her strange hair was beautiful .  it was only moderately high  not nearly the size of max   s lordly male crest  and its silky white sheen caught the sunbeams and sent them back in glistening highlights .   the two little ones grasped the skirt of their elder companion with tight grips and regarded the two adults in wide eyed fright which increased as time passed .      i believe .  miss martin  that the young lady will do     re    marked scanlon .     she is exactly what i had in mind .  could you tell me how soon guardianship papers could be drawn up .         i could have them ready for you tomorrow  mr .  scanlon .  in an unusual case such as yours  i could easily make special arrangements .         thank you .  i shall be back then      he was interrupted .  by a loud sniffle .  one of the little tweenies could stand it no longer and had burst into tears  followed soon by the other .      madeline     cried miss martin to the eighteen year old .     please keep rose and blanche quiet this is an abominable exhibition .      scanlon intervened .  it seemed to him that madeline was rather pale and though she smiled and soothed the youngsters he was certain that there were tears in her eyes .      perhaps     he suggested     the young lady has no wish to leave the institution .  of course  i wouldn   t think of taking her on any but a purely voluntary basis .      miss martin smiled superciliously     she won   t make any trouble .     she turned to the young girl     you   ve heard of the great jefferson scanlon  haven   t you .         ye es  miss martin     replied the girl  in a low voice .      let me handle this .  miss martin     urged scanlon .     tell me  girl  would you really prefer to stay here .         oh  no     she replied earnestly     i would be very glad to leave  though     with an apprehensive glance at miss martin     i have been very well treated here .  but you see what   s to be done with the two little ones .  i   m all they have  and if i left  they they      she broke down and snatched them to her with a sudden  fierce grip     i don   t want to leave them  sir .     she kissed each softly     don   t cry  children .  i won   t leave you .  they won   t take me away .      scanlon swallowed with difficulty and groped for a handkerchief with which to blow his nose .  miss martin gazed on with disapproving hauteur .      don   t mind the silly thing  mr .  scanlon     said she .     i believe i can have everything ready by tomorrow noon .         have ready guardianship papers for all three     was the gruff reply .      what .  all three .  are you serious .         certainly .  i can do it if i wish  can   t i .     he shouted .      why  of course  but      scanlon left precipitately  leaving both madeline and miss martin petrified  the latter with utter stupefaction  the former in a sudden upsurge of happiness .  even the ten year olds sensed the change in affairs and subsided into occasional sobs .     beulah   s surprise  when she met them at the airport and saw three tweenies where she had expected one  is not to be described .  but  on the whole  the surprise was a pleasant one  for little rose and blanche took to the elderly housekeeper immediately .  their first greeting was to bestow great  moist kisses upon beulah   s lined cheeks at which she glowed with joy and kissed them in turn .   with madeline she was enchanted  whispering to scanlon that he knew a little more about such matters than he pretended .      if she had decent hair     whispered scanlon in reply     i   d marry her myself .  that i would     and he smiled in great self    satisfaction .   the arrival at home in mid afternoon was the occasion of great excitement on the part of the two oldsters .  scanlon inveigled max into accompanying him on a long walk together in the woods  and when the unsuspecting max left  puzzled but willing  beulah busied herself with setting the three newcomers at their ease .   they were shown over the house from top to bottom  the rooms assigned to them being indicated .  beulah prattled away continuously  joking and chaffing  until the tweenies had lost all their shyness and felt as if they had known her forever .   then  as the winter evening approached  she turned to madeline rather abruptly and said     it   s getting late .  do you want to come downstairs with me and help prepare supper for the men .      madeline was taken aback     the men .  is there  then  someone besides mr .  scanlon .         oh  yes .  there   s max .  you haven   t seen him yet         is max a relation of yours .         no  child .  he   s another of mr .  scanlon   s wards .         oh  i see .     she blushed and her hand rose involuntarily to her hair .   beulah saw in a moment the thoughts passing through her head and added in a softer voice     don   t worry  dear .  he won   t mind your being a tweenie .  he   ll be glad to see you .        it turned out  though  that    glad    was an entirely inadequate adjective when applied to max   s emotions at the first sight of madeline .   he tramped into the house in advance of scanlon  taking off his overcoat and stamping the snow off his shoes as he did so .      oh  boy     he cried at the half frozen inventor who followed him in     why you were so anxious to saunter about on a freezer like today i don   t know .     he sniffed the air appreciatively     ah  do i smell lamb chops .     and he made for the dining room in double quick time .   it was at the threshold that he stopped suddenly  and gasped for air as if in the last throes of suffocation .  scanlon dipped by and sat down .      come on     he said  enjoying the other   s brick red visage .     sit down .  we have company today .  this is madeline and this s rose and this is blanche .  and this     he turned to the seated girls and noted with satisfaction that madeline   s pink face was burning a fixed glance of confusion upon the plate before her     is my ward .  max .         how do you do     murmured max  eyes like saucers     i   m pleased to meet you .      rose and blanche shouted cheery greetings in reply but madeline only raised her eyes fleetingly and then dropped them again .   the meal was a singularly quiet one .  max  though he had complained of a ravenous hunger all afternoon  allowed his chop and mashed potatoes to die of cold before him  while madeline played with her food as if she did not know what it was there for .  scanlon and beulah ate quietly and well  exchanging sly glances between bites .   scanlon sneaked off after dinner  for he rightly felt that the more tactful touch of a woman was needed in these matters  and when beulah joined him in his study some hours later  he saw at a glance that he had been correct .      i   ve broken the ice     she said happily     they   re telling each other their life histories now and are getting along wonderfully .  they   re still afraid of each other  though  and insist on sitting at opposite ends of the room  but that   ll wear off and pretty quickly  too .         it   s a fine match  beulah  eh .         a finer one i   ve never seen .  and little rose and blanche are angels .  i   ve just put them to bed .      there was a short silence  and then beulah continued softly     that was the only time you were right and i was wrong  that time you first brought max into the house and i objected  but that one time makes up for everything else .  you are a credit to your dear mother  jefferson .      scanlon nodded soberly     i wish i could make all tweenies on earth so happy .  it would be such a simple thing .  if we treated them like humans instead of like criminals and gave them homes built especially for them and calculated especially for their happiness         well  why don   t you do it .     interrupted beulah .   scanlon turned a serious eye upon the old housekeeper     that   s exactly what i was leading up to .     his voice lapsed into a dreamy murmur     just think .  a town of tweenies run by them and for them with its own governing officials and its own schools and its own public utilities .  a little world within a world where the tweenie can consider himself a human being instead of a freak surrounded and looked down upon by endless multitudes of pure bloods .      he reached for his pipe and filled it slowly     the world owes a debt to one tweenie which it can never repay and i owe it to him as well .  i   m going to do it .  i   m going to create tweenietown .      that night he did not go to sleep .  the stars turned in their grand circles and paled at last .  the grey of dawn came and grew  but still scanlon sat unmoving dreaming and planning .     at eighty  age sat lightly upon jefferson scanlon   s head .  the spring was gone from his step  the sturdy straightness from his shoulders  but his robust health had not failed him  and his mind  beneath the shock of hair  now as white as any tweenie   s  still worked with undiminished vigor .   a happy life is not an aging one  and for forty years now  scanlon had watched tweenietown grow  and in the watching  had found happiness .   he could see it now stretched before him like a large  beautiful painting as he gazed out the window .  a little gem of a town with a population of slightly more than a thousand  nestling amid three hundred square miles of fertile ohio land .   neat and sturdy houses  wide  clean streets  parks  theatres  schools  stores a model town  bespeaking decades of intelligent effort and co operation .   the door opened behind him and he recognized the soft step without needing to turn     is that you  madeline .         yes  father     for by no other title was he known to any inhabitant of tweenietown .     max is returning with mr .  johanson .         that   s good     he gazed at madeline tenderly .     we   ve seen tweenietown grow since those days long ago  haven   t we .      madeline nodded and sighed .      don   t sigh  dear .  it   s been well worth the years we   ve given to it .  if only beulah had lived to see it now .      he shook his head as he thought of the old housekeeper  dead now a quarter of a century .      don   t think such sad thoughts     admonished madeline in her turn .     here comes mr .  johanson .  remember it   s the fortieth anniversary and a happy day  not a sad one .        charles b .  johanson was what is known as a    shrewd    man .  that is  he was an intelligent  far seeing person  comparatively well versed in the sciences  but one who was wont to put these good qualities into practice only in order to advance his own interest .  consequently  he went far in politics and was the first appointee to the newly created cabinet post of science and technology .   it was the first official act of his to visit the world   s greatest scientist and inventor  jefferson scanlon  who  in his old age  still had no peer in the number of useful inventions turned over to the government every year .  tweenietown was a considerable surprise to him .  it was known rather vaguely in the outside world that the town existed  and it was considered a hobby of the old scientist a harmless eccentricity .  johanson found it a well worked out project of sinister connotations .   his attitude  however  when he entered scanlon   s room in company with his erstwhile guide .  max  was one of frank geniality  concealing well certain thoughts that swept through his mind .      ah  johanson     greeted scanlon     you   re back .  what do you think of all this .     his arm made a wide sweep .      it is surprising something marvelous to behold     johanson assured him .   scanlon chuckled     glad to hear it .  we have a population of      now and growing every day .  you   ve seen what we   ve done already but it   s nothing to what we are going to do in the future even after my death .  however  there is something i wish to see done before i die and for that i   ll need your help .      and that is .     questioned the secretary of science and technology guardedly .      just this .  that you sponsor measures giving these tweenies  these so long despised half breeds  full equality  political   legal  economic  social  with terrestrials and martians .      johanson hesitated     it would be difficult .  there is a certain amount of perhaps understandable prejudice against them  and until we can convince earth that the tweenies deserve equality     he shook his head doubtfully .      deserve equality .     exclaimed scanlon  vehemently     why  they deserve more .  i am moderate in my demands .     at these words .  max  sitting quietly in a corner  looked up and bit his lip  but said nothing as scanlon continued     you don   t know the true worth of these tweenies .  they combine the best of earth and mars .  they possess the cold  analytical reasoning powers of the martians together with the emotional drive and boundless energy of the earthman .  as far as intellect is concerned  they are your superior and mine  every one of them .  i ask only equality .      the secretary smiled soothingly     your zeal misleads you perhaps  my dear scanlon .         it does not .  why do you suppose i turn out so many successful gadgets like this gravitational shield i created a few years back .  do you think i could have done it without my tweenie assistants .  it was max here     max dropped his eyes before the sudden piercing gaze of the cabinet member     that put the final touch upon my discovery of atomic power itself .      scanlon threw caution to the winds  as he grew excited     ask professor whitsun of stanford and he   ll tell you .  he   s a world authority on psychology and knows what he   s talking about .  he studied the tweenie and he   ll tell you that the tweenie is the coming race of the solar system  destined to take the supremacy away from us pure bloods as inevitably as night follows day .  don   t you think they deserve equality in that case .         yes  i do think so  definitely     replied johanson .  there was a strange glitter in his eyes  and a crooked smile upon his ups     this is of extreme importance  scanlon .  i shall attend to it immediately .  so immediately  in fact  that i believe i had better leave in half an hour  to catch the      strato car .        johanson had scarcely left  when max approached scanlon and blurted out with no preamble at all     there is something i have to show you  father something you have not known about before .      scanlon stared his surprise     what do you mean .         come with me  please  father .  i shall explain .     his grave expression was almost frightening .  madeline joined the two at the door  and at a sign from max  seemed to comprehend the situation .  she said nothing but her eyes grew sad and the lines in her forehead seemed to deepen .   in utter silence  the three entered the waiting rocko car and were sped across the town in the direction of the hill o    the woods .  high over lake clare they shot to come down once more in the wooded patch at the foot of the hill .   a tall  burly tweenie sprang to attention as the car landed  and started at the sight of scanlon .      good afternoon  father     he whispered respectfully  and cast a questioning glance at max as he did so .      same to you  emmanuel     replied scanlon absently .  he suddenly became aware that before him was a cleverly camouflaged opening that led into the very hill itself .   max beckoned him to follow and led the way into the opening which after a hundred feet opened into an enormous manmade cavern .  scanlon halted in utter amazement  for before him were three giant space ships  gleaming silvery white and equipped  as he could plainly see  with the latest atomic power .      i   m sorry  father     said max     that all this was done without your knowledge .  it is the only case of the sort in the history of tweenietown .     scanlon scarcely seemed to hear  standing as if in a daze  and max continued     the center one is the flagship the jefferson scanlon .  the one to the right is the beulah goodkin and the one to the left the madeline .      scanlon snapped out of his bemusement     but what does this all mean and why the secrecy .         these ships have been lying ready for five years now  fully fuelled and provisioned  ready for instant take off .  tonight .  we blast away the side of the hill and shoot for venus  tonight .  we have not told you till now  for we did not wish to disturb your peace of mind with a misfortune we knew long ago to be inevitable .  we had thought that perhaps     his voice sank lower     its fulfillment might have been postponed until after you were no longer with us .         speak out     cried scanlon suddenly .     i want the full details .  why do you leave just as i feel sure i can obtain full equality for you .         exactly     answered max  mournfully .     your words to johanson swung the scale .  as long as earthmen and martians merely thought us different and inferior  they despised us and tolerated us .  you have told johanson we were superior and would ultimately supplant mankind .  they have no alternative now but to hate us .  there shall be no further toleration  of that i can assure you .  we leave before the storm breaks .      the old man   s eyes widened as the truth of the other   s statements became apparent to him     i see .  i must get in touch with johanson .  perhaps  we can together correct that terrible mistake .     he clapped a hand to his forehead .      oh  max     interposed madeline  tearfully     why don   t you come to the point .  we want you to come with us  father .  in venus  which is so sparsely settled  we can find a spot where we can develop unharmed for an unlimited time .  we can establish our nation  free and untrammeled  powerful in our own right  no longer dependent on      her voice died away and she gazed anxiously at scanlon   s face  now grown drawn and haggard .     no     he whispered     no .  my place is here with my own kind .  go  my children  and establish your nation .  in the end  your descendants shall rule the system .  but i i shall stay here .         then i shall stay  too     insisted max .     you are old and someone must care for you .  i owe you my life a dozen times over .      scanlon shook his head firmly     i shall need no one .  dayton is not far .  i shall be well taken care of there or anywhere else i go .  you  max  are needed by your race .  you are their leader .  go .        scanlon wandered through the deserted streets of tweenietown and tried to take a grip upon himself .  it was hard .  yesterday  he had celebrated the fortieth anniversary of its founding it had been at the peak of its prosperity .  today  it was a ghost town .   yet  oddly enough  there was a spirit of exultation about him .  his dream had shattered but only to give way to a brighter dream .  he had nourished foundlings and brought up a race in its youth and for that he was someday to be recognized as the founder of the superrace .   it was his creation that would someday rule the system .  atomic power gravity nullifiers all faded into insignificance .  this was his real gift to the universe .   this  he decided  was how a god must feel .     the end    as in    the weapon too dreadful to use     the story dealt with racial prejudice on an interplanetary scale .  i kept coming back to this theme very frequently something not surprising in a jew growing up during the hitler era .     once again my naivet   shows  since i assume not only an intelligent race on mars  where such a thing is most unlikely even by      evidence  but assume the martians to be sufficiently like earthmen to make interbreeding possible .   i can only shake my head wearily .  i knew better in        i really did .  i just accepted science fictional clich  s  that   s all .  eventually  i stopped doing that .    my treatment of atomic power was also primitive in the extreme  and i knew better than that  too  even though at the time i wrote the story  uranium fission had not been discovered .  the tweenie   s mysterious reference to    a function of x  plus y  plus z     merely means that i had taken analytic geometry at columbia not long before and was flaunting my knowledge of the equation for the sphere .   this was the first story in which i tried to introduce the romantic motif  however light .  it had to be a failure .  at the time of the writing of this story  i had still never had a date with a girl .   and yet the greatest embarrassment in a story simply littered with embarrassments was the following line in the seventh paragraph      .  .  .  for it  he had become a middle aged man at thirty the first flush of youth long gone      well  i wrote it at nineteen .  to me  the first flush of youth was long gone by the time one reached thirty .  i know better now  of course  since more than thirty years later  i find that i am still in the first flush of youth .   there was some reason for self congratulation in connection with    half breed     however .  my fourth published story  it was the longest to appear up to then .  with a length of nine thousand words  it was listed on the table of contents as a    novelette     my first published story in that class .   my name also appeared on the cover of the magazine .  it was the first time that had ever happened .     almost immediately after finishing    half breed     i began    the secret sense     submitting it to john campbell on june           and receiving it back on the twenty eighth .  pohl could not place it either .   toward the end of       however  a pair of sister magazines  cosmic stories and stirring science stories  were being planned  with don wollheim  a fellow futurian  selected as editor .  the magazines were starting on a microbudget  however  and the only way they could come into being was to get stories for nothing at least for the initial issues .  for the purpose  wollheim appealed to the futurians and they came through .  the first issues consisted entirely  i think  of stories by futurians  under their own names or pseudonyms .   i  too  was asked  and since by that time i was convinced i could sell    the secret sense    nowhere  i donated it to wollheim  who promptly accepted it .   that was that  except that  at the time  yet another magazine  comet stories  was coming into existence  under the editorship of f .  orlin tremaine  who had been campbell   s predecessor at astounding .   i went to see tremaine several times  since i thought i might sell him a story or two .  on the second visit  on december          tremaine spoke with some heat concerning the forthcoming birth of wollheim   s magazines .  while he himself was paying top rates  he said  wollheim was getting stories for nothing and with these could put out magazines that would siphon readership from those magazines that paid .  any author who donated stories to wollheim  and thus contributed to the destruction of competing magazines who paid  should be blacklisted in the field .   i listened with horror  knowing that i had donated a story for nothing .  it was a story  to be sure  that i had felt to be worth nothing  but it had not occurred to me that i was undercutting other authors by setting up unfair competition .   i did not quite have the nerve to tell tremaine i was one of the guilty ones  but as soon as i got home i wrote to wollheim asking him to accept one of two alternatives  either he could run the story under a pseudonym so that my guilt would be hidden  or if he insisted on using my name he could pay me five dollars so that if the question ever arose i could honestly deny having given him the story for nothing .   wollheim chose to use my name and sent me a check for five dollars  but did so with remarkably poor grace  and  to be sure  he was not  in those days  noted for any suavity of character  .  he accompanied the check with an angry letter that said  in part  that i was being paid an enormous word rate because it was only my name that had value and for that i was receiving    .    a word .  perhaps he was correct .  if so  the word rate was indeed a record  one that i have not surpassed to this very day .  on the other hand  the total payment also set a record .  no other story i have written commanded so low a payment .   years later  the well known science fiction historian sam moskowitz wrote a short biography of me  which appeared in the april      amazing .  in the course of the biography  he describes a version of the above events and mistakenly states that it was john campbell who was angry at the donation of stories without pay and that it was he who threatened me with blacklisting .   not so .   campbell had nothing to do with it  and  what   s more  would have been incapable of making threats .  if he had known in advance that i intended to donate a story for nothing to a competing magazine  he would have pointed out my stupidity to me in a perfectly friendly way and would have let it go at that .   as a matter of fact  while i tried to keep my guilt a secret from tremaine  i had no intention of hiding it from campbell .  on my very next visit to him  on december           i confessed in full  and he shrugged it off .      campbell  i imagine  was quite certain that no magazine that had to depend on free stories could last for long  since the only stories so available would have been rejected by everyone else .  and he would be right .  cosmic stories lasted only three issues  and stirring science stories only four .     the secret sense    remained the only story of mine they published .   as for comet stories  that lasted five issues  and though tremaine hesitated over a couple of my stories  he never bought one .       the secret sense     the lilting strains of a strauss waltz filled the room .  the music waxed and waned beneath the sensitive fingers of lincoln fields  and through half closed eyes he could almost see whirling figures pirouetting about the waxed floor of some luxurious salon .   music always affected him that way .  it filled his mind with dreams of sheer beauty and transformed his room into a paradise of sound .  his hands flickered over the piano in the last delicious combinations of tones and then slowed reluctantly to a halt .   he sighed and for a moment remained absolutely silent as if trying to extract the last essence of beauty from the dying echoes .  then he turned and smiled faintly at the other occupant of the room .   garth jan smiled in turn but said nothing .  garth had a great liking for lincoln fields  though little understanding .  they were worlds apart literally for garth hailed from the giant underground cities of mars while fields was the product of sprawling terrestrial new york .      how was that .  garth  old fellow .     questioned fields doubtfully .   garth shook his head .  he spoke in his precise  painstaking manner     i listened attentively and can truly say that it was not unpleasant .  there is a certain rhythm  a cadence of sorts  which  indeed  is rather soothing .  but beautiful .  no .      there was pity in fields    eyes pity almost painful in its intensity .  the martian met the gaze and understood all that it meant  yet there was no answering spark of envy .  his bony giant figure remained doubled up in a chair that was too small for him and one thin leg swung leisurely back and forth .   fields lunged out of his seat impetuously and grasped his companion by the arm .     here .  seat yourself on the bench .      garth obeyed genially .     i see you want to carry out some little experiment .         you   ve guessed it .  i   ve read scientific works which tried to explain all about the difference in sense equipment between earthman and martian  but i never could quite grasp it all .      he tapped the notes c and f in a single octave and glanced at the martian inquiringly .      if there   s a difference     said garth doubtfully     it   s a very slight one .  if i were listening casually  i would certainly say you had hit the same note twice .      the earthman marvelled .     how   s this .     he tapped c and g .      i can hear the difference this time .         well  i suppose all they say about your people is true .  you poor fellows to have such a crude sense of bearing .  you don   t know what you   re missing .      the martian shrugged his shoulders fatalistically .     one misses nothing that one has never possessed .      garth jan broke the short silence that followed .     do you realize that this period of history is the first in which two intelligent races have been able to communicate with each other .  the comparison of sense equipment is highly interesting and rather broadens one   s views on life .         that   s right     agreed the earthman     though we seem to have all the advantage of the comparison .  you know a terrestrial biologist stated last month that he was amazed that a race so poorly equipped in the matter of sense perception could develop so high a civilization as yours .         all is relative  lincoln .  what we have is sufficient for us .      fields felt a growing frustration within him .     but if you only knew  garth  if you only knew what you were missing .      you   ve never seen the beauties of a sunset or of dancing fields of flowers .  you can   t admire the blue of the sky  the green of the grass  the yellow of ripe corn .  to you the world consists of shades of dark and light .     he shuddered at the thought    you can   t smell a flower or appreciate its delicate perfume .  you can   t even enjoy such a simple thing as a good  hearty meal .  you can   t taste nor smell nor see color .  i pity you for your drab world .         what you say is meaningless  lincoln .  waste no pity on me  for i am as happy as you .     he rose and reached for his cane necessary in the greater gravitational field of earth .      you must not judge us with such easy superiority  you know .     that seemed to be the galling aspect of the matter .     we do not boast of certain accomplishments of our race of which you know nothing .      and then  as if heartily regretting his words  a wry grimace overspread his face  and he started for the door .     fields sat puzzled and thoughtful for a moment  then jumped up and ran after the martian  who was stumping his way towards the exit .  he gripped garth by the shoulder and insisted that he return .      what did you mean by that last remark .      the martian turned his face away as if unable to face his questioner .     forget it  lincoln .  that was just a moment of indiscretion when your unsolicited pity got on my nerves .      fields gave him a sharp glance .     it   s true  isn   t it .  it   s logical that martians possess senses earthmen do not  but it passes the bounds of reason that your people should want to keep it secret .         that is as it may be .  but now that you   ve found me out through my own utter stupidity  you will perhaps agree to let it go no further .         of course .  i   ll be as secret as the grave  though i   m darned if i can make anything of it .  tell me  of what nature is this secret sense of yours .      garth jan shrugged listlessly .     how can i explain .  can you define color to me  who cannot even conceive it .         i   m not asking for a definition .  tell me its uses .  please     he gripped the other   s shoulder     you might as well .  i have given my promise of secrecy .      the martian sighed heavily .     it won   t do you much good .  would it satisfy you to know that if you were to show me two containers  each filled with a clear liquid  i could tell you at once whether either of the two were poisonous .  or  if you were to show me a copper wire  i could tell instantly whether an electric current were passing through it  even if it were as little as a thousandth of an ampere .  or i could tell you the temperature of any substance within three degrees of the true value even if you held it as much as five yards away .  or i could well  i   ve said enough .         is that all .     demanded fields  with a disappointed cry .      what more do you wish .         all you   ve described is very useful but where is the beauty in it .  has this strange sense of yours no value to the spirit as well as to the body .      garth jan made an impatient movement .     really  lincoln  you talk foolishly .  i have given you only that for which you asked the uses i put this sense to .  i certainly didn   t attempt to explain its nature .  take your color sense .  as far as i can see its only use is in making certain fine distinctions which i cannot .  you can identify certain chemical solutions  for instance  by something you call color when i would be forced to run a chemical analysis .  where   s the beauty in that .      fields opened his mouth to speak but the martian motioned him testily into silence .     i know .  you   re going to babble foolishness about sunsets or something .  but what do you know of beauty .  have you ever known what it was to witness the beauty of the naked copper wires when an ac current is turned on .  have you sensed the delicate loveliness of induced currents set up in a solenoid when a magnet is passed through it .  have you ever attended a martian portwem .      garth jan   s eyes had grown misty with the thoughts he was conjuring up  and fields stared in utter amazement .  the shoe was on the other foot now and his sense of superiority left him of a sudden .      every race has its own attributes     he mumbled with a fatalism that had just a trace of hypocrisy in it     but i    see no reason why you should keep it such a blasted secret .  we earthmen have kept no secrets from your race .         don   t accuse us of ingratitude     cried garth jan vehemently .  according to the martian code of ethics  ingratitude was the supreme vice  and at the insinuation of that garth   s caution left him .     we never act without reason  we martians .  and certainly it is not for our own sake that we hide this magnificent ability .      the earthman smiled mockingly .  he was on the trail of something he felt it in his bones and the only way to get it out was to tease it out .      no doubt there is some nobility behind it all .  it is a strange attribute of your race that you can always find some altruistic motive for your actions .        garth jan bit his lip angrily .     you have no right to say that .     for a moment he thought of pleading worry over fields    future peace of mind as a reason for silence  but the latter   s mocking reference to    altruism    had rendered that impossible .  a feeling of anger crept over him gradually and that forced him to his decision .   there was no mistaking the note of frigid unfriendliness that entered his voice .     i   ll explain by analogy .     the martian stared straight ahead of him as he spoke  eyes half closed .      you have told me that i live in a world that is composed merely of shades of light and dark .  you try to describe a world of your own composed of infinite variety and beauty .  i listen but care little concerning it .  i have never known it and never can know it .  one does not weep over the loss of what one has never owned .      but what if you were able to give me the ability to see color for five minutes .  what if  for five minutes  i reveled in wonders undreamed of .  what if  after those five minutes  i have to return it forever .  would those five minutes of paradise be worth a lifetime of regret afterwards a lifetime of dissatisfaction because of my own shortcomings .  would it not have been the kinder act never to have told me of color in the first place and so have removed its ever present temptation .      fields had risen to his feet during the last part of the martian   s speech and his eyes opened wide in a wild surmise .     do you mean an earthman could possess the martian sense if so desired .         for five minutes in a lifetime     garth jan   s eyes grew dreamy     and in those five minutes sense      he came to a confused halt and glared angrily at his companion     you know more than is good for you .  see that you don   t forget your promise .      he rose hastily and hobbled away as quickly as he could  leaning heavily upon the cane .  lincoln fields made no move to stop him .  he merely sat there and thought .     the great height of the cavern shrouded the roof in misty obscurity in which  at fixed intervals  there floated luminescent globes of radite .  the air  heated by this subterranean volcanic stratum  wafted past gently .  before lincoln fields stretched the wide  paved avenue of the principal city of mars  fading away into the distance .   he clumped awkwardly up to the entrance of the home of garth jan  the six inch thick layer of lead attached to each shoe a nuisance unending .  though it was still better than the uncontrollable bounding earth muscles brought about in this lighter gravity .   the martian was surprised to see his friend of six months ago but not altogether joyful .  fields was not slow to notice this but he merely smiled to himself .  the opening formalities passed  the conventional remarks were made  and the two seated themselves .   fields crushed the cigarette in the ash tray and sat upright suddenly serious .     i   ve come to ask for those five minutes you claim you can give me .  may i have them .         is that a rhetorical question .  it certainly doesn   t seem to require an answer .     garth   s tone was openly contemptuous .   the earthman considered the other thoughtfully .     do you mind if i outline my position in a few words .      the martin smiled indifferently .     it won   t make any difference     he said .      i   ll take my chance on that .  the situation is this  i   ve been bom and reared in the lap of luxury and have been most disgustingly spoiled .  i   ve never yet had a reasonable desire that i have not been able to fulfill  and i don   t know what it means not to get what i want .  do you see .      there was no answer and he continued     i have found my happiness in beautiful sights  beautiful words  and beautiful sounds .  i have made a cult of beauty .  in a word  i am an aesthete .         most interesting     the martian   s stony expression did not change a whit     but what bearing has all this on the problem at hand .         just this  you speak of a new form of beauty a form unknown to me at present and entirely inconceivable even  but one which could be known if you so wished .  the notion attracts me .  it more than attracts me it makes its demands of me .  again i remind you that when a notion begins to make demands of me  i yield i always have .         you are not the master in this case     reminded garth jan .     it is crude of me to remind you of this  but you cannot force me  you know .  your words  in fact  are almost offensive in their implications .         i am glad you said that  for it allows me to be crude in my turn without offending my conscience .      garth jan   s only reply to this was a self confident grimace .      i make my demand of you     said fields  slowly     in the name of gratitude .         gratitude .     the martian started violently .   fields grinned broadly     it   s an appeal no honorable martian can refuse by your own ethics .  you owe me gratitude  now  because it was through me you gained entrance into the houses of the greatest and most honorable men of earth .         i know that     garth jan flushed angrily .     you are impolite to remind me of it .         i have no choice .  you acknowledged the gratitude you owe me in actual words  back on earth .  i demand the chance to possess this mysterious sense you keep so secret in the name of this acknowledged gratitude .  can you refuse now .         you know i can   t     was the gloomy response .     i hesitated only for your own sake .      the martian rose and held out his hand gravely     you have me by the neck  lincoln .  it is done .  afterwards  though  i owe you nothing more .  this will pay my debt of gratitude .  agreed .         agreed .     the two shook hands and lincoln fields continued in an entirely different tone .     we   re still friends  though  aren   t we .  this little altercation won   t spoil things .         i hope not .  come .  join me at the evening meal and we can discuss the time and place of your er five minutes .      lincoln fields tried hard to down the faint nervousness that filled him as he waited in garth jan   s private    concert    room .  he felt a sudden desire to laugh as the thought came to him that he felt exactly as he usually did in a dentist   s waiting room .   he lit his tenth cigarette  puffed twice and threw it away     you   re doing this very elaborately  garth .      the martian shrugged     you have only five minutes so i might as well see to it that they are put to the best possible use .  you   re going to    hear    part of a portwem  which is to our sense what a great symphony  is that the word .   is to sound .         have we much longer to wait .  the suspense  to be trite  is terrible .         we   re waiting for novi lon  who is to play the portwem  and for done vol .  my private physician .  they   ll be along soon .      fields wandered onto the low dais that occupied the center of the room and regarded the intricate mechanism thereupon with curious interest .  the fore part was encased in gleaming aluminum leaving exposed only seven tiers of shining black knobs above and five large white pedals below .  behind  however  it lay open  and within there ran crossings and recrossings of finer wires in incredibly complicated paths .      a curious thing  this     remarked the earthman .   the martian joined him on the dais     it   s an expensive instrument .  it cost me ten thousand martian credits .         how does it work .         not so differently from a terrestrial piano .  each of the upper knobs controls a different electric circuit .  singly and together an expert portwem player could  by manipulating the knobs  form any conceivable pattern of electric current .  the pedals below control the strength of the current .      fields nodded absently and ran his fingers over the knobs at random .  idly  he noticed the small galvanometer located just above the keys kick violently each time he depressed a knob .  aside from that  he sensed nothing .      is the instrument really playing .      the martian smiled     yes  it is .  and a set of unbelievably atrocious discords too .      he took a seat before the instrument and with a murmured    here   s howl    his fingers skimmed rapidly and accurately over the gleaming buttons .   the sound of a reedy martian voice crying out in strident accents broke in upon him  and garth jan ceased in sudden embarrassment .     this is novi lon     he said hastily to fields     as usual  he does not like my playing .      fields rose to meet the newcomer .  he was bent of shoulder and evidently of great age .  a fine tracing of wrinkles  especially about eyes and mouth  covered his face .      so this is the young earthman     he cried  in strongly accented english .     i disapprove your rashness but sympathize with your desire to attend a portwem .  it is a great pity you can own our sense for no more than five minutes .  without it no one can truly be said to live .      garth jan laughed     he exaggerates  lincoln .  he   s one of the greatest musicians of mars  and thinks anyone doomed to damnation who would not rather attend a portwem than breathe .     he hugged the older man warmly     he was my teacher in my youth and many were the long hours in which he struggled to teach me the proper combination of circuits .         and i have failed after all  you dunce     snapped the old martian .     i heard your attempt at playing as i entered .  you still have not learned the proper fortgass combination .  you were desecrating the soul of the great bar damn .  my pupil .  bah .  it is a disgrace .      the entrance of the third martian  done vol  prevented novi lon from continuing his tirade .  garth  glad of the reprieve  approached the physician hastily .      is all ready .         yes     growled vol surlily     and a particularly uninteresting experiment this will be .  we know all the results beforehand .     his eyes fell upon the earthman  whom he eyed contemptuously .     is this the one who wishes to be inoculated .      lincoln fields nodded eagerly and felt his throat and mouth go dry suddenly .  he eyed the newcomer uncertainly and felt uneasy at the sight of a tiny bottle of clear liquid and a hypodermic which the physician had extracted from a case he was carrying .      what are you going to do .     he demanded .      he   ll merely inoculate you .  it   ll take a second     garth jan assured him .     you see  the sense organs in this case are several groups of cells in the cortex of the brain .  they are activated by a hormone  a synthetic preparation of which is used to stimulate the dormant cells of the occasional martian who is born er    blind .     you   ll receive the same treatment .         oh .  then earthmen possess those cortex cells .         in a very rudimentary state .  the concentrated hormone will activate them  but only for five minutes .  after that time  they are literally blown out as a result of their unwonted activity .  after that  they can   t be re activated under any circumstances .      done vol completed his last minute preparations and approached fields .  without a word .  fields extended his right arm and the hypodermic plunged in .   with the operation completed  the terrestrial waited a moment or two and then essayed a shaky laugh     i don   t feel any change .         you won   t for about ten minutes     explained garth .      it takes time .  just sit back and relax .  novi lon has begun bar damn   s    canals in the desert    it is my favorite and when the hormone begins its work you will find yourself in the middle of things .      now that the die was cast irrevocably .  fields found himself stonily calm .  novi lon played furiously  and garth jan  at the earthman   s right  was already lost in the composition .  even done vol  the fussy doctor  had forgotten his peevishness for the nonce .   fields snickered under his breath .  the martians listened attentively but to him the room was devoid of sound and  almost of all other sensation as well .  what no  it was impossible  of course but what if it were just an elaborate practical joke .  he stirred uneasily and put the thought from his mind angrily .   the minutes passed  novi lon   s fingers flew  garth jan   s expression was one of unfeigned delight .   then lincoln fields blinked his eyes rapidly .  for a moment a nimbus of color seemed to surround the musician and his instrument .  he couldn   t identify it but it was there .  it grew and spread until the room was full of it .  other hues came to join it and still others .  they wove and wavered  expanding and contracting  changing with lightning speed and yet staying the same .  intricate patterns of brilliant tints formed and faded  beating in silent bursts of color upon the young man   s eyeballs .   simultaneously  there came the impression of sound .  from a whisper it rose into a glorious  ringing shout that wavered up and down the scale in quivering tremolos .  he seemed to hear every instrument from fife to bass viol simultaneously  and yet  paradoxically  each rang in his ear in solitary clearness .   and together with this  there came the more subtle sensation of odor .  from a suspicion  a mere trace  it waxed into a phantasmal field of flowers .  delicate spicy scents followed each other in ever stronger succession  in gentle wafts of pleasure .   yet all this was nothing .  fields knew that .  somehow  he knew that what he saw  heard  and smelt were mere delusions  mirages of a brain that frantically attempted to interpret an entirely new conception in the old  familiar ways .   gradually  the colors and the sounds and the scents died .  his brain was beginning to realize that that which beat upon it was something hitherto unexperienced .  the effect of the hormone became stronger  and suddenly in one burst fields realized what it was he sensed .   he didn   t see it nor hear it nor smell it nor taste it  nor feel it .  he knew what it was but he couldn   t think of the word for it .  slowly  he realized that there wasn   t any word for it .  even more slowly  he realized that there wasn   t even any concept for it .   yet he knew what it was .   there beat upon his brain something that consisted of pure waves of enjoyment something that lifted him out of himself and pitched him headlong into a universe unknown to him earlier .  he was falling through an endless eternity of  something .  it wasn   t sound or sight but it was something .  something that enfolded him and hid his surroundings from him that   s what it was .  it was endless and infinite in its variety  and with each crashing wave  he glimpsed a farther horizon  and the wonderful cloak of sensation became thicker and softer and more beautiful .   then came the discord .  like a little crack at first marring a perfect beauty .  then spreading and branching and growing wider  until  finally  if split apart thunderously though without a sound .   lincoln fields  dazed and bewildered  found himself back in the concert room again .   he lurched to his feet and grasped garth jan by the arm violently     garth .  why did he stop .  tell him to continue .  tell him .      garth jan   s startled expression faded into pity     he is still playing  lincoln .      the earthman   s befuddled stare showed no signs of understanding .  he gazed about him with unseeing eyes .  novi lon   s fingers sped across the keyboard as nimbly as ever  the expression on his face was as rapt as ever .  slowly  the truth seeped in  and the earthman   s empty eyes filled with horror .   he sat down  uttering one hoarse cry  and buried his head in his hands .   the five minutes had passed .  there could be no return .   garth jan was smiling a smile of dreadful malice     i had pitied you just a moment ago  lincoln  but now i   m glad  glad .  you forced this out of me you made me do this .  i hope you   re satisfied  because i certainly am .  for the rest of your life     his voice sank to a sibilant whisper     you   ll remember these five minutes and know what it is you   re missing what it is you can never have again .  you are blind  lincoln blind .      the earthman raised a haggard face and grinned  but it was no more than a horrible baring of the teeth .  it took every ounce of willpower he possessed to maintain an air of composure .   he did not trust himself to speak .  with wavering step  he marched out of the room  head held high to the end .   and within  that tiny  bitter voice  repeating over and over again     you entered a normal man .  you leave blind blind  blind .        the end    the summer of      was full of doubts and uncertainty for me .     in june i had graduated from columbia and obtained my bachelor of science degree .  so far  so good .  however  my second round of attempts to enter medical school had failed  as the first had .  to be sure  i hadn   t really been anxious to go to medical school and i had tried only halfheartedly  but it still left me at loose ends .   .   what did i do now .  i did not wish to look for some nondescript job  even if these were to be found  so i had to continue with my schooling .  i had been majoring in chemistry  so  failing medical school  the natural next step was to go for my degree of doctor of philosophy in that field .   the first question was whether i would be able to swing this financially .   it would have been the first question  even more so  if i had gotten into medical school .   college itself had been touch and go all four years  and my small writing income of about      during my senior year had been a considerable help .   naturally  i would have to continue writing and  just as naturally  my depression made it very difficult to write .  i managed one story during that summer  it was called    life before birth .         life before birth    was my first attempt at anything other than science fiction .  it was in the allied field of fantasy  as imaginative as science fiction  but without the restriction of requiring scientific plausibility  .   the reason for my attempting fantasy was that at the beginning of       street   smith began the publication of a new magazine  unknown  of which campbell was editor .   unknown caught my fancy at once .  it featured stories of what are now called    adult fantasy     and the writing seemed to my nineteen year old self to be even more advanced and literate than that in astounding .  of course i wanted desperately to place a story in this new and wonderful magazine .      life before birth    was an attempt in this direction  but aside from the mere fact that it was a fantasy  i remember nothing more about it .  it was submitted to campbell on july    and was back in my hands on the nineteenth .  it never placed anywhere and no longer exists .   august was even worse .  all europe rang with the hideous possibility of war  and on september    world war ii began with the german invasion of poland .  i could do nothing during the crisis but listen to the radio .  it was not till september    that i could settle down long enough to start another story     the brothers .         the brothers    was science fiction  and all i remember is that it was about two brothers  a good one and an evil one  and a scientific invention that one or the other was constructing .  on october   i submitted it to campbell  and on october    it was rejected .  it  too  never placed and no longer exists .   so the summer had passed fruitlessly and now i had to face another problem .  columbia university was not in the least anxious to take me on as a graduate student .  they felt i was going to use the position as a mere way of marking time till i could try once more to get into medical school .   i swore that this was not so  but my position was vulnerable because as a premedical student i had not been required to take a course in physical chemistry and had therefore not done so .  physical chemistry was  however  required for graduate work in chemistry .   i persisted  and finally the admissions board made the following suggestion  i would have to take a full year   s selection of graduate courses  and  at the same time  i would have to take physical chemistry and get at least a b in that .  if i failed to get the b  i was out on my ear and my tuition money would  of course  not be refunded .   one of the members of the board told me  some years later  that i was offered this in the belief that i would not accept a set of terms so loaded against me .  however  since i had never had trouble with passing courses  it never occurred to me that a set of requirements that merely asked that i achieve certain grades  was loaded against me .   i agreed  and when at the end of the first semester there were only three a   s in physical chemistry out of a class of sixty  and i was one of them  the probation was lifted .     by december i had gotten deeply enough into my course work to be quite certain i would fulfill all grade requirements .  the only uncertainty remaining was financial .  i had to get back to writing .   on december    i began    homo sol    and completed it on january          the day before my twentieth birthday .  i submitted it on january    and on that day  in campbell   s office  i met theodore sturgeon and l .  ron hubbard  two established members of campbell   s stable of writers .   hubbard has since then become world famous  in a fashion  as the originator of the cults of dianetics and scientology .    there is no sign in my diary of any discouragement  but after a year and a half of assiduous efforts  i had failed to sell campbell more than one story out of the eighteen i had by then written .  he had rejected eight stories before buying    trends     and he had rejected seven stories since .   two stories  which i sold elsewhere  he never saw and had no chance to reject .  had he seen them he would certainly have rejected them .    one factor in the lack of discouragement was campbell   s unfailing interest .  as long as he didn   t get tired reading my stories and advising me about them so kindly  why should i get tired writing them .  then  too  my occasional sales to magazines other than astounding  there had been six by then  and  especially  the opening up of a new and sympathetic market in the form of pohl   s magazines  helped keep my spirits up .   for    homo sol     my nineteenth story  there was no outright rejection .  again  campbell asked for revisions .  i had to revise it twice  but it was not to be another    black friar of the flame .     the second revision was satisfactory  and on april           i received my second check from campbell  and  by that time  my seventh check  all told  .  what   s more  it was for seventy two dollars  the story being       words long  and was the largest check i had ever received for a story up to that time .   oddly enough  the clearest thing i remember about that check is an incident that took place that evening in my father   s candy store  where i still worked every day and where i was to continue working for two more years .  a customer took offense at my neglecting to say    thank you    after his purchase a crime i frequently committed because  very often  i was working without conscious attention but was concentrating deeply on the plot permutations that were sounding hollowly within the cavern of my skull .   the customer decided to scold me for my obvious inattention and apparent lack of industry .     my son     he said     made fifty dollars through hard work last week .  what do you do to earn a living .         i write     i said     and i got this for a story today     and i held up the check for him to see .   it was a very satisfactory moment .       homo sol     the seven thousand and fifty fourth session of the galactic congress sat in solemn conclave in the vast semicircular hall on eon  second planet of arcturus .   slowly  the president delegate rose to his feet .  his broad arcturian countenance flushed slightly with excitement as he surveyed the surrounding delegates .  his sense of the dramatic caused him to pause a moment or so before making the official announcement for  after all  the entrance of a new planetary system into the great galactic family is not a thing likely to happen twice in any one man   s lifetime .   a dead silence prevailed during that pause .  the two hundred and eighty eight delegates one from each of the two hundred and eighty eight oxygen atmosphere  water chemistry worlds of the system waited patiently for him to speak .   beings of every manlike type and shape were there .  some were tall and pole like  some broad and burly  some short and stumpy .  there were those with long  wiry hair  those with scanty gray fuzz covering head and face  others with thick  blond curls piled high  and still others entirely bald .  some possessed long  hair covered trumpets of ears  others had tympanum membranes flush with their temples .  there were those present with large gazelle like eyes of a deep purple luminosity  others with tiny optics of a beady black .  there was a delegate with green skin  one with an eight inch proboscis and one with a vestigial tail internally  variation was almost infinite .   but all were alike in two things .   they were all humanoid .  they all possessed intelligence .   the president delegate   s voice boomed out then     delegates .  the system of sol has discovered the secret of interstellar travel and by that act becomes eligible for entrance into the galactic federation .      a storm of approving shouts arose from those present and the arcturian raised a hand for silence .      i have here     he continued     the official report from alpha centauri  on whose fifth planet the humanoids of sol have landed .  the report is entirely satisfactory and so the ban upon travel into and communication with the solarian system is lifted .  sol is free  and open to the ships of the federation .  even now  there is in preparation an expedition to sol  under the leadership of joselin arn of alpha centauri  to tender that system the formal invitation into the federation .      he paused  and from two hundred and eighty eight throats came the stentorian shout     hail  homo sol .  hail  homo sol .  hail .   it was the traditional welcome of the federation for all new worlds .     tan porus raised himself to his full height of five feet two  he was tall for a rigellian and his sharp  green eyes snapped with annoyance .      there it is  lo fan .  for six months that damned freak squid from beta draconis iv has stumped me .      lo fan stroked his forehead gently with one long finger  and one hairy ear twitched several times .  he had traveled eighty five light years to be here on arcturus ii with the greatest psychologist of the federation and  more specifically  to see this strange mollusk whose reactions had stumped the great rigellian .   he was seeing it now  a puffy  dull purple mass of soft flesh that writhed its tentacular form in placid unconcern through the huge tank of water that held it .  with unruffled serenity  it fed on the green fronds of an underwater fern .      seems ordinary enough     said lo fan .      ha .     snorted tan porus .     watch this .      he drew the curtain and plunged the room into darkness .  only a dim blue light shone upon the tank  and in the murk the draconian squid could barely be discerned .      here goes the stimulus     grunted porus .  the screen above his head burst into soft green light  focused directly upon the tank .  it persisted a moment and gave way to a dull red and then almost at once to a brilliant yellow .  for half a minute it shot raggedly through the spectrum and then  with a final glare of glowing white  a clear bell like tone sounded .   and as the echoes of the note died away  a shudder passed over the squid   s body .  it relaxed and sank slowly to the bottom of the tank .   porus pulled aside the curtain .     it   s sound asleep     he growled .     hasn   t failed yet .  every specimen we   ve ever had drops as if shot the moment that note sounds .         asleep  eh .  that   s strange .  have you got the figures on the stimulus .         certainly .  right here .  the exact wave lengths of the lights required are listed  plus the length of duration of each light unit  plus the exact pitch of the sounded note at the end .      the other surveyed the figures dubiously .  his forehead wrinkled and his ears rose in surprise .  from an .  inner pocket  he drew forth a slide rule .      what type nervous system has the animal .         two b .  plain  simple  ordinary two b .  i   ve had the anatomists  physiologists  and ecologists check that until they were blue in the face .  two b is all they get .  damn fools .      lo fan said nothing  but pushed the center bar of the rule back and forth carefully .  he stopped and peered closely  shrugged his shoulders  and reached for one of the huge volumes on the shelf above his head .  he leafed through the pages and picked out numbers from among the close print .  again the slide rule .   finally he stopped .     it doesn   t make sense     he said helplessly .      i know that .  i   ve tried six times in six different ways to explain that reaction and i failed each time .  even .  if i rig up a system that will explain its going to sleep  i can   t get it to explain the specificity of the stimulus .         it   s highly specific .     questioned lo fan  his voice reaching the higher registers .      that   s the worst part of it     shouted tan porus .  he leaned forward and tapped the other on the knee .     if you shift the wave length of any of the light units by fifty angstroms either way any one of them it doesn   t sleep .  shift the length of duration of a light unit two seconds either way it doesn   t sleep .  shift the pitch of the tone at the end an eighth of an octave either way it doesn   t sleep .  but get the right combination  and it goes straight into a coma .      lo fan   s ears were two hairy trumpets  stiffly erect .     galaxy .     he whispered .     how did you ever stumble on the combination .         i didn   t .  it happened at beta draconis .  some hick college was putting its freshmen through a lab period on light sound reactions of molluscoids been doing it for years .  some student runs through his light sound combinations and his blasted specimen goes to sleep .  naturally  he   s scared out of his wits and brings it to the instructor .  the instructor tries it again on another squid it goes to sleep .  they shift the combination  nothing happens .  they go back to the original it goes to sleep .  after they fooled around with it long enough to know they couldn   t make head or tail of it  they sent it to arcturus and wished it on me .  it   s six months since   had a real night   s sleep .        a musical note sounded and porus turned impatiently .      what is it .         messenger from the president delegate of congress  sir     came in metallic tones from the telecaster on his desk .      send him up .      the messenger stayed only long enough to hand porus an impressively sealed envelope and to say in hearty tone      great news  sir .  the system of sol has qualified for entrance .         so what .     snorted porus beneath his breath as the other left    we all knew it was coming .      he ripped off the outer sheath of cello fiber from the envelope and removed the sheaf of papers from within .  he glanced through them and grimaced .      oh  rigel .         what   s wrong .     asked lo fan .      those politicians keep bothering me with the most inconsequential things .  you   d think there wasn   t another psychologist on eron .  look .  we   ve been expecting the solarian system to solve the principle of the hyperatomo any century now .  they   ve finally done it and an expedition of theirs landed on alpha centauri .  at once  there   s a politicians    holiday .  we must send an expedition of our own to ask them to join the federation .  and  of course  we must have a psychologist along to ask them in a nice way so as to be sure of getting the right reaction  because  to be sure  there isn   t a man in the army that ever gets proper training in psychology .      lo fan nodded seriously .     i know  i know .  we have the same trouble out our way .  they don   t need psychology until they get into trouble and then they come running .         well  it   s a cinch i   m not going to sol .  this sleeping squid is too important to neglect .  it   s a routine job  anyway this business of raking in new worlds  a type a reaction that any sophomore can handle .         whom will you send .         i don   t know .  i   ve got several good juniors under me that can do this sort of thing with their eyes closed .  i   ll send one of them .  and meanwhile  i   ll be seeing you at the faculty meeting tomorrow  won   t i .         you will and hearing me  too .  i   m making a speech on the finger touch stimulus .         good .  i   ve done work on it  so i   ll be interested in hearing what you have to say .  till tomorrow  then .        left alone  porus turned once more to the official report on the solarian system which the messenger had handed him .  he leafed through it leisurely  without particular interest  and finally put it down with a sigh .      lor haridin could do it     he muttered to himself .     he   s a good kid deserves a break .      he lifted his tiny bulk out of the chair and  with the report under his arm  left his office and trotted down the long corridor outside .  as he stopped before a door at the far end  the automatic flash blazed up and a voice within called out to him to enter .   the rigellian opened the door and poked his head inside .     busy  haridin .      lor haridin looked up and sprang to his feet at once .     great space  boss  no .  i haven   t had anything to do since i finished work on anger reactions .  you   ve got something for me  maybe .         i have if you think you   re up to it .  you   ve heard of the solarian system  haven   t you .         sure .  the visors are full of it .  they   ve got interstellar travel  haven   t they .         that   s right .  an expedition is leaving alpha centauri for sol in a month .  they   ll need a psychologist to do the fine work  and i was thinking of sending you .      the young scientist reddened with delight to the very top of his hairless dome .     do you mean it  boss .         why not .  that is if you think you can do it .         of course i can .     haridin drew himself up in offended hauteur .     type a reaction .  i can   t miss .         you   ll have to learn their language  you know  and administer the stimulus in the solarian tongue .  it   s not always an easy job .      haridin shrugged .     i still can   t miss .  in a case like this  translation need only be seventy five percent effective to get ninety nine and six tenths percent of the desired result .  that was one of the problems i had to solve on my qualifying exam .  so you can   t trip me up that way .      porus laughed .     all right  haridin  i know you can do it .  clean up everything here at the university and sign up for indefinite leave .  and if you can  haridin  write some sort of paper on these solarians .  if it   s any good  you might get senior status on the basis of it .      the junior psychologist frowned     but  boss  that   s old stuff .  humanoid reactions are as well known as  .  .  .  as  you can   t write anything on them .         there   s always something if you look hard enough  haridin .  nothing is well known  remember that .  if you   ll look at sheet    of the report  for instance  you   ll find an item concerning the care with which the solarians armed themselves on leaving their ship .      the other turned to the proper page .     that   s reasonable     said he .     an entirely normal reaction .         certainly .  but they insisted on retaining their weapons throughout their stay  even when they were greeted and welcomed by fellow humanoids .  that   s quite a perceptible deviation from the normal .  investigate it it might be worth while .         as you say  boss .  thanks a lot for the chance you   re giving me .  and say how   s the squid coming along .      porus wrinkled his nose .     my sixth try folded up and died yesterday .  it   s disgusting .     and with that  he was gone .     tan porus of rigel trembled with rage as he folded the handful of papers he held in two and tore them across .  he plugged in the telecaster with a jerk .      get me santins of the math department immediately     he snapped .   his green eyes shot fire at the placid figure that appeared on the visor almost at once .  he shook his fist at the image .      what on eron   s the idea of that analysis you sent me just now  you betelgeusian slime worm .      the image   s eyebrows shot up in mild surprise .     don   t blame me  porus .  they were your equations  not mine .  where did you get them .         never mind where i got them .  that   s the business of the psychology department .         all right .  and solving them is the business of the mathematics department .  that   s the seventh set of the damnedest sort of screwy equations i   ve ever seen .  it was the worst yet .  you made at least seventeen assumptions which you had no right to make .  it took us two weeks to straighten you out  and finally we boiled it down      porus jumped as if stung .     i know what you boiled it down to .  i just tore up the sheets .  you take eighteen independent variables in twenty equations  representing two months of work  and solve them out at the bottom of the last  last page with that gem of oracular wisdom    a    equals    a .     all that work and all i get is an identity .         it   s still not my fault  porus .  you argued in circles  and in mathematics that means an identity and there   s nothing you can do about it .     his lips twitched in a slow smile .     what are you kicking about  anyway .     a    does equal    a     doesn   t it .         shut up .     the telecaster went dead  and the psychologist closed his lips tightly and boiled inwardly .  the light signal above the telecaster flashed to life again .      what do you want now .      it was the calm  impersonal voice of the receptionist below that answered him .     a messenger from the government  sir .         damn the government .  tell them i   m dead .         it   s important  sir .  lor haridin has returned from sol and wants to see you .      porus frowned .     sol .  what sol .  oh  i remember .  send him up  but tell him to make it snappy .         come in  haridin     he said a little later  voice calmer  as the young arcturian  a bit thinner  a bit more weary than he had been six months earlier when he left the arcturian system  entered .      well  young man .  did you write the paper .      the arcturian gazed intently upon his fingernails .     no  sir .         why not .     porus    green eyes peered narrowly at the other .     don   t tell me you   ve had trouble .         quite  a bit  boss .     the words came with an effort .     the psychological board itself has sent for you after hearing my report .  the fact of the matter is that the solarian system has  .  .  .  has refused to join the federation .      tan porus shot out of his chair like a jack in the box and landed  purely by chance  on his feet .      what .  .      haridin nodded miserably and cleared his throat .      now  by the great dark nebula     swore the rigellian  distractedly     if this isn   t one sweet day .  first  they tell me that    a    equals    a     and then you come in and tell me you muffed a type a reaction muffed it completely .      the junior psychologist fired up .     i didn   t muff it .  there   s something wrong with the solarians themselves .  they   re not normal .  when i landed they went wild over us .  there was a fantastic celebration entirely unrestrained .  nothing was too good for us .  i delivered the invitation before their parliament in their own language a simple one which they call esperanto .  i   ll stake my life that my translation was ninety five percent effective .         well .  and then .         i can   t understand the rest  boss .  first  there was a neutral reaction and i was a little surprised  and then    he shuddered in retrospect    in seven days only seven days  boss the entire planet had reversed itself completely .  i couldn   t follow their psychology  not by a hundred miles .  i   ve brought home copies of their newspapers of the time in which they objected to joining with    alien monstrosities    and refused to be    ruled by inhumans of worlds parsecs away .     i ask you  does that make sense .      and that   s only the beginning .  it was light years worse than that .  why  good galaxy  i went all the way into type g reactions  trying to figure them out  and couldn   t .  in the end  we had to leave .  we were in actual physical danger from those  .   .   .  those earthmen  as they call themselves .      tan porus chewed his lip a while .     interesting .  have you your report with you .         no .  the psychological board has it .  they   ve been going over it with a microscope all day .         and what do they say .      the young arcturian winced .     they don   t say it openly  but they leave a strong impression of thinking the report an inaccurate one .         well  i   ll decide about that after i   ve read it .  meanwhile  come with me to parliamentary hall and you can answer a few questions on the way .        joselin arn of alpha centauri rubbed stubbled jaws with his huge  six fingered hand and peered from under beetling brows at the semicircle of diversified faces that stared down upon him .  the psychological board was composed of psychologists of a score of worlds  and their united gaze was not the easiest thing in the world to withstand .      we have been informed     began frian obel  head of the board and native of vega  home of the green skinned men     that those sections of the report dealing with sol   s military state are your work .      joselin arn inclined his head in silent agreement .      and you are prepared to confirm what you have stated here  in spite of its inherent improbability .  you are no psychologist  you know .         no .  but i   m a soldier .     the centaurian   s jaws set stubbornly as his bass voice rumbled through the hall .     i don   t know equations and i don   t know graphs but i do know spaceships .  i   ve seen theirs and i   ve seen ours  and theirs are better .  i   ve seen their first interstellar ship .  give them a hundred years and they   ll have a better hyperatomos than we have .  i   ve seen their weapons .  they   ve got almost everything we have  at a stage in their history millennia before us .  what they haven   t got they   ll get  and soon .  what they have got  they   ll improve .      i   ve seen their munitions plants .  ours are more advanced  but theirs are more efficient .  i   ve seen their soldiers and i   d rather fight with them than against them .      i   ve said all that in the report .  i say it again now .      his brusque sentences came to an end and frian obel waited for the murmur from the men about him to cease .      and the rest of their science  medicine  chemistry  physics .  what of them .         i   m not the best judge of those .  you have the report there of those who know  however  and to the best of my knowledge i confirm them .         and so these solarians are true humanoids .         by the circling worlds of centauri  yes .      the old scientist drew himself back in his chair with a peevish gesture and cast a rapid  frowning glance up and down the length of the table .      colleagues     he said     we make little progress by rehashing this mess of impossibilities .  we have a race of humanoids of a superlatively technological turn  possessing at the same time an intrinsically unscientific belief in supernatural forces  an incredibly childish predilection toward individuality  singly and in groups  and  worst of all  lack of sufficient vision to embrace a galaxy wide culture .      he glared down upon the lowering centaurian before him .     such a race must exist if we are to believe the report and fundamental axioms of psychology must crumble .  but i  for one  refuse to believe any such to be vulgar about it comet gas .  this is plainly a case of mismanagement to be investigated by the proper authorities .  i hope you all agree with me when i say that this report be consigned to the scrap heap and that a second expedition led by an expert in his line  not by an inexperienced junior psychologist or a soldier      the drone of the scientist   s voice was buried suddenly in the crash of an iron fist against the table .  joselin am  his huge bulk writhing in anger  lost his temper and gave vent to martial wrath .      now  by the writhing spawn of templis  by the worms that crawl and the gnats that fly  by the cesspools and the plague spots  and by the hooded death itself  i won   t allow this .  are you to sit there with your theories and your long range wisdom and deny what i have seen with my eyes .  are my eyes    and they flashed fire as he spoke    to deny themselves because of a few wriggling marks your palsied hands trace on paper .      to the core of centauri with these armchair wise men  say i and the psychologists first of all .  blast these men who bury themselves in their books and their laboratories and are blind to what goes on in the living world outside .  psychology  is it .  rotten  putrid      a tap on his belt caused him to whirl  eyes staring  fists clenched .  for a moment  he looked about vainly .  then  turning his gaze downward  he found himself looking into the enigmatic green eyes of a pygmy of a man  whose piercing stare seemed to drench his anger with ice water .      i know you  joselin am     said tan porus slowly  picking his words carefully .     you   re a brave man and a good soldier  but you don   t like psychologists  i see .  that is wrong of you  for it is on psychology that the political success of the federation rests .  take it away and our union crumbles  our great federation melts away  the galactic system is shattered .     his voice descended into a soft  liquid croon .     you have sworn an oath to defend the system against all its enemies  joselin am and you yourself have now become its greatest .  you strike at its foundations .  you dig at its roots .  you poison it at its source .  you are dishonored .  you are disgraced .  you are a traitor .        the centaurian soldier shook his head helplessly .  as porus spoke  deep and bitter remorse filled him .  recollection of his words of a moment ago lay heavy on his conscience .  when the psychologist finished  am bent his head and wept .  tears ran down those lined  war scarred cheeks  to which for forty years now they had been a stranger .   porus spoke again  and this time his voice boomed like a thunderclap     away with your mewling whine  you coward .  danger is at hand .  man the guns .      joselin am snapped to attention  the sorrow that had filled him a bare second before was gone as if it had never existed .   the room rocked with laughter and the soldier grasped the situation .  it had been porus    way of punishing him .  with his complete knowledge of the devious ins and outs of the humanoid mind  he had only to push the proper button  and   the centaurian bit his lip in embarrassment  but said nothing .   but tan porus  himself  did not laugh .  to tease the soldier was one thing  to humiliate him  quite another .  with a bound  he was on a chair and laid his small hand on the other   s massive shoulder .      no offense  my friend a little lesson  that is all .  fight the sub humanoids and the hostile environments of fifty worlds .  dare space in a leaky rattletrap of a ship .  defy whatever dangers you wish .  but never  never offend a psychologist .  he might get angry in earnest the next time .      arn bent his head back and laughed a gigantic roar of mirth that shook the room with its earthquake like lustiness .      your advice is well taken  psychologist .  bum me with an atomo  if i don   t think you   re right .     he strode from the room with his shoulders still heaving with suppressed laughter .   porus hopped off the chair and turned to face the board .      this is an interesting race of humanoids we have stumbled upon  colleagues .         ah     said obel  dryly     the great porus feels bound to come to his pupil   s defense .  your digestion seems to have improved  since you feel yourself capable of swallowing haridin   s report .      haridin  standing  head bowed  in the corner  reddened angrily  but did not move .   porus frowned  but his voice kept to its even tone .     i do  and the report  if properly analyzed  will give rise to a revolution in the science .  it is a psychological gold mine  and homo sol  the find of the millennium .         be specific .  tan porus     drawled someone .     your tricks are all very well for a centaurian blockhead  but we remain unimpressed .      the fiery little rigellian emitted a gurgle of anger .  he shook one tiny fist in the direction of the last speaker .      i   ll be more specific  inar tubal  you hairy space bug .     prudence and anger waged a visible battle within him .     there is more to a humanoid than you think certainly far more than you mental cripples can understand .  just to show you what you don   t know  you desiccated group of fossils  i   ll undertake to show you a bit of psycho technology that   ll knock the guts right out of you .  panic  morons  panic .  worldwide panic .      there was an awful silence .     did you say world wide panic .     stuttered frian obel  his green skin turning gray .     panic .         yes  you parrot .  give me six months and fifty assistants and i   ll show you a world of humanoids in panic .      obel attempted vainly to answer .  his mouth worked in a heroic attempt to remain serious and failed .  as though by signal  the entire board dropped its dignity and leaned back in a single burst of laughter .      i remember     gasped inar tubal of sirius  his round face streaked with tears of pure joy     a student of mine who once claimed to have discovered a stimulus that would induce world wide panic .  when i checked his results  i came across an exponent with a misplaced decimal point .  he was only ten orders of magnitude out of the way .  how many decimal points have you misplaced  colleague porus .         what of kraut   s law  porus  which says you can   t panic more than five humanoids at a time .  shall we pass a resolution repealing it .  and maybe the atomic theory as well  while we   re about it .     and semper gor of capella cackled gleefully .   porus climbed onto the table and snatched obel   s gavel .     the next one who laughs is getting this over his empty head .     there was sudden silence .      i   m taking fifty assistants     shouted the green eyed rigellian     and joselin am is taking me to sol .  i want five of you to come with me inar tubal  semper gor and any three others  so that i can watch their stupid faces when i   ve done what i said i would .     he hefted the gavel  threateningly .     well .      frian obel gazed at the ceiling placidly .     all right  porus .  tubal .  gor .  helvin  prat  and winson can go with you .  at the end of the specified time  we   ll witness world wide panic which will be very gratifying or we   ll watch you eat your words  and how much more gratifying that would be .     and with that  he chuckled very quietly to himself .     tan porus stared thoughtfully out the window .  terrapolis  capital city of earth  sprawled beneath him to the very edge of the horizon .  its muted roar reached even to the half mile height at which he stood .   there was something over that city  invisible and intangible but none the less real .  its presence was only too evident to the small psychologist .  the choking  cloak of dank fear that spread over the metropolis beneath was one of his own weaving a horrible cloak of dark uncertainty  that clutched with clammy fingers at the hearts of mankind and stopped short  just short of actual panic .   the roar of the city had voices in it  and the voices were tiny ones of fear .   the rigellian turned away in disgust .     hey  haridin     he roared .   the young arcturian turned away from the televisor .     calling me  boss .         what do you think i   m doing .  talking to myself .  what   s the latest from asia .         nothing new .  the stimuli just aren   t strong enough .  the yellow men seem to be more stolid of disposition than the white dominants of america and europe .  i   ve sent out orders not to increase the stimuli  though .         no  they mustn   t     agreed porus .     we can   t risk active panic .     he ruminated in silence .     listen  we   re about through .  tell them to hit a few of the big cities they   re more susceptible and quit .      he turned to the window again .     space  what a world  what a world .  an entirely new branch of psychology has opened up one we never dreamed of .  mob psychology  haridin  mob psychology .     he shook his head impressively .      there   s lots of suffering  though  boss     muttered the younger man .     this passive panic has completely paralyzed trade and commerce .  the business life of the entire planet is stagnant .  the poor government is helpless they don   t know what   s wrong .         they   ll find out when i   m ready .  and  as for the suffering well  i don   t like it  either  but it   s all a means to an end  a damned important end .      there followed a short silence  and then porus    lips twitched into a nasty smile .     those five nitwits returned from europe yesterday  didn   t they .      haridin smiled in turn and nodded vigorously     and hopping sore .  your predictions have checked to the fifth decimal place .  they   re fit to be tied .         good .  i   m only sorry i can   t see obel   s face right now  after the last message i sent him .  and  incidentally    his voice dropped lower    what   s the latest on them .      haridin raised two fingers .     two weeks  and they   ll be here .         two weeks  .   .   .  two weeks     gurgled porus jubilantly .  he rose and made for the door .     i think i   ll find my dear  dear colleagues and pass the time of day .        the five scientists of the board looked up from their notes and fell into an embarrassed silence as porus entered .   the latter smiled impishly .     notes satisfactory  gentlemen .  found some fifty or sixty fallacies in my fundamental assumptions  no doubt .      hybron prat of alpha cepheus rumpled the gray fuzz he called hair .     i don   t trust the unholy tricks this crazy mathematical notation of yours plays .      the rigellian emitted a short bark of laughter .     invent a better  then .  so far  it   s done a good job of handling reactions  hasn   t it .      there was an unmusical chorus of throat clearings but no definite answer .      hasn   t it .     thundered porus .      well  what if it has     returned kim winson  desperately .     where   s your panic .  all this is well and good .  these humanoids are cosmic freaks  but where   s the big show you were going to put on .  until you break kraut   s law  this entire exhibition of yours isn   t worth a pinhead meteor .         you   re beaten  gentlemen  you   re beaten     crowed the small master psychologist .     i   ve proven my point this passive panic is as impossible according to classic psychology as the active form .  you   re trying to deny facts and save face now  by harping on a technicality .  go home  go home  gentlemen  and hide under the bed .      psychologists are only human .  they can analyze the motives that drive them  but they are the slave of those motives just as much as the commonest mortal of all .  these galaxy famous psychologists writhed under the lash of wounded pride and shattered vanity  and their blind stubbornness was the mechanical reaction due therefrom .  they knew it was and they knew porus knew it was and that made it all the harder .   inar tubal stared angrily from red rimmed eyes .     active panic or nothing .  tan porus .  that   s what you promised  and that   s what we   ll have .  we want the letter of the bond or  by space and time  we   ll balk at any technicality .  active panic or we report failure .      porus swelled ominously and  with a tremendous effort  spoke quietly .     be reasonable  gentlemen .  we haven   t the equipment to handle active panic .  we   ve never come up against this superform they have here on earth .  what if it gets beyond control .     he shook his head violently .      isolate it  then     snarled semper gor .     start it up and put it out .  make all the preparations you want  but do it .         if you can     grunted hybron prat .   but tan porus had his weak point .  his brittle temper lay in splintered shards about him .  his agile tongue blistered the atmosphere and inundated the sullen psychologist with wave after wave of concentrated profanity .      have your way  vacuumheads .  have your way and to outer space with you .     he was breathless with passion .     we   ll set it off right here in terrapolis as soon as all the men are back home .  only you   d all better get from under .      and with one last parting snarl  he stalked from the room .     tan porus parted the curtains with a sweep of his hand  and the five psychologists facing him averted their eyes .  the streets of earth   s capital were deserted of civilian population .  the ordered tramp of the military patrolling the highways of the city sounded like a dirge .  the wintry sky hung low over a scene of strewn bodies and silence  the silence that follows an orgy of wild destruction .      it was touch and go for a few hours there  colleagues .     porus    voice was tired .     if it had passed the city limits  we could never have stopped it .         horrible  horrible .     muttered hybron prat .     it was a scene a psychologist would have given his right arm to witness  and his life to forget .         and these are humanoids .     groaned kim winson .   semper gor rose to his feet in sudden decision .     do you see the significance of this  porus .  these earthmen are sheer uncontrolled atomite .  they can   t be handled .  were they twice the technological geniuses they are  they would be useless .  with their mob psychology  their mass panics  their superemotionalism  they simply won   t fit into the humanoid picture .      porus raised an eyebrow .     comet gas .  individually  we are as emotional as they are .  they carry it into mass action and we don   t  that   s the only difference .         and that   s enough .     exclaimed tubal .     we   ve made our decision  porus .  we made it last night  at the height of the  .  .  .  the  .  .  .  of it .  the solar system is to be left to itself .  it is a plague spot and we want none of it .  as far as the galaxy is concerned .  homo sol will be placed in strict quarantine .  that is final .      the rigellian laughed softly .     for the galaxy  it may be final .  but for homo sol .      tubal shrugged .     they don   t concern us .      porus laughed again .     say  tubal .  just between the two of us  have you tried a time integration of equation     followed by expansion with karolean tensors .         no o .  i can   t say i have .         well  then  just glance up and down these calculations and enjoy yourself .      the five scientists of the board grouped themselves about the sheets of paper porus had handed them .  expressions changed from interest to bewilderment and then to something approaching panic .   nam helvin tore the sheets across with a spasmodic movement .     it   s a lie     he screeched .      we   re a thousand years ahead of them now  and by that time we   ll be advanced another two hundred years .     tubal snapped .     they won   t be able to do anything against the mass of the galaxy   s people .      tan porus laughed in a monotone  which is hard to do  but very unpleasant to hear .     you still don   t believe mathematics .  that   s in your behavior pattern  of course .  all right  let   s see if experts convince you as they should  unless contact with these off normal humanoids has twisted you .  joselin joselin am come in here .        the centaurian commander came in  saluted automatically  and looked expectant .      can one of your ships defeat one of the sol ships in battle  if necessary .          arn grinned sourly .     not a chance  sir .  these humanoids break kraut   s law in panic and also in fighting .  we have a corps of experts manning our ships  these people have a single crew that functions as a unit  without individuality .  they manifest a form of fighting panic  i imagine  is the best word .  every individual on a ship becomes an organ of the ship .  with us  as you know  that   s impossible .      furthermore  this world   s a mass of mad geniuses .  they have  to my certain knowledge  taken no less than twenty two interesting but useless gadgets they saw in the thalsoon museum when they visited us  turned    em inside out  and produced from them some of the most unpleasant military devices i   ve seen .  you know of julmun thill   s gravitational line tracer .  used rather ineffectively for spotting ore deposits before the modem electric potential method came in .      they   ve turned it somehow into one of the deadliest automatic fire directors it   s been my displeasure to see .  it will automatically lay a gun or projector on a completely invisible target in space  air  water or rock  for that matter .         we     said tan porus  gleefully     have far greater fleets than they .  we could overwhelm them  could we not .      joselin am shook his head .     defeat them now probably .  it wouldn   t be overwhelming  though  and i wouldn   t bet on it too heavily .  certainly wouldn   t invite it .  the trouble is  in a military way  this collection of gadget maniacs invent things at a horrible rate .  technologically  they   re as unstable as a wave in water  our civilization is more like a sanddune .  i   ve seen their ground car plants install a complete plant of machine tools for production of a new model of automobile and rip it out in six months because it   s completely obsolete .      now we   ve come in contact with their civilization briefly .  we   ve learned the methods of one new civilization to add to our previous two hundred and eighty odd a small percentage advantage .  they   ve added one new civilization to their previous one a one hundred percent advance .         how about     porus asked gently     our military position if we simply ignore them completely for two hundred years .      joselin am gave an explosive little laugh .     if we could  which means if they   d let us i   d answer offhand and with assurance .  they   re all i   d care to tackle right now .  two hundred years of exploring the new tracks suggested by their brief contact with us and they   d be doing things i can   t imagine .  wait two hundred years and there won   t be a battle  there   ll be an annexation .      tan porus bowed formally .     thank you  joselin arn .  that was the result of my mathematical work .      joselin arn saluted and left the room .   turning to the five thoroughly paralyzed scientists  porus went on     and i hope these learned gentlemen still react in a vaguely humanoid way .  are you convinced that it is not up to us to decide to end all intercourse with this race .  we    may  but they won   t .      fools    he spat out the word    do you think i   m going to waste time arguing with you .  i   m laying down the law  do you understand .  homo sol shall enter the federation .  they are going to be trained into maturity in two hundred years .  and i   m not asking you  i   m telling you .     the rigellian stared up at them truculently .      come with me .     he growled brusquely .     they followed in tame submission and entered tan porus    sleeping quarters .  the little psychologist drew aside a curtain and revealed a life size painting .      make anything of that .      it was the portrait of an earthman  but of such an earthman as none of the psychologists had yet seen .  dignified and sternly handsome  with one hand stroking a regal beard  and the other holding the single flowing garment that clothed him  he seemed personified majesty .      that   s zeus     said porus .     the primitive earthmen created him as the personification of storm and lightning .     he whirled upon the bewildered five .     does it remind you of anybody .         homo canopus .     ventured helvin uncertainly .   for a moment  porus    face relaxed in momentary gratification and then it hardened again .     of course     he snapped .     why do you hesitate about it .  that   s canopus to the life  down to the full yellow beard .      then     here   s something else .     he drew another curtain .   the portrait was of a female  this time .  full bosomed and wide hipped she was .  an ineffable smile graced her face and her hands seemed to caress the stalks of grain that sprang thickly about her feet .      demeter .     said porus .     the personification of agricultural fertility .  the idealized mother .  whom does that remind you of .      there was no hesitation this time .  five voices rang out as one     homo betelgeuse .      tan porus smiled in delight .     there you have it well .         well .     said tubal .      don   t you see .     the smile faded .     isn   t it clear .  nitwit .  if a hundred zeuses and a hundred demeters were to land on earth as part of a    trade mission     and turned out to be trained psychologists now do you see .      semper gor laughed suddenly .     space  time  and little meteors .  of course .  the earthmen would be putty in the hands of their own personifications of storm and motherhood come to life .  in two hundred years why  in two hundred years  we could do anything .         but this so called trade mission of yours  porus     interposed prat .     how would you get homo sol to accept it in the first place .      porus cocked his head to one side .     dear colleague prat     he murmured     do you suppose that i created the passive panic just for the show or just to gratify five woodenheads .  this passive panic paralyzed industry  and the terrestrial government is faced with revolution another form of mob action that could use investigation .  offer them galactic trade and eternal prosperity and do you think they   d jump at it .  has matter mass .      the rigellian cut short the excited babble that followed with an impatient gesture .     if you   ve nothing more to ask  gentlemen  let   s begin our preparations to leave .  frankly  i   m tired of earth  and  more than that  i   m blasted anxious to get back to that squid of mine .      he opened the door and shouted down the corridor     hey  haridini tell arn to have the ship ready in six hours .  we   re leaving .         but  .   .   .  but     the chorus of puzzled objections crystallized into sudden action as semper gor dashed at porus and snatched him back as he was on the point of leaving .  the little rigellian struggled vainly in the other   s powerful grasp .      let go .         we   ve endured enough  porus     said gor     and now you   ll just calm down and behave like a humanoid .  whatever you say  we   re not leaving until we   re finished .  we   ve got to arrange with the terrestrial government concerning the trade mission .  we   ve got to secure approval of the board .  we   ve got to pick our psychologist .  we   ve got to      here porus  with a sudden jerk  freed himself .     do you suppose for one moment that i would wait for your precious board to start to begin to commence to consider doing something about the situation in two or three decades .      earth agreed to my terms unconditionally a month ago .  the squad of canopans and betelgeusans set sail five months ago  and landed day before yesterday .  it was only with their help that we managed to stop yesterday   s panic though you never suspected it .  you probably thought you did it yourself .  today  gentlemen  they have the situation in full control and your services are no longer needed .  we   re going home .        the end       homo sol    has a plot of a sort that particularly appealed to campbell .  although the human beings in the story are far behind the other intelligences of the galaxy  it is clear that there is something special about them  that they have an unusual ability to move ahead very quickly  and that everyone else had better watch out for them .     campbell liked stories in which human beings proved themselves superior to other intelligences  even when those others were further advanced technologically .  it pleased him to have human beings shown to possess a unique spirit of daring  or a sense of humor  or a ruthless ability to kill when necessary  that always brought them victory over other intelligences  even against odds .   i sometimes got the uncomfortable notion  however  that this attitude reflected campbell   s feelings on the smaller  earth scale .  he seemed to me to accept the natural superiority of americans over non americans  and he seemed automatically to assume the picture of an american as one who was of northwest european origin .   i cannot say that campbell was racist in any evil sense of the term .  i cannot recall any act of his that could be construed as unkind  and certainly he never  not once  made me feel uncomfortable over the fact that i was jewish .  nevertheless  he did seem to take for granted  somehow  the stereotype of the nordic white as the true representative of man the explorer  man the darer  man the victor   i argued with him strenuously on the subject  or as violently as i dared  and in years to come our relationship was to be as nearly strained as it could be  considering our mutual affection  and all that i owed him  over the civil rights issue .  i was on the liberal side of the issue  he on the conservative  and our minds never met on that subject .   all this had an important bearing on my science fiction work .  i did not like campbell   s attitude concerning humanity vis a vis other intelligences and it took two revisions of    homo sol    before campbell could move me close enough to what he wanted .  even then  he inserted several paragraphs  here and there  without consulting me  in the final version .   i tried to avoid such a situation in future .  one way out was to depart from the traditions of those writers who wove plots against the gigantic web of entire galaxies containing many intelligences notably those of e .  e .  smith and of campbell himself .  instead  i began to think of stories involving a galaxy populated by human intelligences only .   this came to fruit  soon enough  in .  the    foundation    series .  undoubtedly the smith campbell view makes more sense .  it is almost certain that among the hundreds of billions of worlds in a large galaxy there ought to be hundreds or even thousands of different intelligent species .  that there should be only one  ourselves  as i postulated  is most unlikely .   some science fiction critics  notably sam moskowitz  have given me credit for inventing the human only galaxy  as though it were some kind of literary advance .  others may have thought privately  i have never heard it stated openly  that i had only human intelligences in my galaxy because i lacked the imagination to think up extraterrestrials .   but the fact is that i was only trying to avoid a collision with campbell   s views  i did not want to set up a situation in which i would be forced to face the alternatives of adopting campbell   s views when i found them repugnant and failing to sell a story  which i also found repugnant  .     on march           the day i put through my final submission of    homo sol     i went on to visit fred pohl at his office .  he told me that the response to    half breed    had been such that he felt justified in asking for a sequel .  it was the first time i had ever been requested to write a specific story with acceptance virtually guaranteed in advance .   i spent april and may working on the sequel     half breeds on venus     and submitted it to pohl on june   .  on june     he accepted it .  the story was ten thousand words long  the longest i had ever sold up to that time .  what   s more  pohl   s magazines were doing so well that his budget had been increased and he was able to pay me five eighths of a cent a word for it     .    .   it appeared in the issue of astonishing that reached the stands on october           two years almost to a day since my first sale .  this was a red letter day for me  too  since it was the first time that the cover painting on a magazine was ever taken from one of my stories .  i had    made the cover .      the title of the story and my name were on the cover in bold letters .  it was a flattering indication that my name could be counted on to sell magazines by this time .       half breeds on venus     the damp  somnolent atmosphere stirred violently and shrieked aside .  the bare plateau shook three times as the heavy egg shaped projectiles shot down from outer space .  the sound of the landing reverberated from the mountains on one side to the lush forest on the other  and then all was silent again .   one by one  three doors clanged open  and human figures stepped out in hesitant single file .  first slowly  and then with impatient turbulence  they set first foot upon the new world  until the space surrounding the ships was crowded .   a thousand pairs of eyes gazed upon the prospect and a thousand mouths chattered excitedly .  and in the other world wind  a thousand crests of foot high white hair swayed gracefully .   the tweenies had landed on venus .     max scanlon sighed wearily     here we are .      he turned from the porthole and slumped into his own special arm chair .     they   re as happy as children and i don   t blame them .  we   ve got a new world one all for ourselves  and that   s a great thing .  but just the same  there are hard days ahead  . of us .  i am almost afraid .  it is a project so lightly embarked upon  but one so hard to carry out to completion .      a gentle arm stole about his shoulder and he grasped it tightly  smiling into the soft  blue eyes that met his .     but you   re not afraid  are you  madeline .         certainly not .     and then her expression grew sadder     if only father had come with us .  you you know that he meant more to us than to the others .  we were the the first he took under his wing  weren   t we .      there was a long silence after that as each fell into deep thought .   max sighed     i remember him that day forty years ago  old suit  pipe  everything .  he took me in .  me  a despised half breed .  and and he found you for me  madeline .         i know     there were tears in her eyes .     but he   s still with us  max  and always will be here  and there .     her hand crept first to her own heart and then to max   s .        hey  there  dad  catch her  catch her .      max whirled at the sound of his elder son   s voice  just in time to catch up the little bundle of flying arms and legs that catapulted into him .   he held her gravely up before him     shall i give you to your papa  elsie .  he wants you .      the little girl kicked her legs ecstatically .     no  no .  i want you  grand daddy .  i want you to give me a piggy back and come out with grandmamma to see how nice everything is .      max turned to his son  and motioned him sternly away     depart  despised father  and let old grand dad have a chance .      arthur laughed and mopped a red face     keep her  for heaven   s sake .  she   s been leading me and the wife a merry chase outside .  we had to drag her back by the dress to keep her from running off into the forest .  didn   t we  elsie .      elsie  thus appealed to  suddenly recalled a past grievance .     grand daddy  tell him to let me see the pretty trees .  he doesn   t want me to .     she wriggled from max   s grasp and ran to the porthole .     see them  grand daddy  see them .  it   s all trees outside .  it   s not black anymore .  i hated it when it was black  didn   t you .      max leaned over and ruffled the child   s soft  white hair gravely     yes  elsie  i hated it when it was black .  but it isn   t black anymore  and it won   t ever be black again .  now go run to grandmamma .  she   ll get some cake specially for you .  go ahead  run .      he followed the departing forms of his wife and granddaughter with smiling eyes  and then  as they turned to his son  they became serious once more .      well  arthur .         well  dad  what now .         there   s no time to waste  son .  we   ve got to start building immediately underground .      arthur snapped into an attentive attitude     underground .     he frowned his dismay .      i know  i know .  i said nothing of this previously  but it   s got to be done .  at all costs we must vanish from the face of the system .  there are earthmen on venus purebloods .  there aren   t many  it   s true  but there are some .  they mustn   t find us at least  not until we are prepared for whatever may follow .  that will take years .         but father  underground .  to live like moles  hidden from light and air .  i don   t like that .         oh  nonsense .  don   t overdramatize .  well live on the surface but the city  the power stations  the food and water reserves  the laboratories all that must be below and impregnable .      the old tweenie gestured the subject away with impatience     forget that  anyway .  i want to talk about something else  something we   ve discussed already .      arthur   s eyes hardened and he shifted his glance to the ceiling .  max rose and placed his bands upon his son   s brawny shoulders .      i   m past sixty  arthur .  how long i have yet to live  i don   t know .  in any case  the best of me belongs to the past and it is better that i yield the leadership to a younger  more vigorous person .         dad  that   s sentimental bosh and you know it .  there isn   t one of us that   s fit to wipe your shoes and no one is going to listen for a second to any plan of appointing a successor while you   re still alive .         i   m not going to ask them to listen .  it   s done and you   re the new leader .      the younger man shook his head firmly     you can   t make me serve against my will .      max smiled whimsically     i   m afraid you   re dodging responsibility  son .  you   re leaving your poor old father to the strains and hardships of a job beyond his aged strength .         dad .     came the shocked retort .     that   s not so .  you know it isn   t .  you         then prove it .  look at it this way .  our race needs active leadership  and i can   t supply it .  i   ll always be here while i live to advise you and help you as best i can  but from now on  you must take the initiative .      arthur frowned and the words came from him reluctantly     all right  then .  i take the job of field commander .  but remember  you   re commander in chief .         good .  and now let   s celebrate the occasion .     max opened a cupboard and withdrew a box  from which he abstracted a pair of cigars .  he sighed     the supply of tobacco is down to the vanishing point and we won   t have any more until we grow our own  but  we   ll smoke to the new leader .      blue smoke curled upwards and max frowned through it at his son     where   s henry .      arthur grinned     dunno .  i haven   t seen him since we landed .  i can tell you with whom he is  though .      max grunted     i know that  too .         the kid   s making hay while the sun shines .  it won   t be many years now .  dad  before you   ll be spoiling a second set of grandchildren .         if they   re as good as the three of my first set  i only hope i live to see the day .      and father and son smiled affectionately at each other and listened in silence to the muted sound of happy laughter from the hundreds of tweenies outside .     henry scanlon cocked his head to one side  and raised his hand for silence     do you hear running water  irene .      the girl at his side nodded     over in that direction .         let   s go there  then .  a river flashed by just before we landed and maybe that   s it .         all right  if you say so  but i think we ought to be getting back to the ships .         what for .     henry stopped and stared .     i should think you   d be glad to stretch your legs after weeks on a crowded ship .         well  it might be dangerous .         not here in the highlands  irene .  venusian highlands are practically a second earth .  you can see this is forest and not jungle .  now if we were in the coastal regions     he broke off short  as if he had just remembered something .     besides  what   s there to be afraid of .  i   m with you  aren   t i .     and he patted the tonite gun at his hip .   irene repressed a sudden smile and shot an arch glance at her strutting companion     i   m quite aware that you   re with me .  that   s the danger .      henry   s chest deflated with an audible gasp .  he frowned .     very funny and i on my best behavior  too .     he drifted away  brooded sulkily awhile  and then addressed the trees in a distant manner     which reminds me that tomorrow is daphne   s birthday .  i   ve promised her a present .         get her a reducing belt     came the quick retort .     fat thing .         who   s fat .  daphne .  oh i wouldn   t say so .     he considered matters carefully  one thoughtful eye upon the young girl at his side .     now my description of her would be shall we say    pleasingly plump     or  maybe     comfortably upholstered .             she   s fat     irene   s voice was suddenly a hiss  and something very like a frown wrinkled her lovely face     and her eyes are green .     she swung on ahead  chin high  and superbly conscious of her own little figure .   henry hastened his steps and caught up     of course  i prefer skinny girls any day .   irene whirled on him and her little fists clenched     i   m not skinny  you incredibly stupid ape .         but irene  who said i meant you .     his voice was solemn  but his eyes were laughing   the girl reddened to the ears and turned away  lower lip trembling .  the smile faded from henry   s eyes and was replaced by a look of concern .  his arm shot out hesitantly and slipped about her shoulder .      angry  irene .      the smile that lit her face of a sudden was as brilliant as the sparkling sheen of her silvery hair in the bright sun .      no     she said .   their eyes met and  for a moment  henry hesitated and found that he who hesitates is lost  for with a sudden twist and a smothered laugh  irene was free once more .   pointing through a break in the trees  she cried     look  a lake .     and was off at a run .   henry scowled  muttered something under his breath  and ran after .   the scene was truly earthly .  a rapids broken stream wound its way through banks of slender trunked trees and then spread into a placid lake some miles in width .  the brooding quiet was unbroken save by the muffled beat that issued from the throat bags of the frilled lizards that nested in the upper reaches of the trees .   the two tweenies boy and girl stood hand in hand upon the bank and drank in the beauty of the scene .   then there was a muffled splash near by and irene shrank into the encircling arms of her companion .      what   s the matter .         n nothing .  something moved in the water  i think .         oh  imagination  irene .         no .  i did see something .  it came up and oh  goodness  henry  don   t squeeze so tightly      she almost lost her balance as henry suddenly dropped her altogether and jerked at his tonite gun .   immediately before them  a dripping green head lifted out of the water and regarded them out of wide set  staring goggle eyes .  its broad lipless mouth opened and closed rapidly  but not a sound issued forth .     max scanlon stared thoughtfully at the rugged foot hills ahead and clasped his hands behind his back .      you think so  do you .         certainly  dad     insisted arthur  enthusiastically .     if we burrow under these piles of granite  all earth couldn   t get at us .  it wouldn   t take two months to form the entire cavern  with our unlimited power .         hmph .  it will require care .         it will get it .         mountainous regions are quake regions .         we can rig up enough stat rays to hold up all venus  quakes or no quakes .         stat rays eat up energy wholesale  and a breakdown that will leave us energyless would mean the end .         we can hook up five separate power houses  as foolproof as we can make them .  all five won   t break down at once .      the old tweenie smiled     all right  son .  i see you   ve got it planned thoroughly .  go ahead .  start whenever you want and remember  it   s all up to you .         good .  let   s get back to the ships .     they picked their way gingerly down the rocky  slope .      you know  arthur     said max  stopping suddenly     i   ve been thinking about those stat beams .         yes .     arthur offered his arm  and the two resumed their walk .      it   s occurred to me that if we could make them two dimensional in extent and curve them  we   d have the perfect defense  as long as our energy lasted a stat field .         you need four dimensional radiation for that .  dad nice to think about but can   t be done .         oh  is that so .  well  listen to this      what arthur was to listen to remained hidden  however  for that day at least .  a piercing shout ahead jerked both their heads upward .  up towards them came the bounding form of henry scanlon  and following him  at a goodly distance and a much more leisurely pace  came irene .      say  dad  i had a devil of a time finding you .  where were you .         right here  son .  where were you .         oh  just around .  listen  dad .  you know those amphibians the explorers talk about as inhabiting the highland lakes of venus  don   t you .  well  we   ve located them  lots of them  a regular convoy of them .  haven   t we  irene .      irene paused to catch her breath and nodded her head     they   re the cutest things  mr .  scanlon .  all green .     she wrinkled her nose laughingly .   arthur and his father exchanged glances of doubt .  the former shrugged .     are you sure you haven   t been seeing things .  i remember once .  henry  when you sighted a meteor in space  scared us all to death  and then had it turn out to be your own reflection in the port glass .      henry  painfully aware of irene   s snicker  thrust out a belligerent lower lip     say  art  i guess you   re looking for a shove in the face .  and i   m old enough to give it to you  too .         whoa there  quiet down     came the peremptory voice of the elder scanlon     and you  arthur  had better leam to respect your younger brother   s dignity .  now here .  henry  all arthur meant was that these amphibians are as shy as rabbits .  no one   s ever caught more than a glimpse of them .         well  we have .  dad .  lots of them .  i guess they were attracted by irene .  no one can resist her .         i know you can   t     and arthur laughed loudly .   henry stiffened once more  but his father stepped between .     grow up  you two .  let   s go and see these amphibians .           this is amazing     exclaimed max scanlon .     why  they   re as friendly as children .  i can   t understand it .      arthur shook his head     neither can i  dad .  in fifty years  no explorer has ever gotten a good look at one  and here they are thick as flies .      henry was throwing pebbles into the lake .     watch this  all of you .      a pebble curved its way into the water  and as it splashed six green forms turned a back somersault and slid smoothly below the surface .  with no time for a breath between  one was up again and the pebble arced back to fall at henry   s feet .   the amphibians were crowding closer in ever increasing numbers now  approaching the very edge of the lake  where they grasped at the coarse reeds on the bank and stared goggle eyed at the tweenies .  their muscular webbed  legs could be seen below the surface of the water  moving back and forth with lazy grace .  without cessation  the lipless mouths opened and closed in a queer  uneven rhythm .      i think they   re talking  mr .  scanlon     said irene  suddenly .      it   s quite possible     agreed the old tweenie  thoughtfully .     their brain cases are fairly large  and they may possess considerable intelligence .  if their voice boxes and ears are tuned to sound waves of higher or lower range than our own  we would be unable to hear them and that might very well explain their soundlessness .         they   re probably discussing us as busily as we are them     said arthur .      yes  and wondering what sort of freaks we are     added irene .   henry said nothing .  he was approaching the edge of the lake with cautious steps .  the ground grew muddy beneath his feet  and the reeds thick .  the group of amphibians nearest turned anxious eyes toward him  and one or two loosened their hold and slipped silently away .   but the nearest held his ground .  his wide mouth was clamped tight  his eyes were wary but he did not move .   henry  paused  hesitated  and then held out his hand     hiya  phib .      the    phib    stared at the outstretched hand .  very cautiously  his own webbed forelimb stretched out and touched the tweenie   s fingers .  with a jerk  they were drawn back  and the phib   s mouth worked in soundless excitement .      be careful     came max   s voice from behind .     you   ll scare him that way .  his skin is terribly sensitive and dry objects must irritate him .  dip your hand in the water .      slowly  henry obeyed .  the phib   s muscles tensed to escape at the slightest sudden motion  but none came .  again the tweenie   s hand was held out  dripping wet this time .   for a long minute  nothing happened  as the phib seemed to debate within itself the future course of action .  and then  after two false starts and hasty withdrawals  fingers touched again .      ataphib     said henry  and clasped the green hand in his own .   a single  startled jerk followed and then a lusty return of pressure to an extent that numbed the tweenie   s fingers .  evidently encouraged by the first phib   s example  his fellows were crowding close now  offering hosts of hands .   the other three tweenies slushed up through the mud now  and offered wetted hands in their turn .      that   s funny     said irene .     everytime i shake hands i seem to keep thinking of hair .      max turned to her     hair .         yes  ours .  i get a picture of long  white hair  standing straight up and shining in the sun .     her hand rose unconsciously to her own smooth tresses .      say .     interrupted henry suddenly     i   ve been noticing that  too  now that you mention it .  only when i shake hands  though .         how about you  arthur .     asked max .   arthur nodded once  his eyebrows climbing .   max smiled and pounded fist into palm .     why  it   s a primitive sort of telepathy too weak to work without physical contact and even then capable of delivering only a few simple ideas .         but why hair  dad .     asked arthur .      maybe it   s our hair that attracted them in the first place .  they   ve never seen anything like it and and well  who can explain their psychology .      he was down on his knees suddenly  splashing water over his high crest of hair .  there was a frothing of water and a surging of green bodies as the phibs pressed closer .  one green paw passed gently through the stiff white crest  followed by excited  if noiseless  chattering .  struggling amongst themselves for favored vantage points  they competed for the privilege of touching the hair until max  for sheer weariness  was forced to rise again .      they   re probably our friends for life now     he said .     a pretty queer set of animals .      it was irene  then  who noticed the group of phib .  a hundred yards from shore .  they paddled quietly  making no effort to approach closer     why don   t they come .     she asked .   she turned to one of the foremost phibs and pointed  making frantic gestures of dubious meaning .  she received only solemn stares in return .      that   s not the way  irene     admonished max  gently .  he     held out his hand  grasped that of a willing phib and stood motionless for a moment .  when he loosed his grip  the phib slid into the water and disappeared .  in a moment  the laggard phibs were approaching shore slowly .      how did you do it .     gasped irene .      telepathy .  i held on tightly and pictured an isolated group of phibs and a long hand stretching out over the water to shake theirs .     he smiled gently     they are quite intelligent  or they would not have understood so readily .         why  they   re females     cried arthur  in sudden breathless astonishment    by all that   s holy  they suckle their young .      the newcomers were slenderer and lighter in color than the others .  they advanced shyly  urged on by the bolder males and held out timid hands in greeting .      oh h     irene cried in sudden delight .     look at this .      she was down on her knees in the mud  arms outstretched to the nearest female .  the other three watched in fascinated silence as the nervous she phib clasped its tiny armful closer to its breast .   but irene   s arms made little inviting gestures     please  please .  it   s so cute .  i won   t hurt him .      whether the phib mother understood is doubtful  but with a sudden motion  she held out a little green bundle of squirming life and deposited it in the waiting arms .   irene rose  squealing with delight .  little webbed feet kicked aimlessly and round frightened eyes stared at her .  the other three crowded close and watched it curiously .      its the dearest little thing  it is .  look at its funny little mouth .  do you want to hold it .  henry .      henry jumped backwards as if stung     not on your life .  i   d probably drop it .         do you get any thought images  irene .     asked max  thoughtfully .   irene considered and frowned her concentration     no o .  it   s too young  mayb oh  yes .  it   s it   s     she stopped  and tried to laugh .     it   s hungry .      she returned the little baby phib to its mother  whose muscular arms clasped the little mite close .  the tiny phib swiveled its little green head to bend one last goggling look at the creature that had held it for an instant .      friendly creatures     said max     and intelligent .  they can keep their lakes and rivers .  we   ll take the land and won   t interfere with them .        a lone tweenie stood on scanlon ridge and his field glass pointed at the divide ten miles up the hills .  for five minutes  the glass did not waver and the tweenie stood like some watchful statue made of the same rock as formed the mountains all about .   and then the field glass lowered  and the tweenie   s face was a pale thin lipped picture of gloom .  he hastened down the slope to the guarded  hidden entrance to venustown .   he shot past the guards without a word and descended into the lower levels where solid rock was still being puffed into nothingness and shaped at will by controlled blasts of super energy .   arthur scanlon looked up and with a sudden premonition of disaster  gestured the disintegrators to a halt .      what   s wrong  sorrell .      the tweenie leant over and whispered a single word into arthur   s ear .      where .     arthur   s voice jerked out hoarsely .      on the other side of the ridge .  they   re coming through the divide now in our direction .  i spotted the blaze of sun on metal and     he held up his field glass significantly .      good lord .     arthur rubbed his forehead distractedly and then turned to the anxiously watching tweenie at the controls of the disinto .     continue as planned .  no change .      he hurried up the levels to the entrance  and snapped out hurried orders     triple the guard immediately .  no one but me or those with me  are to be permitted to leave .  send out men to round up any stragglers outside immediately and order them to keep within shelter and make no unnecessary sound .      then  back again through the central avenue to his father   s quarters .   max scanlon looked up from his calculations and his grave forehead smoothed out slowly .      hello  son .  is anything wrong .  another resistant stratum .         no  nothing like that .     arthur closed the door carefully and lowered his voice .     earthmen .      for a moment .  max made no movement .  the expression on his face froze for an instant  and then  with a sudden exhalation  he slumped in his chair and the lines in his forehead deepened wearily .      settlers .         looks so .  sorrell said women and children were among them .  there were several hundred in all  equipped for a stay and headed in this direction .      max groaned     oh  the luck  the luck .  all the vast empty spaces of venus to choose and they come here .  come  let   s get a firsthand look at this .        they came through the divide in a long  snaky line .  hard bitten pioneers with their pinched work worn women and their carefree  half barbarous  wilderness bred children .  the low  broad    venus vans    joggled clumsily over the untrodden ways  loaded down with amorphous masses of household necessities .   the leaders surveyed the prospect and one spoke in clipped  jerky syllables     almost through  jem .  we   re out among the foothills now .      and the other replied slowly     and there   s good new growing land ahead .  we can stake out farms and settle down .     he sighed     it   s been tough going this last month .  i   m glad it   s over .      and from a ridge ahead the last ridge before the valley the scanlons  father and son  unseen dots in the distance  watched the newcomers with heavy hearts .      the one thing we could not prepare for and it   s happened .      arthur spoke slowly and reluctantly     they are few and unarmed .  we can drive them out in an hour .     with sudden fierceness     venus is ours .         yes  we can drive them out in an hour in ten minutes .  but they would return  in thousands  and armed .  we   re not ready to fight all earth  arthur .      the younger man bit his lip and words were muttered forth half in shame     for the sake of the race .  father we could kill them all .         never .     exclaimed max  his old eyes flashing .     we will not be the first to strike .  if we kill  we can expect no mercy from earth  and we will deserve none         but  father  what else .  we can expect no mercy from earth as it is .  if we   re spotted  if they ever suspect our existence  our whole hegira becomes pointless and we lose out at the very beginning .         i know .  i know .         we can   t change now     continued arthur  passionately .     we   ve spent months preparing venustown .  how could we start over .         we can   t     agreed max  tonelessly .     to even attempt to move would mean sure discovery .  we can only         live like moles after all .  hunted fugitives .  frightened refugees .  is that it .         put it any way you like but we must hide  arthur  and bury ourselves .         until  .         until i or we perfect a curved two dimensional statbeam .  surrounded by an impermeable defense  we can come out into the open .  it may take years  it may take one week .  i don   t know .         and every day we run the risk of detection .  any day the swarms of purebloods can come down upon us and wipe us out .  we   ve got to hang by a hair day after day  week after week  month after month         we   ve got to .     max   s mouth was clamped shut  and his eyes were a frosty blue .   slowly  they went back to venustown .     things were quiet in venustown  and eyes were turned to the top most level and the hidden exits .  out there was air and the sun and space and earthmen .   they had settled several miles up the river bed .  their rude houses were springing up .  surrounding land was being cleared .  farms were being staked out .  planting was taking place .   and in the bowels of venus  eleven hundred tweenies shaped their home and waited for an old man to track down the elusive equations that would enable a stat ray to spread in two dimensions and curve .   irene brooded somberly as she sat upon the rocky ledge and stared ahead to where the dim gray light indicated the existence of an exit to the open .  her shapely legs swung gently back and forth and henry scanlon  at her side  fought desperately to keep his gaze focussed harmlessly upon air .      you know what .  henry .         what .         i   ll bet the phibs could help us .         help us do what  irene .         help us get rid of the earthmen .      henry thought it over carefully     what makes you think that .         well  they   re pretty clever cleverer than we think .  their minds are altogether different  though  and maybe they could fix it .  besides i   ve just got a feeling .     she withdrew her hand suddenly     you don   t have to hold it .  henry .      henry swallowed     i i thought you had a sort of unsteady seat there might fall  you know .         oh .     irene looked down the terrific three foot drop .     there   s something in what you say .  it does look pretty high here .      henry decided he was in the presence of a hint  and acted accordingly .  there was a moment   s silence while he seriously considered the possibility of her feeling a bit chilly but before he had quite decided that she probably was  she spoke again      what i was going to say  henry  was this .  why don   t we go out and see the phibs .         dad would take my head off if i tried anything like that .         it would be a lot of fun .         sure  but it   s dangerous .  we can   t risk anyone seeing us .      irene shrugged resignedly     well  if you   re afraid  we   ll say no more about it .      henry gasped and reddened .  he was off the ledge in a bound     who   s afraid .  when do you want to go .         right now  henry .  right this very minute .     her cheeks flushed with enthusiasm .      all right then .  come on .     he started off at a half run  dragging her along .  and then a thought occurred to him and he stopped short .   he turned to her fiercely     i   ll show you if i   m afraid .     his arms were suddenly about her and her little cry of surprise was muffled effectively .      goodness     said irene  when in a position to speak once more .     how thoroughly brutal .         certainly .  i   m a very well known brute     gasped henry  as he uncrossed his eyes and got rid of the swimming sensation in his head .     now let   s get to those phibs  and remind me  when i   m president  to put up a memorial to the fellow who invented kissing .        up through the rock lined corridor  past the backs of outward gazing sentries  out through the carefully camouflaged opening  and they were upon the surface .   the smudge of smoke on the southern horizon was grim evidence of the presence of man  and with that in mind  the two young tweenies slithered through the underbrush into the forest and through the forest to the lake of the phibs .   whether in some strange way of their own the phibs sensed the presence of friends  the two could not tell  but they had scarcely reached the banks when approaching dull green smudges beneath water told of the creatures    coming .   a wide  goggle eyed head broke the surface  and  in a second  bobbing frogheads dotted the lake .   henry wet his hand and seized the friendly forelimb outstretched to him .      hi there  phib .      the grinning mouth worked and made its soundless answer .      ask him about the earthmen  henry     urged irene .  henry motioned impatiently .      wait a while .  it takes time .  i   m doing the best i can .      for two slow minutes  the two  tweenie and phib  remained motionless and stared into each other   s eyes .  and then the phib broke away and  at some silent order  every lake creature vanished  leaving the tweenies alone .   irene stared for a moment  nonplussed     what happened .      henry shrugged     i don   t know .  i pictured the earthmen and he seemed to know who i meant .  then i pictured earthmen fighting us and killing us and he pictured a lot of us and only a few of them and another fight in which we killed them .  but then i pictured us killing them and then a lot more of them coming hordes and hordes and killing us and then      but the girl was holding her hands to her tortured ears     oh  my goodness .  no wonder the poor creature didn   t understand .  i wonder he didn   t go crazy .         well  i did the best i could     was the gloomy response .     this was all your nutty idea  anyway .      irene got no further with her retort than the opening syllable  for in a moment the lake was crowded with phibs once more .     they   ve come back     she said instead .   a phib pushed forward and seized henry   s hand while the others crowded around in great excitement .  there were several moments of silence and irene fidgeted .      well .     she said .      quiet  please .  i don   t get it .  something about big animals  or monsters  or     his voice trailed away  and the furrow between his eyes deepened into painful concentration .   he nodded  first abstractedly  then vigorously .   he broke away and seized irene   s hands .     i   ve got it and it   s the perfect solution .  we can save venustown all by ourselves  irene  with the help of the phibs if you want to come to the lowlands with me tomorrow .  we can take along a pair of tonite pistols and food supplies and if we follow the river  it oughtn   t to take us more than two or three days there and the same time back .  what do you say  irene .      youth is not noted for forethought .  irene   s hesitation was for effect only     well maybe we shouldn   t go ourselves  but  but i   ll go with you .     there was the lightest accent on the last word .   ten seconds later  the two were on their way back to venustown  and henry was wondering  if on the whole  it weren   t better to put up two memorials to the fellow who invented kissing .     the flickering red yellow of the fire sent back ruddy highlights from henry   s lordly crest of hair and cast shifting shadows upon his brooding face .   it was hot in the lowlands  and the fire made it worse  yet henry huddled close and kept an anxious eye upon the sleeping form of irene on the other side .  the teeming life of the venusian jungle respected fire  and the flames spelt safety .   they were three days from the plateau now .  the stream had become a lukewarm  slowly moving river  the shores of which were covered with the green scum of algae .  the pleasant forests had given way to the tangled  vine looped growths of the jungle .  the mingled sounds of life had grown in volume and increased to a noisy crescendo .  the air became warmer and damper  the ground swampier  the surroundings more fantastically unfamiliar .   and yet there was no real danger of that  henry was convinced .  poisonous life was unknown on venus  and as for the tough skinned monsters that lorded the jungles  the fire at night and the phibs during day would keep them away .   twice the ear splitting shriek of a centosaur had sounded in the distance and twice the sound of crashing trees had caused the two tweenies to draw together in fear .  both times     i the monsters had moved away again .       this was the third night out  and henry stirred uneasily .  the phibs seemed confident that before morning they could start their return trip  and somehow the thought of venustown was rather attractive .  adventure and excitement are fine and with every passing hour the glory of his scintillating bravery grew in irene   s eyes which was wonderful but still venustown and the friendly highlands were nice to think about .   he threw himself on his stomach and gazed morosely into the fire  thinking of his twenty years of age almost twenty years .      why  heck     he tore at the rank grass beneath .     it   s about time i was thinking of getting married .     and his eye strayed involuntarily to the sleeping form beyond the fire .   as if in response  there was a flickering of eyelids and a vague stare out of deep blue eyes .   irene sat up and stretched .      i can   t sleep at all     she complained  brushing futilely at her white hair .     it   s so hot    she stared at the fire distastefully .   henry   s good humor persisted .     you slept for hours and snored like a trombone .      irene   s eyes snapped wide open .     i did not .     then  with a voice vibrant with tragedy     did i .         no  of course not .     henry howled his laughter  stopping only at the sudden  sharp contact between the toe of irene   s shoe and the pit of his own stomach .     ouch     he said .      don   t speak to me anymore .  mister scanlon .     was the girl   s frigid remark .   it was henry   s turn to look tragic .  he rose in panicky dismay and took a single step towards the girl .  and then he froze in his tracks at the ear piercing shriek of a centosaur .  when he came to himself  he found his arms full of irene .   reddening  she disentangled herself  and then the centosaurian shriek sounded again  from another direction  and there she was  right back again .   henry   s face was pale  in spite of his fair armful .     i think the phibs have snared the centosaurs .  come with me and i   ll ask them .        the phibs were dim blotches in the grey dawn that was breaking .  rows and rows of strained  abstracted individuals were all that met the eye .  only one seemed to be unoccupied and when henry rose from the handclasp  he said     they   ve got three centosaurs and that   s all they can handle .  we   re starting back to the highlands right now .      the rising sun found the party two miles up the river .  the tweenies  hugging the shore  cast wary eyes towards the bordering jungle .  through an occasional clearing  vast grey bulks could be made out the noise of the reptilian shrieks was almost continuous .      i   m sorry i brought you  irene     said henry .     i   m not so sure now that the phibs can take care of the monsters .      irene shook her head .     that   s all right  henry .  i wanted to come .  only i wish we had thought of letting the phibs bring the beasts themselves .  they don   t need us .         yes  they do .  if a centosaur gets out of control  it will make straight for the tweenies and they   d never get away .  we   ve got the tonite guns to kill the    saurs with if the worst comes to the worst     his voice trailed away and he glanced at the lethal weapon in his hand and derived but cold comfort therefrom .   the first night was sleepless for both tweenies .  somewhere  unseen in the blackness of the river  phibs took shifts and their telepathic control over the tiny brains of the gigantic  twenty legged centosaurs maintained its tenuous hold .  off in the jungle  three hundred ton monsters howled impatiently against the force that drove them up the river side against their will and raved impotently against the unseen barrier that prevented them from approaching the stream .   by the side of the fire  a pair of tweenies  lost between mountainous flesh on one side and the fragile protection of a telepathic web on the other  gazed longingly towards the highlands some forty miles off .   progress was slow .  as the phibs tired  the centosaurs grew balkier .  but gradually  the air grew cooler .  the rank jungle growth thinned out and the distance to venustown shortened .   henry greeted the first signs of familiar temperate zone forest with a tremulous sigh of relief .  only irene   s presence prevented him from discarding his role of heroism .   he felt pitifully eager for their quixotic journey to be over  but he only said     it   s practically all over but the shouting .  and you can bet there   ll be shouting  irene .  we   ll be heroes  you and i .      irene   s attempt at enthusiasm was feeble .     i   m tired .  henry .  let   s rest .     she sank slowly to the ground  and henry  after signalling the phibs  joined her .      how much longer  henry .     almost without volition  she found her head nestling wearily against his shoulder .      one more day  irene .  tomorrow this time  we   ll be back .     he looked wretched     you think we shouldn   t have tried to do this ourselves  don   t you .         well  it seemed a good idea at the time .         yes  i know     said henry .     i   ve noticed that i get lots of ideas that seem good at the time  but sometimes they turn sour .     he shook his head philosophically     i don   t know why  but that   s the way it is .         all i know     said irene     is that i don   t care if i never move another step in my life .  i wouldn   t get up now      her voice died away as her beautiful blue eyes stared off towards the right .  one of the centosaurs stumbled into the waters of a small  tributary to the stream they were following .  wallowing in the water  his huge serpentine body mounted on the ten stocky pairs of legs  glistened horribly .  his ugly head weaved towards the sky and his terrifying call pierced the air .  a second joined him .   irene was on her feet .     what are you waiting for .  henry .  let   s go .  hurry .      henry gripped his tonite gun tightly and followed .     arthur scanlon gulped savagely at his fifth cup of black coffee and  with an effort  brought the audiomitter into optical focus .  his eyes  he decided  were becoming entirely too balky .  he rubbed them into red rimmed irritation and cast a glance over his shoulder at the restlessly sleeping figure on the couch .   he crept over to her  and adjusted the coverlet .      poor mom     he whispered  and bent to kiss the pale lips .   he turned to the audiomitter and clenched a fist at it     wait till i get you  you crazy nut     madeline stirred     is it dark yet .         no     lied arthur with feeble cheerfulness .     hell call before sundown .  mom .  you just sleep and let me take care of things .  dad   s upstairs working on the stat field and he says he   s making progress .  in a few days everything will be all right .     he sat silently beside her and grasped her band tightly .  her tired eyes closed once more .   the signal light blinked on and  with a last look at his mother  he stepped out into the corridor     well .      the waiting tweenie saluted smartly     john barno wants to say that it looks as if we are in for a storm .     he handed over an official report .   arthur glanced at it peevishly     what of that .  we   ve had plenty so far  haven   t we .  what do you expect of venus .         this will be a particularly bad one  from all indications .  the barometer has fallen unprecedentedly .  the ionic concentration of the upper atmosphere is at an unequalled maximum .  the beulah river has overflowed its banks and is rising rapidly .      the other frowned     there   s not an entrance to venustown that isn   t at least fifty yards above river level .  as for rain  our drainage system is to be relied upon .     he grimaced suddenly .     go back and tell barno that it can storm for my part  for forty days and forty nights if it wants to .  maybe it will drive the earthmen away .      he turned away  but the tweenie held his ground     beg pardon sir  but that   s not the worst .  a scouting party today      arthur whirled .     a scouting party .  who ordered one to be sent out .         your father  sir .  they were to make contact with the phibs  i don   t know why .         well  go on .         sir  the phibs could not be located .      and now  for the first time  arthur was startled out of his savage ill humor     they were gone .      the tweenie nodded     it is thought that they have sought shelter from the coming storm .  it is that which causes barno to fear the worst .         they say rats desert a sinking ship     murmured arthur .  he buried his head in trembling hands .     godi everything at once .  everything at once .        the darkening twilight hid the pall of blackness that lowered over the mountains ahead and emphasized the darting flashes of lightning that flickered on and off continuously .   irene shivered     it   s getting sort of windy and chilly  isn   t it .         the cold wind from the mountains .  we   re in for a storm  i guess     henry assented absently .     i think the river is getting wider .      a short silence  and then  with sudden vivacity     but look  irene  only a few more miles to the lake and then we   re practically at the earth village .  it   s almost over .      irene nodded     i   m glad for all of us and the phibs  too .      she had reason for the last statement .  the phibs were swimming slowly now .  an additional detachment had arrived the day before from upstream  but even with those reinforcements  progress had slowed to a walk .  unaccustomed cold was nipping the multi legged reptiles and they yielded to superior mental force more and more reluctantly .     the first drops fell just after they had passed the lake .  darkness had fallen  and in the blue glare of the lightning the trees about them were ghostly specters reaching swaying fingers towards the sky .  a sudden flare in the distance marked the funeral pyre of a lightning hit tree .   henry paled .     make for the clearing just ahead .  at a time like this  trees are dangerous .      the clearing he spoke of composed the outskirts of the earth village .  the rough hewn houses  crude and small against the fury of the elements  showed lights here and there that spoke of human occupancy .  and as the first centosaur stumbled out from between splintered trees  the storm suddenly burst in all its fury .   the two tweenies huddled close .     it   s up to the phibs     screamed henry  dimly heard above the wind and rain .     i hope they can do it .      the three monsters converged upon the houses ahead .  they moved more rapidly as the phibs called up every last bit of mental power .   irene buried her wet head in henry   s equally wet shoulder     i can   t look .  those houses will go like matchsticks .  oh  the poor people .         no  irene  no .  they   ve stopped .      the centosaurs pawed vicious gouges out of the ground beneath and their screams rang shrill and clear above the noise of the storm .  startled earthmen rushed from their cabins .   caught unprepared most having been roused from sleep  and faced with a venusian storm and nightmarish venusian monsters  there was no question of organized action .  as they stood  carrying nothing but their clothes  they broke and ran .   there was the utmost confusion .  one or two  with dim attempts at presence of mind  took wild  ineffectual pot shots at the mountains of flesh before them and then ran .   and when it seemed that all were gone  the giant reptiles surged forward once more and where once had been houses  there were left only mashed splinters .      they   ll never come back  irene  they   ll never come back .     henry was breathless at the success of his plan .     we   re heroes now  and     his voice rose to a hoarse shriek     irene  get back .  make for the trees .      the centosaurian howls had taken on a deeper note .  the nearest one reared onto his two hindmost pairs of legs and his great head  two hundred feet above ground  was silhouetted horribly against the lightning .  with a rumbling thud  he came down on all feet again and made for the river which under the lash of the storm was now a raging flood .   the phibs had lost control .   henry   s tonite gun flashed into quick action as he shoved irene away .  she  however  backed away slowly and brought her own gun into line .   the ball of purple light that meant a hit blazed into being and the nearest centosaur screamed in agony as its mighty tail threshed aside the surrounding trees .  blindly  the hole where once a leg had been gushing blood  it charged .   a second glare of purple and it was down with an earthshaking thud  its last shriek reaching a crescendo of shrill frightfulness .   but the other two monsters were crashing towards them .  they blundered blindly towards the source of the power that  had held them captive almost a week  driving violently with all the force of their mindless hate to the river .  and in the path of the juggernauts were the two tweenies .   the boiling torrent was at their backs .  the forest was a groaning wilderness of splintered trees and ear splitting sound .   then  suddenly  the reports of tonite guns sounded from the distance .  purple glares a flurry of threshing spasmodic shrieking and then a silence in which even the wind  as if overawed by recent events  held its peace momentarily .   henry yelled his glee and performed an impromptu war dance .     they   ve come from venustown  irene     he shouted .     they   ve got the centosaurs and everything   s finished .  we   ve saved the tweenies .        it happened in a breath   s time .  irene had dropped her gun and sobbed her relief .  she was running to henry and then she tripped and the river had her .      henry .     the wind whipped the sound away .   for one dreadful moment .  henry found himself incapable of motion .  he could only stare stupidly  unbelievingly  at the spot where irene had been  and then he was in the water .  he plunged into the surrounding blackness desperately .      irene .     he caught his breath with difficulty .  the current drove him on .      irene .     no sound but the wind .  his efforts at swimming were futile .  he couldn   t even break surface for more than a second at a time  his lungs were bursting .      irene .     there was no answer .   nothing but rushing water and darkness .   and then something touched him .  he lashed out at it instinctively  but the grip tightened .  he felt himself borne up into the air .  his tortured lungs breathed in gasps .  a grinning phib face stared into his and after that there were nothing but confused impressions of cold  dark wetness .     he became aware of his surroundings by stages .  first  that he was sitting on a blanket under the trees  with other blankets wrapped tightly about him .  then  he felt the warm radiation of the heatlamps upon him and the illumination of atomo bulbs .  people were crowding close and he noticed that it was no longer raining .   he stared about him hazily and then     irene .      she was beside him  as wrapped up as he  and smiling feebly     i   m all right  henry .  the phibs dragged me back  too .      madeline was bending over him and he swallowed the hot coffee placed to his lips .     the phibs have told us of what you two have helped them do .  we   re all proud of you  son you and irene .      max   s smile transfigured his face into the picture of paternal pride     the psychology you used was perfect .  venus is too vast and has too many friendly areas to expect earthmen to return to places that have shown themselves to be infested with centosaurs not for a good long while .  and when they do come back  we shall have our stat field .      arthur scanlon hurried up out of the gloom .  he thwacked henry on the shoulder and then wrung irene   s hand .     your guardian and i     he told her     are fixing up a celebration for day after tomorrow  so get good and rested .  it   s going to be the greatest thing you ever saw .      henry spoke lip     celebration  huh .  well  i   ll tell you what you can do .  after it   s over  you can announce an engagement        an engagement .     madeline sat up and looked interested .     what do you mean .         an engagement to be married     came the impatient answer .     i   m old enough  i suppose .  today proves it .      irene   s eyes bent in furious concentration upon the grass     with whom .  henry .         huh .  with you  of course .  gosh  who else could it be .         but you haven   t asked me .     the words were uttered slowly and with great firmness .   for a moment henry flushed  and then his jaws grew grim     well  i   m not going to .  i   m telling you .  and what are you going to do about it .      he leaned close to her and max scanlon chuckled and motioned the others away .  on tip toes  they left .   a dim shape hobbled into view and the two tweenies separated in confusion .  they had forgotten the others .   but it wasn   t another tweenie .     why why  it   s a phib .     cried irene .   he limped his ungainly way across the wet grass  with the inexpert aid of his muscular arms .  approaching  he flopped wearily on his stomach and extended his forearms .   his purpose was plain .  irene and henry grasped a hand apiece .  there was silence a moment or two and the phib   s great eyes glinted solemnly in the light of the atomo lamps .  then there was a sudden squeal of embarrassment from irene and shy laugh from henry .  contact was broken .      did you get the same thing i did .     asked henry .   irene was red     yes  a long row of little baby phibs  maybe fifteen         or twenty     said henry .       with long white hear .        the end    the story  not surprisingly  reflects my personal situation at the time .  i had gone to a boys    high school and to a boys    college .  now that i was in graduate school  however  the surroundings were  for the first time  coeducational .     in the fall of       i discovered that a beautiful blond girl had the desk next to mine in the laboratory of my course in synthetic organic chemistry .  naturally i was attracted .   i persuaded her to go out with me on simple dates  the very first being on my twentieth birthday  when i took her to radio city music hall .  for five months  i mooned after her with feckless  romanticism .   at the end of the school year  though  she had earned her master of arts degree and  having decided not to go on for her doctorate  left school and took a job in wilmington  delaware  leaving me behind  woebegone and stricken .   i got over it  of course  but while she was still at school i wrote    half breeds on venus .     of all the stories i had yet written  it was the most heavily boy and girl .  the heroine   s name was irene  which was the name of my pretty blond lab neighbor .   merely having a few dates on the hand holding level did not  however  perform the magic required to make me capable of handling passion in literature  and i continued to use girls sparingly in later stories and a good thing  too  i think .     the success of    half breeds on venus    made the notion of writing sequels generally seem a good idea .  a sequel to a successful story must  after all  be a reasonably sure sale .  so even while i was working on    half breeds on venus     i suggested to campbell that i write a sequel to    homo sol .      campbell   s enthusiasm was moderate  but he was willing to look at such a sequel if i were to write it .  i did write it as soon as    half breeds on venus    was done and called it    the imaginary .     although it used one of the chief characters of    homo sol     the human nonhuman confrontation was absent  which probably didn   t help it as far as campbell was concerned .  i submitted it to him on june     and received it back a rejection  sequel or no sequel on june    .   pohl rejected it  too .  tremaine read it with more sympathy and was thinking of taking it for comet  i heard  but that magazine ceased publication and the story was back on the market .  actually  i retired it  but two years later i sold it to pohl   s magazine after all but at a time when pohl was no longer editor .   but though i had my troubles and didn   t click every time  or even right away  i did manage to make      during my first year as a graduate student  and that was an enormous help .       the imaginary     the telecaster flashed its fitful signal  while tan porus sat by complacently .  his sharp  green eyes glittered their triumph  and his tiny body was vibrant with excitement .  nothing could have better indicated the greatness of the occasion than his extraordinary position tan porus had his feet on the desk .   the    caster glowed into life and a broad arcturian countenance frowned fretfully out at the rigellian psychologist .      do you have to drag me here straight from bed  porus .  it   s the middle of the night .         it   s broad daylight in this part of the world .  final .  but i   ve got something to tell you that   ll make you forget all about sleep .      gar final  editor of the j . g . p .  journal of galactic psychology allowed a look of alertness to cross his face .  whatever tan porus   s faults and arcturus knew they were many  he had never issued a false alarm .  if he said something great was in the air  it was not merely great it was colossal .   it was quite evident that porus was enjoying himself .     final     he said     the next article i send to your rag is going to be the greatest thing you   ve ever printed .      final was impressed .     do you really mean what you say .     he asked idiotically .      what kind of a stupid question is that .  of course i do .  listen     there followed a dramatic silence  while the tenseness on final   s face reached painful proportions .  then came porus   s husky whisper    i   ve solved the problem of the squid .      of course the reaction was exactly what porus had expected .  there was a blow up at the other end  and for thirty interesting seconds the rigellian was surprised to learn that the staid and respectable final had a blistering vocabulary .   porus   s squid was a by word throughout the galaxy .  for two years now  he had been fussing over an obscure draconian animal that persisted in going to sleep when it wasn   t supposed to .  he had set up equations and torn them down with a regularity that had become a standing joke with every psychologist in the federation and none had explained the unusual reaction .  now final had been dragged from bed to be told that the solution had been reached and that was all .   final ripped out a concluding phrase that all but put the    caster out of commission .   porus waited for the storm to pass and then said calmly     but do you know how i solved it .      the other   s answer was an indistinct mumble .   the rigellian began speaking rapidly .  all traces of amusement had left his face and  after a few sentences  all traces of anger left final   s .   the arcturian   s expression became one of wide eyed interest .     no .     he gasped .      yes .      when porus had finished .  final raced madly to put in rush calls to the printers to delay publication of the coming issue of the j . g . p .  for two weeks .     furo santins  head of the math department of the university of arcturus  gazed long and steady at his sirian colleague .      no  no  you   re wrong .  his equations were legitimate .  i checked them myself .         mathematically  yes     retorted the round faced sirian .     but psychologically they had no meaning .      santins slapped his high forehead .     meaning .  listen to the mathematician talk .  great space  man  what have mathematics to do with meaning .  mathematics is a tool and as long as it can be manipulated to give proper answers and to make correct predictions  actual meaning has no significance .  i   ll say this for tan porus most psychologists don   t know enough mathematics to handle a slide rule efficiently  but he knows his stuff .      the other nodded doubtfully     i guess so .  i guess so .  but using imaginary quantities in psychological equations stretches my faith in science just a little bit .  square root of minus one .      he shuddered .   .   .   .   the seniors    lounge in psychology hall was crowded and a buzz with activity .  the rumor of porus   s solution to the now classic problem of the squid had spread fast  and conversation touched on nothing else .   at the center of the thickest group was lor haridin .  he was young  with but newly acquired senior status .  but as porus   s assistant he was  under present conditions  master of the situation .      look  fellows just exactly what it   s all about i don   t know .  that   s the old man   s secret .  all i can tell you is that i   ve got the general idea as to how he solved it .      the others squeezed closer .     i hear he had to make up a new mathematical notation for the squid     said one     like that time we had trouble with the humanoids of sol .      lor haridin shook his head .     worse .  what made him think of it  i can   t imagine .  it was either a brainstorm or a nightmare  but anyway he introduced imaginary quantities the square root of minus one .      there was an awful silence and then someone said     i don   t believe it .         fact .     was the complacent reply .      but it doesn   t make sense .  what can the square root of minus one represent  psychologically speaking .  why  that would mean     he was doing rapid calculation in his head  as were most of the others    that the neural synapses were hooked up in neither more nor less than four dimensions .         sure     broke in another .     i suppose that if you stimulate the squid today  it will react yesterday .  that   s what an imaginary would mean .  comet gas .  that   s what i say .         that   s why you   re not the man tan porus is     said haridin .     do you suppose he cares how many imaginaries there are in the intermediate steps if they all square out into minus one in the final solution .  all he   s interested in is that they give him the proper sign in the answer an answer which will explain that sleep business .  as for its physical significance  what matter .  mathematics is only a tool  anyway .      the others considered silently and marveled .     tan porus sat in his stateroom aboard the newest and most luxurious interstellar liner and gazed at the young man before him happily .  he was in amazing good humor and  for perhaps the first time in his life  did not mind being interviewed by the keen  efficient employees of the ether press .   the ethereporter on his side wondered in silence at the affability of the scientist .  from bitter experience  he had found out that scientists  as a whole  detested reporters and that psychologists  in particular  thought it fun to practice a bit of applied psych on them and to induce killingly amusing  to others reactions .   he remembered the time that the old fellow from canopus had convinced him that arboreal life was the greatest good .  it had taken twenty men to drag him down from the tree tops and an expert psychologist to bring him back to normal .   but here was the greatest of them all .  tan porus  actually answering questions like a normal human being .      what i would like to know now  professor     said the reporter     is just what this imaginary quantity is all about .  that is     he interposed hastily     not the mathematics of it we   ll take your word on that but just a general idea that the ordinary humanoid can picture .  for instance  i   ve heard that the squid has a four dimensional mind .      porus groaned     oh  rigel .  four dimensional poppycock .  to tell the honest truth  that imaginary i used which seems to have caught the popular fancy probably indicates nothing more than some abnormality in the squid   s nervous system  but just what  i don   t know .  certainly  to the gross methods of ecology and micro physiology  nothing unusual has been found .  no doubt  the answer would lie in the atomic physics of the creature   s brain  but there i have no hope .     there was a trace of disdain in his voice .     the atomic physicists are too far behind the psychologists to expect them to catch up at this late date .      the reporter bore down furiously on his stylus .  the next day   s headline was clear in his mind  noted psychologist blasts atomic physicists .   also  the headline of the day after  indignant physicists denounce noted psychologist .   scientific feuds were great stuff for the ether press  particularly that between psychologists and physicists  who  it was well known  hated each other   s guts .   the reporter glanced up brightly .     say  professor  the humanoids of the galaxy are very interested  you know  in the private lives of you scientists .  i hope you don   t mind if i ask you a few questions about your trip home to rigel iv .         go ahead     said porus  genially .     tell them it   s the first time i   m getting home in two years .  i   m sort of looking forward to it .  arcturus is just a bit too yellow for my eyes and the furniture you have here is too big .         it   s true  isn   t it  that you have a wife at home .      porus coughed .     hmm  yes .  sweetest little woman in the galaxy .  i   m looking forward to seeing her  too .  put that down .      the reporter put it down .     how is it you didn   t bring her to arcturus with you .      some of the geniality left the rigellian   s face .     i like to be alone when i work .  women are all right in their place .  besides  my idea of a vacation is one by myself .  don   t put that down .      the reporter didn   t put it down .  he gazed at the other   s little form with open admiration .     say  prof  how did you ever get her to stay home  though .  i wish you   d tell me the secret    then  with a wealth of feeling he added     i could use it .      porus laughed .     i tell you  son .  when you   re an ace psychologist  you   re master in your own home .      he motioned the interview to an end and then suddenly grasped the other by the arm .  his green eyes were piercingly sharp .     and listen  son  that last remark doesn   t go into the story  you know .      the reporter paled and backed away .     no  sir  no sir .  we   ve got a little saying in our profession that goes     never monkey around with a psychologist  or he   ll make a monkey of you .            good .  i can do it literally  you know  if i have to .      the young press employee ducked out hastily after that  wiped the cold perspiration from his brow and left with his story .  for a moment  towards the last  he had felt himself hanging on the ragged edge .  he made a mental note to refuse all future interviews with psychologists unless they raised his pay .     tens of billions of miles out  the pure white orb of rigel had reached porus   s eyes  and something in his heart uplifted him .   type b reaction nostalgia  conditioned reflex through association of rigel with happy scenes of youth   words  phrases  equations spun through his keen brain  but he was happy in spite of them .  and in a little while  the human triumphed over the psychologist and porus abandoned analysis for the superior joy of uncritical happiness .   he sat up past the middle of the sleep period two nights before the landing to catch first glimpse of hanlon  fourth planet of rigel  his home world .  some place on that world  on the shores of a quiet sea  was a little two story house .  a little house not those giant structures fit only for arcturians and other hulking humanoids .   it was the summer season now and the houses would be bathed in the pearly light of rigel  and after the harsh yellow red of arcturus  how restful that would be .   and he almost shouted in his joy the very first night he was going to insist on gorging himself with broiled tryptex .  he hadn   t tasted it for two years  and his wife was the best hand at tryptex in the system .   he winced a little at the thought of his wife .  it had been a dirty trick  getting her to stay home the last two years  but it had had to be done .  he glanced over the papers before him once more .  there was just a little nervousness in his fingers as they shuffled the sheets .  he had spent a full day in calculating her reactions at first seeing him after two years    absence and they were not pleasant  nina porus was a woman of untamed emotions  and he would have to work quickly and efficiently .     he spotted her quickly in the crowd .  he smiled .  it was nice to see her  even if his equations did predict long and serious storms .  he ran over his initial speech once more and made a last minute change .   and then she saw him .  she waved frantically and broke from the forefront of the crowd .  she was on tan porus before he was aware of it and  in the grip of her affectionate embrace  he went limp with surprise .   that wasn   t the reaction to be expected at all .  something was wrong .   she was leading him dexterously through the crowd of reporters to the waiting stratocar  talking rapidly along the way .      tan porus  i thought i   d never live to see you again .  it   s so good to have you with me again  you have absolutely no idea .  everything here at home is just fine  of course  but it isn   t quite the same without you .      porus   s green eyes were glazed .  this speech was entirely uncharacteristic of nina .  to the sensitive ears of a psychologist  it sounded little short of the ravings of a maniac .  he had not even the presence of mind to grunt at proper intervals .  frozen mutely in his seat  he watched the ground rush downwards and heard the air shriek backwards as they headed for their little house by the sea .   nina porus prattled on gaily the one normal aspect of her conversation being her ability to uphold both ends of a dialogue with smooth efficiency .      and  of course  dear  i   ve fixed up an entire tryptex  broiled to a turn  garnished with sarnees .  and  oh yes  about that affair last year with that new planet earth  do you call it .  i was so proud of you when i heard about it .  i said      and so on and on  until her voice degenerated into a meaningless conglomeration of sounds .   where were her tears .  where were the reproaches  the threats  the impassioned self pity .   tan porus roused himself to one great effort at dinner .  he stared at the steaming dish of tryptex before him with an odd lack of appetite and said     this reminds me of the time at arcturus when i dined with the president delegate      he went into details  dilating on the gayety and abandon of the affair  waxing lyrical over his own enjoyment of it  stressing  almost unsubtly  the fact that he had not missed his wife  and finally  in one last wild burst of desperation  mentioning casually the presence of a surprising number of rigellian females in the arcturian system .   and through it all  his wife sat smiling .     wonderful  darling     she   d say .     i   m so glad you enjoyed yourself .  eat your tryptex .      but porus did not eat his tryptex .  the mere thought of food nauseated him .  with one lingering stare of dismay at his wife  he arose with what dignity he could muster and left for the privacy of his room .   he tore up the equations furiously and hurled himself into a chair .  he seethed with anger  for evidently something had gone wrong with nina .  terribly wrong .  even interest in another man and for just a moment that had occurred to him as a possible explanation would not cause such a revolution in character .   he tore at his hair .  there was some hidden factor more startling than that but what it was he had no idea .  at that moment tan porus would have given the sum total of his worldly possessions to have his wife enter and make one just one attempt to snatch his scalp off  as of old .   and below  in the dining room  nina porus allowed a crafty gleam to enter her eye .     lor haridin put down his pen and said     come in .      the door opened  and his friend  eblo ranin  entered  brushed off a corner of the desk and sat down .      haridin  i   ve got an idea .     his voice was uncommonly like a guilty whisper .   haridin gazed at him suspiciously .      like the time     he said     you set up the booby trap for old man obel .      ranin shuddered .  he had spent two days hiding in the ventilator shaft after that brilliant piece of work .     no  this is legitimate .  listen  porus left you in charge of the squid  didn   t he .         oh  i see what you   re getting at .  it   s no go .  i can feed the squid  but that   s all .  if i as much as clapped my hands at it to induce a color change tropism  the boss would throw a fit .         to space with him .  he   s parsecs away  anyway .     ranin drew forth a two month old copy of the j . g . p .  and folded the cover back .     have you been following livell   s experiments at procyon u .  .  you know magnetic fields applied with and without ultra violet radiation .         out of my field     grunted haridin .     i   ve beard of it  but that   s all .  what about it .         well  it   s a type e reaction which gives  believe it or not  a strong fimbal effect in practically every case  especially in the higher invertebrates .         hmm .         now  if we could try it on this squid  we could         no  no  no  no .     haridin shook his head violently .     porus would break me .  great stars and little meteors  how he would break me .         listen  you nut porus can   t tell you what to do with the squid .  it   s frian obel that has final say .  he   s head of the psychological board  not porus .  all you have to do is to apply for his permission and you   ll get it .  just between us  since that homo sol affair last year  he can   t stand the sight of porus anyway .      haridin weakened .     you ask him .      ranin coughed .     no .  on the whole  perhaps i   d better not .  he   s sort of got a suspicion that i set that booby trap  and i   d rather keep out of his way .         hmm .  well all right .        lor haridin looked as if he had not slept well for a week  which shows that sometimes appearances are not deceiving .  eblo ranin regarded him with patient kindliness and sighed .      look .  will you please sit down .  santin said he would have the final results in today  didn   t he .         i know  i know  but it   s humiliating .  i spent seven years on higher math .  and now i make a stupid mistake and can   t even find it .         maybe it   s not there to find .         don   t be silly .  the answer is just impossible .  it must be impossible .  it must be .     his high forehead creased .     oh  i don   t know what to think .      he continued his concentrated attempt to wear out the nap of the rug beneath and mused bitterly .  suddenly he sat down .      it   s those time integrals .  you can   t work with them  i tell you .  you look    em up in a table  taking half an hour to find the proper entry  and they give you seventeen possible answers .  you have to pick the one that makes sense  and  arcturus help me .  either they all do  or none do .  run up against eight of them  as we do in this problem  and we   ve got enough permutations to last us the rest of our life .  wrong answer .  it   s a wonder i lived through it at all .      the look he gave the fat volume of helo   s tables of time integrals did not sear the binding  to ranin   s great surprise .   the signal light flashed  and haridin leaped to the door .   he snatched the package from the messenger   s hand and ripped open the wrappings frantically .   he turned to the last page and stared at santin   s final note     your calculations are correct .  congratulations  and won   t this knock porus   s head right off his shoulders .  better get in touch with him at once .     ranin read it over the other   s shoulder  and for one long minute the two gazed at each other .      i was right     whispered haridin  eyes bulging .     we   ve found something in which the imaginary doesn   t square out .  we   ve got a predicted reaction which includes an imaginary quantity .      the other swallowed and brushed aside his stupefaction with an effort .     how do you interpret it .         great space .  how in the galaxy should i know .  we   ve got to get porus  that   s all .      ranin snapped his fingers and grabbed the other by the shoulders .     oh  no  we won   t .  this is our big chance .  if we can carry this through  we   re made for life .     he shuttered in his excitement .     arcturus .  any psychologist would sell his life twice over to have our opportunity right now .      the draconian squid crawled placidly about  unawed by the huge solenoid that surrounded its tank .  the mass of tangled wires  the current leads  the mercury vapor lamp up above meant nothing to it .  it nibbled contentedly at the fronds of the sea fern about it  and was at peace with the world .   not so the two young psychologists .  eblo ranin scurried through the complicated set up in a last minute effort at checking everything .  lor haridin helped him in intervals between nail biting .      everything   s set     said ranin  and swabbed wearily at his damp brow .     let her shoot .      the mercury vapor lamp went on and haridin pulled the window curtains together .  in the cold red less light  two green tinted faces watched the squid closely .  it stirred restlessly  its warm pink changing to a dull black in the mercury light     turn on the juice     said haridin hoarsely .   there was a soft click  and that was all .      no reaction .     questioned ranin  half to himself .  and then   he held his breath as the other bent closer .      something   s happening to the squid .  it seems to glow a bit  or is it my eyes .      the glow became perceptible and then seemed to detach itself from the body of the animal and take on a spherical shape of itself .  long minutes passed .      it   s emitting some sort of radiation  field  force whatever you want to call it and there seems to be expansion with time .      there was no answer  and none was expected .  again they waited and watched .   and then ranin emitted a muffled cry and grasped haridin   s elbow tightly .     crackling comets  what   s it doing .      the globular glowing sphere of whatever it was had thrust out a pseudopod .  a gleaming little projection touched the swaying branch of the sea fern  and where it touched the leaves turned brown and withered .      shut off the current .      the current clicked off  the mercury vapor lamp went out  the shades were parted and the two stared at each other nervously .      what was it .      haridin shook his head .     i don   t know .  it was something definitely insane .  i never saw anything like it        you never saw an imaginary in a reaction equation before  either  did you .  as a matter of fact  i don   t think that expanding field was any known form of energy at      his breath came out in one long whistling exhalation and he retreated slowly from the tank containing the squid .  the mollusc was motionless  but around it half the fern .  in the tank hung sere and withered .   haridin gasped .  he pulled the shades and in the gloom  the globe of glowing haze bulked through half the tank .  little curving tentacles of light reached toward the remaining fem and one pulsing thread extended through the glass and was creeping along the table .   that fright in ranin   s voice rendered it a cracked  scarcely understood sound .      it   s a lag reaction .  didn   t you test it by wilbon   s theorem .         how could i .     the other   s heart pumped madly and his dry lips fought to form words .     wilbon   s theorem didn   t make sense with an imaginary in the equation .  i let it go .      ranin sped into action with feverish energy .  he left the room and was back in a moment with a tiny  squealing  squirrel like animal from his own lab .  he dropped it in the path of the thread of light stealing along the table  and held it there with a yard rule .   the glowing thread wavered  seemed to sense the presence of life in some horribly blind way  and lunged towards it the little rodent squealed once  a high pitched shriek of infinite torture  and went limp .  in two seconds it was a shriveled  shrunken travesty of its former self .   ranin swore and dropped the rule with a sudden yell  for the thread  of light a bit brighter  a bit thicker began creeping up the wood toward him .      here     said haridin     let   s end this .     he yanked a drawer open and withdrew the chromium plated tonite gun within .  its sharp thin beam of purple light lunged forward towards the squid and exploded in blazing  soundless fury against the edge of the sphere of force .  the psychologist shot again and again  and then compressed the trigger to form one continuous purple stream of destruction that ceased only when power failed .   and the glowing sphere remained unharmed .  it engulfed the entire tank .  the ferns were brown masses of death .      get the board     yelled ranin .     it   s beyond us entirely .        there was no confusion humanoids in the mass are simply not subject to panic  if you don   t count the half genius  half humanoid inhabitants of the planets of sol and the evacuation of the university grounds was carried out smoothly .      one fool     said old mir deana  ace physicist of arcturus u .      can ask more questions than a thousand wise men can answer .     he fingered his scraggly beard and his button nose sniffed loudly in disdain .      what do you mean by that .     questioned frian obel sharply .  his green vegan skin darkened angrily .      just that  by analogy  one cosmic fool of a psychologist can make a bigger mess than a thousand physicists can clear up .      obel drew in his breath dangerously .  he had his own opinion of haridin and ranin  but no lame brain physicist could   the plump figure of qual wynn  university president  came charging down upon them .  he was out of breath and spoke between puffs .      i   ve gotten in touch with the galactic congress and they   re arranging for evacuation of all eron  if necessary .     his voice became pleading .     isn   t there anything that can be done .         mir deana sighed     nothing yet .  all we know is this  the squid is emitting some sort of pseudo living radiatory field which is not electromagnetic in character .  its advance cannot be stopped by anything we have yet tried  material or vacuum .  none of our weapons affect it  for within the field the ordinary attributes of space time apparently don   t hold .      the president shook a worried head .     bad  bad .  you   ve sent for porus  though .     he sounded as though we were clutching at a last straw .      yes     scowled frian obel .     he   s the only one that really knows that squid .  if he can   t help us  no one can .     he stared off toward the gleaming white of the university buildings  where the grass over half the campus was brown stubble and the trees blasted ruins .      do you think     said the president  turning to deana once more     that the field can span interplanetary space .         sizzling novae  i don   t know what to think .     deana exploded  and he turned pettishly away .   there was a thick silence of utter gloom .     tan porus was sunk in deep apathy .  he was unaware of the brilliant coruscations of color overhead .  he didn   t hear a sound of the melodious tones that filled the auditorium .   he knew only one thing that he had been talked into attending a concert .  concerts above all were anathema to him  and in twenty years of married life he had steered clear of them with a skill and ease that only the greatest psychologist of them all could have shown .  and now   he was startled out of his stupor by the sudden discordant sounds that arose from the rear .   there was a rush of ushers to the exit where the disturbance originated  a waving of protesting uniformed arms and then a strident voice     i am here on urgent business direct from the galactic congress on eron  arcturus .  is tan porus in the audience .      tan porus was out of his seat with a bound .  any excuse to leave the auditorium was nothing short of heaven sent .   he ripped open the communication handed him by the messenger and devoured its contents .  at the second sentence  his elation left him .  when he was finished  he raised a face in which only his darting green eyes seemed alive .      how soon can we leave .         the ship is waiting now .         come  then .      he took one step forward and stopped .  there was a hand on his elbow .      where are you going .     asked nina porus .  there was hidden steel in her voice .   tan porus felt stifled for a moment .  he foresaw what would happen .     darling  i must go to eron immediately .  the fate of a world  of the whole galaxy perhaps  is at stake .  you don   t know how important it is .  i tell you         all right  go .  and i   ll go with you .      the psychologist bowed his head .      yes  dear .     he said .  he sighed .     the psychological board hemmed and hawed as one man and then stared dubiously at the large scale graph before them .      frankly  gentlemen     said tan porus     i don   t feel too certain about it myself  but well  you   ve all seen my results  and checked them too .  and it is the only stimulus that will yield a canceling reaction .      frian obel fingered his chin nervously .     yes  the mathematics is clear .  increase in hydrogen ion activity past ph  would set up a demane   s integral and that  but listen  porus  we   re not dealing with space time .  the math might not hold  perhaps nothing will hold .         it   s our only chance .  if we were dealing with normal space time  we could just dump in enough acid to kill the blasted squid or fry it with a tonite .  as it is  we have no choice but to take our chances with      loud voices interrupted him .     let me through  i say .  i don   t care if there are ten conferences going on .      the door swung open and qual wynn   s portly figure made its entrance .  he spied porus and bore down upon him .     porus  i tell you i   m going crazy .  parliament is holding me  as university president  responsible for all this  and now deana says that     he sputtered into silence and mir deana  standing composedly behind him  took up the tale .      the field now covers better than one thousand square miles and its rate of increase is growing steadily .  there seems to do no doubt now that it can span interplanetary space if it wishes to do so interstellar as well  if given the time .         you hear that .  you hear that .     wynn was fairly dancing in his anxiety .     can   t you do something .  the galaxy is doomed  i tell you  doomed .         oh  keep your tunic on     groaned porus     and let us handle this .     he turned to deana .     didn   t your physicist stooges conduct some clumsy investigations as to the speed of penetration of the field through various substances .      deana nodded stiffly .      penetration varies  in general  inversely with density .  osmium  iridium and platinum are the best .  lead and gold are fair .         good .  that checks .  what i   ll need then is an osmium plated suit with a lead glass helmet .  and make both plating and helmet good and thick .      qual wynn stared horrified .     osmium plating .  osmium .  by the great nebula  think of the expense .         i   m thinking     said porus frostily .  .      but they   ll charge it to the university  they   ll     he recovered with difficulty as the somber stares of the assembled psychologists fastened themselves upon him .     when do you need it .     he muttered weakly .        you   re really going  yourself .         why not .     asked porus  clambering out of the suit .   mir deana said     the lead glass headpiece will hold off the field not longer than an hour and you   ll probably be getting partial penetration in much shorter time .  i don   t know if you can do it .         i   ll worry about that .     he paused  and then continued uncertainly .     i   ll be ready in a few minutes .  i   d like to speak to my wife first alone .      the interview was a short one .  it was one of the very few occasions that tan porus forgot that he was a psychologist  and spoke as his heart moved him  without stopping to consider the natural reaction of the one spoken to .   one thing he did know by instinct rather than thought  and that was that his wife would not break down or go sentimental on him  and there he was right .  it was only in the last few seconds that her eyes fell and her voice quavered .  she tugged a handkerchief from her wide sleeve and hurried from the room .   the psychologist stared after her and then stooped to pick up the thin book that had fallen as she had removed the handkerchief .  without looking at it  he placed it in the inner pocket of his tunic .   he smiled crookedly .     a talisman .     he said .     tan porus   s gleaming one man cruiser whistled into the    death field .     the clammy sensation of desolation impressed itself upon him at once .   he shrugged .     imagination .  mustn   t get nervy now .      there was the vaguest glitter a sparkle that was felt rather than seen in the air about him .  and then it invaded the ship itself  and  looking up  the rigellian saw the five eronian ricebirds he had brought with him lying dead on the floor of their cage  huddled masses of bedraggled feathers .      the    death field    is in     he whispered .  it had penetrated the steel hull of the cruiser .   the cruiser bumped to a rather unskillful landing on the broad university athletic field  and tan porus  an incongruous figure in the bulky osmium suit  stepped out .  he surveyed his depressing surroundings .  from the brown stubble underfoot to the glimmering haze that hid the normal blue of the sky  all seemed dead .   he entered psychology hall .   his lab was dark  the shades were still drawn .  he parted them and studied the squid   s tank .  the water replenisher was still working  for the tank was full .  however  that was the only normal thing about it .  only a few dark brown  ragged strands of rot were left of what had once been sea fern .  the squid itself lay inertly upon the floor of the tank .   tan porus sighed .  he felt tired and numbed .  his mind was hazy and unclear .  for long minutes he stared about him unseeingly .   then  with an effort  he raised the bottle he held and glanced at the label    molar hydrochloric acid .   he mumbled vaguely to himself .     two hundred cc .  just dump the whole thing in .  that   ll force the ph down if only hydrogen ion activity means something here .      he was fumbling with the glass stopper  and suddenly  laughing .  he had felt exactly like this the one and only time he had ever been drunk .   he shook the gathering cobwebs from his brain .     only got a few minutes to do to do what .  i don   t know something anyway .  dump this thing in .  dump it in .  dump .  dump .  dumpety dump .     he was mumbling a silly popular song to himself as the acid gurgled its way into the open tank .   tan porus felt pleased with himself and he laughed .  he stirred the water with his mailed fist and laughed some more .  he was still singing that song .   and then he became aware of a subtle change in environment he fumbled for it and stopped singing .  and then it hit him with the suddenness of a downpour of cold water .  the glitter in the atmosphere had gone .   with a sudden motion  he unclasped the helmet and cast it off .  he drew in long breaths of air  a bit musty  but unkilling .   he had acidified the water of the tank  and destroyed the field at its source .  chalk up another victory for the pure mathematics of psychology .   he stepped out of his osmium suit and stretched .  the pressure on his chest reminded him of something .  withdrawing the booklet his wife had dropped  he said     the talisman came through .     and smiled indulgently at his own whimsy .   the smile froze as he saw for the first time the title upon the book .   the title was intermediate course in applied psychology  volume   .   it was as if something large and heavy had suddenly fallen onto porus   s head and driven understanding into it nina had been boning up on applied psych for two whole years .   this was the missing factor .  he could allow for it .  he would have to use triple time integrals  but   he threw the communicator switch and waited for contact     hello .  this is porus .  come on in  all of you .  the death field is gone .  i   ve beaten the squid .     he broke contact and added triumphantly      and my wife .      strangely enough or  perhaps  not so strangely it was the latter feat that pleased him more .     the end    the chief interest to me in    the imaginary    is that it foreshadows the    psychohistory    that was to play such a big role in the    foundation    series .  it was in this story and in its predecessor     homo sol     that for the first time i treated psychology as a mathematically refined science .       it was about time that i made another stab at unknown  and i did so with a story called    the oak     which  as i recall  was something about an oak tree that served as an oracle and delivered ambiguous statements .  i submitted it to campbell on july           and it was promptly rejected .   one of the bad things about writing for unknown was that the magazine was one of a kind .  if unknown rejected a story  there was no place else to submit it .  it was possible to try weird tales  a magazine that was older than any science fiction magazine  but it dealt with old fashioned  creaky horror tales and paid very little to boot .  i wasn   t really interested in trying to get into it .   and besides  they rejected both    life before birth    and    the oak    when i submitted them .    still  july           was a turning point in my career  although  of course  i had no way of telling it .  i had up to that point written twenty two stories in twenty five months .  of these i had sold  or was to sell  thirteen  while nine never sold at all and no longer exist .  the record wasn   t abysmal but neither was it great let   s call it mediocre .   however  as it happened  except for two short short stories that were special cases  i never again wrote a science fiction story i could not sell .  i had found the range .   but not campbell   s range particularly .  in august i wrote    heredity     which i submitted to campbell on august     and which he rejected two weeks later .  fortunately  pohl snapped it up at once .       heredity     dr .  stefansson fondled the thick sheaf of typewritten papers that lay before him     it   s all here  harvey twenty five years of work .      mild mannered professor harvey puffed idly at his pipe     well  your part is over and markey   s  too  on ganymede .  it   s up to the twins  themselves  now .      a short ruminative silence  and then dr .  stefansson stirred uneasily     are you going to break the news to allen soon .      the other nodded quietly     it will have to be done before we get to mars  and the sooner the better .     he paused  then added in a tightened voice     i wonder how it feels to find out after twenty five years that one has a twin brother whom one has never seen .  it must be a damned shock .         how did george take it .         didn   t believe it at first  and i don   t blame him .  markey had to work like a horse to convince him it wasn   t a hoax .  i suppose i   ll have as hard a job with allen .     he knocked the dottle from his pipe and shook his head .      i have half a mind to go to mars just to see those two get together     remarked dr .  stefansson wistfully .     you   ll do no such thing  stef .  this experiment   s taken too long and means too much to have you rum it by any such fool move .         i know  i know .  heredity versus environment .  perhaps at last the definite answer .     he spoke half to himself  as if repeating an old  familiar formula     two identical twins  separated at birth  one brought up on old  civilized earth  the other on pioneer ganymede .  then  on their twenty fifth birthday brought together for the first time on mars god .  i wish carter had lived to see the end of it they   re his children .         too bad .  but we   re alive  and the twins .  to carry the experiment to its end will be our tribute to him .        there is no way of telling  at first seeing the martian branch of medicinal products  inc .   that it is surrounded by anything but desert .  you can   t see the vast underground caverns where the native fungi of mars are artificially nurtured into huge blooming fields .  the intricate transportation system that connects all parts of the square miles of fields to the central building is invisible .  the irrigation system  the air purifiers  the drainage pipes  are all hidden .   and what one sees is the broad squat red brick building and martian desert  rusty and dry  all about  that had been all george carter had seen upon arriving via rocket taxi  but him  at least  appearances had not deceived .  it would have been strange had it done so  for his life on ganymede had been oriented in its every phase towards eventual general managership of that very concern .  he knew every square inch of the caverns below as well as if he had been born and raised in them himself .   and now he sat in professor lemuel harvey   s small office and allowed just the slightest trace of uneasiness to cross his impassive countenance .  his ice blue eyes sought those of professor harvey .      this this twin brother o    mine .  he   ll be here soon .      professor harvey nodded     he   s on his way over right now .      george carter uncrossed his knees .  his expression was almost wistful     he looks a lot like me  d   ya rackon .         quite a lot .  you   re identical twins  you know .         hmm .  rackon so .  wish i   d known him all the time on ganny .     he frowned .     he   s lived on airth all   s life  huh .      an expression of interest crossed professor harvey   s face .  he said briskly     you dislike earthmen .         no  not exactly     came the immediate answer .     it   s just the airthmen are tanderfeet all of    m i know are .      harvey stifled a grin  and conversation languished .   the door signal snapped harvey out of his reverie and george carter out of his chair at the same instant .  the professor pressed the desk button and the door opened .   the figure on the threshold crossed into the room and then stopped .  the twin brothers faced each other .   it was a tense  breathless moment  and professor harvey sank into his soft chair  put his finger tips together and watched keenly .   the two stood stiffly erect  ten feet apart  neither making a move to lessen the distance .  they made a curious contrast a contrast all the more marked because of the vast similarity between the two .   eyes of frozen blue gazed deep into eyes of frozen blue .  each saw a long  straight nose over full  red lips pressed firmly together .  the high cheekbones were as prominent in one as in the other  the jutting  angular chin as square .  there was even the same  odd half cock of one eyebrow in twin expressions of absorbed  part quizzical interest .   but with the face  all resemblance ended .  allen carter   s clothes bore the new york stamp on every square inch .  from his loose blouse  past his dark purple knee breeches  salmon colored cellulite stockings  down to the glistening sandals on his feet  he stood a living embodiment of latest terrestrial fashion .   for a fleeting moment  george carter was conscious of a feeling of ungainliness as he stood there in his tight sleeved  close necked shirt of ganymedan linen .  his unbuttoned vest and his voluminous trousers with their ends tucked into high laced  heavy soled boots were clumsy and provincial .  even he felt it for just a moment  from his sleeve pocket allen removed a cigarette case it was the first move either of the brothers had made opened it  withdrew a slender cylinder of paper covered tobacco that spontaneously glowed into life at the first puff .   george hesitated a fraction of a second and his subsequent action was almost one of defiance .  his hand plunged into his inner vest pocket and drew therefrom the green  shriveled form of a cigar made of ganymedan greenleaf .  a match flared into  . flame upon his thumbnail and for a long moment  he matched  puff for puff  the cigarette of his brother .   and then allen laughed a queer  high pitched laugh     your eyes are a little closer together  i think .         rackon    tis  maybe .  y   r hair   s fixed sort o    different .     there was faint disapproval in his voice .  allen   s hand went self consciously to his long  light brown hair  carefully curled at the ends  while his eyes flickered over the carelessly bound queue into which the other   s equally long hair was drawn .      i suppose we   ll have to get used to each other .   i   m willing to try .     the earth twin was advancing now  hand outstretched .   george smiled     y    bet .     at goes here  too .      the hands met and gripped .      y   r name   s all   n  huh .     said george .      and yours is george  isn   t it .     answered allen .   and then for a long while they said nothing more .  they just looked and smiled as they strove to bridge the twenty five year gap that separated them .     george carter   s impersonal gaze swept over the carpet of low growing purple blooms that stretched in plot path bordered squares into the misty distance of the caverns .  the newspapers and feature writers might rhapsodize over the    fungus gold    of mars about the purified extracts  in yields of ounces to acres of blooms  that had become indispensable to the medical profession of the system .  opiates  purified vitamins  a new vegetable specific against pneumonia the blooms were worth their weight in gold  almost .   but they were merely blooms to george carter blooms to be forced to full growth  harvested  baled  and shipped to the aresopolis labs hundreds of miles away .   he cut his little ground car to half speed and leant furiously out the window     hi y    mudcat there .  y    with the dairty face .  watch what y   r doing keep the domned water in the channel .      he drew back and the ground car leapt ahead once more .  the ganymedan muttered viciously to himself     these domned men about here are wairse than useless .  so many machines t    do their wairk for    m they give their brains a pairmenent vacation  i rackon .      the ground car came to a halt and he clambered out .  picking his way between the fungus plots  he approached the clustered group of men about the spider armed machine in the plotway ahead .      well  here i am .  what is    t  all   n .      allen   s head bobbed up from behind the other side of the machine .  he waved at the men about him     stop it for a second .     and leaped toward his twin .      george  it works .  it   s slow and clumsy  but it works .  we can improve it now that we   ve got the fundamentals down .  and in no time at all  we   ll be able to         now wait a while  all   n .  on ganny  we go slow .  y    live long  that way .  what y    got there .      allen paused and swabbed at his forehead .  his face shone with grease  sweat  and excitement .     i   ve been working on this thing ever since i finished college .  it   s a modification of something we have on earth but it   s no end improved .  it   s a mechanical bloom picker .      he had fished a much folded square of heavy paper from his pocket and talked steadily as he spread it on the plotway before them     up to now  bloom picking has been the bottleneck of production  to say nothing of the    to     loss due to picking under  and over ripe blooms .  after all  human eyes are only human eyes  and the blooms here  look .      the paper was spread flat and allen squatted before it george leaned over his shoulder  with frowning watchfulness .      you see .  it   s a combination of fluoroscope and photoelectric cell .  the ripeness of the bloom can be told by the state of the spores within .  this machine is adjusted so that the proper circuit is tripped upon the impingement of just that combination of light and dark formed by ripe spores within the bloom .  on the other hand  this second circuit but look  it   s easier to show you .      he was up again  brimming with enthusiasm .  with a jump  he was in the low seat behind the picker and had pulled the lever .   ponderously  the picker turned towards the blooms and its    eye    travelled sideways six inches above the ground .  as it passed each fungus bloom  a long spidery arm shot out  lopping it cleanly half an inch from the ground and depositing it neatly in the downward sloping slide beneath .  a pile of blooms formed behind the machine .      we can hook on a binder  too  later on .  do you notice those blooms it doesn   t touch .  those are unripe .  just wait till it comes to an over ripe one and see what it does .      he yelled in triumph a moment later when a bloom was torn out and dropped on the spot .   he stopped the machine     you see .  in a month  perhaps  we can actually start putting it to work in the fields .      george carter gazed sourly upon his twin     take more    n a month  i rackon .  it   ll take foraver  more likely .         what do you mean  forever .  it just has to be sped up         i don   t care if    t just has t    be painted pairple .     tisn   t going t    appear on my fields .         your fields .         yup  mine     was the cool response .     i   ve got veto pow   r here same as you have .  y    can   t do anything    thout my say so and y    won   t get it f   r this .  in fact  i want y    t    clear that thing out o    here  altogether .  got no use f   r    t .      allen dismounted and faced his brother     you agreed to let me have this plot to experiment on  veto free  and i   m holding you to that agreement .         all right  then .  but keep y   r domned machine out o    the rest o    the fields .      the earthman approached the other slowly .  there was a dangerous look in his eyes .     look  george  i don   t like your attitude and i don   t like the way you   re using your veto power .  i don   t know what you   re used to running on ganymede  but you   re in the big time now  and there are a lot of provincial notions you   ll have to get out of your head .         not unless i want to .  and if y    want t    have    t out with me  we   d better go t    y   r office .  spatting before the men    d be bad for discipline .        the trip back to central was made in ominous silence .  george whistled softly to himself while allen folded his arms and stared with ostentatious indifference at the narrow  twisting plotway ahead .  the silence persisted as they entered the earthman   s office .  allen gestured shortly towards a chair and the ganymedan took it without a word .  he brought out his ever present green leaf cigar and waited for the other to speak .   allen hunched forward upon the edge of his seat and leaned both elbows on his desk .  he began with a rush .      there   s lots to this situation  george  that   s a mystery to me .  i don   t know why they brought up you on ganymede and me on earth  and i don   t know why they never let us know of each other  or made us co managers now with veto power over one another but i do know that the situation is rapidly growing intolerable .      this corporation needs modernization  and you know that .  yet you   ve been wielding that veto power over every trifling advance i   ve tried to initiate .  i don   t know just what your viewpoint is  but i   ve a suspicion that you think you   re still living on ganymede .  if you   re still in the sticks  i   m warning you get out of them fast .  i   m from earth  and this corporation is going to be run with earth efficiency and earth organization .  do you understand .      george puffed odorous tobacco at the ceiling before answering  but when he did  his eyes came down sharply  and there was a cutting edge to his voice .      airth  is it .  airth efficiency  no less .  well  all   n  i like ye .  i can   t help it y   r so much like me  that disliking y    would be like disliking myself  i rackon .  i hate t    say this  but y   r upbringing   s all wrong .      his voice became sternly accusatory     y   r an airthman .  well  look at y    .  airthman   s but half a man at best  and naturally y    lean on machines .  but d    y    suppose i want the corporation to be run by machines just machines .  what   re the men t    do .         the men run the machines     came the clipped  angry response .   the ganymedan rose  and a fist slammed down on the desk     the machines run the men  and y    know it .  fairst  y    use them  then y    depend on them  and finally y   r slaves t    them .  over on y   r pracious airth  it was machines  machines  machines and as a result  what are y    .  i   ll tell y    .  half a man .      he drew himself up     i still like y    .  i like y    weu enough f wish y   d lived on gannie with me .  by jupe    n    domn     twould have made a man o    y    .         finished .     said allen .      rackon so .         then i   ll tell you something .  there   s nothing wrong with you that a life time on a decent planet wouldn   t have fixed .  as it is  however  you belong on ganymede .  i   d advise you to go back there .      george spoke very softly     y   r not thinking o    taking a punch at me  are y    .         no .  i couldn   t fight a mirror image of myself  but if your face were only a little different  i would enjoy splashing it about the premises a bit .         think y    could do it an airthman like you .  here  sit down .  we   re both getting a bit too excited  i rackon .  nothing    .  .  be settled this way .        he sat down once more  puffed vainly at his dead cigar  and tossed it into the incinerator chute in disgust .      where   s y   r water .     he grunted .   allen grinned with sudden delight     would you object to having a machine supply it .         machine .  what d    y    mean .     the ganymedan gazed about him suspiciously .      watch .  i had this installed a week ago .     he touched a button on his desk and a low click sounded below .  there was the sound of pouring water for a second or so and then a circular metal disk beside the earthman   s right hand slid aside and a cup of water lifted up from below .      take it     said allen .   george lifted it gingerly and drank it down .  he tossed the empty cup down the incinerator shaft  then stared long and thoughtfully at his brother     may i see this water feeder o  y   rs .         surely .  it   s just under the desk .  here  i   ll make room for you .      the ganymedan crawled underneath while allen watched uncertainly .  a brawny hand was thrust out suddenly and a muffled voice said     hand me a screwdriver .         here .  what are you going to do .         nothing .  nothing    t all .  just want t    investigate this contraption .      the screw driver was handed down and for a few minutes there was no other sound than an occasional soft scraping of metal on metal .  finally  george withdrew a flushed face and adjusted his wrinkled collar with satisfaction .      which button do i press for the water .      allen gestured and the button was pressed .  the gurgling of water sounded .  the earthman stared in mystification from his desk to his brother and back again .  and then he became aware of a moistness about his feet .   he jumped  looked downwards  and squawked in dismay     why  damn you  what have you done .     a snaky stream of water wriggled blindly out from under the desk and the pouring sound of water still continued .   george made leisurely for the door     just short caircuited it .  here   s y   r screw driver  fix    t up again .     and just before he slammed the door     so much f   r y   r pracious machines .  they go wrong at the wrong times .        the sounder was buzzily insistent and allen carter opened one eye peevishly .  it was still dark .   with a sigh  he lifted one arm to the head of his bed and put the audiomitter into commission .   the treble voice of amos wells of the night shift squawked excitedly at him .  allen   s eyes snapped open and he sat up .      you   re crazy .     but he was plunging into his breeches even as he spoke .  in ten seconds  he was careening up the steps three at a time .  he shot into the main office just behind the charging figure of his twin brother .   the place was crowded  its occupants in a jitter .   allen brushed his long hair out of his eyes     turn on the turret searchlight .         it   s on     said someone helplessly .   the earthman rushed to the window and looked out .  the yellow beam reached dimly out a few feet and ended in a muddy murkiness .  he pulled at the window and it lifted upwards grittily a few inches .  there was a whistle of wind and a tornado of coughing from within the room .  allen slammed it down again and his hands went at once to his tear filled eyes .   george spoke between sneezes     we   re not located in the sandstorm zone .  this can   t be one .         it is     asserted wells in a squeak .     it   s the worst i   ve ever seen .  started full blast from scratch just like that .  it caught me flat footed .  by the time i closed off all exits to above  it was too late .         too late .     allen withdrew his attention from his sand filled eyes and snapped out the words     too late for what .         too late for our rolling stock .  our rockets got it worst of all .  there isn   t one that hasn   t its propulsives clogged with sand .  and that goes for our irrigation pumps and the ventilating system .  the generators below are safe but everything else will have to be taken apart and put together again .  we   re stalled for a week at least .  maybe more .      there was a short  pregnant silence  and then allen said     take charge .  wells .  put the men on double shift and tackle the irrigation pumps first .  they   ve got to be in working order inside of twenty four hours  or half the crop will dry up and die on us .  here wait  i   ll go with you .      he turned to leave  but his first footstep froze in midair at the sight of michael anders  communications officer  rushing up the stairs .      what   s the matter .      anders spoke between gasps     the damned planet   s gone crazy .  there   s been the biggest quake in history with its center not ten miles from aresopolis .      there was a chorus of    what .     and a ragged follow up of blistering imprecations .  men crowded in anxiously  many had relatives and wives in the martian metropolis .   anders went on breathlessly     it came all of a sudden .  aresopolis is in ruins and fires have started .  there aren   t any details but the transmitter at our aresopolis labs went dead five minutes ago .      there was a babel of comment the news spread out into the furthest recesses of central  and excitement waxed to dangerously panicky proportions .  allen raised his voice to a shout .      quiet  everyone .  there   s nothing we can do about aresopolis .  we   ve got our own troubles .  this freak storm is connected with the quake some way and that   s what we have to take care of .  everyone back to his work now and work fast .  they   ll be needing us at aresopolis damned soon .     he turned to anders     you .  get back to that receiver and don   t knock off until you   ve gotten in touch with aresopolis again .  coming with me  george .         no  rackon not     was the response .     y    tend t    y   r machines .  i   ll go down with anders .        dawn was breaking  a dusky  lightless dawn  when allen carter returned to central .  he was weary weary in mind and body and looked it .  he entered the radio room .      things are a mess .  if      there was a    shhh    and george waved frantically .  allen fell silent .  anders bent over the receiver  turning tiny dials with nervous fingers .   anders looked up     it   s no use  mr .  carter .  can   t get them .         all right .  stay here and keep y   r ears open .  let me know if anything turns up .      he walked out  hooking an arm underneath his brother   s and dragging the latter out .      when c   n we get out the next shipment  all   n .         not for at least a week .  we haven   t a thing that   ll either roll or fly for days  and it will be even longer before we can start harvesting again .         have we any supplies on hand now .         a few tons of assorted blooms mainly the red purples .  the earth shipment last tuesday took off almost everything .      george fell into a reverie .   his brother waited a moment and said sharply     well  what   s on your    mind .  what   s the news from aresopolis .         domned bad .  the quake   s leveled three fourths o    aresopolis and the rest   s pretty much gutted with fire  i rackon .  there    re fifty thousand that   ll have t    camp out nights .  that   s no fun in martian autumn weather with the airth gravity system broken down .      allen whistled     pneumonia .         and common colds and influenza and any o    half doz   n diseases t    say nothing o    people bairnt .   old vincent is raising cain .         wants blooms .         he   s only got a two day supply on hand .  he   s got t    have more .      both  were speaking quietly  almost with indifference  with the vast understatement that is all that makes great crises bearable .   there was a pause and then george spoke again     what   s the best we c   n do .         not under a week not if we kill ourselves to do it .  if they could send over a ship as soon as the storm dies down  we might be able to send what we have as a temporary supply until we can get over with the rest .         silly even t    think o    that .  the aresopolis port is just ruins .  they haven   t a ship t    their names .      again silence .  then allen spoke in a low  tense voice .     what are you waiting for .  what   s that look on your face for .         i   m waiting fr y    t    admit y   r domned machines have failed y    in the fairest emairgency we   ve had t    meet .         admitted     snarled the earthman .      good .  and now its up t    me t    show y    what human ingenuity can do .     he handed a sheet of paper to his brother     there   s a copy of the message i sent vincent .      allen looked long at his brother and slowly read the pencilled scribbling .      will deliver all we have on hand in thirty six hours .  hope it will keep you going the few days until we can get a real shipment out .  things are a little rough out here .         how are you going to do it .     demanded allen  upon finishing .      i   m trying to show y        answered george  and allen realized for the first time that they had left central and were out in the caverns .   george led the way for five minutes and stopped before an object bulking blackly in the dimness .  he turned on the section lights and said     sand truck .      the sand truck was not an imposing object .  with the low driving car in front and the three squat  open topped freightcars behind  it presented a picture of obsolete decrepitude .  fifteen years ago  it had been relegated to the dust heap by the sand sleds and rocket freights .   the ganymedan was speaking     checked it an hour ago  m   self  and    tis still in wairking order .  it has shielded bearings  air conditioning unit f   r the driving car  and an intairnal combustion engine .      the other looked up sharply .  there was an expression of distaste on his face .     you mean it burns chemical fuel .         yup .  gas   line .  that   s why i like it .  reminds me o    ganymede .  on gannie  i had a gas engine that         but wait a while .  we haven   t any of that gasoline .         no  rackon not .  but we got lots o    liquid hydrocarbons round the place .  how about solvent d .  that   s mostly octane .  we   ve got tanks o    it .      allen said     that   s so  but the truck holds only two .         i know it .  i   m one .         and i   m the other .      george grunted     i rackond y   d say that but this isn   t going t    be a push button machine job .  rackon y   r up t    it   airthman .         i reckon i am gannie .        the sun had been up some two hours before the sandtruck   s engine whirred into life  but outside  the murk had become  if anything  thicker .   the main driveway within the caverns was ahum with activity .  grotesque figures with eyes peering through the thick glass of improvised air helmets stepped back as the truck   s broad  sand adapted wheels began their slow turn .  the three cars behind had been piled high with purple blooms  canvas covers had been thrown over them and bound down tightly   and now the signal was given to open the doors .   the lever was jerked downwards and the double doors separated with sand clogged protests .  through a gray whirl of inblown sand  the truck made its way outwards  and behind it sand coated figures brushed at their air helmets and closed the doors again .     george carter  inured by long ganymedan custom  met the sudden gravity change as they left the protective gravitor fields of the caverns  with a single long drawn breath .  his hands held steady upon the wheels .  his terrestrial brother  however  was in far different condition .  the hard nauseating knot into which his stomach tied itself loosened only very gradually  and it was a long time before his irregular stertorous breathing approached anything like normality again .   and throughout  the earthman was conscious of the other   s side long glance and of just a trace of a smile about the other   s lips .   it was enough to keep the slightest moan from issuing forth  though his abdominal muscles cramped and icy perspiration bathed his face .   the miles clicked off slowly  but the illusion of motionlessness was almost as complete as that in space .  the surroundings were gray uniform  monotonous and unvarying .  the noise of the engine was a harsh purr and the clicking of the air purifier behind like a drowsy tick .  occasionally  there was an especially strong gust of wind  and a patter of sand dashed against the window with a million tiny  separate pings .   george kept his eye strictly upon the compass before him .  the silence was almost oppressive .   and then the ganymedan swivelled his head  and growled     what   s wrong with the domned vent   lator .      allen squeezed upward  head against the low top  and then turned back  pale faced     it   s stopped .         it   ll be hours    fore the storm   s over .  ye   ve got t    have air till then .  craw  in back there and start it again .     his voice was flat and final .      here     he said  as the other crawled over his shoulder into the back of the car .     here   s the tool kit .  y   v got    bout twenty minutes    fore the air gets too foul t    breathe .     tis pretty bad now .      the clouds of sand hemmed in closer and the dim yellow light above george   s head dispelled only partially the darkness within .   there was the sound of scrambling from behind him and then allen   s voice     damn this rope .  what   s it doing here .     there was a hammering and then a disgusted curse .      this thing is choked with rust .         anything else wrong .     called out the ganymedan .      don   t know .  wait till i clear it out .     more hammering and an almost continuous harsh  scraping sound followed .   allen backed into his seat once more .  his face dripped rusty perspiration and a swab with the back of an equally damp  rust covered hand did it no good .      the pump is leaking like a punctured kettle  now that the rust   s been knocked loose .  i   ve got it going at top speed  but the only thing between it and a total breakdown is a prayer .         start praying     said george  bruskly .     pray for a button to push .      the earthman frowned  and stared ahead in sullen silence .     at four in the afternoon  the ganymedan drawled     air   s beginning t    thin out  looks like .      allen snapped to alertness .  the air was foul and humid within .  the ventilator behind swished sibilantly between each click and the clicks were spacing themselves further apart .  it wouldn   t hold out much longer now .      how much ground have we covered .            bout a thaird o    the distance     was the reply .     how    r y  holding out .         well enough     allen snapped back .  he retired once more into his shell    night came and the first brilliant stars of a martian night peeped out when with a last futile and long sustained swi i i s s sh  the ventilator died .      domn .     said george .     i can   t breathe this soup any longer  anyway .  open the windows .      the keenly cold martian wind swept in and with it the last traces of sand .  george coughed as he pulled his woolen cap over his ears and turned on the heaters .      y    can still taste the grit .      allen looked wistfully up into the skies     there   s earth  with the moon hanging right onto her tail .         airth .     repeated george with fine contempt .  his finger pointed horizonwards     there   s good old jupe for y    .      and throwing back his head  he sang in a full throated baritone        when the golden orb o    jove  shines down from the skies above   then my spirit longs to go  to that happy land i know  back t    good  old ganyme e e e ede .        the last note quavered and broke  and quavered and broke again and still again in an ever increasing rapidity of tempo until its vibrating ululation pierced the air about ear shatteringly .   allen stared at his brother wide eyed     how did you do that .      george grinned     that   s the gannie quaver .  didn   t y    ever hear it before .      the earthman shook his head     i   ve head of it  but that   s all .      the other became a bit more cordial     well  o    course y    can only do it in a thin atmosphere .  y    should hear me on gannie .  i c   d shake y    right off y   r chair when i   m going good .  here .  wait till i gulp down some coffee  and then i   ll sing y    vairse twenty four o    the    ballad o    ganymede .          he took a deep breath        there   s a fair haired maid i love  standing in the light o    jove  and she   s waiting there for me e e e e .     then      allen grasped him by the arm and shook him .  the ganymedan choked into silence .      what   s the matter .     he asked sharply .      there was a thumping sound on the roof just a second ago .  there   s something up there .      george stared upwards     grab the wheel .  i   ll go up .      allen shook his head     i   m going myself .  i wouldn   t trust myself running this primitive contraption .      he was out on the running board the next instant .      keep her going     he shouted  and threw one foot up onto the roof .     he froze in that position when he became aware of two yellow slits of eyes staring hard into his .  it took not more than a second for him to realize that he was face to face with a keazel  a situation which for discomfort is about on a par with the discovery of a rattlesnake in one   s bed back on earth .   there was little time for mental comparisons of his position with earth predicaments  however  for the keazel lunged forward  its poisonous fangs agleam in the starlight .   allen ducked desperately and lost his grip .  he hit the sand with a slow motion thud and the cold  scaly body of the martian reptile was upon him .   the earthman   s reaction was almost instinctive .  his hand shot out and clamped down hard upon the creature   s narrow muzzle .   in that position  beast and man stiffened into breathless statuary .  the man was trembling and within him his heart pounded away with hard rapidity .  he scarcely dared move .  in the unaccustomed martian gravity  he found he could not judge movements of his limbs .  muscles knotted almost of their own accord and legs swung when they ought not to .   he tried to lie still and think .   the keazel squirmed  and from its lips  clamped shut by earth muscles  issued a tremulous whine .  allen   s hand grew slick with perspiration and he could feel the beast   s muzzle turn a bit within his palm .  he clamped harder  panic stricken .  physically  the keazel was no match for an earthman  even a tired  frightened  gravity unaccustomed earthman but one bite  anywhere  was all that was needed .   the keazel jerked suddenly  its back humped and its legs threshed .  allen held on with both hands and could not let go .  he had neither gun nor knife .  there was no rock on the level desert sands to crack its skull against .  the sand truck had long since disappeared into the martian night  and he was alone alone with a keazel .   in desperation  he twisted .  the keazel   s head bent .  he could hear its breath whistling forth harshly and again there was that low whine .   allen writhed above it and clamped knees down upon its cold  scaly abdomen .  he twisted the head  further and further .  the keazel fought desperately  but allen   s earthly biceps maintained their hold .  he could almost sense the beast   s agony in the last stages  when he called up all his strength  something snapped .   and the beast lay still .   he rose to his feet  half sobbing .  the martian night wind knifed into him and the perspiration froze on his body .  he was alone in the desert .   reaction set in .  there was an intense buzzing in his ears .  he found it difficult to stand .  the wind was biting but somehow he didn   t feel it any more .   the buzzing in his ears resolved itself into a voice a voice calling weirdly through the martian wind .      all   n  where are y    .  domn y     y    tanderfoot  where are y    .  all   n .  a ll   n .      new life swept into the earthman .  he tossed the keazel   s carcass onto his shoulders and staggered on towards the voice .      here i am  g gannie .  right here .      he stumbled blindly into his brother   s arms .   george began harshly     y    blasted airthman  can   t y    even keep y   r footing on a sandtruck moving at ten miles per .  y    might   ve      his voice died away in a semi gurgle .   allen said tiredly     there was a keazel on the roof .  he knocked me off .  here  put it somewhere .  there   s a hundred dollar bonus for every keazel skin brought in to aresopolis .      he had no clear recollection of anything for the next half hour .  when things straightened out  he was in the truck again with the taste of warm coffee in his mouth .  the engine was rumbling once more and the pleasant warmth of the heaters surrounded him .   george sat next to him silently  eyes fixed on the desert ahead .  but once in a while  he cleared his throat and shot a lightning glance at his brother .  there was a queer look in his eyes .   allen said     listen  i   ve got to keep awake  and you look half dead yourself so how about teaching me that    gannie quaver    of yours .  that   s bound to wake the dead .      the ganymedan stared even harder and then said gruffly     sure  watch m    adam   s apple while i do    t again .        the sun was half way to zenith when they reached the canal .   an hour before dawn there had come the crackling sound of hoarfrost beneath the heavy wheels and that signified the end of the desert area and the approach of the canal oasis .  with the rising of the sun  the crackling disappeared and the softening mud underneath slowed the sand adapted truck .  the pathetic clumps of gray green scrub that dotted the flat landscape were the first variant to eternal red sand since the two had started on their journey .   and then allen had leaned forward and grasped his brother by the arm     look  there   s the canal itself right ahead .      the    canal    a small tributary of the mighty jefferson canal contained a mere trickle of water at this season of the year .  a dirty winding line of dampness  it was  and little more .  surrounding it on both sides were the boggy areas of black mud that were to fill up into a rushing ice cold current an earth year hence .   the sand truck nosed gingerly down the gentle slope  weaving a tortuous path among the sparsely strewn boulders brought down by the spring   s torrents and left there as the sinking waters receded .   it slopped through the mud and splashed clumsily through the puddles .  it jounced noisily over rocks  muddied itself past the hubs as it made its way through the murky mid stream channel and then settled itself for the upward pull out .   and then  with a suddenness that tossed the two drivers out of their seats  it side slipped  made one futile effort to proceed onwards  and thereafter refused to budge .   the brothers scrambled out and surveyed the situation .  george swore lustily  voice more thickly accented than ever .      b    jupe    n    domn  we   re in a pickled situation f   r fair .  tis wallowing in the mud there like a blasted pig .      allen shoved his hair back wearily     well  don   t stand there looking at it .  we   re still a hundred miles or better from aresopolis .  we   ve got to get it out of there .         sure  but how .     his imprecations dropped to sibilant breathings as he reached into the truck for the coil of rope in the back .  he looked at it doubtfully .      y    get in here  all   n  and when i pull  press down with y   r foot on that pedal .      he was tying the rope to the front axle even as he spoke .  he played it out behind him as he slogged out through ankle deep mud  and stretched it taut .      all right  now  give .     he yelled .  his face turned purple with effort as his back muscles ridged .  allen  within the car  pressed the indicated pedal to the floor  heard a loud roar from the engine and a spinning whir from the back wheels .  the truck heaved once  and then sank back .         tis no use     george called .     i can   t get a footing .  if the ground were dry  i c   d do it .         if the ground were dry  we wouldn   t be stuck     retorted allen .     here  give me that rope .         d    y    think y    can do it  if i can   t .     came the enraged cry  but the other had already left the car .   allen had spied the large  deep bedded boulder from the truck  and it was with relief that he found it to be within reaching distance of the rope .  he pulled it taut and tossed its free end about the boulder .  knotting it clumsily  he pulled  and it held .   his brother leaned out of the car window  as he made his way  back  with one lumped ganymedan fist agitating the air .      hi  y    nitwit .  what   re y    doing .  d    y    expect that overgrown rock t    pull us out .         shut up     yelled back allen     and feed her the gas when i pull .      he paused midway between boulder and truck and seized the rope .      give .     he shouted in his turn  and with a sudden jerk pulled the rope towards him with both hands .   the truck moved  its wheels caught hold .  for a moment it hesitated with the engine blasting ahead full speed  and george   s hands trembling upon the wheel .  and then it went over .  and almost simultaneously  the boulder at the other end of the taut rope lifted out of the mud with a liquid smacking sound and went over on its side .   allen slipped the noose off it and ran for the truck .      keep her going     he shouted  and hopped onto the running board  rope trailing .      how did y    do that .     asked george  eyes round with awe .      i haven   t got the energy to explain it now .  when we get to aresopolis and after we   ve had a good sleep  i   ll draw the triangle of forces for you  and show you what happened .  no muscles were involved .  don   t look at me as if i were hercules .      george withdrew his gaze with an effort     triangle o    forces  is it .  i never heard o    it  but if that   s what it c   n do  education   s a great thing .         comet gas .  is any coffee left .     he stared at the last thermos bottle  shook it near his ear dolefully  and said     oh  well  let   s practice the quaver .  it   s almost as good and i   ve practically got it perfected .      he yawned prodigiously     will we make it by nightfall .         maybe .      the canal was behind them now .     the reddening sun was lowering itself slowly behind the southern range .  the southern range is one of the two    mountain chains    left on mars .  it is a region of hills  ancient  time worn  eroded hills behind which lies aresopolis .   it possesses the only scenery worth mentioning on all mars and also the golden attribute of being able  through the updrafts along its sides  to suck an occasional ram out of the desiccated martian atmosphere .   ordinarily  perhaps  a pair from earth and ganymede might have idled through this picturesque area  but this was definitely not the case with the carter twins .   eyes  puffed for lack of sleep  glistened once more at the sight of hills on the horizons .  bodies  almost broken for sheer weariness  tensed once more when they rose against the sky .   and the truck leaped ahead  for just behind the hills lay aresopolis .  the road they travelled was no longer a rule edge straight one  guided by the compass  over table top flat land .  it followed narrow  twisting trails over rocky ground .   they had reached twin peaks  then  when there was a sudden sputter from the motor  a few halting coughs and then silence .   allen sat up and there was weariness and utter disgust in his voice     what   s wrong with this everlastingly to be damned machine now .      his brother shrugged     nothing that i haven   t been expecting for the last hour .  we   re out o    gas .  doesn   t matter at all .  we   re at twin peaks only ten miles fr   m the city .  we c   n get there in an hour  and then they c   n send men out here for the blooms .         ten miles in an hour .     protested allen .     you   re crazy .     his face suddenly twisted at an agonizing thought     my god .  we can   t do it under three hours and it   s almost night .  no one can last that long in a martian night .  george  we   re      george was pulling him out of the car by main force     by jupe    n    domn  all   n  don   t let the tenderfoot show through now .  we c   n do it in an hour  i tell y    .  didn   t y    ever try running under sub normal gravity .  it   s like flying .  look at me .      he was off  skimming the ground closely  and proceeding in ground covering leaps that shrank him to a speck up the mountain side in a moment .   he waved  and his voice came thinly     come on .      allen started  and sprawled at the third wide stride  arms nailing and legs straddled wide .  the ganymedan   s laughter drifted down in heartless gusts .   allen rose angrily and dusted himself .  at an ordinary walk  he made his way upwards .      don   t get sore  all   n     said george .     it   s just a knack  and i   ve had practice on gannie .  just pretend y   r running along a feather bed .  run rhythmically a sort o    very slow rhythm  and run close t    the ground  don   t leap high .  like this .  watch me .      the earthman tried it  eyes on his brother .  his first few uncertain strides became surer and longer .  his legs stretched and his arms swung as he matched his brother  step for step .   george shouted encouragement and speeded his pace     keep lower t    the ground  all   n .  don   t leap    fore y   r toes hit the ground .      allen   s eyes shone and  for the moment  weariness was forgotten     this is great  it is like flying or like springs on your shoes .         y    ought t    have lived on gannie with me .  we   ve got special fields f   r subgravity races .  an expairt racer c   n do forty miles an hour at times and i c   n do thirty five myself .        course  the gravity there   s a bit lower than here on mars .        long hair streamed backwards in the wind and skin reddened at the bitter cold air that blew past .  the ruddy patches of sunlight travelled higher and higher up the slopes  lingered briefly upon the very summits and went out altogether .  the short martian twilight started upon its rapidly darkening career .  the evening star earth was already glimmering brightly  its attendant moon somewhat closer than the night previous .   the passing minutes went unheeded by allen .  he was too absorbed by the wonderful new sensation of sub gravity running  to do anything more than follow his brother .  even the increasing chilliness scarcely registered upon his consciousness .   it was george  then  upon whose countenance a tiny  puckered uneasiness grew into a vast  panicky frown .      hi  all   n  hold up .     he called .  leaning backward  he brought himself to a short  hopping halt full of grace and ease .  allen tried to do likewise  broke his rhythm  and went forward upon his face .  he rose with loud reproaches .   the ganymedan turned a deaf ear to them .  his gaze was sombre in the dusk     d    y    know where we are  all   n .      allen felt a cold constriction about his windpipe as he stared about him quickly .  things looked different in semidarkness  but they looked more different than they ought .  it was impossible for things to be so different .      we should   ve sighted old baldy by now  shouldn   t we have .     he quavered .      we sh   d   ve sighted him long ago     came the hard answer .        tis that domned quake .  landslides must   ve changed the trails .  the peaks themselves must   ve been screwed up     his voice was thin edged     allen     tisn   t any use making believe .  we   re dead lost .      for a moment  they stood silently uncertainly .  the sky was purple and the hills retreated into the night .  allen licked bluechilled ups with a dry tongue .      we can   t be but a few miles away .  we   re bound to stumble on the city if we look .         consider the situation  airthman     came .  the savage  shouted answer         tis night  martian night .  the temperature   s down past zero and plummeting every minute .  we haven   t any time t    look  we   ve got t    go straight there .  if we   re not there in half an hour  we   re not going t    get there at all .      allen knew that well  and mention of the cold increased his consciousness of it .  he spoke through chattering teeth as he drew his heavy  fur lined coat closer about him .      we might build a fire .     the suggestion was a half hearted one  muttered indistinctly  and fallen upon immediately by the other .      with what .     george was beside himself with sheer disappointment and frustration .     we   ve pulled through this far  and now we   ll prob   ly freeze t    death within a mile o    the city .  c   mon keep running .  it   s a hundred t    one chance .      but allen pulled him back .  there was a feverish glint in the earthman   s eye     bonfires .     he said irrelevantly .     it   s a possibility .  want to take a chance that might do the trick .         nothin else t    do     growled the other .     but hurry .  every minute i         then run with the wind and keep going .         why .         never mind why .  do what i say run with the wind .      there was no false optimism in allen as he bounded through the dark  stumbling over loose stones  sliding down declivities  always with the wind at his back .  george ran at his side  a vague  formless blotch in the night .   the cold was growing more bitter  but it was not quite as bitter as the freezing pang of apprehension gnawing at the earthman   s vitals .   death is unpleasant .   and then they topped the rise  and from george   s throat came a loud    b    jupe    n    domn .     of triumph .   the ground before them  as far as the eye could see  was dotted by bonfires .  shattered aresopolis lay ahead  its homeless inhabitants making the night bearable by the simple agency of burning wood .   and on the hilly slopes  two weary figures slapped each other on the backs  laughed wildly  and pressed half frozen  stubbly cheeks together for sheer  unadulterated joy .   they were there at last .     the aresopolis lab  on the very outskirts of the city  was one of the few structures still standing .  within  by makeshift light  haggard chemists were distilling the last drops of extract .  without  the city   s police force remnants were clearing desperate way for the precious flasks and vials as they were distributed to the various emergency medical centers set up in various regions of the bonfire pocked ruins that were once the martian metropolis .   old hal vincent supervised the process and his faded eyes ever and again peered anxiously into the hills beyond  watching hopefully but doubtfully for the promised cargo of blooms .   and then two figures reeled out of the darkness and collapsed to halt before him .   chill anxiety clamped down upon him     the blooms .  where are they .  have you got them .         at twin peaks     gasped allen .     a ton of them and better in a sand truck .  send for them .      a group of police ground cars set off before he had finished  and vincent exclaimed bewilderedly     a sand truck .  why didn   t you send it in a ship .  what   s wrong with you out there  anyway .  earthquake      he received no direct answer .  george had stumbled towards the nearest bonfire with a beatific expression on his worn face .      ahhh     tis warm .     slowly  he folded and dropped  asleep before he hit the ground .   allen coughed gaspingly     huh .  the gannie tenderfoot .  couldn   t ulp take it .      and the ground came up and hit him in the face .     allen woke with the evening sun in his eyes and the odor of frying bacon in his nostrils .  george shoved the frying pan towards him and said between gigantic  wolfing mouthfuls     help yourself .      he pointed to the empty sand truck outside the labs     they got the stuff all right .      allen fell to  quietly .  george wiped his lips with the back of his hand and said     say  all   n  how    d y    find the city .  i   ve been sitting here trying t    figure it all out        it was the bonfires     came the muffled answer .     it was the only way they could get heat  and fires over square miles of land create a whole section of heated air  which rises  causing the cold surrounding air of the hills to sweep in .     he suited his words with appropriate gestures .     the wind in the hills was heading for the city to replace warm air and we followed the wind .   sort of a natural compass  pointing to where we wanted to go .      george was silent  kicking with embarrassed vigor at the ashes of the bonfire of the night before .      lis   n  all   n  i   ve had y    a   wrong .  y    were an airthman tanderfoot t    me till     he paused  drew a deep breath and exploded with     well  by jupe n    domn  y   r my twin brother and i   m proud o    it all airth c   dn   t drown out the carter blood in y    .      the earthman opened his mouth to reply but his brother clamped one palm over it     y    keep quiet  till i   m finished .  after we get back  y    can fix up that mechanical picker or anything else y    want .  i drop my veto .  if airth and machines c   n tairn out y   r kind o    man  they   re all right .  but just the same     there was a trace of wistfulness in his voice     y    got t    admit that everytime the machines broke down from irrigation trucks and rocket ships to ventilators and sand trucks  t   was men who had t    pull through in spite o    all that mars could do .      allen wrenched his face from out behind the restraining palm .      the machines do their best     he said  but not too vehemently .      sure  but that   s all they can do .  when the emairgency comes  a man   s got t    do a damn lot better than his  . best or he   s a goner .      the other paused  nodded  and gripped the other   s hand with sudden fierceness     oh  we   re not so different .  earth and ganymede are plastered thinly over the outside of us  but inside      he caught himself .      come on  let   s give out with that old gannie quaver .      and from the two fraternal throats tore forth a shrieking eldritch yell such as the thin  cold martian air had seldom before carried .     the end    i got the cover again with    heredity .        in connection with that story  i remember best a comment i received from a young fellow named scott feldman  who was then still in his teens but who was later  as scott meredith  to become one of the most important literary agents in the business  .  he disapproved of the story because i introduced two characters at the start who disappeared from the story and were never heard of again .   once that was pointed out to me  it seemed to me that this was indeed a major flaw  and i wondered why neither campbell nor pohl had specifically pointed it out .  i never quite had the courage to ask  however .   but it did cause me to look at my stories more closely thereafter  and to realize again that writing isn   t all inspiration and free flow .  you do have to ask yourself pretty mechanical questions  such as     what do i do with this character now that i   ve taken the trouble to make use of him .      by the time campbell was rejecting  and pohl accepting    heredity     i was writing    history .     the same thing happened .  i submitted it to campbell on september    .  it was rejected  and  eventually  pohl took it .       history     ullen   s lank arm pushed the stylus carefully and painstakingly across the paper  his near sighted eyes blinked through thick lenses .  the signal light flashed twice before he answered .   he turned a page  and called out     is dat you  johnnie .  come in  please .      he smiled gently  his thin  martian face alight with pleasure .      sit down  johnnie but first lower de window shade .  de glare of your great eard sun is annoying .  ah  dat   s good  and sid down and be very  very quiet for just a little while  because i am busy .      john brewster shifted a pile of ill stacked papers and seated himself .  he blew the dust from the edges of an open book in the next chair and looked reproachfully on the martian historian .      are you still poking around these musty old things .  don   t you get tired .         please  johnnie     ullen did not look up     you will lose de page .  dat book dere is william stewart   s    hitlerian era    and it is very hard to read .  so many words he uses which he doesn   t explain .      his expression as it focussed upon johnnie was one of frowning petulance     never do dey explain deir terms .  it is so unscientific .  on mars  before we even start  we say     dis is a list of all definitions of terms to be used .     how oderwise can people talk sensibly .  hmp .  you crazy eardmen .         oh  nuts  ullen forget it .  why don   t you look at me .  don   t you even notice anything .      the martian sighed  removed his glasses  cleaned them thoughtfully  and carefully replaced them .  he stared impersonally at johnnie     well  i think it is new clothes you are wearing .  is it not so .         new clothes .  is that all you can say  ullen .  this is a uniform .  i   m a member of the home defense .     he rose to his feet  a picture of boyish exuberance .      what is dis    home defense    .     asked ullen languidly .   johnnie gulped and sat down helplessly     you know  i really think you haven   t heard that earth and venus have been at war for the last week .  i   ll bet money you haven   t .         i   ve been busy .     he frowned and pursed his thin  bloodless lips     on mars  dere is no war at least  dere isn   t any more .  once  we used to fight  but dat was long ago .  once we were scientists  too  and dat was long ago .  now  dere are only a few of us and we do not fight dere is no happiness dat way .     he seemed to shake himself  and spoke more briskly     tell me  johnnie  do you know where it is i can find what it means  dis    national honor .     it holds me back .  i can   t go furder unless i can understand it .      johnnie rose to his full height and glittered in the spotless green of the terrestrial service .  he laughed with fond indulgence     you   re hopeless  ullen  you old coot .  aren   t you going to wish me luck .  i   m hitting space tomorrow .         oh  is dere danger .      there was a squawk of laughter     danger .  what do you think .         well  den  to seek danger it is foolish .  why do you do it .         you wouldn   t understand  ullen .  just wish me luck and say you hope i come through whole .         cer tain ly .   .   don   t want anyone to die .     he slipped his hand into the strong fist held out to him .     take care of yourself  johnnie and wait  before you go  bring me stewart   s book .  everything is so heavy here on eard .  heavy  heavy   and de words have no definitions .      he sighed  and was back at his books as johnnie slipped quietly out of the room .      dese barbarous people     he muttered sleepily to himself .     war .  dey dink dat by killing     his voice died away and merged into a slurred mumble as his eyes followed creeping finger across the page .         from the very moment of the union of the anglo saxon world into a single governmental entity and even as far back as the spring of       it was evident that the doom of             dese crazy eardmeni       ullen leaned heavily upon his crutches on the steps of the university library and one thin hand shielded his watering eyes from the terrible earthly sun .   the sky was blue  cloudless  undisturbed .  yet somewhere up above  beyond the planet   s airy blanket  steel sided ships were veering and sparkling in vicious combat .  and down upon the city were falling the tiny    drops of death     the highly radioactive bombs that noiselessly and inexorably ate out a fifteen foot crater wherever they fell .   the city   s population was herding into the shelters and burying themselves inside the deep set leaden cells .  upstaring  silent  anxious  they streamed past ullen .  uniformed guards invested some sort of order into the gigantic flight  steering the stragglers and speeding the laggards .   the air was filled with barked orders .      hit the shelter  pop  better get going .  you can   t stand there  you know .      ullen turned to the guard who addressed him and slowly brought his wandering thoughts to bear upon the situation .      i am sorry  eardman but i cannot move very fast on your huge world .     he tapped one crutch upon the marble flags beneath .     dings are so heavy .  if i were to crowd in wid de rest  i would be crushed .      he smiled gently down from his lank height  and the guard rubbed a stubbly chin     all right  pop  i can fix that .  it is tough on you marsies at that here  hold those crutches up out of the way .      with a heave  he cradled the martian     hold your legs    close to my body  because we   re going to travel fast .        his bulky figure pressed through the line of earthmen .  ullen shut his eyes as the rapid motion under supernormal gravity stirred his stomach into rebellion .  he opened them once again in the dim recesses of the low ceilinged shelter .   the guard set him down carefully and adjusted the crutches beneath ullen   s armpits     o . k .  pop .  take care of yourself .      ullen took in his surroundings and hobbled to one of the low benches at the near end of the shelter .  from behind him came the sombre clang of the thick  leaden door .   the martian historian fished a worn tablet from his pocket and scribbled slow notes .  he disregarded the excited babble that arose about him and the scraps of heated talk that filled the air thickly .   and then he scratched at his furrowed forehead with the stub end of his pencil  meeting the staring eyes of the man sitting next to him .  he smiled abstractedly and returned to his notes .      you   re a martian  aren   t you .     his neighbor spoke in quick  squeaky tones .     i don   t like foreigners much  but i   ve got nothing special against marsies .  these veenies  now  they      ullen   s soft tones interrupted him .     hate is all wrong  i dink .  dis war is a great annoyance a great one .  it interferes wid my work and you eardmen ought to stop it .  is it not so .         you can bet your hide we   re going to stop it     came the emphatic reply .     we   re going to bash their planet inside out  and the dirty veenies with it .         you mean attack deir cities like dis .     the martian blinked owlishly in thought     you dink dat would be best .         damn it  yes .  it         but look .     ullen placed a skeleton finger in one palm and continued in gentle argument .     would it not be easier to get de ships demselves by de fall apart weapon .  don   t you dink so .  or is it dat de venus people  dey have de screens .         what weapon  did you say .      ullen ruminated carefully     i suppose dat isn   t de name you call it by but i don   t know about weapons  anyway .  we call it on mars de    skellingbeg    and dat means in english    fallapart weapon .     now you know .      there was no direct answer unless a vague under breath mutter could be called one .  the earthman pushed away from his companion and stared at the opposite wall in a fidget .   ullen sensed the rebuff and shrugged one shoulder wearily     it is not dat i care much about de whole ding .  it is only dat de war is a big bodder .  it should be ended .     he sighed     but i don   t care .      his fingers had just begun manipulating the pencil once more in its travels across the open tablet on his lap  when he looked up again .      tell me  please  what is de name of dat country where hitler died .  your eard names  dey are so complicated sometimes .  i dink it begins wid an m .      his neighbor ripped him open with a stare and walked away .  ullen   s eyes followed him with a puzzled frown .   and then the all clear signal sounded .      oh  yes     said ullen .     madagascar i such a silly name .        johnnie brewster   s uniform was war worn now  a bit more wrinkled about the neck and shoulders  a trace more worn at knees and elbows .   ullen ran his finger along the angry scar that ran the length of johnnie   s right fore arm     it hurts no more  johnnie .         nuts .  a scratch .  i got the veenie that did that .  he   s chasing dreams in the moon now .         you were in de hospital long  johnnie .         a week .     he lit a cigarette  pushed some of the mess off the martian   s desk and seated himself .     i   ve spent the rest of the time with my family  though i did get around to visiting you  you see .      he leaned over and poked an affectionate hand at the martian   s leathery cheek     aren   t you going to say you   re glad to see me .      ullen removed his glasses and peered at the earthman     why  johnnie  are you so uncertain dat i am glad to see you  dat you require i should say it in words .     he paused     i   ll make a note of dat .  you silly eardmen must always be telling each oder dese simple dings and den you don   t believe it anyway .  on mars      he was rubbing his glasses methodically  as he spoke  and now he replaced them     johnnie  don   t you eardmen have de    fall apart    weapon .  i met a person once in de raid shelter and he didn   t know what i was talking about .      johnnie frowned     i don   t either  for that matter .  why do you ask .         because it seems strange dat you should have to fight so hard dese venus men  when dey don   t seem to have de screens to stop it wid .  johnnie  i want de war should be over .  it makes me all de time stop my work to go to a shelter .         hold on  now  ullen .  don   t sputter .  what is this    fall apart    weapon .  a disintegrator .  what do you know about it .         i .  i know nodding about it at all .  i dought you knew  dat   s why i asked .  back on mars  in our histories  dey talk about using dat kind of weapon in our old wars .  but we don   t know nodding about weapons any more .  anyway  dey   re so silly  because de oder side always dinks of someding which protects against it  and den everyding is de same as always .   johnnie  do you suppose you could go down to de desk and ask for a copy of higginboddam   s    beginnings of space travel .         the earthman clenched his fists and shook them impotently     ullen  you damned martian pedant don   t you understand that this is important .  earth is at war .  war .  war .  war .         well  den  stop de war .     there was irritation in ullen   s voice .     dere is no peace and quiet anywheres on eard .  i wish i had dis library johnnie  be careful .  please  what are you doing .  you   re hurting me .         i   m sorry  ullen  but you   ve got to come with me .  we   re going to see about this .     johnny had the feebly protesting martian wedged into the wheel chair and was off with a rush  before he had finished the sentence .   a rocket taxi was at the bottom of the library steps  and together chauffeur and spaceman lifted the chair inside .  with a comet tail of smoke  they were off .   ullen moaned softly at the acceleration  but johnnie ignored him .     washington in twenty minutes  fellow     he said to the driver     and ignore the signal beams .        the starched secretary spoke in a frozen monotone     admiral korsakoff will see you now .      johnnie wheeled and stamped out the last cigarette butt .  he shot a hasty glance at his watch and grunted .   at the motion of the wheel chair  ullen roused himself out of a troubled sleep .  he adjusted his glasses     did dey let us in finally  johnnie .         shhh .      ullen   s impersonal stare swept over the rich furnishings of the room  the huge maps of earth and venus on the wall  the imposing desk in the center .  it lingered upon the pudgy  bearded figure behind this desk and then came to rest upon the lanky  sandy haired man at his side .   the martian attempted to rise from the chair in sudden eagerness     aren   t you dr .  doming .  i saw you last year at princeton .  you remember me  don   t you .  dey gave me at dat time  my honorary degree .      dr .  thorning had advanced and shook hands vigorously     certainly .  you spoke then on martian historical methods  didn   t you .         oh  you remember .  i   m glad .  but dis is a great opportunity for me  meeting you .  tell me  as a scientist  what would be your opinion of my deory dat de social insecurity of de hitlerian era was de direct cause for de lag      dr .  thorning smiled     i   ll discuss it with you later  dr .  ullen .  right now  admiral korsakoff wants information from you  with which we hope to end the war .         exactly     korsakoff spoke in clipped tones as he met ullen   s mild gaze .     although a martian  i presume you favor the victory of the principles of freedom and justice over the foul practices of venusian tyranny .      ullen stared uncertainly     dat sounds familiar but i don   t dink about it much .  you mean  maybe  de war should end .         with victory  yes .         oh     victory     dat is just a silly word .  history proves dat a war decided on military superiority only lays de groundwork for future wars of retaliation and revenge .  i refer you to a very good essay on de subject by a james calkins .  it was published all de way back in      .         my dear sir .      ullen raised his voice in bland indifference to johnnie   s urgent whisperings .     now to end de war really end it you should say to de plain people of venus     it is unnecessary to fight .  let us just talk         there was the slam of fist on desk and a muttered oath of frightful import .     for god   s sakes  thorning  get what you want out of him .  i give you five minutes .        thorning stifled his chuckle     dr .  ullen  we want you to tell us what you know about the disintegrator .         disintegrator .     ullen put a puzzled finger to his cheek .      the one you told lieutenant brewster of .         ummmm  oh .  you mean de    fall apart    weapon .  i don   t know nodding about it de martian historians mention it some times  but none of dem know about it de technical side  dat is .      the sandy haired physicist nodded patiently     i know  i know .  but what do they say .  what kind of a weapon is it .         well  de way dey talk about it  it makes de metals to fall to pieces .  what is it you call de ding dat holds metals togedder now .         intra molecular forces .      ullen frowned and then spoke thoughtfully     maybe .  i forgot what de martian word is except dat it   s long .  anyway  dis weapon  it makes dis force dat holds de metals to gedder not to exist anymore and it all falls apart in a powder .  but it only works on de dree metals  iron  cobalt  and uh de odder one .         nickel     prompted johnnie  softly .      yes  yes  nickel .      thorning   s eyes glittered     aha  the ferromagnetic elements .  there   s an oscillating magnetic field mixed up in this  or i   m a veenie .  how about it  ullen .      the martian sighed     such crazy eard words .  let   s see now  most of what i know about de weapon is from de work of hogel beg .  it was i   m pretty sure in his    cultural and social history of de dird empire .     it was a huge work in twenty four volumes  but i always dought it was radder mediocre .  his technique in de presentation of         please     said thorning     the weapon         oh  yes  dat .     he hitched himself higher in his chair and grimaced with the effort .     he talks about electricity and it goes back and ford very fast very fast  and its pressure     he paused hopelessly  and regarded the scowling visage of the bearded admiral naively     i dink de word is pressure  but i don   t know  because it is hard to translate .  de martian word is    cranstard .     does dat help .         i think you mean    potential     dr .  ullen .     thorning sighed audibly .      well  if you say so .  anyway  dis    potential    changes also very fast and de two changes are synchronized somehow along wid magnetism dat uh shifts and dat   s all i know about it .     he smiled uncertainly     i would like to go back now .  it would be all right now  wouldn   t it .      the admiral vouchsafed no answer     do you make anything out of that mess .  doctor .         damned little     admitted the physicist     but it gives me a lead or two .  we might try getting hold of this beg   s book  but there   s not much hope .  it will simply repeat what we   ve just heard .  dr .  ullen  are there any scientific works on your planet .      the martian saddened     no  dr .  doming  dey were all destroyed during de kalynian reaction .  on mars  we doroughly disbelieve in science .  history has shown dat it comes from science no happiness .     he turned to the young earthman at his side     johnnie  let us go now  please .      korsakoff dismissed the two with a wave of the hand .     ullen bent carefully over the closely typed manuscript and inserted a word .  he glanced up brightly at johnnie brewster  who shook his head and placed a hand on the martian   s arm .  his brow furrowed more deeply .   ullen     he said harshly     you   re in trouble .         eh .  i .  in trouble .  why  johnnie  dat is not so .  my book is coming along famously .  de whole first volume  it is completed and  but for a bit of polishing  is ready for de printers .         ullen  if you can   t give the government definite information on the disintegrator  i won   t answer for the consequences .         but i told all i knew         it won   t do .  ifs not enough .  you   ve got to remember more  ullen  you   ve got to .         but knowledge where dere is none is impossible to have  dat is an axiom .     ullen sat upright in his seat  propping himself on a crutch .      i know it     johnnie   s mouth twisted in misery     but you   ve got to understand .      the venusians have control of space  our asteroid garrisons have been wiped out  and last week phobos and deimos fell .  communications between earth and luna are broken and god knows how long the lunar squadron can hold out .  earth itself is scarcely secure and their bombings are becoming more serious  . oh  ullen  don   t you understand .      the martian   s look of confusion deepened     eard is losing .         god  yes .         den give up .  dat is de logical ding to do .  why did you start at all you stupid eardmen .      johnnie ground his teeth     but if we have the disintegrator  we won   t lose .      ullen shrugged     oh  johnnie  it gets wearisome to listen to de same old story .  you eardmen have one track minds .  look  wouldn   t it make you feel better to have me read you some of my manuscript .  it would do your intellect good .         all right  ullen  you   ve asked for it  and here   s everything right out if you don   t tell thorning what he wants to know  you   re going to be arrested and tried for treason .      there was a short silence  and then a confused stutter     t  treason .  you mean dat i betray     the historian removed his glasses and wiped them with shaking hand     it   s not true .  you   re trying to frighten me .         oh  no  i   m not korsakoff thinks you know more than you   re telling .  he   s sure that you   re either holding out for a price or  more likely  that you   ve sold out to the veenies .         but doming         thorning isn   t any too secure himself .  he has his own skin to think of .  earth governments in moments of stress are not famous for being reasonable .     there were sudden tears in his  eyes     ullen  there must be something you can do .  it   s not only you it   s for earth .      ullen   s breathing whistled harshly     dey tink i would sell my scientific knowledge .  is dat de kind of insult dey pay my sense of eddies  my scientific integrity .     his voice was thick with fury and for the first time since johnnie knew him  he lapsed into guttural martian .     for dat  i say not a word     he finished .     let dem put me in prison or shoot me  but dis insult i cannot forget .      there was no mistaking the firmness in his eyes  and johnnie   s shoulders sagged .  the earthman didn   t move at the glare of the signal light .      answer de light  johnnie     said the martian  softly .     dey are coming for me .        in a moment  the room was crowded with green uniforms .  dr .  thorning and the two with him were the only ones present in civilian clothes .   ullen struggled to his feet     gentlemen  say nodding .  i have heard dat it is dought dat i am selling what i know  selling for money .     he spat the words .     it is a ding never before said of me a ding f bave not deserved .  if you wish you can imprison me immediately  but i shall say nodding more  nor have anyding furder to do wid de eard government .      a green garbed official stepped forward immediately  but dr .  thorning waved him back .      whoa  there .  dr .  ullen     he said jovially     don   t jump too soon .  i   ve just come to ask if there isn   t a single additional fact that you remember .  anything  no matter how insignificant      there was stony silence .  ullen leant heavily on his crutches but remained stolidly erect .   dr .  thorning seated himself imperturably upon the historian   s desk  picked up the high stack of type written pages     ah  is this the manuscript young brewster was telling me about .     he gazed at it curiously     well  of course  you realize that your attitude will force the government to confiscate all this .         eh .     ullen   s stern expression melted into dismay .  his crutch slipped and he dropped heavily into his seat .   the physicist warded off the other   s feeble clutch     keep your hands off .  dr .  ullen  i   m taking care of this .     he leafed through the pages with a rustling noise .     you see  if you are arrested for treason  your writings become subversive .         subversive .     ullen   s voice was hoarse     dr .  doming  you don   t know what you are saying .  it is my my great labor .     his voice caught huskily     please  dr .  doming  give me my manuscript .      the other held it just beyond the martian   s shaking fingers .      if     he said .      but i don   t know .      the sweat stood out on the historian   s pale face .  his voice came thickly .     time .  give me time .  but let me dink and don   t  please don   t harm dis manuscript     the other   s fingers sank painfully into ullen   s shoulder     so help me  i burn your manuscript in five minutes  if         wait  i   ll tell you .  somewhere i don   t know where it was said dat in de weapon dey used a special metal for some of de wiring .  i don   t know what metal  but water spoiled it and had to be kept away also air .  it         holy jumping jupiter     came the sudden shout from one of thorning   s companions .     chief  don   t you remember aspartier   s work on sodium wiring in argon atmosphere five years ago      dr .  thorning   s eyes were deep with thought     wait wait  wait damn .  it was staring us in the face         i know     shrieked ullen suddenly .     it was in karlsto .  he was discussing de fall of gallonie and dat was one of de minor causes de lack of dat metal and den he mentioned      he was talking to an empty room  and for a while he was silent in puzzled astonishment .   and then     my manuscript .     he salvaged it from where it lay scattered over the floor  hobbling painfully about  smoothing each wrinkled sheet with care .      de barbarians to treat a great scientific work so .        ullen opened still another drawer and scrabbled through its contents .  he closed it and looked about peevishly     johnnie  where did i put dat bibliography .  did you see it .      he looked toward the window     johnniel     johnnie brewster said     wait a while  ullen .  here they come now .      the streets below were a burst of color .  in a long  stiffly moving line the green of the navy paraded down the avenue  the air above them snow thick with confetti  hail thick with ticker tape .  the roar of the crowd was dull  muted .      ah  de foolish people     mused ullen .     dey were happy just like dis when de war started and dere was a parade just like dis and now anodder one .  silly .     he stumped back to his chair .   johnnie followed     the government is naming a new museum after you  isn   t it .         yes     was the dry reply .  he peered helplessly about under the desk     de ullen war museum and it will be filled wid ancient weapons  from stone knife to anti aircraft gun .  dat is your queer eard sense of de fitness of dings .  where in dunderation is dat bibliography .         here     said johnnie  withdrawing the document from ullen   s vest pocket .     our victory was due to your weapon  ancient to you  so it is fit in a way .         victory .  sure .  until venus rearms and reprepares and refights for revenge .  all history shows but never mind .  it is useless  dis talk .     he settled himself deeply in his chair     here  let me show you a real victory .  let me read you some of de first volume of my work .  it   s already in print  you know .      johnnie laughed     go ahead  ullen .  right now i   m even willing to listen to you read your entire twelve volumes  word for word .      and ullen smiled gently .     it would be good for your intellect     he said .     the end       history     you will notice  mentions hitler   s end .  it was written in the first days of september       when hitler seemed at the very peak of his success .  france was defeated and occupied and britain was at bay and seemed unlikely to survive .   still  i had no doubt as to his ultimate defeat .  i did not visualize his ending in suicide  however .  i thought that like napoleon and the kaiser  he would end his life in exile .  madagascar was the place i picked .     also mentioned in the story are    the tiny    drops of death     the highly publicized radioactive bombs that noiselessly and inexorably ate out a fifteen foot crater wherever they fell .      by the time i wrote the story  uranium fission had been discovered and announced .  i had not yet heard of it  however  and i was unaware that reality was about to outstrip my prized science fictional imagination .     on october           i visited campbell and outlined to him another robot story i wanted to write  a story i planned to call    reason .     campbell was completely enthusiastic .  i had trouble writing it and had to start over several times  but eventually it was done  and on november    i submitted it to john .  he accepted it on the twenty second  and it appeared in the april      issue of astounding .   it was the third story of mine that he had accepted and the first in which he did not ask for a revision .   he told me  in fact  that he had liked it so well  he had almost decided to pay me a bonus .      with    reason     the    positronic robot    series was fairly launched  and my two most successful characters yet  gregory powell and mike donovan  improvements on turner and snead of    ring around the sun     made their appearance .  eventually     reason    and others of the series that were to follow  together with    robbie     which campbell had rejected  were to appear in i  robot .     the success of    reason    didn   t mean that i was to have no further rejections from campbell .   on december          influenced by the season and never stopping to think that a christmas story must sell no later than july in order to make the christmas issue  i began    christmas on ganymede .     i submitted it to him on the twenty third  but the holiday season did not affect his critical judgment .  he rejected it .   i tried pohl next  and  as was happening so often that year  he took it .  in this case  for reasons i will describe later  the acceptance fell through .  i eventually sold it the next summer  june           the proper time of year  to startling stories  the younger  sister magazine of thrilling wonder stories .       christmas on ganymede     olaf johnson hummed nasally to himself and his china blue eyes were dreamy as he surveyed the stately fir tree in the corner of the library .  though the library was the largest single room in the dome  olaf felt it none too spacious for the occasion .  enthusiastically he dipped into the huge crate at his side and took out the first roll of red and green crepe paper .   what sudden burst of sentiment had inspired the ganymedan products corporation  inc .  to ship a complete collection of christmas decorations to the dome  he did not pause to inquire .  olaf   s was a placid disposition  and in his self imposed job as chief christmas decorator  he was content with his lot .   he frowned suddenly and muttered a curse .  the general assembly signal light was hashing on and off hysterically .  with a hurt air olaf laid down the tack hammer he had just lifted  then the roll of cr  pe paper  picked some tinsel out of his hair and left for officers quarters .   commander scott pelham was in his deep armchair at the head of the table when olaf entered .  his stubby fingers were drumming unrhythmically upon the glass topped table .  olaf met the commander   s hotly furious eyes without fear  for nothing had gone wrong in his department in twenty ganymedan revolutions .   the room filled rapidly with men  and pelham   s eyes hardened as he counted noses in one sweeping glance .      we   re all here .  men  we face a crisis .      there was a vague stir .  olaf   s eyes sought the ceiling and he relaxed .  crises hit the dome once a revolution  on the average .  usually they turned out to be a sudden rise in the quota of oxite to be gathered  or the inferior quality of the last batch of karen leaves .  he stiffened  however  at the next words .      in connection with the crisis  i have one question to ask .     pelham   s voice was a deep baritone  and it rasped unpleasantly when he was angry .     what dirty imbecilic troublemaker has been telling those blasted ossies fairy tales .      olaf cleared his throat nervously and thus immediately became the center of attention .  his adam   s apple wobbled in sudden alarm and his forehead wrinkled into a washboard .  he shivered .      i i     he stuttered  quickly fell silent .  his long fingers made a bewildered gesture of appeal .     i mean i was out there yesterday  after the last uh supplies of karen leaves  on account the ossies were slow and      a deceptive sweetness entered pelham   s voice .  he smiled .      did you tell those natives about santa claus  olaf .        the smile looked uncommonly like a wolfish leer and olaf broke down .  he nodded convulsively .      oh  you did .  well  well  you told them about santa claus .  he comes down in a sleigh that hies through the air with eight reindeer pulling it  huh .         well er doesn   t he .     olaf asked unhappily .      and you drew pictures of the reindeer  just to make sure there was no mistake .  also  he has a long white beard and red clothes with white trimmings .         yeah  that   s right     said olaf  his face puzzled     and he has a big bag  chock full of presents for good little boys and girls  and he brings it down the chimney and puts presents inside stockings .         sure .         you also told them he   s about due  didn   t you .  one more revolution and he   s going to visit us .      olaf smiled weakly .     yeah  commander  i meant to ten you .  i   m fixing up the tree and         shut up .     the commander was breathing hard in a whistling sort of way .     do you know what those ossies have thought of .         no  commander .      pelham leaned across the table toward olaf and shouted      they want santa claus to visit them .      someone laughed and changed it quickly into a strangling cough at the commander   s raging stare .      and if santa claus doesn   t visit them  the ossies are going to quit work .     he repeated     quit cold strike .      there was no laughter  strangled or otherwise  after that .  if there were more than one thought among the entire group  it didn   t show itself .  olaf expressed that thought      but what about the quota .         well  what about it .     snarled pelham .     do i have to draw pictures for you .  ganymedan products has to get one hundred tons of wolframite  eighty tons of karen leaves and fifty tons of oxite every year  or it loses its franchise .  i suppose there isn   t anyone here who doesn   t know that .  it so happens that the current year ends in two ganymedan revolutions  and we   re five per cent behind schedule as it is .      there was pure  horrified silence .      and now the ossies worit work unless they get santa claus .  no work  no quota  no franchise no jobs .  get that  you low grade morons .  when the company loses its franchise  we lose the best paying jobs in the system .  kiss them good by  men  unless      he paused  glared steadily at olaf  and added      unless  by next revolution  we have a flying sleigh  eight reindeer and a santa claus .  and by every cosmic speck in the rings of saturn  we   re going to have just that  especially a santa .      ten faces turned ghastly pale .      got someone in mind  commander .     asked someone in a voice that was three quarters croak .      yes  as a matter of fact  i have .      he sprawled back in his chair .  olaf johnson broke into a sudden sweat as he found himself staring at the end of a pointing forefinger .      aw  commander .     he quavered .   the pointing finger never moved .     pelham tramped into the foreroom  removed his oxygen nosepiece and the cold cylinders attached to it one by one he cast off thick woolen outer garments and  with a final  weary sigh  jerked off a pair of heavy knee high space boots .   sim pierce paused in his careful inspection of the latest batch of karen leaves and cast a hopeful glance over his spectacles .      well .     he asked .   pelham shrugged .     i promised them santa .  what else could i do .  i also doubled sugar rations  so they   re back on the job for the moment .         you mean till the santa we promised doesn   t show up .     pierce straightened and waved a long karen leaf at the commander   s face for emphasis .     this is the silliest thing i ever heard of .  it can   t be done .  there ain   t no santa claus .         try telling that to the ossies     pelham slumped into a chair and his expression became stonily bleak .     what   s benson doing .         you mean that flying sleigh he says he can rig up .     pierce held a leaf up to the light and peered at it critically .     he   s a crackpot  if you ask me .  the old buzzard went down to the sub level this morning and he   s been there ever since .  all i know is that he   s taken the spare lectro dissociator apart .  if anything happens to the regular  it just means that we   re without oxygen .         well     pelham rose heavily     for my part i hope we do choke .  it would be an easy way out of this whole mess .  i   m going down below .      he stumped out and slammed the door behind him .   in the sub level he gazed about in bewilderment  for the room was littered with gleaming chrome steel machine parts .  it took him some time to recognize the mess as the remains of what had been a compact  snugly built lectro dissociator the day before .  in the center  in anachronistic contrast  stood a dusty wooden sleigh atop rust red runners .  from beneath it came the sound of hammering .      hey  benson .     called pelham .   a grimy  sweat streaked face pushed out from underneath the sleigh  and a stream of tobacco juice shot toward benson   s ever present cuspidor .      what are you shouting like that for .     he complained .     this is delicate work .          what the devil is that weird contraption .     demanded pelham .      flying sleigh .  my own idea  too .     the light of enthusiasm shone in benson   s watery eyes  and the quid in his mouth shifted from cheek to cheek as he spoke .     the sleigh was brought here in the old days  when they thought ganymede was covered with snow like the other jovian moons .  all i have to do is fix a few gravo repulsors from the dissociator to the bottom and that   ll make it weightless when the current   s on .  compressed air jets will do the rest .       the commander chewed his lower lip dubiously .      will it work .         sure it will .  lots of people have thought of using repulsors in air travel  but they   re inefficient  especially in heavy gravity fields .  here on ganymede  with a field of one third gravity and a thin atmosphere  a child could run it .  even johnson could run it  though i wouldn   t mourn if he fell off and broke his blasted neck .         all right  then  look here .  we   ve got lots of this native purplewood .  get charlie finn and tell him to put that sleigh on a platform of it .  he   s to have it extend about twenty feet or more frontward  with a railing around the part that projects .      benson spat and scowled through the stringy hair over his eyes .      what   s the idea  commander .      pelham   s laughter came in short  harsh barks .      those ossies are expecting reindeer  and reindeer they   re going to have .  those animals will have to stand on something  won   t they .         sure .  .  . but wait  hold on .  there aren   t any reindeer on ganymede .      commander pelham paused on his way out .  his eyes narrowed unpleasantly as they always did when he thought of olaf johnson .      olaf is out rounding up eight spinybacks for us .  they   ve got four feet  a head on one end and a tail on the other .  that   s close enough for the ossies .      the old engineer chewed this information and chuckled nastily .      good .  i wish the fool joy of his job .         so do i     gritted pelham .   he stalked out as benson  still leering  slid underneath the sleigh .     the commander   s description of a spinyback was concise and accurate  but it left out several interesting details .  for one thing  a spinyback has a long  mobile snout  two large ears that wave back and forth gently  and two emotional purple eyes .  the males have pliable spines of a deep crimson color along the backbone that seem to delight the female of the species .  combine these with a scaly  muscular tail and a brain by no means mediocre  and you have a spinyback or at least you have one if you can catch one .   it was just such a thought that occurred to olaf johnson as he sneaked down from the rocky eminence toward the herd of twenty five spinybacks grazing on the sparse  gritty undergrowth .  the nearest spinies looked up as olaf  bundled in fur and grotesque with attached oxygen nosepiece  approached .  however  spinies have no natural enemies  so they merely gazed at the figure with lanquidly disapproving eyes and returned to their crunchy but nourishing fare .   olaf   s notions on bagging big game were sketchy .  he fumbled in his pocket for a lump of sugar  held it out and said      here  pussy  pussy  pussy  pussy  pussy .      the ears of the nearest spinie twitched in annoyance .  olaf came closer and held out the sugar again .      come  bossy .  come .  bossy .      the spinie caught sight of the sugar and rolled his eyes at it .  his snout twitched as he spat out his last mouthful of vegetation and ambled over .  with neck stretched out  he sniffed .  then  using a rapid  expert motion  he struck at the outheld palm and hipped the lump into his mouth .  olaf   s other hand whistled down upon nothingness .   with a hurt expression  olaf held out another piece .     here .  prince .  here  fido .      the spinie made a low  tremulous sound deep in his throat .  it was a sound of pleasure .  evidently this strange monstrosity before him .  having gone insane  intended to feed him these bits of concentrated succulence forever .  he snatched and was back as quickly as the first time .  but .  since olaf had held on firmly this time  the spinie almost bagged half a finger as well .   olaf   s yell lacked a bit of the nonchalance necessary at such times .  nevertheless .  a bite that can be felt through thick gloves is a bite .   he advanced boldly upon the spinie .  there are some things that stir the johnson blood and bring up the ancient spirit of the vikings .  having one   s finger bitten  especially by an unearthly animal  is one of these .   there was an uncertain look in the spinie   s eyes as he backed slowly away .  there weren   t any white cubes being offered any more and he wasn   t quite sure what was going to happen now .  the uncertainty vanished with a suddenness he did not expect  when two glove muffled hands came down upon his ears and jerked .  he let out a high pitched yelp and charged forward .     a spinie has a certain sense of dignity .  he doesn   t like to have his ears pulled .  particularly when other spinies .  including several unattached females  have formed a ring and are looking on .   the earthman went over backward and remained in that position for awhile .  meantime  the spinie backed away a few feet in a gentlemanly manner and allowed johnson to get to his feet .   the old viking blood frothed still higher in olaf .  after rubbing the hurt spot where he had landed on his oxygen cylinder  he jumped  forgetting to allow for ganymedean gravity .  he sailed five feet over the spinie   s back .   there was awe in the animal   s eye as he watched olaf  for it was a stately jump .  but there was a certain amount of bewilderment as well .  there seemed to be no purpose to the maneuver .   olaf landed on his back again and got the cylinder in the same place .  he was beginning to feel a little embarrassed .  the sounds that came from the circle of onlookers were remarkably like snickers .      laugh .     he muttered bitterly .     i haven   t even begun to fight yet .      he approached the spinie slowly  cautiously .  he circled  watching for his opening .  so did the spinie .  olaf feinted and the spinie ducked .  then the spinie reared and olaf ducked .   olaf kept remembering new profanity all the time .  the husky    ur r r r r    that came out the spinie   s throat seemed to lack the brotherly spirit that is usually associated with christmas .   there was a sudden  swishing sound .  olaf felt something collide with his skull  just behind his left ear .  this time he turned a back somersault and landed on the nape of his neck .  there was a chorused whinny from the onlookers  and the spinie waved his tail triumphantly .   olaf got rid of the impression that he was floating through a star studded unlimited space and wavered to his feet .      listen     he objected     using your tail is a foul .      he leaped back as the tail shot forward again  then flung himself forward in a diving tackle .  he grabbed at the spinie   s feet and felt the animal come down on his back with an indignant yelp .   now it was a case of earth muscles against ganymedan muscles  and olaf became a man of brute strength .  he struggled up  and the spinie found himself slung over the stranger   s shoulders .   the spinie objected vociferously and tried to prove his objections by a judicious whip of the tail .  but he was in an inconvenient position and the stroke whistled harmlessly over olaf   s head .   the other spinies made way for the earthman with saddened expressions .  evidently they were all good friends of the captured animal and hated to see him lose a fight .  they returned to their meal in philosophic resignation  plainly convinced that it was kismet .   on the other side of the rocky ledge  olaf reached his prepared cave .  there was the briefest of scrambling sh   uggles before he managed to sit down hard on the spinie   s head and put enough knots into rope to hold him there .   a few hours later  when he had corralled his eighth spinyback  he possessed the technique that comes of long practice .  he could have given a terrestrial cowboy valuable pointers on throwing a maverick .  also  he could have given a terrestrial stevedore lessons in simple and compound swearing .      twas the night before christmas and all through the ganymedan dome there was deafening noise and bewildering excitement  like an exploding nova equipped for sound .  around the rusty sleigh  mounted on its huge platform of purplewood  five earthmen were staging a battle royal with a spinie .   the spinie had definite views about most things  and one of his stubbornest and most definite views was that he would never go where he didn   t want to go .  he made that clear by flailing one head  one tail  three spines and four legs in every possible direction  with all possible force .   but the earthmen insisted  and not gently .  despite loud  agonized squeaks  the spinie was lifted onto the platform  hauled into place and harnessed into hopeless helplessness .      okay .     peter benson yelled .     pass the bottle .      holding the spinie   s snout with one hand  benson waved the bottle under it with the other .  the spinie quivered eagerly and whined tremulously .  benson poured some of the liquid down the animal   s throat .  there was a gurgling swallow and an appreciative whinny .  the spinie   s neck stretched out for more .   benson sighed .     our best brandy  too .      he up ended the bottle and withdrew it half empty .  the spinie  eyes whirling in their sockets rapidly  did what seemed an attempt at a gay jig .  it didn   t last long  however  for ganymedan metabolism is almost immediately affected by alcohol .  his muscles locked in a drunken rigor and  with a loud hiccup  he went out on his feet .      drag out the next .     yelled benson .   in an hour the eight spinybacks were so many cataleptic statues .  forked sticks were tied around their heads as antlers .  the effect was crude and sketchy  but it would do .   as benson opened his mouth to ask where olaf johnson was  that worthy showed up in the arms of three comrades  and he was putting up as stiff a fight as any spinie .  his objections  however  were highly articulate .      i   m not going anywhere in this costume .     he roared  gouging at the nearest eye .     you hear me .      there certainly was cause for objection .  even at his best  olaf had never been a heart throb .  but in his present condition  he resembled a hybrid between a spinie   s nightmare and a picassian conception of a patriarch .   he wore the conventional costume of santa .  his clothes were as red as red tissue paper sewed onto his space coat could make it .  the    ermine    was as white as cotton wool  which it was .  his beard  more cotton wool glued into a linen foundation  hung loosely from his ears .  with that below and his oxygen nosepiece above  even the strongest were forced to avert their eyes .   olaf had not been shown a mirror .  but  between what he could see of himself and what his instinct told him  he would have greeted a good  bright lightning bolt like a brother .   by fits and starts  he was hauled to the sleigh .  others pitched in to help  until olaf was nothing but a smothered squirm and muffled voice .      leggo     he mumbled .     leggo and come at me one by one .  come on .      he tried to spar a bit  to point his dare .  but the multiple grips upon him left him unable to wriggle a finger .      get in .     ordered benson .      you go to hell .     gasped olaf .     i   m not getting into any patented short cut to suicide  and you can take your bloody flying sleigh and         listen     interrupted benson     commander pelham is waiting for you at the other end .  he   ll skin you alive if you don   t show up in half an hour .         commander pelham can take the sleigh sideways and         then think of your job .  think of a hundred and fifty a week .  think of every other year off with pay .  think of hilda  back on earth  who isn   t going to marry you without a job .  think of all that .        johnson thought  snarled .  he thought some more  got into the sleigh  strapped down his bag and turned on the gravo repulsors .  with a horrible curse  he opened the rear jet .   the sleigh dashed forward and he caught himself from going backward  over and out of the sleigh  by two thirds of a whisker .  he held onto the sides thereafter  watching the surrounding hills as they rose and fell with each lurch of the unsteady sleigh .   as the wind rose  the undulations grew more marked .  and when jupiter came up  its yellow light brought out every jag and crag of the rocky ground  toward everyone of which  in turn  the sleigh seemed headed .  and by the time the giant planet had shoved completely over the horizon  the curse of drink which departs from the ganymedan organism just as quickly as it descends began removing itself from the spinies .   the hindmost spinie came out of it first  tasted the inside of his mouth  winced and swore off drink .  having made that resolution  he took in his immediate surroundings languidly .  they made no immediate impression on him .  only gradually was the fact forced upon him that his footing  whatever it was  was not the usual stable one of solid ganymede .  it swayed and shifted  which seemed very unusual .   yet he might have attributed this unsteadiness to his recent orgy  had he not been so careless as to drop his glance over the railing to which he was anchored .  no spinie ever died of heart failure  as far as is recorded  but  looking downward  this one almost did .   his agonized screech of horror and despair brought the other spinies into full  if headachy  consciousness .  for a while there was a confused blur of squawking conversation as the animals tried to get the pain out of their heads and the facts in .  both aims were achieved and a stampede was organized .  it wasn   t much of a stampede  because the spinies were anchored tightly .  but  except for the fact that they got nowhere  they went through all the motions of a full gallop .  and the sleigh went crazy .   olaf grabbed his beard a second before it let go of his ears .      hey .     he shouted .   it was something like saying    tut  tut    to a hurricane .   the sleigh kicked  bucked and did a hysterical tango .  it made sudden spurts  as if inspired to dash its wooden brains out against ganymede   s crust .  meanwhile olaf prayed  swore  wept and jiggled all the compressed air jets at once .   ganymede whirled and jupiter was a wild blur .  perhaps it was the spectacle of jupiter doing the shimmy that steadied the spinies .  more likely it was the fact that they just didn   t give a hang any more .  whatever it was  they halted  made lofty farewell speeches to one another  confessed their sins and waited for death .   the sleigh steadied and olaf resumed his breathing once more .  only to stop again as he viewed the curious spectacle of hills and solid ground up above  and black sky and swollen jupiter down below .   it was at this point that he  too  made his peace with the eternal and awaited the end .        ossie    is short for ostrich  and that   s what native ganymedans look like  except that their necks are shorter  their heads are larger  and their feathers look as if they were about to fall out by the roots .  to this  add a pair of scrawny  feathered arms with three stubby fingers apiece .  they can speak english  but when you hear them  you wish they couldn   t  there were fifty of them in the low purplewood structure that was their    meeting hall .     on the mound of raised dirt in the front of the room dark with the smoky dimness of burning purplewood torches fetid to boot sat commander scott pelham and five of his men .  before them strutted the frowziest ossie of them all  inflating his huge chest with rhythmic  booming sounds .   he stopped for a moment and pointed to a ragged hole in the ceiling .      look .     he squawked .     chimney .  we make .  sannycaws come in .      pelham grunted approval .  the ossie clucked happily .  he pointed to the little sacks of woven grass that hung from the walls .      look .  stockies .  sannycaws put presets .         yeah     said pelham unenthusiastically .     chimney and stockings .  very nice .     he spoke out of the corner of his mouth to sim pierce  who sat next to him     another half hour in this dump will kill me .  when is that fool coming .      pierce stirred uneasily .      listen     he said     i   ve been doing some figuring .  we   re safe on everything but the karen leaves  and we   re still four tons short on that if we can get this fool business over with in the next hour  so we can start the next shift and work the ossies at double  we can make it    he leaned back    yes  i think we can make it        just about     replied pelham gloomily .     that   s if johnson gets here without pulling another bloomer .      the ossie was talking again  for ossies like to talk he said      every year kissmess comes .  kissmess nice  evvybody friendly .  ossie like kissmess .  you like kissmess .         yeah  fine     pelham snarled politely .     peace on ganymede  good will toward men especially johnson .  where the devil is that idiot  anyhow .        he fell into an annoyed fidget  while the ossie jumped up and down a few times in a thoughtful sort of manner  evidently for the exercise of it .  he continued the jumping  varying it with little hopping dance steps  till pelham   s fists began making strangling gestures .  only an excited squawk from the hole in the wall dignified by the term    window    kept pelham from committing ossie slaughter .   ossies swarmed about and the earthmen fought for a view .   against jupiter   s great yellowness was outlined a flying sleigh  complete with reindeers .  it was only a tiny thing  but there was no doubt about it .  santa claus was coming .   there was only one thing wrong with the picture .  the sleigh     reindeer    and all  while plunging ahead at a terrific speed  was flying upside down .   the ossies dissolved into squawking cacophony .     sannycaws .  sannycaws .  sannycaws .      they scrambled out the window like so many animated dust mops gone mad .  pelham and his men used the low door .   the sleigh was approaching  growing larger  lurching from side to side and vibrating like an off center flywheel .  olaf johnson was a tiny figure holding on desperately to the side of the sleigh with both hands .     pelham was shouting wildly  incoherently  choking on the thin atmosphere every time he forgot to breathe through his nose .  then he stopped and stared in horror .  the sleigh  almost life size now  was dipping down .  if it had been an arrow shot by william tell  it could not have aimed between pelham   s eyes more accurately .      everybody down .     he shrieked  and dropped .   the wind of the sleigh   s passage whistled keenly and brushed his face .  olaf   s voice could be heard for an instant  high pitched and indistinct .  compressed air spurted  leaving tracks of condensing water vapor .   pelham lay quivering  hugging ganymede   s frozen crust .  then  knees shaking like a hawaiian hula girl  he rose slowly .  the ossies who had scattered before the plunging vehicle had assembled again .  off in the distance  the sleigh was veering back .   pelham watched as it swayed and hovered  still rotating .  it lurched toward the dome  curved off to one side  turned back  and gathered speed .   inside that sleigh  olaf worked like a demon .  straddling his legs wide  he shifted his weight desperately .  sweating and cursing  trying hard not to look    downward    at jupiter  he urged the sleigh into wilder and wilder swings .  it was wobbling through an angle of     degrees now  and olaf felt his stomach raise strenuous objections .   holding his breath  he leaned hard with his right foot and felt the sleigh swing far over .  at the extremity of that swing  he released the gravo repulsor and  in ganymede   s weak gravity  the sleigh jerked downward .  naturally  since the vehicle was bottom heavy due to the metal gravo repulsor beneath  it righted itself as it fell .   but this was little comfort to commander pelham  who found himself once more in the direct path of the sleigh .      down .     he yelled  and dropped again .   the sleigh whi i ished overhead  came up against a huge boulder with a crack  bounced twenty five feet into the air  came down with a rush and a bang  and olaf fell over the railing and out .   santa claus had arrived .   with a deep  shuddering breath  olaf swung his bag over his shoulders  adjusted his beard and patted one of the silently suffering spinies on the head .  death might be coming in fact  olaf could hardly wait but he was going to die on his feet nobly  like a johnson .   inside the shack  into which the ossies had once more swarmed  a thump announced the arrival of santa   s bag on the roof  and a second thud the arrival of santa himself .  a ghastly face appeared through the makeshift hole in the ceiling .      merry christmas .     it croaked  and tumbled through .  olaf landed on his oxygen cylinders  as usual  and got them in the usual place .   the ossies jumped up and down like rubber balls with the itch .   olaf limped heavily toward the first stocking and deposited the garishly colored sphere he withdrew from his bag  one of the many that had originally been intended as a christmas tree ornament one by one he deposited the rest in every available stocking .   having completed his job  he dropped into an exhausted squat  from which position he watched subsequent proceedings with a glazed and fishy eye .  the jolliness and belly shaking good humor  traditionally characteristic of santa claus  were absent from this one with remarkable thoroughness .   the ossies made up for it by their wild ecstasy .  until olaf had deposited the last globe  they had kept their silence and their seats .  but when he had finished  the air heaved and writhed under the stresses of the discordant screeches that arose .  in half a second the hand of each ossie contained a globe .   they chattered among themselves furiously  handling the globes carefully and hugging them close to their chests .  then they compared one with another  flocking about to gaze at particularly good ones .     the frowziest ossie approached pelham and plucked at the commander   s sleeve .     sannycaws good     he cackled .     look  he leave eggs i    he stared reverently at his sphere and said     pittier   n ossie eggs .  must be sannycaws eggs  huh .      his skinny finger punched pelham in the stomach .      no .     yowled pelham vehemently .     hell  no .      but the ossie wasn   t listening .  he plunged the globe deep into the warmth of his feathers and said      pitty colors .  how long take for little sannycaws come out .  and what little sannycaws eat .     he looked up .     we take good care .  we teach little sannycaws  make him smart and full of brain like ossie .      pierce grabbed commander pelham   s arm .      don   t argue with them  .  .  he whispered frantically .     what do you care if they think those are santa claus eggs .  come on .  if we work like maniacs  we can still make the quota .  lets get started .         that   s right     pelham admitted .  he turned to the ossie .     tell everyone to get going .     he spoke clearly and loudly .     work now .  do you understand .  hurry  hurry  hurry .  come on .      he motioned with his arms .  but the frowzy ossie had come to a sudden halt .  he said slowly      we work  but johnson say kissmess come evvy year .  .  .      isn   t one christmas enough for you .     pelham rasped .      no .     squawked the ossie .     we want sannycaws next year .  get more eggs .  and next year more eggs .  and next year .  and next year  and next year .  more eggs .  more little sannycaws eggs .  if sannycaws not come  we not work .         that   s a long time off  .  .  said pelham .     we   ll talk about it then .  by that time i   ll either have gone completely crazy  or you   ll have forgotten all about it .  .  .   pierce opened his mouth  closed it  opened his mouth  closed it  opened it  and finally managed to speak .      commander  they want him to come every year .  .  .      i know .  they won   t remember by next year  though .  .  .      but you don   t get it .  a year to them is one ganymedan revolution around jupiter .  in earth time  that   s seven days and three hours .  they want santa claus to come every week .  .  .      every week .     pelham gulped .     johnson told them      for a moment everything turned sparkling somersaults before his eyes .  he choked  and automatically his eye sought olaf .   olaf turned cold to the marrow of his bones and rose to his feet apprehensively  sidling toward the door .  there he stopped as a sudden recollection of tradition hit him .  beard a dangle  he croaked      merry christmas to all  and to all a good night .      he made for the sleigh as if all the imps of hades were after him .  the imps weren   t  but commander scott pelham was .     the end    in january of       the month in which i attained my majority   i undertook something new a collaboration .     fred pohl  after all  was not merely an editor .  he was also a budding writer .  he has since come to be a giant in the field  but in those early days he was struggling along with only the sort of meager success i was having .  alone  and in collaboration with other futurians  he turned out stories under a variety of pseudonyms .  the one he used most frequently was    james maccreigh .      as it happened  he had written  under that pseudonym  a small fantasy called    the little man on the subway     which he apparently had hopes for but couldn   t get right .  he asked me if i would rewrite it  and the request flattered me .  besides  i was still trying to get into unknown  and if i couldn   t do it on my own  maybe i could do it by way of a collaboration .  i wasn   t proud at least as far as fantasy was concerned .   i took on the task and did it virtually at a sitting .  doing it easily didn   t help  however .  i submitted it to campbell for unknown on january           and he rejected it .  i had to hand it back to pohl .   pohl  however  with the true agent   s soul  never gave up  and in       long after i had utterly forgotten it  he managed to place it with a small magazine called fantasy book .       the little man on the subway    with james maccreigh     subway stations are places where people usually get out  so when no one left the first car at atlantic avenue station  conductor cullen of the i . r .  t .  began to get worried .  in fact  no one had left the first car from the time the run to flatbush had begun though dozens were getting on all the time .   odd .  very odd .  it was the kind of proposition that made well bred conductors remove their caps and scratch their heads .  conductor cullen did so .  it didn   t help  but he repeated the process at bergen street  the next station  where again the first car lost not one of its population .  and at grand army plaza  he added to the head scratching process a few rare old gaelic words that had passed down from father to son for hundreds of years .  they ionized the surrounding atmosphere  but otherwise did not affect the situation .   at eastern parkway  cullen tried an experiment .  he carefully refrained from opening the first car   s doors at all .  he leaned forward eagerly  twisted his head and watched and was treated to nothing short of a miracle .  the new york subway rider is neither shy  meek  nor modest  and doors that do not open immediately or sooner are helped on their way by sundry kicks .  but this time there was not a kick  not a shriek  not even a modified yell .  cullen   s eyes popped .   he was getting angry .  at franklin avenue  where he again contacted the express  he flung open the doors and swore at the crowd .  every door spouted commuters of both sexes and all ages  except that terrible first car .  at those doors  three men and a very young girl got on  though cullen could plainly see the slight bulging of the walls that the already super crowded condition of the car had caused .   for the rest of the trip to flatbush avenue  cullen ignored the first car completely  concentrating on that last stop where everyone would have to get off .  everyone .  president  church  and beverly road were visited and passed  and cullen found himself counting the stations to the flatbush terminus .   they seemed like such a nice bunch of passengers  too .  they read their newspapers  stared into the whirling blackness out the window  or at the girl   s legs across the way  or at nothing at all  quite like ordinary people .  only  they didn   t want to get out .  they didn   t even want to get into the next car  where empty seats filled the place .  imagine new yorkers resisting the impulse to pass from one car to the other  and missing the chance to leave the doors open for the benefit of the draft .   but it was flatbush avenue .  cullen rubbed his hands  slammed the doors open and yelled in his best unintelligible manner     lasstop .     he repeated it two or three times hoarsely and several in that damned first car looked up at him .  there was reproach in their eyes .  have you never heard of the mayor   s anti noise campaign  they seemed to say .   the last other passenger had come out of the train  and the scattered new ones were coming in .  there were a few curious looks at the jammed car  but not too many .  the new yorker considers everything he cannot understand a publicity stunt .   cullen fell back on his gaelic once more and dashed up the platform toward the motorman   s booth .  he needed moral assistance .  the motorman should have been out of his cab  preparing for his next trip  but he wasn   t .  cullen could see him through the glass of the door  leaning on the controls and staring vacantly at the bumper stop ahead .      gus .     cried cullen .     come out .  there   s a hell of      at that point  his tongue skidded to a halt  because it wasn   t gus .  it was a little old man  who smiled politely and twiddled his fingers in greeting .   patrick cullen   s irish soul rebelled .  with a yelp  he grabbed the edge of the door and tried to shove it open .  he should have known that wouldn   t work .  so  taking a deep breath and commending said irish soul to god  he made for the open door and ploughed into the mass of haunted humans in that first car .  momentum carried him six feet  and then there he stuck .  behind him  those he had knocked down picked themselves up from the laps of their fellow travelers  apologized with true new york courtesy  consisting of a growl  a grunt  and a grimace  and returned to their papers .   then  caught helplessly  he heard the dispatcher   s bell .  it was time for his own train to be on its way .  duty called .  with a superhuman effort  he inched towards the door  but it closed before he could get there  and the train commenced to move .   it occurred to cullen that he had missed a report for the first time  and he said     damn .     after the train had travelled some fifty feet  it came to him that they were going the wrong way  and this time he said nothing .   after all  what was there to say even in the purest of gaelic .   how could a train go the wrong way at flatbush ave .  there were no further tracks .  there was no further tunnel .  there was a bumper stop to prevent eccentric motormen from trying to bore one .  it was absurd .  even the big deal couldn   t do it .   but there they were .   there were stations in this new tunnel  too  cute little small ones just large enough for one car .  but that was all right  because only one car was travelling .  the rest had somehow become detached  presumably to make the routine trip to bronx park .   there were maybe a dozen stations on the line with curious names .  cullen noticed only a few  because he found it difficult to keep his eyes from going out of focus .  one was archangel boulevard  another seraph road  still another cherub plaza .   and then  the train slid into a monster station  that looked uncommonly like a cave  and stopped .  it was huge  about three hundred feet deep  and almost spherical .  the tracks ran to the exact center  without trusses  and the platform at its side likewise rested comfortably upon air .   the conductor was the only person left in the car  the rest having mostly gotten off at hosannah square .  he hung limply from the porcelain hand grip  staring fixedly at a lip stick advertisement .  the door of the motonnan   s cabin opened and the little man came out .  he glanced at cullen  turned away  then whirled back .      hey     he said     who are you .      cullen rotated slowly  still clutching the hand grip .     only the conductor .  don   t mind me .  i   m quitting anyway .  i don   t like the work .         oh  dear  dear  this is unexpected .     the little man waggled his head and tch tched .     i   m mr .  crumley     he explained .     i steal things .  people mostly .  sometimes subway cars  but they   re such big  clumsy things  don   t you think .         mister     groaned cullen .     i quit thinking two hours ago .  it didn   t get me anywhere .  who are you  anyway .         i told you i   m mr .  crumley .  i   m practicing to be a god .         a gob .     said cullen .     you mean a sailor .         dear  no     frowned mr .  crumley .     i said     god     as in jehovah .  look .     he pointed out the window to the wall of the cave .  where his finger pointed  the rock billowed and rose .  he moved his finger and there was a neat ridge of rock describing a reversed  lower case    h .         that   s my symbol     said crumley modestly .     mystic  isn   t it .  but that   s nothing .  wait till i really get things organized .  dear  dear  will i give them miracles .      cullen   s head swivelled between the raised rock symbol and the simpering mr .  crumley  until he began to get dizzy  and then he stopped .      listen     he demanded hoarsely .     how did you get that car out of flatbush avenue .  where did that tunnel come from .  are some of them foreigners         oh  my  no .     answered mr .  crumley .     i made that myself and willed it so that no one would notice .  it was quite difficult .  it just wears the ectoplasm right out of me .  miracles with people mixed up in it are much harder than the other kind  because you have to fight their wills .  unless you have lots of believers  you can   t do it .  now that i   ve got over a hundred thousand  i can do it  but there was a time     he shook his head reminiscently     when i couldn   t even have levitated a baby or healed a leper .  oh  well  we   re wasting time .  we ought to be at the nearest factory .      cullen brightened .     factory    was more prosaic .     i once had a brother     he said     who worked in a sweater factory  but         oh  goodness  mr .  cullen .  i   m referring to my believers    factories .  i have to educate people to believe in me  don   t i  and preaching is such slow work .  i believe in mass production .  some day i intend to be called the henry ford of utopia .  why  i   ve got twelve factories in brooklyn alone and when i manufacture enough believers  i   ll just cover the world with them .      he sighed     gracious me  if i only had enough believers .  i   ve got to have a million before i can let things progress by themselves and until then i have to attend to every little detail myself .  it is so boring .  i even have to keep reminding my believers who i am even the disciples .  incidentally  cullen  i read your mind  by the way  so that   s how i know your name you want to be a believer  of course .         well  now     said cullen nervously .      oh  come now .  some gods would have been angry at your intrusion and done away with you     he snapped his fingers     like that .  not i  though  because i think killing people is messy and inconsiderate .  just the same  you   ll have to be a believer .      now patrick cullen was an intelligent irishman .  that is to say  he admitted the existence of banshees  leprechauns  and the little folk  and kept an open mind on poltergeists  werewolves  vampires and such like foreign trash .  at mere supernaturalities  he was too well educated to sneer .  still  cullen did not intend to compromise his religion .  his theology was weak  but for a mortal to claim godship smacked of heresy  not to say sacrilege and blasphemy  even to him .      you   re a faker     he cried boldly     and you   re headed straight for hell the way you   re going .      mr .  crumley clicked his tongue     what terrible language you use .  and so unnecessary .  of course you believe in me .         oh  yeah .         well  then  if you are stubborn  i   ll pass a minor miracle .  its inconvenient  but now     he made vague motions with his left hand     you believe in me .         certainly     said cullen  hurt .     i always did .  how do i go about worshipping you .  i want to do this properly .         just believe in me  and that   s enough .  now you must go to the factories and then we   ll send you back home they   ll never know you were gone and you can live your life like a believer .      the conductor smiled ecstatically     oh  happy life .  i want to go to the factories .         of course you would     replied mr .  crumley .     you   d be a fine crumleyite otherwise  wouldn   t you .  come .     he pointed at the door of the car  and the door slid open .  they walked out and crumley kept on pointing .  rock faded away in front  and bit down again behind .  through the wall cullen walked  following that little figure who was his god .   that was a god  thought cullen .  any god that could do that was one hell of a damn good god to believe in .   and then he was at the factory in another cave  only smaller .  mr .  crumley seemed to like caves .   cullen didn   t pay much attention to his surroundings .  he couldn   t see much anyway on account of the faint violet mist that blurred his vision .  he got the impression of a slowly moving conveyor belt  with men stationed at intervals along it .  disciples  he thought .  and the parts being machined on that belt were probably non believers  or such low trash .   there was a man watching him  smiling .  a disciple  cullen thought  and quite naturally made the sign to him .  he had never made it before  but it was easy .  the disciple replied in kind .      he told me you were coming     said the disciple .     he made a special miracle for you  he said .  that   s quite a distinction .  do you want me to show you around the belt .         you bet .         well  this is factory one .  it   s the nerve center of all the factories of the country .  the others give preliminary treatment only  and make only believers .  we make disciples .      oh  boy  disciples .     am i going to be a discipler asked cullen eagerly .      after being miraculated by him .  of course .  you   re a somebody  you know .  there are only five other people he ever took personal charge of .      this was a glorious way to do things .  everything mr .  crumley did was glorious .  what a god .  what a god .      you started that way  too .         certainly     said the disciple  placidly     i   m an important fellow  too .  only i wish i were more important  even .         what for .     said cullen  in a shocked tone of voice .      are you murmuring against the dictates of mr .  crumley .   may he prosper  . this is sacrilege .      the disciple shifted uncomfortably     well  i   ve got ideas  and i   d like to try them out .         you   ve got ideas  huh .     muttered cullen balefully .     does mr .  crumley  may he live forever  know .         well frankly  no .  but just the same     the disciple looked over each shoulder carefully and drew closer     i   m not the only one .  there are lots of us that think mr .  crumley  on whom be blessings  is just a trifle old fashioned .  for instance  take the lights in this place .      cullen stared upwards .  the lights were the same type as those in the terminal cave .  they might have been stolen from any line of the irt subway .  perfect copies of the stop and go signals and the exit markers .      what   s wrong .     he asked .   the disciple sneered     they lack originality .  you   d think a grade a god would do something new .  when he takes people  he does it through the subway  and he obeys subway rules .  he waits for the dispatcher to tell him to go  he stops at every station  he uses crude electricity and so on .  what we need     the disciple was waving his hands wildly and shouting     is more enterprise  more git and go .  we   ve got to speed up things and run them with efficiency and vim .      cullen stared hotly     you are a heretic     he accused .     you are doomed to damnation .     he looked angrily about for a bell  whistle  gong  or drum wherewith to summon the great crumley  but found nothing .   the other blinked in quick thought .     say     he said  bluffly     look at what time it is .  i   m behind schedule .  you better get on the belt for your first treatment .      cullen was hot about the slovenly assistance mr .  crumley was getting from this inferior disciple  but a treatment is a treatment  so making the sign devoutly  he got on .  he found it fairly comfortable despite its jerky motion .  the disciple motioned to cullen   s first preceptor another disciple standing beside a sort of blackboard .  cullen had watched others while discussing crumley and he had noticed the question and answer procedure that had taken place .  he had noticed it particularly .   consequently  he was surprised  when the second disciple  instead of using his heavy pointer to indicate a question on the board  reversed it and brought it down upon his head .   the lights went out .     when he came to  he was under the belt  at the very bottom of the cave .  he was tied up  and the rebellious disciple and three others were talking about him .      he couldn   t be persuaded     the disciple was saying .     crumley must have given him a double treatment or something .         it   s the last double treatment crumley   ll ever give     said the fat little man .      let   s hope so .  how   s it coming .         very well .  very well  indeed .  we teleported ourselves to section four about two hours ago .  it was a perfect miracle .      the disciple was pleased .     fine .  how   re they doing at four .      the fat little man clucked his lips .  cow ell  now  not so hot .  for some reason  they   re getting odd effects over there .  miracles are just happening .  even ordinary crumleyites can pass them  and sometimes they just happen .  it   s extremely annoying .         hmm  that   s bad .  if there are too many hitches  crumley   ll get suspicious .  ti he investigates there first  he can reconvert all of them in a jiffy  before he comes here and then without their support we might not be strong enough to stand up against him .         say  now     said the fat man apprehensively     we   re not strong enough now  you mow .  none of this going off half cocked .         we   re strong enough     pointed out the disciple stiffly     to weaken him long enough to get us a new god started  and after that      a new god  eh .     said another .  he nodded wisely .      sure     said the disciple .      a new god  created by us  can be destroyed by us .  he   d be completely under our thumb and then instead of this one man tyranny  we can have a sort of er council .      there were general grins and everyone looked pleased .      but we   ll discuss that further some other time     continued the disciple briskly .     let   s believe just a bit .  crumley isn   t stupid  you mow  and we don   t want him to observe any slackening .  come on  now .  all together .      they closed their eyes  concentrated a bit  and then opened them with a sigh .      well     said the little  fat man     that   s over .  i   d better be getting back now .      from under the belt  cullen watched him .  he looked singularly like a chicken about to take off for a tree as he flexed his knees and stared upwards .  then he added to the resemblance not a little when he spread his arms  gave a little hop and fluttered away .   cullen could follow his flight only by watching the eyes of the three remaining .  those eyes turned up and up  following the fat man to the very top of the cave  it seemed .  there was an air of self satisfaction about those eyes .  they were very happy over their miracles .   then they all went away and left cullen to his holy indignation .  he was shocked to the very core of his being at this sinful rebellion  this apostasy this this there weren   t any words for it  even when he tried gaelic .   imagine trying to create a god that would be under the thumbs of the creators .  it was anthropomorphic heresy  where had he heard that word  now .   and struck at the roots of all religion .  was he going to lie there and watch anything strike at the roots of all religion .  was he going to submit to having mi .  crumley  may he swim through seas of ecstasy  deposed .   never .   but the ropes thought otherwise  so there he stayed .   and then there was an interruption in his thoughts .  there came a low  booming sound a sound which would have been a voice if it had not been pitched so incredibly low .  there was a menace to it that got immediate attention .  it got attention from cullen  who quivered in his bonds  from the others in the cave  who quivered even harder  not being restrained by ropes  from the belt itself  which stopped dead with a jerk  and quivered mightily .   the rebellious disciple dropped to his knees and quivered more than any of them .   the voice came again  this time in a recognizable language     where is that bum  crumley .     it roared .   there was no wait for an answer .  a cloud of shadow gathered in the center of the hall and spat a black bolt at the belt .  a spot of fire leaped out from where the bolt had touched and spread slowly outward .  where it passed  the belt ceased to exit .  it was far from cullen  but there were humans nearer  and among those scurrying pandemonium existed .   cullen wanted very much to join the flight  but unfortunately the disciple who had trussed him up had evidently been a boy scout .  jerking  twisting  and writhing had no effect upon the stubborn ropes  so he fell back upon gaelic and wishing .  he wished he were flee .  he wished he weren   t tied .  he wished he were far away from that devouring flame .  he wished lots of things  some unprintable  but mainly those .   and with that he felt a gentle slipping pressure and down at his feet was an untidy pile of hempen fibre .  evidently the forces liberated by the rebellion were getting out of control here as well as in section four .  what had the little fat man said .     miracles are just happening .  even ordinary crumleyites can pass them  and sometimes they just happen .      but why waste time .  he ran to the rock wall and howled a wish at it to dissolve into nothing .  he howled several times with gaelic modifications  but the wall didn   t even slightly soften .  he stared wildly and then saw the hole .  it was on the side of the cave  diametrically across from cullen   s position at the bottom of the hall  and about three loops of the belt up .  the upward spiral passed just below it .   somehow he made the leap that grabbed the lower lip of the spiral  wriggled his way onto it and jumped into a run .  the fire of disintegration was behind him and plenty far away  but it was making time .  up the belt to the third loop he ran  not taking time to be dizzy from the circular trip .  but when he got there  the hole  large  black and inviting  was just the tiniest bit higher than he could jump .   he leaned against the wall panting .  the spot of fire was now two spots  crawling both ways from a twenty foot break in the belt .  everyone in the cavern  some two hundred people  was in motion  and everyone made some sort of noise .   somehow  the sight stimulated him .  it nerved him to further efforts to get into the hole .  wildly  he tried walking up the sheer wall  but this didn   t work .   and then mr .  crumley stuck his head out of the hole and said     oh  mercy me  what a perfectly terrible mess .  dear  dear .  come up here  cullen .  why do you stay down there .      a great peace descended upon cullen .     hail  mr .  crumley     he cried .     may you sniff the essence of roses forever .      mr .  crumley looked pleased     thank you  cullen .     he waved his hand  and the conductor was beside him a simple matter of levitation .  once again  cullen decided in his inmost soul that here was a god .      and now     said mr .  crumley     we must hurry  hurry  hurry .  i   ve lost most of my power when the disciples rebelled  and my subway car is stuck half way .  i   ll need your help .  hurry .      cullen had no time to admire the tiny subway at the end of the tunnel .  he jumped off the platform on crumley   s heels and dashed about a hundred feet down the tube to where the car was standing idle .  he wafted into the open front door with the grace of a chorusboy .  mr .  crumley took care of that .      cullen     said mr .  crumley     start this thing and take it back to the regular line .  and be careful  he is waiting for me .         who .         he  the new god .  imagine those fools no  idiots thinking they could create a controllable god  when the very essence of godship is uncontrollability .  of course  when they made a god to destroy me  they made a destroyer  and he   ll just destroy everything in sight that i created  including my disciples .      cullen worked quickly .  he knew how to start car        any conductor would .  he raced to the other end of the car for the control lever  snatched it off  and returned at top speed .  that was all he needed .  there was power in the rail  the lights were on  and there were no stop signals between him and god   s country .   mr .  crumley lay himself down on a seat     be very quiet .  he may let you get past him .  i   m going to blank myself out  and maybe he won   t notice me .  at any rate  he won   t harm you i hope .  dear  dear  since this all started in section four  things are such a mess .      eight stations passed before anything happened and then came utopia circle station and well  nothing really happened .  it was just an impression an impression of people all around him for a few seconds watching him closely with a virulent hostility .  it wasn   t exactly people  but a person .  it wasn   t exactly a person either  but just a huge eye  watching watching watching .   but it passed  and almost immediately cullen saw a black and white    flatbush avenue    sign at the side of the tunnel .  he jammed on his brakes in a hurry  for there was a train waiting there .  but the controls didn   t work the way they should have  and the car edged up until it was in contact with the cars before .  with a soft click  it coupled and       was just the last car of the train .   it was mr .  crumley   s work  of course .  mr .  crumley stood behind him  watching .     he didn   t get you  did he .  no i see he didn   t .         is there any more danger .     asked cullen  anxiously .      i don   t think so     responded mr .  crumley sadly .     after he has destroyed all my creation  there will be nothing left for him to destroy  and  deprived of a function  he will simply cease to exist .  that   s the result of this nasty  slipshod work .  i   m disgusted with human beings .         don   t say that      said cullen .      i will     reported mr .  crumley savagely     human beings aren   t fit to be god of .  they   re too much trouble and worry .  it would give any self respecting god grey hairs and i suppose you think a god looks very dignified all grey .  darn all humans .  they can get along without me .  from now on  i   m going to go to africa and try the chimpanzees .  i   ll bet they make much better material .         but wait      wailed cullen .     what about me .  i believe in you .         oh  dear  that would never do .  here .  return to normal .      mr .  crumley   s hand caressed the air  and cullen  once more a god fearing irishman  let loose a roar in the purest gaelic and made for him .      why  you blaspheming spalpeen      but there was no mr .  crumley .  there was only the dispatcher  asking very impolitely in english what the blankety blank hell was the matter with him .     the end    i am sorry to say that i have no clear memory  at this time  what parts of the story are mine and what parts are pohl   s .  going over it  i can say     this part sounds like me  this part doesn   t     but whether i   d be right or not i couldn   t swear .     fantasy book was a very borderline publication that lasted only eight issues .     the little man on the subway    was in the sixth .   an amusing fact about this issue of a small magazine that had to make do with what it could find among the rejects of the field was that it included    scanners live in vain  .  .  by cordwainer smith .  this was smith   s first published story and he was not to publish another for eight years or so .  in the     s  smith  a pseudonym for a man whose real identity was not made clear until after his death  became a writer of considerable importance  and this first story of his became a classic .     while working on    the little man on the subway    i was also doing another    positronic robot    story  called    liar .     in this one  my character susan calvin first appeared  she has been a character in ten of my stories up to the present time and i don   t eliminate the possibility that she will appear yet again  .   it was while campbell and i were discussing this story  by the way  on december           that the    three laws of robotics    were worked out in full .   i say it was campbell who worked them out and he says it was i but i know i   m right .  it was he .       liar .     was accepted at once by campbell  at the end of january  without revision  and appeared in the may      issue of astounding .  it was my fourth appearance in that magazine .  the fact that it appeared the month after    reason    helped fix the    positronic robot    stories in the readers    minds as a    series .  .  .     liar .     eventually appeared in i  robot .   the sale of two    positronic robot    stories     reason    and    liar .     virtually back to back put me all on fire to do more of the same .  when i suggested still another story of the sort to campbell on february          he approved  but he said he didn   t want me  this early in the game  tying myself down too completely into a rigid formula .  he suggested i do other kinds of stories first .  i was a good boy  i obeyed .   on that very day  in fact  i decided to try fantasy again .  i wrote a short one        words  called    masks     and heaven only knows what it was about  for i don   t .  i submitted it to campbell for unknown on february     and he rejected it .  it is gone  it no longer exists .   later that month i also wrote a short story called    the hazing     intended for pohl .  i submitted it to him on february     and he rejected it at once .  eventually i submitted it to thrilling wonder stories .  they requested a revision  i obliged  and they accepted it on july          .       the hazing     the campus of arcturus university  on arcturus   s second planet  eron  is a dull place during mid year vacations and  moreover  a hot one  so that myron tubal  sophomore  found life boring and uncomfortable .  for the fifth time that day  he looked in at the undergraduate lounge in a desperate attempt at locating an acquaintance  and was at last gratified to behold bill sefan  a green skinned youngster from vega   s fifth planet .   sefan  like tubal  had flunked biosociology and was staying through vacation to study for a make up exam .  things like that weave strong bonds between sophomore and sophomore .   tubal grunted a greeting  dropped his huge hairless body he was a native of the arcturian system itself into the largest chair and said      have you seen the new freshmen yet .         already .  it   s six weeks before the fall semester starts .      tubal yawned .     these are a special breed of frosh .  they   re the very first batch from the solarian system ten of them .         solarian system .  you mean that new system that joined the galactic federation three four years ago .         that   s the one .  their world capital is called earth  i think .         well  what about them .         nothing much .  they   re just here  that   s all .  some of them have hair on the upper lip  and very silly it looks  too .  otherwise  they look like any of a dozen or so other breeds of humanoids .      it was at this point that the door flew open and little wri forase ran in .  he was from deneb   s single planet  and the short  gray fuzz that covered his head and face bristled with agitation  while his large purple eyes gleamed excitedly .      say     he twittered breathlessly     have you seen the earthmen .      sefan sighed .     isn   t anyone ever going to change the subject .  tubal was just telling me about them .         he was .     forase seemed disappointed .     but but did he tell you these were that abnormal race they made such a fuss over when the solarian system entered the federation .         they looked all right to me     said tubal .      i   m not talking about them from the physical standpoint     said the denebian disgustedly .     it   s the mental aspect of the case .  psychology .  that   s the stuff .     forase was going to be a psychologist some day .      oh  that .  well  what   s wrong with them .         their mob psychology as a race is all wrong     babbled forase .     instead of becoming less emotional with numbers  as is the case with every other type of humanoid known  they become more emotional .  in groups  these earthmen riot  panic  go crazy .  the more there are  the worse it is .  so help me  we even invented a new mathematical notation to handle the problem .  look .      he had his pocket pad and stylus out in one rapid motion  but tubal   s hand clamped down upon them before the stylus so much as made a mark .   tubal said     whoa .  i   ve got a walloping lulu of an idea .         imagine .     murmured sefan .   tubal ignored him .  he smiled again  and his hand rubbed thoughtfully over his bald dome .      listen     he said  with sudden briskness .  his voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper .     albert williams  late of earth  stirred in his sleep and became conscious of a prodding finger exploring the space between his second and third ribs .  he opened his eyes  swiveled his head  stared stupidly  then gasped  shot upright  and reached for the light switch .      don   t move     said the shadowy figure beside his bed .  there was a muted click  and the earthman found himself centered in the pearly beam of a pocket hash .   he blinked and said     who the blasted devil are you .         you are going to get out of bed     replied the apparition stolidly .     dress  and come with me .      williams grinned savagely .     try and make me .      there was no answer  but the hash beam shifted slightly and fell upon the shadow   s other hand .  it held a    neuronic whip     that pleasant little weapon that paralyzes the vocal cords and twists nerves into so many knots of agony .  williams swallowed hard  and got out of bed .   he dressed in silence  and then said      all right  what do i do now .      the gleaming    whip    gestured  and the earthman moved toward the door .      just walk ahead     said the unknown .   williams moved out of the room  along the silent corridor  and down eight stories without daring to look back .  out upon the campus he stopped  and felt metal probe the small of his back .      do you know where obel hall is .      williams  nodding  began walking .  he walked past obel hall  turned right at university avenue  and after half a mile stepped off the roads and past the trees .  a spaceship hulked dimly in the darkness  with ports closely curtained and only a dim light showing where the airlock opened a crack .      get in .     he was shoved up a flight of stairs and into a small room .   he blinked  looked about him and counted aloud .       seven  eight  nine  and i make ten .  they   ve got us all  i guess .         it   s no guess     growled eric chamberlain sourly .     it   s a certainty .      he was rubbing his hand .     i   ve been here an hour .         what   s wrong with the mitt .     asked williams .      i sprained it on the jaw of the rat that brought me here .  he   s as tough as a spaceship   s hull .      williams seated himself cross legged upon the floor and rested his head against the wall .      has anyone any idea as to what this is all about .         kidnaping .     said little joey sweeney .  his teeth were chattering .      what the devil for .     snorted chamberlain .     if any of us are millionaires  i hadn   t heard of it .  i know i   m not .      williams said     look  let   s not go off the deep end .  kidnaping or anything of that sort is .  out .  these people can   t be criminals .  it stands to reason that a civilization that has developed psychology to the extent this galactic federation has  would be able to wipe out crime without raising a sweat .         pirates     grunted lawrence marsh .     i don   t think so  but it   s just a suggestion .         nuts .     said williams .     piracy is a frontier phenomenon .  this region of space has been civilized for tens of millennia .         just the same  they had guns     insisted joe     and i don   t like it .     he had left his glasses in his room and peered about in near sighted anxiety .      that doesn   t mean much     answered williams .     now  i   ve been thinking .  here we are ten newly arrived freshmen at arcturus u .  on our first night here  we   re bundled mysteriously out of our rooms and into a strange spaceship .  that suggests something to me .  how about it .        sidney morton raised his head from his arms long enough to say sleepily      i   ve thought of it  too .  it looks like we   re in for one hell of a hazing .  gents  i think the local sophs are just having good  clean fun .         exactly     agreed williams .     anyone have any other ideas .      silence .      all right  then  so there isn   t anything to do but wait .  personally  i   ve going to catch up on my sleep .  they can wake me up if they need me .      there was a jar at that moment and he fell off balance .     well  we   re off wherever we   re going .      moments later  bill sefan hesitated just an instant before entering the control room .  when he finally did  it was to face a highly excited wri forase .      how is it working .     demanded the denebian .      rotten     responded sefan sourly .     if they   re panicked  then i   ve damned .  they   re going to sleep .         asleep .  all of them .  but what were they saying .         how do i know .  they weren   t speaking galactic  and i can   t make head or tail out of their infernal foreign gibberish .      forase threw his hands into the air in disgust .   tubal spoke finally .     listen  forase  i   m cutting a class in biosoc .  which i can   t afford .  you guaranteed the psychology of this stunt .  if it turns out to be a flop  i   m not going to like it .         well  for the love of deneb     grated forase desperately     you two are a fine pair of yellow bellies .  did you expect them to start screaming and kicking right off .  sizzling arcturus i wait till we get to the spican system  will you .  when we maroon them overnight      he tittered suddenly .     this is going to be the fanciest trick since they tied those stink bats to the chromatic organ on concert night .      tubal cracked a grin  but sefan leaned back in his chair and remarked thoughtfully .      what if someone say  president wynn hears about this .      the arcturian at the controls shrugged .     it   s only a hazing .  they   ll    go easy .      don   t play dumb  m .  t .  this isn   t kid stuff .  planet four  spica the whole spican system  in fact is banned to galactic ships  and you know that .  it   s got a sub humanoid race on it .  they   re supposed to develop entirely free of interference until they discover interstellar travel on their own .  that   s the law  and they   re strict about it .  space .  if they find out about this  we   ll be in the soup for fair .      tubal turned in his seat .     how in arcturus do you expect prexy wynn damn his thick hide .  to find out about us .  now  mind you  i   m not saying the story won   t spread around the campus  because half the fun will be killed if we have to keep it to ourselves .  but how will names come out .  no one will squeal .  you know that .         okay     said sefan  and shrugged .   and then tubal said     ready for hyper space .      he compressed keys and there was the queer internal wrench that marked the ship   s departure from normal space .     the ten earthmen were rather the worse for wear  and looked it .  lawrence marsh squinted at his watch again .      two thirty     he said .     that   s thirty six hours now .  i wish they   d get this over with .         this isn   t a hazing     moaned sweeney .     it takes too long .      williams grew red .     what do you all look half dead about .  they   ve been feeding us regularly  haven   t they .  they haven   t tied us up  have they .  i should say it was pretty evident that they were taking good care of us .         or     came sidney morton   s discontented drawl     fattening us up for the slaughter .      he paused  and everyone stiffened .  there was no mistaking the queer internal wrench they had felt .      get that .     said eric chamberlain in sudden frenzy .     we   re back in normal space again  and that means we   re only an hour or two from wherever we   re going .  we   ve got to do something .         hear  hear     williams snorted .     but what .         there are ten of us  aren   t there .     shouted chamberlain  puffing out his chest .     well  i   ve only seen one of them so far .  next time he comes in  and we   ve got another meal due us pretty soon  we   re going to mob him .      sweeney looked sick .     what about the neuronic whip he always carries .         it won   t kill us .  he can   t get us all before we pin him down  anyway .         eric     said williams bluntly     you   re a fool .      chamberlain flushed and his stub fingered fists closed slowly .      i   m just in the mood for a little practice persuasion .  call me that again  will you .         sit down .     williams scarcely bothered to look up .      and don   t work so hard justifying my epithet .  all of us are nervous and keyed up  but that doesn   t mean we ought to go altogether crazy .  not yet  anyway .  first of all  even discounting the whip  mobbing our jailer won   t be particularly successful .      we   ve only seen one  but that one is from the arcturian system .  he   s better than seven feet tall  and comfortably past the three hundred pound mark .  he   d mop us up all ten of us with his bare fists .  i thought you had one run in with him already  eric .      there was a thickish silence .   williams added      and even if we could knock him out and finish as many others as there may be in the ship  we still haven   t the slightest idea where we are or how to get back or even how to run the ship .     a pause .  then     well .         nuts .     chamberlain turned away  and glowered in silence .   the door kicked open and the giant arcturian entered .  with one hand  he emptied the bag he carried  and with the other kept his neuronic whip carefully leveled .      last meal     he grunted .   there was a general scramble for the rolling cans  still lukewarm from recent heating .  morton glared at his with disgust .      say     he spoke stumblingly in galactic     can   t you give us a change .  i   m tired of this rotten goulash of yours .  this is the fourth can .         so what .  it   s your last meal     the arcturian snapped  and left .   a horrified paralysis prevailed .      what did he mean by that .     gulped someone huskily .      they   re going to kill us .     sweeney was round eyed  the thin edge of panic in his voice .   williams    mouth was dry and he felt unreasoning anger grow against sweeney   s contagious fright .  he paused the kid was only seventeen and said huskily     stow it  will you .  let   s eat .      it was two hours later that he felt the shuddering jar that meant the landing and end of the journey .  in that time  no one had spoken  but williams could feel the pall of fear choke tighter with the minutes .     spica had dipped crimsonly below the horizon and there was a chill wind blowing .  the ten earthmen  huddled together miserably upon the rock strewn hilltop  watched their captors sullenly .  it was the huge arcturian  myron tubal  that did the talking  while the green skinned vegan  bill sefan  and the fuzzy little denebian  wri forase  remained placidly in the background .      you   ve got your fire     said the arcturian gruffly     and there   s plenty of wood about to keep it going .  that will keep the beasts away .  we   ll leave you a pair of whips before we go  and those will do as protection  if any of the aborigines of the planet bother you .  you will have to use your own wits as far as food  water and shelter are concerned .      he turned away .  chamberlain let loose with a sudden roar  and leaped after the departing arcturian .  he was sent reeling back with an effortless heave of the other   s arm .   the lock closed after the three other world men .  almost at once  the ship lifted off the ground and shot upward .  williams finally broke the chilled silence .      they   ve left the whips .  i   ll take one and you can have the other  eric .      one by one  the earthmen dropped into a sitting position  back to the fire  frightened  half panicky .   williams forced a grin .     there   s plenty of game about the region is well wooded .  come on  now  there are ten of us and they   ve got to come back sometime .  let   s show them we earthmen can take it .  how about it  fellows .      he was talking aimlessly now .  morton said listlessly .      why don   t you shut up .  you   re not making this any easier .      williams gave up .  the pit of his own stomach was turning cold .   the twilight blackened into night  and the circle of light about the fire contracted into a little flickering area that ended in shadows .  marsh gasped suddenly  and his eyes went wide .      there   s some something coming .      the stir that followed froze itself into attitudes of breathless attention .      you   re crazy     began williams huskily and stopped dead at the unmistakable  slithering sound that reached his ears .      grab your whip .     he screamed to chamberlain .   joey sweeney laughed suddenly a strained  high pitched laugh .   and then there was a sudden shrieking in the air  and the shades charged down upon them .   things were happening elsewhere  too .   tubal   s ship lazed outward from spica   s fourth planet  with bin sefan at the controls .  tubal himself was in his own cramped quarters  polishing off a huge flagon of denebian liquor in two gulps .   wri forase watched the operation sadly .      it cost twenty credits a bottle     he said     and i only have a few left .         well  don   t let me hog it     said tubal magnanimously     match me bottle for bottle .  it   s all right with me .         one swig like that     grumbled the denebian     and r d be out till the fall exams      tubal paid scant attention .     this     he began     is going to make campus history as the hazing stunt      and at this point  there was a sharp  singing pinging ping g g g  scarcely muffled by intervening walls  and the lights went out .   wri forase felt himself pressed hard against the wall .  he struggled for breath and stuttered out in gasps .      b by space  we   re at f full acceleration .  what   s wr rong with the equalizer .         damn the equalizer .     roared tubal  heaving to his feet .     what   s wrong with the ship .        he stumbled out the door  into the equally dark corridor  with forase crawling after him .  when they burst into the control room  they found sefan surrounded by the dim emergency lights  his green skin shining with perspiration .      meteor     he croaked .     it played hob with our power distributors .  it   s all going into acceleration .  the lights  heating units and radio are all out of commission  while the ventilators are just barely limping .     he added     and section four is punctured      tubal gazed about him wildly .     idiot .  why didn   t you keep your eye on the mass indicator .         i did  you overgrown lump of putty     howled sefan     but it never registered .  it never registered .  isn   t that just what you   d expect from a second hand jalopy  rented for two hundred credits .  it went through the screen as if it were empty ether .         shut up .     tubal flung open the suit compartments and groaned .     they   re all arcturian models .  i should have checked up .  can you handle one of these  sefan .         maybe .     the vegan scratched a doubtful ear .   in five minutes  tubal swung into the lock and sefan  stumbling awkwardly  followed after .  it was half an hour before they returned .   tubal removed his head piece .     curtains .      wri forase gasped .     you mean we   re through .      the arcturian shook his head .     we can fix it  but it will take time .  the radio is ruined for good  so we can   t get help .         get help .     forase looked shocked .     that   s all we need .  how would we explain being inside the spican system .  we might as well commit suicide as send out radio calls .  as long as we can get back without help  we   re safe .  missing a few more classes won   t hurt us too much .      sefan   s voice broke in dully .     but what about those panicky earthmen back on spica four .      forase   s mouth opened  but he didn   t say a word .  it closed again  and if ever a humanoid looked sick  forase was that humanoid .   that was only the beginning .   it took a day and a half to unscramble the space jalopy   s power lines .  it took two more days to decelerate to safe turning point .  it took four days to return to spica iv .  total eight days .   when the ship hovered once more over the place where they had marooned the earthmen  it was midmorning  and the tubal   s face as he surveyed the area through the televisor was a study in length .  shortly he broke a silence that had long since become sticky .      i guess we   ve made every boner we could possibly have made .  we landed them right outside a native village .  there   s no sign of the earthmen .      sefan shook his head dolefully .     this is a bad business .      tubal buried his head in his long arms clear down to the elbows .      that   s the finish .  if they didn   t scare themselves to death  the natives got them .  violating prohibited solar systems is bad enough but it   s just plain murder now  i guess .         what we   ve got to do     said sefan     is to get down there and find out if there are any still alive .  we owe them that much .  after that      he swallowed .  forase finished in a whisper .      after that  it   s expulsion from the u .   psycho revision and manual labor for life .         forget it .     barked tubal .     we   ll face that when we have to .      slowly  very slowly  the ship circled downward and came to rest on the rocky clearing where  eight days previously  ten earthmen had been left stranded .      how do we handle these natives .     tubal turned to forase with raised eyebrow ridges  there was no hair on them  of course  .     come on  son  give with some sub humanoid psychology .  there are only three of us and i don   t want any trouble .        forase shrugged and his fuzzy face wrinkled in perplexity .     i   ve just been thinking about that  tubal .  i don   t know any .         what .     exploded sefan and tubal in twin shouts .      no one does     added the denebian hurriedly .     it   s a fact .  after all  we don   t let sub humanoids into the federation till they   re fully civilized  and we quarantine them until then .  do you suppose we have much opportunity to study their psychology .      the arcturian seated himself heavily .     this gets better and better .  think  fuzzy face  will you .  suggest something .      forase scratched his head .     well uh the best we can do is to treat them like normal humanoids .  if we approach slowly  palms spread out  make no sudden movements and keep calm  we ought to get along .  now  remember  i   m saying we ought to .  i can   t be certain about this .         let   s go  and damnation with certainty     urged sefan impatiently .     it doesn   t matter much  anyway .  if i get knocked off here  i don   t have to go back home .     his face took on a hunted look .     when i think of what my family is going to say      they emerged from the ship and sniffed the atmosphere of spica   s fourth planet .  the sun was at meridian  and loomed overhead like a large orange basketball .  off in the woods  a bird called once in a creaky caw .  utter silence descended .      hmph .     said tubal  arms akimbo .      it   s enough to make you feel sleepy .  no signs of life at all .  now  which way is the villager  there was a three way dispute about this  but it didn   t last long .  the arcturian first  the other two tagging along  they strode down the slope and toward the straggling forest .   a hundred feet inside  the trees came alive  as a wave of natives dropped noiselessly from the overhanging branches .  wri forase went under at the very first of the avalanche .  bill sefan stumbled  stood his ground momentarily  then went over backward with a grunt .   only huge myron tubal was left standing .  legs straddled wide  and whooping hoarsely  he laid about right and left .  the attacking natives hit him and bounced off like drops of water from a whirling flywheel .  modeling his defense on the principle of the windmill  he backed his way against a tree .   here he made a mistake .  on the lowest branch of that tree squatted a native at once more cautious and more brainy than his fellows .  tubal had already noticed that the natives were equipped with stout  muscular tails  and had made a mental note of the fact .  of all the races in the galaxy  only one other  homo gamma cepheus  possessed tails .  what he didn   t notice  however  was that these tails were prehensile .   this he found out almost immediately  for the native in the branch above his head looped his tail downward  hashed it about tubal   s neck and contracted it .   the arcturian threshed wildly in agony  and the tailed attacker was jerked from his tree .  suspended head first and whirled about in huge sweeps  the native nevertheless maintained his hold and tightened that tail grip steadily .   the world blacked out .  tubal was unconscious before he hit the ground .     tubal came to slowly  unpleasantly aware of the stinging stiffness of his neck .  he tried vainly to rub that stiffness  and it took a few seconds to realize that he was tied tightly .  the fact startled him into alertness .  he became aware  first  that he was lying on his stomach  second  of the horrible din about him  third  of sefan and forase bundled up next to him and last  that he could not break his bonds .      hey  sefan  forase .  can you hear me .      it was sefan that answered joyfully .     you old draconian goat .  we thought you were out for good .         i don   t die so easy     grunted the arcturian .     where are we .      there was a short pause .      in the native village  i imagine     wri forase said dully .     did you ever hear such a noise .  the drum hasn   t stopped a minute since they dumped us here .         have you seen anything of      hands were upon tubal  and he felt himself whirled about .  he was in a sitting posture now and his neck hurt worse than ever .  ramshackle huts of thatch and green logs gleamed in the early afternoon sun .  in a circle about them  watching in silence  were dark skinned  long tailed natives .  there must have been hundreds  all wearing feathered head dresses and carrying short  wickedly barbed spears .   their eyes were upon the row of figures that squatted mysteriously in the foreground  and upon these tubal turned his angry glare .  it was plain that they were the leaders of the tribe .  dressed in gaudy  fringed robes of ill tanned skins  they added further to their barbaric impressiveness by wearing tall wooden masks painted into caricatures of the human face .   with measured steps  the masked horror nearest the humanoids approached .      hello     it said  and the mask lifted up and off .     back so soon .      for quite a long while  tubal and sefan said absolutely nothing  while wri forase went into a protracted fit of coughing .   finally  tubal drew a long breath .     you   re one of the earthmen  aren   t you .         that   s right .  i   m al williams .  just call me al .         they haven   t killed you yet .      williams smiled happily .     they haven   t killed any of us .  quite the contrary .  gentlemen     he bowed extravagantly     meet the new tribal er gods .         the new tribal what .     gasped forase .  he was still coughing .      er gods .  sorry  but i don   t know the galactic word for a god .         what do you    gods    represent .         we   re sort of supernatural entities objects to be worshipped .  don   t you get it .      the humanoids stared unhappily .      yes  indeed     williams grinned     we   re persons of great power .         what are you talking about .     exclaimed tubal indignantly .     why should they think you were of great power .  you earth people are below average physically well below .         its the psychology of the thing     explained williams .     if they see us landing in a large  gleaming vehicle that travels mysteriously through the air  and then takes off in a burst of rocket flame they   re bound to consider us supernatural .  that   s elementary barbaric psychology .      forase   s eyes seemed on the point of dropping out as williams continued .      incidentally  what detained you .  we figure it was all a hazing of some sort  and it was  wasn   t it .         say     broke in sefan     i think you   re feeding us a lot of bull .  if they thought you people were gods  why didn   t they think we were .  we had the ship  too  and         that     said williams     is where we started to interfere .  we explained via pictures and sign language that you people were devils .  when you finally came back and say  were we glad to see that ship coming down they knew what to do .         what      asked forase  with a liberal dash of awe in his voice     are    devils    .        williams sighed .     don   t you galaxy people know anything .  tubal moved his aching neck slowly .     how about letting us up now .     he rumbled .     i   ve got a crick in my neck .         what   s your hurry .  after all  you were brought here to be sacrificed in our honor .         sacrificed .         sure .  you   re to be carved up with knives .      there was a horror laden silence .     don   t give us any of that cometgas .     tubal managed to grind out at last .     we   re not earthmen who get panicky or scared  you know .         oh  we know that .  i wouldn   t fool you for the world .  but simple ordinary savage psychology always goes for a little human sacrifice  and      sefan writhed against his bonds and tried to throw himself in a rage at forase .      i thought you said no one knew any sub humanoid psychology .  trying to alibi your ignorance  weren   t you  you shriveled  fuzz covered  pop eyed son of a half breed vegan lizard .  a fine mess we   re in now .      forase shrank away .     now  wait .  just      williams decided the joke had gone far enough .      take it easy     he soothed .     your clever hazing blew up right in your faces it blew up beautifully but we   re not going to carry it too far .  i guess we   ve had enough fun out of you fellows .  sweeney is with the native chief now  explaining that we   re leaving and taking you three with us .  frankly  i   ll be glad to get going wait a while  sweeney   s calling me .      when williams returned two seconds later  his expression was peculiar  having turned a bit greenish .  in fact  he got greener by the second .      it looks     he gulped throatily        as if our counter haze has blown up in our faces .  the native chief insists on the sacrifice .      silence brooded  while the three humanoids thought over the state of affairs .  for moments  none of them could say a word     i   ve told sweeney     williams added  glumly     to go back and tell the chief that if he doesn   t do as we say  something terrible is going to happen to his tribe .  but it   s pure bluff and he may not fall for it .  uh  i   m sorry  fellows .  i guess we went too far .  if it looks really bad  we   ll cut you loose and join in the fight .         cut us loose now     growled tubal  his blood running cold .     let   s get this over with .         wait .     cried forase frantically .     let the earthman try some of his psychology .  go ahead  earthman .  think hard .      williams thought until his brain began to hurt .      you see     he said weakly     we   ve lost some of our godlike prestige  ever since we were unable to cure the chief   s wife .  she died yesterday .     he nodded abstractedly to himself .     what we need is an impressive miracle .  er have you fellows anything in your pockets .      he knelt beside them and began searching .  wri forase had a stylus  a pocket pad  a thin toothed comb  some anti itch powder  a sheaf of credits and a few odds and ends .  sefan had a collection of similar nondescript material .   it was from tubal   s hip pocket that williams withdrew a small black gunlike object with a huge hand grip and a short barrel .      what   s this .      tubal scowled .     is that what i   ve been sitting on all this while .  it   s a weld gun that i used to fix up a meteor puncture in our ship .  it   s no good  power   s almost gone .      williams    eyes kindled .  his whole body galvanized with excitement .      that   s what you think .  you galaxy men never could see farther than your noses .  why don   t you come down to earth for a spell and get a new point of view .      williams was running toward his fellow conspirators now .      sweeney     he howled     you tell that damned monkey tailed chief that in just about one second  i   m going to get sore and pull the whole sky down over his head .  get tough .        but the chief did not wait for the message .  he gestured defiance and the natives made a united rush .  tubal roared  and his muscles cracked against the bonds .  the weld gun in williams    hand flared into life  its feeble power beaming outward .   the nearest native hut went up in sudden flames .  another followed and another and the fourth and then the weld gun went dead .   but it was enough .  not a native remained standing .  all were groveling on their faces  wailing and shrieking for pardon .  the chief wailed and shrieked loudest of all .      tell the chief     said williams to sweeney     that that   s just a little  insignificant sample of what we   re thinking of doing to him .      to the humanoids  as he cut the rawhide holding them  he added complacently      just some simple  ordinary savage psychology .      it was only after they were back in their ship and off in space again that forase locked up his pride .      but i thought earthmen had never developed mathematical psychology .  how did you know all that sub humanoid stuff .  no one in the galaxy has got that far yet .         well     williams grinned     we have a certain amount of rule of thumb knowledge about the workings of the uncivilized mind .  you see we come from a world where most people  in a manner of speaking  are still uncivilized .  so we have to know .      forase nodded slowly .     you screwball earthmen .  at least  this little episode has taught us all one thing .         what   s that .         never     said forase  dipping a second time into earth slang     get tough with a bunch of nuts .  they may be nuttier than you think .        the end    in going through my stories while preparing this book  i found    the hazing    to be the only published story concerning which i could remember nothing from the title alone .  even as i reread it  nothing clicked .  if i had been given the story without my name on it and had been asked to read it and guess the author  i would probably have been stumped .  maybe that means something .       it does seem to me  though  that the story is set against a    homo sol    background .     i had better luck with fred pohl with another story     super neutron     which i wrote at the end of the same february in which i did    masks    and    the hazing .     i submitted it to him on march          and he accepted it on march   .   by that time  less than three years after my first submission  i was clearly becoming rather impatient with rejections .  at least  the news of the acceptance of    super neutron    is greeted in my diary with an    it   s about time i made a sale five and a half weeks since the last one .          super neutron     it was at the seventeenth meeting of the honorable society of ananias that we got the greatest scare of our collective lives and consequently elected gilbert hayes to the office of perpetual president .   the society is not a large one .  before the election of hayes there were only four of us  john sebastian  simon murfree  morris levin and myself .  on the first sunday of every month we met at luncheon  and on these monthly occasions justified our society   s title by gambling the dinner check on our ability to lie .   it was quite a complicated process  with strict parliamentary rules .  one member spun a yarn each meeting as his turn came up  and two conditions had to be adhered to .  his story had to be an outrageous  complicated  fantastic lie  and  it had to sound like the truth .  members were allowed to and did attack any and every point of the story by asking questions or demanding explanations .   woe to the narrator who did not answer all questions immediately  or who  in answering  involved himself in a contradiction .  the dinner check was his .  financial loss was slight  but the disgrace was great .   and then came that seventeenth meeting and gilbert hayes .  hayes was one of several non members who attended occasionally to listen to the after dinner whopper  paying his own check  and  of course  being forbidden to participate  but on this occasion he was the only one present aside from the regular members .   dinner was over  i had been voted into the chair  it was my regular turn to preside   and the minutes had been read  when hayes leaned forward and said quietly     i   d like a chance today  gentlemen .      i frowned     in the eyes of the society you are non existent  mr .  hayes .  it is impossible for you to take part .         then just let me make a statement      he rejoined .     the solar system is coming to an end at exactly seventeen and a half minutes after two this afternoon .      there was a devil of a stir  and i looked at the electric clock over the television receiver .  it was      p . m .   i said hesitantly     if you have anything to substantiate that extraordinary statement  it should be most interesting .  it is mr .  levin   s turn today  but if he is willing to waive it  and if the rest of the society agrees      levin smiled and nodded  and the others joined in .   i banged the gavel     mr .  hayes has the floor .        hayes lit his cigar and gazed at it pensively .     i have little more than an hour  gentlemen  but i   ll start at the beginning which is about fifteen years ago .  at that time  though i   ve resigned since  i was an astrophysicist at yerkes observatory young  but promising .  i was hot on the trail of the solution to one of the perennial puzzles of astrophysics the source of the cosmic rays and full of ambition .      he paused  and continued in a different tone     you know  it is strange that with all our scientific advance in the last two centuries we have never found either that mysterious source or the equally mysterious reason for the explosion of a star .  they are the two eternal puzzles and we know as little about them today as we did in the days of einstein  eddington  and millikan .      still  as i say  i thought i had the cosmic ray by the tail  so i set out to check my ideas by observation  and for that i had to go out in space .  it wasn   t  however  as easy as all that .  it was in       you see  just after the last war  and the observatory was about broke as weren   t we all .      i made the best of it .  i hired an old second hand       model  piled my apparatus in  and set out alone .  what   s more  i had to sneak out of port without clearance papers  not wishing to go through the red tape the occupation army would have put me through .  it was illegal  but i wanted my data so i headed out at a right angle to the ecliptic  in the direction of the south celestial pole  approximately  and left sol a billion miles behind me .      the voyage i made  and the data i collected are unimportant .  i never reported one or the other .  it was the planet i found that makes the story .      at this point  murfree raised those bushy eyebrows of his and grunted     i would like to warn the gentleman  mr .  chairman .  no member has yet escaped with his skin with a phony planet .      hayes smiled grimly     i   ll take my chance .   to continue  it was on the eighteenth day of my trip that i first detected the planet  as a little orange disc the size of a pea .  naturally  a planet in that region of space is something of a sensation .  i headed for it  and immediately discovered that i had not even scratched the surface of that planet   s queerness .  to exist there at all was phenomenal but it likewise possessed absolutely no gravitational field .      levin   s wine glass crashed to the floor .     mr .  chairman     he gasped     i demand the gentleman   s immediate disqualification .  no mass can exist without distorting the space in its neighborhood and thus creating a gravitational field he has made an impossible statement  and should therefore be disqualified .     his face was an angry red .   but hayes held his hand up     i demand time  mr .  chairman .  the explanation will be forthcoming in due course .  to make it now would only complicate things .  please  may i continue .      i considered     in view of the nature of your story  i am disposed to be lenient .  delay is granted  but please remember that an explanation will be required eventually .  you will lose without it .         all right      said hayes .     for the present  you will have to accept my statement that the planet had no gravity at all .  that is definite  for i had complete astronomical equipment upon my ship  and though my instruments were very sensitive  they registered a dead zero .      it worked the other way around as well  for the planet was not affected by the gravity of other masses .  again  i stress the point that it was not affected at all .  this i was not able to determine at the time  but subsequent observation over a period of years  showed that the planet was traveling in a straight line orbit and at a constant speed .  as it was well within the sun   s influence  the fact that its orbit was neither elliptical nor hyperbolic  and that  though approaching the sun  it was not accelerating  showed definitely that it was independent of solar gravity .         wait a while  hayes .     sebastian scowled till his gold premolar gleamed .     what held this wonderful planet together .  without gravity  why didn   t it break up and drift apart .         sheer inertia  for one thing .     was the immediate retort .     there was nothing to pull it apart .  a collision with another body of comparable size might have done it leaving out of consideration the possibility of the existence of some other binding force peculiar to the planet        he sighed and continued     that doesn   t finish the properties of the body .  its red orange color and its low reflective power  or albedo  set me on another track  and i made the astonishing discovery that the planet was entirely transparent to the whole electro magnetic spectrum from radio waves to cosmic rays .  it was only in the region of the red and yellow portion of the visible light octave that it was reasonably opaque .  hence  its color .         why was this .     demanded murfree .   hayes looked at me     that is an unreasonable question  mr .  chairman .  i maintain that i might as well be asked to explain why glass is entirely transparent to anything above or below the ultra violet region  so that heat  light  and x rays pass through  while it remains opaque to ultra violet light itself .  this sort of thing is a property of the substance itself and must be accepted as such without explanation .      i whacked my gavel     question declared improper .         i object     declared murfree .     hayes missed the point nothing is perfectly transparent glass of sufficient thickness will stop even cosmic rays .  do you mean to say that blue light would pass through an entire planet  or heat  for instance .         why not .     replied hayes .     that perfect transparency does not exist in your experience does not mean it does not exist altogether .  there is certainly no scientific law to that effect this planet was perfectly transparent except for one small region of the spectrum .  that   s a definite fact of observation .      my gavel thumped again     explanation declared sufficient continue  hayes .      his cigar had gone out and he paused to relight then     in other respects  the planet was normal .  it was not quite the size of saturn perhaps half way in diameter between it and neptune .  subsequent experiments showed it to possess mass  though it was hard to find out how much certainly more than twice earth   s .  with mass  it possessed the usual properties of inertia and momentum but no gravity .      it was      now .   hayes followed my eyes and said     yes  only three quarters of an hour is left .  i   ll hurry .  .  .  . naturally  this queer planet set me to thinking  and that  together with the fact that i had already been evolving certain theories concerning cosmic rays and novae  led to an interesting solution .      he drew a deep breath     imagine if you can our cosmos as a cloud of well  super atoms which         i beg your pardon     exclaimed sebastian  rising to his feet     are you intending to base any of your explanation on drawing analogies between stars and atoms  or between solar systems and electronic orbits .         why do you ask .     questioned hayes  quietly .     because if you do  i demand immediate disqualification .  the belief that atoms are miniature solar systems is in a class with the ptolemaic scheme of the universe .  the idea has never been accepted by responsible scientists even at the very dawn of the atomic theory .      i nodded     the gentleman is correct .  no such analogy will be permitted as part of the explanation .         i object     said hayes .     in your school course in elementary physics or chemistry  you will remember that in the study of the properties of gases  it was often pretended  for the sake of illustrating a point  that the gas molecules were tiny billiard balls .  does that mean that gas molecules are billiard balls .         no     admitted sebastian .      it only means     drove on hayes     that gas molecules act similarly to billiard balls in some ways .  therefore the actions of one are better visualized by studying the actions of the other .   well  then  i am only trying to point out a phenomenon in our universe of stars  and for the sake of ease of visualization  i compare it to a similar  and better known  phenomenon in the world of atoms .  that does not mean that stars are magnified atoms .        i was won over .     the point is well taken     i said .     you may continue with your explanation  but if it is the judgment of the chair that the analogy becomes a false one  you will be disqualified .         good     agreed hayes     but we   ll pass on to another point for a moment .  do any of you remember the first atomic power plants of a hundred and seventy years ago and how they operated .         i believe     muttered levin     that they used the classical uranium fission method for power .  they bombarded uranium with slow neutrons and split it up into masurium  barium  gamma rays and more neutrons  thus establishing a cyclic process .         that   s right .  well  imagine that the stellar universe acted in ways mind you  this is a metaphor  and not to be taken literally like a body composed of uranium atoms  and imagine this stellar universe to be bombarded from without by objects which might act in some ways similar to the way neutrons act on an atomic scale .      such a super neutron  hitting a sun  would cause that sun to explode into radiation and more super neutrons .  in other words  you would have a nova .     he looked around for disagreement .      what justification have you for that idea .     demanded levin .      two  one logical  and one observational .  logic first .  stars are essentially in matter energy equilibrium  yet suddenly  with no observable change  either spectral or otherwise  they occasionally explode .  an explosion indicates instability  but where .  not within the star  for it had been in equilibrium for millions of years .  not from a point within the universe  for novae occur in even concentration throughout the universe .  hence  by elimination  only from a point outside the universe .      secondly  observation .  i came across one of these super neutrons .      said murfree indignantly     i suppose you mean that gravitationless planet you came across .         that   s right .         then what makes you think it   s a super neutron .  you can   t use your theory as proof  because you   re using the super neutron itself to bolster the theory .  we   re not allowed to argue in circles here .         i know that     declared hayes  stiffly .     i   ll resort to logic again .  the world of atoms possesses a cohesive force in the electro magnetic charge on electrons and protons .  the world of stars possesses a cohesive force in gravity .  the two forces are only alike in a very general manner .  for instance  there are two kinds of electrical charges  positive and negative  but only one kind of gravity and innumerable minor differences .  still  an analogy this far seems to me to be permissible .  a neutron on an atomic scale is a mass without the atomic cohesive force electric charge .  a super neutron on a stellar scale ought to be a mass without the stellar cohesive force gravity .  therefore  if i find a body without gravity  it seems reasonable to assume it to be a super neutron .         do you consider that a rigorously scientific proof .     asked sebastian sarcastically .      no     admitted hayes     but it is logical  conflicts with no scientific fact i know of  and works out to form a consistent explanation of novae .  that should be enough for our purpose at present .      murfree was gazing hard at his fingernails     and just where is this superneutron of yours heading .         i see you anticipate     said hayes  sombrely .     it was what i asked myself at the time .  at     y  today it hits the sun square  and eight minutes later  the radiation resulting from the explosion will sweep earth to oblivion .           why didn   t you report all this .     barked sebastian .      where was the use .  there was nothing to be done about it .  we can   t handle astronomical masses .  all the power available on earth would not have sufficed to swerve that great body from its path .  there was no escape within the solar system itself  for neptune and pluto will turn gaseous along with the other planets  and interstellar travel is as yet impossible .  since man cannot exist independently in space  he is doomed .      why tell of all this .  what would result after i had convinced them that the death warrant was signed .  suicides  crime waves  orgies  messiahs  evangelists  and everything bad and futile you could think of .  and after all  is death by nova so bad .  it is instantaneous and clean .  at      you   re here .  at      you are a mass of attenuated gas .  it is so quick and easy a death  it is almost not death .      there was a long silence after this .  i felt uneasy .  there are lies and lies  but this sounded like the real thing .  hayes didn   t have that little quirk of the lip or that little gleam in the eye which marks the triumph of putting over a good one .  he was deadly  deadly serious .  i could see the others felt the same .  levin was gulping at his wine  hand shaking .   finally  sebastian coughed loudly     how long ago did you discover this super neutron and where .         fifteen years ago  a billion miles or better from the sun .         and all that time it has been approaching the sun .         yes  at a constant speed of two miles per second .         good  i   ve got you .     sebastian almost laughed his relief .     why haven   t the astronomers spotted it in all this while .         my god     responded hayes  impatiently     it   s clear you aren   t an astronomer .  now  what fool would look to the southern celestial pole for a planet  when they   re only found in the ecliptic .         but     pointed out sebastian     the region is studied just the same .  it is photographed .         surely .  for all i know  the super neutron has been photographed a hundred times a thousand times if you like though the southern pole is the most poorly watched region of the sky .  but what   s to differentiate it from a star .  with its low albedo  it never passed eleventh magnitude in brightness .  after all  it   s hard enough to detect any planets in any case .  uranus was spotted many times before herschel realized it was a planet .  pluto took years to find even when they were looking for it .  remember also that without gravity  it causes no planetary perturbations  and that the absence of these removes the most obvious indication of its presence .         but      insisted sebastian  desperately     as it approached the sun  its apparent size would increase and it would begin to show a perceptible disc through a telescope .  even if its reflected light were very faint  it would certainly obscure the stars behind it .         true     admitted hayes .     i will not say that a really thorough mapping of the polar region would not have uncovered it  but such mapping has been done long ago  and the present cursory searches for novae  special spectral types  and so on are by no means thorough .  then  as the super neutron approaches the sun  it begins to appear only in the dawn and twilight in evening and morning star fashion so that observation becomes much more difficult .  and so  as a matter of fact  it just has not been observed and it is what should have been expected .      again a silence  and i became aware that my heart was pounding .  it was two o   clock even  and we hadn   t been able to shake hayes    story .  we had to prove it a lie fast  or r d die of sheer suspense .  we were all of us watching the clock .     levin took up the fight .     it   s an awfully queer coincidence that the super neutron should be heading straight for the sun .  what are the chances against it .  remember  that would be the same thing as reciting the chances against the truth of the story .      i interposed     that is an illegitimate objection  mr .  levin .  to cite improbability  however great  is not sufficient .  only outright impossibility or citation of inconsistency can serve to disqualify .      but hayes waved his hand     it   s all right .  let me answer .  taking an individual super neutron and an individual star  the chances of collision  head on  are all but infinitely small .  however  statistically  if you shoot enough super neutrons into the universe  then  given enough time  every star ought to be hit sooner or later .  space must be swarming with super neutrons say one every thousand cubic parsecs so that in spite of the vast distances between the stars and the relative minuteness of the targets  twenty novae occur in our single galaxy every year that is  there are twenty collisions between superneutrons and stars annually .      the situation is no different really from uranium being bombarded with ordinary neutrons .  only one neutron out of a hundred million may score a hit  but  given time  every nucleus is exploded eventually .  if there is an outer universe intelligence directing this bombardment pure hypothesis  and not part of my argument  please a year to us is probably an infinitesimal fraction of a second to them .  the hits  to them  may be occurring at the rate of billions to their seconds .  energy is being developed  perhaps  to the point where the material this universe composes has become heated to the gaseous state or whatever passes for the gaseous state there .  the universe is expanding  you know like a gas .         still  for the very first super neutron entering our system to head straight for the sun seems     levin ended in a weak stammer .      good lord     snapped hayes     who told you this was the first .  hundreds may have passed through the system in geologic times .  one or two may have passed through in the last thousand years or so .  how would we know .  even when one is headed straight for the sun  astronomers don   t find it .  perhaps this is the only one that   s passed through since the telescope was invented  and before then  of course .  and never forget that  having no gravity  they can go right through the middle of the system  without affecting the planets .  only a hit on the sun registers  and then it   s too late .      he looked at the clock       o   we ought to see it now against the sun .     he stood up and raised the window shade .  the yellow sunlight streamed in and i moved away from the dusty shaft of light .  my mouth was dry as desert sand .  murfree was mopping his brow  but beads of sweat stood out all along his cheeks and neck .   hayes took out several slips of exposed film negative and handed them out     i came prepared  you see .     he held one up and squinted at the sun .     there it is     he remarked placidly .     my calculations showed it would be in transit with respect to earth at the time of collision .  rather convenient .      i was looking at the sun  too  and felt my heart skip a beat .  there  quite clear against the brightness of the sun  was a little  perfectly round  black spot .      why doesn   t it vaporize .     stammered murfree .     it must be almost in the sun   s atmosphere .     i don   t think he was trying to disprove hayes    story .  he had gone past that .  he was honestly seeking information .      i told you     explained hayes     that it is transparent to almost all solar radiation .  only the radiation it absorbs can go into heat and that   s a very small percentage of all it receives .  besides  it isn   t ordinary matter .  it   s probably much more refractory than anything on earth  and the solar surface is only at       degrees centrigrade .      he pointed a thumb over his shoulder     it   s         gentlemen .  the super neutron has struck and death is on its way .  we have eight minutes .      we were dumb with something that was just simply unbearable terror .  i remember hayes    voice  quite matter of fact  saying     mercury just went .     then a few minutes later     venus has gone .     and lastly     thirty seconds left  gentlemen .      the seconds crawled  but passed at last  and another thirty seconds  and still another .  .  .  .     and on hayes    face  a look of astonishment grew and spread .  he lifted the clock and stared at it  then peered through his film at the sun once more .      it   s gone .     he turned and faced us     it   s unbelievable .  i had thought of it  but i dared not draw the atomic analogy too far .  you know that not all atomic nuclei explode on being hit by a neutron .  some  cadmium  for instance  absorb them one after the other like sponges do water .  i      he paused again  drew a deep breath  and continued musingly     even the purest block of uranium contains traces of all other elements .  and in a universe of trillions of stars acting like uranium  what does a paltry million of cadmium like stars amount to nothing .  yet the sun is one of them .  mankind never deserved that .      he kept on talking  but relief had finally penetrated and we listened no longer .  in half hysterical fashion  we elected gilbert hayes to the office of perpetual president by enthusiastic acclamation  and voted the story the whoppingest lie ever told .   but there   s one thing that bothers me .  hayes fills his post well  the society is more successful than ever but i think he should have been disqualified after all .  his story fulfilled the second condition  it sounded like the truth .  but i don   t think it fulfilled the first condition .   i think it was the truth .     the end    i had series on my mind by now .     super neutron    was certainly intended to be but the first in a long chain of very clever and very ingenious tales to be told at the meetings of the    honorable society of ananias .     it didn   t work out that way .  there was never a second story  not even the beginnings of one  not even the idea for one .     by the time i was writing    super neutron     in february of       i had heard of uranium fission and had even discussed it in some detail with campbell .  i managed to refer to it in the course of the story as    the classical uranium fission method for power .     i also spoke of the metal cadmium as a neutron absorber .  it wasn   t bad for a story that appeared in       and i sometimes quote it in public to create an impression .   notice  though  that in the same paragraph in which i mention fission  i also talk of    masurium .     actually  masurium was the name given to element     in       but that discovery had proven a false alarm .  the element was really discovered in      and was given the now accepted name of    technetium .     it seems  then  that i could look years into the future and see uranium fission as a practical power source  but i couldn   t look a few years into the past and see the correct name for element     .     this brings us to march           and one of the key turning points of my literary career .   by that day  i had written thirty one stories .  of these i had already sold seventeen and was yet to sell four more .  of all these stories  three perhaps  and no more  were to turn out to be of more than ephemeral value  and those were the three    positronic robots    stories i had so far written     robbie         reason     and    liar .      looking back on my first three years as a writer  then  i can judge myself to be nothing more than a steady and  perhaps  hopeful third rater .  what   s more  that   s all i considered myself then  too .  nor did anyone else  at that time  seriously consider me as a potential first magnitude star in the science fiction heavens except  maybe  campbell .   what are the odds  then  that on march           i would sit down and write something that for thirty years now has been considered by a surprising number of people to be the outstanding short classic of magazine science fiction .  it was one of those things that couldn   t possibly happen yet it did .   it began when i walked into campbell   s office that day and  as usual  suggested an idea .  what it was i don   t remember  but whatever it was he turned it down instantly  not because it was such a bad idea but because he had something he wanted to show me that crowded everything else out of his mind .  he had come across a quotation from ralph waldo emerson that went     if the stars should appear one night in a thousand years  how would men believe and adore  and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of god .      does anyone know in what essay  and in what connection  emerson says this .  every once in a while i make a desultory search through quotation books or through a collection of emerson but haven   t found it yet .  i hope it exists and that the quote is given correctly .     campbell asked me what i thought would happen if the stars would appear at only very long intervals .  i had nothing intelligent to suggest .      i think men would go mad     he said thoughtfully .   we talked about that notion for quite a while  and i went home to write a story on the subject  one that campbell and i decided from the start was to be called    nightfall     i began it that night .  i can remember the details exactly  my parents    apartment on windsor place in brooklyn  across the street from the candy store  my own room  just next to the living room  is clear in my mind  with the position of my bed  my desk  my typewriter and myself getting started .   in years to come  fans would occasionally vote in polls designed to decide the best science fiction short stories of all time .  quite frequently     nightfall    would finish in first place .  just a couple of years ago  the science fiction writers of america polled their membership to decide the best science fiction short stories ever published  for inclusion in a hall of fame anthology .     nightfall    finished in first place by a sizable margin .  and  of course  it has been anthologized a dozen times so far .   with all this  one might argue that    nightfall    is the best  or at least the most popular  short science fiction story ever to appear in the magazines .  well  i often wonder  with a shudder  what might have happened on the evening of march           if some angelic spirit had whispered in my ear     isaac  you are about to start writing the best short science fiction story of our time .      i would undoubtedly have frozen solid .  i wouldn   t have been able to type a word .   but we don   t know the future  and i tapped away blissfully  writing the story and completing it by april         .  that day  i submitted it to campbell .  he asked for a small revision .  i took care of that  and on april           he bought the story .   it set several records for me .  it was the longest story i had yet sold  a little over thirteen thousand words .  since campbell paid me a bonus  my first one   the word rate was one and a quarter cents a word  and the total check was for       more than twice as large as any single payment i had ever before received .      black friar of the flame    was three thousand words longer than    nightfall     but the former was not to be sold for another half year  and since it earned merely one cent a word  it brought in only      .  of course  first time earnings are not the whole story  either .     nightfall    has earned me some thousands of dollars since      and will yet earn me more     black friar of the flame    has not yet earned me one cent over the original check till its appearance in this book .     then  too     nightfall    appeared in the september      issue of astounding as the lead novelette .  for the first time  i made the cover of that magazine  with    nightfall  by isaac asimov    in large  bold letters .   most important of all  the appearance of    nightfall    graduated me by common consent  three years after i had begun my career  into the list of first rank science fiction writers .   alas  the story is not included here .  it appears  of course  in nightfall and other stories .   in telling the story  in that collection  of how    nightfall    came to be written  i mentioned that i had received      for it  quoting from memory .  once again  i must confess fallibility .  the records say      .  it is a small point  and perhaps not worth noting  but i know my readers .  by explaining this now  i fend off dozens of letters that will mention the discrepancy and demand an explanation .     the excitement of writing    nightfall    and campbell   s hearty and unqualified praise of it ought  one might think  to have set me furiously to work at the typewriter  but it didn   t .  spring      was a bad time for me .   i could at any time that half year have left columbia with a master   s degree  but that would have done me no good .  i had no job to go to  so i could only mark time and try to raise my value to some prospective employer by going on to the big one  the doctorate .   but that meant i had to take a series of elaborate  interminable    qualifying examinations     which i had to pass in order to be allowed to begin the research without which i could not get the ph . d .  passing was difficult and i didn   t feel prepared at all  but i had to try it sometime  and besides  if i didn   t fall short by too far  i would be allowed to continue taking courses and to repeat the qualifying examinations at some future date .   so in may i absented myself from the typewriter  studied earnestly for my qualifyings  took them and didn   t pass .  i did well enough to earn the option of a future repeat  and i also received my m . a .  as a kind of consolation prize  but i was badly disheartened all the same .    and in the larger world outside  though great britain had survived air bombardment  hitler still seemed unstoppable .  he invaded the balkans and was again winning spectacular victories  and that was disheartening  too .    it was not till may    .        that i could bring myself to go back to my writing .  i turned out    not final .     which i submitted to campbell on june z .  it was accepted on the sixth  but without a bonus .       not final .      nicholas orloff inserted a monocle in his left eye with all the incorruptible briticism of a russian educated at oxford and said reproachfully     but  my dear mr .  secretary .  half a billion dollars .      leo birnam shrugged his shoulders wearily and allowed his lank body to cramp up still farther in the chair     the appropriation must go through  commissioner .  the dominion government here at ganymede is becoming desperate .  so far  i   ve been holding them off  but as secretary of scientific affairs  my powers are small .         i know  but     and orloff spread his hands helplessly .     i suppose so     agreed birnam .     the empire government finds it easier to look the other way .  they   ve done it consistently up to now .  i   ve tried for a year now to have them understand the nature of the danger that hangs over the entire system  but it seems that it can   t be done .  but i   m appealing to you  mr .  commissioner .  you   re new in your post and can approach this jovian affair with an unjaundiced eye .      orloff coughed and eyed the tips of his boots .  in the three months since he had succeeded gridley as colonial commissioner he had tabled unread everything relating to    those damned jovian d . t .    s .     that had been according to the established cabinet policy which had labeled the jovian affair as    deadwood    long before he had entered office .   but now that ganymede was becoming nasty  he found himself sent out to jovopolis with instructions to hold the    blasted provincials    down .  it was a nasty spot .   birnam was speaking     the dominion government has reached the point where it needs the money so badly  in fact  that if they don   t get it  they   re going to publicize everything .      orloff   s phlegm broke completely  and he snatched at the monocle as it dropped     my dear fellow .         i know what it would mean .  i   ve advised against it  but they   re justified .  once the inside of the jovian affair is out  once the people know about it  the empire government won   t stay in power a week .  and when the technocrats come in  they   ll give us whatever we ask .  public opinion will see to that .         but you   ll also create a panic and hysteria         surely .  that is why we hesitate .  but you might call this an ultimatum .  we want secrecy  we need secrecy  but we need money more .         i see .     orloff was thinking rapidly  and the conclusions he came to were not pleasant .     in that case  it would be advisable to investigate the case further .  if you have the papers concerning the communications with the planet jupiter         i have them     replied birnam  dryly     and so has the empire government at washington .  that won   t do  commissioner .  it   s the same cud that   s been chewed by earth officials for the last year  and it   s gotten us nowhere .  i want you to come to ether station with me .      the ganymedan had risen from his chair  and he glowered down upon orloff from his six and a half feet of height .   orloff flushed      are you ordering me .         in a way  yes .  i tell you there is no time .  if you intend acting  you must act quickly or not at all .     birnam paused  then added     you don   t mind walking  i hope .  power vehicles aren   t allowed to approach ether station  ordinarily  and i can use the walk to explain a few of the facts .  it   s only two miles off .         i   ll walk     was the brusque reply .     the trip upward to subground level was made in silence  which was broken by orloff when they stepped into the dimly lit anteroom .      it   s chilly here .         i know .  it   s difficult to keep the temperature up to norm this near the surface .  but it will be colder outside .  here .      birnam had kicked open a closet door and was indicating the garments suspended from the ceiling .     put them on .  you   ll need them .      orloff fingered them doubtfully     are they heavy enough .      birnam was pouring into his own costume as he spoke .     they   re electrically heated .  you   ll find them plenty warm .  that   s it .  tuck the trouser legs inside the boots and lace them tight .      he turned then and  with a grunt  brought out a double compressed gas cylinder from its rack in one corner of the closet .  he glanced at the dial reading  and then turned the stopcock .  there was a thin wheeze of escaping gas  at which birnam sniffed with satisfaction .      do you know how to work one of these .     he asked  as he screwed onto the jet a flexible tube of metal mesh  at the other end of which was a curiously curved object of thick  clear glass .      what is it .         oxygen nosepiece .  what there is of ganymede   s atmosphere is argon and nitrogen  just about half and half .  it isn   t particularly breathable .     he heaved the double cylinder into position  and tightened it in its harness on orloff   s back .   orloff staggered     it   s heavy .  i can   t walk two miles with this .         it won   t be heavy out there     birnam nodded carelessly upward and lowered the glass nosepiece over orloff   s head .     just remember to breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth  and you won   t have any trouble .  by the way  did you eat recently .         i lunched before i came to your place .      birnam sniffed dubiously     well  that   s a little awkward .     he drew a small metal container from one of his pockets and tossed it to the commissioner .     put one of those pills in your mouth and keep sucking on it .      orloff worked clumsily with gloved fingers and finally managed to get a brown spheriod out of the tin and into his mouth .  he followed birnam up a gently sloped ramp .  the blind alley ending of the corridor slid aside smoothly when they reached it and there was a faint soughing as air slipped out into the thinner atmosphere of ganymede .   birnam caught the other   s elbow  and fairly dragged him out .      i   ve turned your air tank on full     he shouted .     breathe deeply and keep sucking at that pill .      gravity had flicked to ganymedan normality as they crossed the threshold and orloff after one horrible moment of apparent levitation  felt his stomach turn a somersault and explode .   he gagged  and fumbled the pill with his tongue in a desperate attempt at self control .  the oxygen rich mixture from the air cylinders burned his throat  and gradually ganymede steadied .  his stomach shuddered back into place .  he tried walking .      take it easy  now     came birnam   s soothing voice .     it gets you that way the first few times you change gravity fields quickly .  walk slowly and get the rhythm  or you   ll take a tumble .  that   s right  you   re getting it      the ground seemed resilient orloff could feel the pressure of the other   s arm holding him down at each step to keep him from springing too high .  steps were longer now and flatter  as he got the rhythm .  birnam continued speaking  a voice a little muffled from behind the leather flap drawn loosely across mouth and chin .      each to his own world     he grinned .     i visited earth a few years back  with my wife  and had a hell of a time .  i couldn   t get myself to learn to walk on a planet   s surface without a nosepiece .  i kept choking i really did .  the sunlight was too bright and the sky was too blue and the grass was too green .  and the buildings were right out on the surface .  i   ll never forget the time they tried to get me to sleep in a room twenty stories up in the air  with the window wide open and the moon shining in .      i went back on the first spaceship going my way and don   t ever intend returning .  how are you feeling now .         fine .  splendid .     now that the first discomfort had gone .  orloff found the low gravity exhilarating .  he looked about him .  the broken  hilly ground  bathed in a drenching yellow light  was covered with ground hugging broad leaved shrubs that showed the orderly arrangement of careful cultivation .   birnam answered the unspoken question     there   s enough carbon dioxide in the air to keep the plants alive  and they all have the power to fix atmospheric nitrogen .  that   s what makes agriculture ganymede   s greatest industry .  those plants are worth their weight in gold as fertilizers back on earth and worth double or triple that as sources for half a hundred alkaloids that can   t be gotten anywhere else in the system .  and  of course  everyone knows that ganymedan green leaf has terrestrial tobacco beat hollow .      there was the drone of a strato rocket overhead  shrill in the thin atmosphere  and orloff looked up .   he stopped stopped dead and forgot to breathe .   it was his first glimpse of jupiter in the sky .     it is one thing to see jupiter  coldly harsh  against the ebon backdrop of space .  at six hundred thousand miles  it is majestic enough .  but on ganymede  barely topping the hills  its outlines softened and ever so faintly hazed by the thin atmosphere  shining mellowly from a purple sky in which only a few fugitive stars dare compete with the jovian giant it can be described by no conceivable combination of words .   at first  orloff absorbed the gibbous disk in silence .  it was gigantic  thirty two times the apparent diameter of the sun as seen from earth .  its stripes stood out in faint washes of color against the yellowness beneath and the great red spot was an oval splotch of orange near the western rim .   and finally orloff murmured weakly     it   s beautiful .      leo birnam stared  too  but there was no awe in his eyes .  there was the mechanical weariness of viewing a sight often seen  and besides that an expression of sick revulsion .  the chin flap hid his twitching smile  but his grasp upon orloff   s arm left bruises through the tough fabric of the surface suit .   he said slowly     it   s the most horrible sight in the system .      orloff turned reluctant attention to his companion     eh .     then  disagreeably     oh  yes  those mysterious jovians .      at that  the ganymedan turned away angrily and broke into swinging  fifteen foot strides .  orloff followed clumsily after  keeping his balance with difficulty .      here  now     he gasped .   but birnam wasn   t listening .  he was speaking coldly  bitterly     you on earth can afford to ignore jupiter .  you know nothing of it .  it   s a little pin prick in your sky  a little flyspeck .  you don   t live here on ganymede  watching that damned colossus gloating over you .  up and over fifteen hours hiding god knows what on its surface .  hiding something that   s waiting and waiting and trying to get out .  like a giant bomb just waiting to explode .         nonsense .     orloff managed to jerk out .     will you slow down .  i can   t keep up .      birnam cut his strides in half and said tensely     everyone knows that jupiter is inhabited  but practically no one ever stops to realize what that means .  i tell you that those jovians  whatever they are  are born to the purple .  they are the natural rulers of the solar system .         pure hysteria     muttered orloff .     the empire government has been hearing nothing else from your dominion for a year .         and you   ve shrugged it oil .  well  listen .  jupiter  discounting the thickness of its colossal atmosphere  is eighty thousand miles in diameter .  that means it possesses a surface one hundred times that of earth  and more than fifty times that of the entire terrestrial empire .  its population  its resources .  its war potential are in proportion .         mere numbers         i know what you mean     birnam drove on  passionately .     wars are not fought with numbers  but with science and with organization .  the jovians have both .  in the quarter of a century during which we have communicated with them  we   ve learned a bit .  they have atomic power and they have radio .  and in a world of ammonia under great pressure a world in other words in which almost none of the metals can exist as metals for any length of time because of the tendency to form soluble ammonia complexes they have managed to build up a complicated civilization .  that means they have had to work through plastics  glasses  silicates and synthetic building materials of one sort or another .  that means a chemistry developed just as far as ours is  and r d put odds on its having developed further .      orloff waited long before answering .  and then     but how certain are you people about the jovians    last message .  we on earth are inclined to doubt that the jovians can possibly be as unreasonably belligerent as they have been described .      the ganymedan laughed shortly .     they broke oil all communication after that last message  didn   t they .  that doesn   t sound friendly on their part  does it .  i assure you that we   ve all but stood on our ears trying to contact them .      here now .  don   t talk .  let me explain something to you .  for twenty five years here on ganymede a little group of men have worked their hearts out trying to make sense out of a static ridden  gravity distorted set of variable clicks in our radio apparatus .  for those clicks were our only connection with living intelligence upon jupiter .  it was a job for a world of scientists  but we never had more than two dozen at the station at anyone time .  i was one of them from the very beginning and  as a philologist  did my part in helping construct and interpret the code that developed between ourselves and the jovians  so that you can see i am speaking from the real inside .      it was a devil of a heartbreaking job .  it was five years before we got past the elementary clicks of arithmetic  three and four are seven  the square root of twenty five is five  factorial six is seven hundred and twenty .  after that  months sometimes passed before we could work out and check by further communication a single new fragment of thought .      but and this is the point by the time the jovians broke off relations  we understood them thoroughly .  there was no more chance of a mistake in comprehension  than there was of ganymede suddenly cutting loose from jupiter .  and their last message was a threat  and a promise of destruction .  oh  there   s no doubt there   s no doubt .        they were walking through a shallow pass in which the yellow jupiter light gave way to a clammy darkness .   orloff was disturbed .  he had never had the case presented to him in this fashion before .  he said     but the reason  man .  what reason did we give them         no reason .  it was simply this  the jovians had finally discovered from our messages just where and how i don   t know that we were not jovians .         well  of course .         it wasn   t    of course    to them .  in their experiences they had never come across intelligences that were not jovian .  why should they make an exception in favor of those from outer space .         you say they were scientists .     orloff   s voice had assumed a wary frigidity .     wouldn   t they realize that alien environments would breed alien life .  we knew it .  we never thought the jovians were earthmen though we had never met intelligences other than those of earth .      they were back in the drenching wash of jupiter light again  and a spreading region of ice glimmered amberly in a depression to the right .   birnam answered     i said they were chemists and physicists but i never said they were astronomers .  jupiter  my dear commissioner  has an atmosphere three thousand miles or more thick  and those miles of gas block off everything but the sun and the four largest of jupiter   s moons .  the jovians know nothing of alien environments .      orloff considered .     and so they decided we were aliens .  what next .         if we weren   t jovians  then  in their eyes  we weren   t people .  it turned out that a non jovian was    vermin    by definition .      orloff   s automatic protest was cut off short by birnam     in their eyes  i said  vermin we were  and vermin we are .  moreover  we were vermin with the peculiar audacity of having dared to attempt to treat with jovians with human beings .  their last message was this  word for word    jovians are the masters .  there is no room for vermin .  we will destroy you immediately .     i doubt if there was any animosity in that message simply a cold statement of fact .  but they meant it .          but why .         why did man exterminate the housefly .         come  sir .  you   re not seriously presenting an analogy of that nature .         why not  since it is certain that the jovian considers us a sort of housefly an insufferable type of housefly that dares aspire to intelligence .      orloff made a last attempt .     but truly  mr .  secretary  it seems impossible for intelligent life to adopt such an attitude .         do you possess much of an acquaintance with any other type of intelligent life than our own .     came with immediate sarcasm .     do you feel competent to pass on jovian psychology .  do you know just how alien jovians must be physically .  just think of their world with its gravity at two and one half earth normal  with its ammonia oceans oceans that you might throw all earth into without raising a respectable splash  with its three thousand mile atmosphere  dragged down by the colossal gravity into densities and pressures in its surface layers that make the sea bottoms of earth resemble a medium thick vacuum .  i tell you we   ve tried to figure out what sort of life could exist under those conditions and we   ve given up .  it   s thoroughly incomprehensible .  do you expect their mentality  then  to be any more understandable .  never .  accept it as it is .  they intend destroying us .  that   s all we know and all we need to know .      he lifted a gloved hand as he finished and one finger pointed .     there   s ether station just ahead .      orloff   s head swiveled     underground .         certainly .  all except the observatory .  that   s that steel and quartz dome to the right the small one .      they had stopped before two large boulders that flanked an earthy embankment  and from behind either one a nosepieced  suited soldier in ganymedan orange  with blasters ready  advanced upon the two .   birnam lifted his face into jupiter   s light and the soldiers saluted and stepped aside .  a short word was barked into the wrist mike of one of them and the camouflaged opening between the boulders fell into two and orloff followed the secretary into the yawning air lock .  the earthman caught one last glimpse of sprawling jupiter before the closing door cut off the surface altogether .   it was no longer beautiful .     orloff did not quite feel normal again until he had seated himself in the overstuffed chair in dr .  edward prosser   s private office .  with a sigh of utter relaxation  he propped his monocle under his eyebrow .      would dr .  prosser mind if i smoked in here  while we   re waiting .     he asked .      go ahead      replied birnam  carelessly .     my own idea would be to drag prosser away from whatever he   s fooling with just now  but he   s a queer chap .  we   ll get more out of him if we wait until he   s ready for us .     he withdrew a gnarled stick of greenish tobacco from its case  and bit off the edge viciously .   orloff smiled through the smoke of his own cigarette     i don   t mind waiting .  i still have something to say .  you see  for the moment  mr .  secretary  you gave me the jitters  but  after all  granted that the jovians intend mischief once they get at us  it remains a fact      and here he spaced his words emphatically     that they can   t get at us .         a bomb without a fuse  hey .         exactly .  it   s simplicity itself  and not really worth discussing .  you will admit  i suppose  that under no circumstances call the jovians get away from jupiter .         under no circumstances .     there was a quizzical tinge in birnam   s slow reply .     shall we analyze that .      he stared hard at the purple flame of his cigar .     it   s an old trite saying that the jovians can   t leave jupiter .  the fact has been highly publicized by the sensation mongers of earth and ganymede and a great deal of sentiment has been driveled about the unfortunate intelligences who are irrevocably surface bound  and must forever stare into the universe without  watching  watching  wondering  and never attaining .      but  after all  what holds the jovians to their planet .  two factors .  that   s all .  the first is the immense gravity field of the planet .  two and a half earth normal .      orloff nodded .     pretty bad .     he agreed .      and jupiter   s gravitational potential is even worse  for because of its greater diameter the intensity of its gravitational field decreases with distance only one tenth as rapidly as earth   s field does .  it   s a terrible problem but it    s been solved .         hey .     orloff straightened .      they   ve got atomic power .  gravity even jupiter   s means nothing once you   ve put unstable atomic nuclei to work for you .      orloff crushed his cigarette to extinction with a nervous gesture .     but their atmosphere         yes  that   s what   s stopping them .  they   re living at the bottom of a three thousand mile deep ocean of it  where the hydrogen of which it is composed is collapsed by sheer pressure to something approaching the density of solid hydrogen .  it stays a gas because the temperature of jupiter is above the critical point of hydrogen  but you just try to figure out the pressure that can make hydrogen gas half as heavy as water .  you   ll be surprised at the number of zeros you   ll have to put down .      no spaceship of metal or of any kind of matter can stand that pressure .  no terrestrial spaceship can land on jupiter without smashing like an eggshell  and no jovian spaceship can leave jupiter without exploding like a soap bubble .  that problem has not yet been solved  but it will be some day .  maybe tomorrow  maybe not for a hundred years  or a thousand .  we don   t know  but when it is solved  the jovians will be on top of us .  and it can be solved in a specific way .         i don   t see how         force fields .  we   ve got them now  you know .         force fields .     orloff seemed genuinely astonished  and he chewed the word over and over to himself for a few moments .     they   re used as meteor shields for ships in the asteroid zone but i don   t see the application to the jovian problem .           the ordinary force field     explained birnam     is a feeble rarefied zone of energy extending over a hundred miles or more outside the ship .  it   ll stop meteors but it   s just so much empty ether to an object like a gas molecule .  but what if you took that same zone of energy and compressed it to a thickness of a tenth of an inch .  molecules would bounce off it like this ping g g g .  and if you used stronger generators  and compressed the field to a hundredth of an inch  molecules would bounce off even when driven by the unthinkable pressure of jupiter   s atmosphere and then if you build a ship inside     he left the sentence dangling .   orloff was pale .     you   re not saying it can be done .         i   ll bet you anything you like that the jovians are trying to do it .  and we   re trying to do it right here at ether station .      the colonial commissioner jerked his chair closer to birnam and grabbed the ganymedan   s wrist .     why can   t we bombard jupiter with atomic bombs .  give it a thorough going over  i mean .  with her gravity  and her surface area  we can   t miss .      birnam smiled faintly     we   ve thought of that .  but atomic bombs would merely tear holes in the atmosphere .  and even if you could penetrate  just divide the surface of jupiter by the area of damage of a single bomb and find how many years we must bombard jupiter at the rate of a bomb a minute before we begin to do significant damage .  jupiter   s big .  don   t ever forget that .      his cigar had gone out  but he did not pause to relight .  he continued in a low  tense voice .     no  we can   t attack the jovians as long as they   re on jupiter .  we must wait for them to come out and once they do  they   re going to have the edge on us in numbers .  a terrific  heart breaking edge so we   ll just have to have the edge on them in science .  .  .      but     orloff broke in  and there was a note of fascinated horror in his voice     how can we tell in advance what they   ll have .         we can   t .  we   ve got to scrape up everything we can lay our hands on and hope for the best .  but there   s one thing we do know they   ll have  and that   s force fields .  they can   t get out without them .  and if they have them  we must  too  and that   s the problem we   re trying to solve here .  they will not insure us victory  but without them  we will suffer certain defeat .  and now you know why we need money and more than that .  we want earth itself to get to work .  it   s got to start a drive for scientific armaments and subordinate everything to that .  you seer  orloff was on his feet .     birnam  i   m with you a hundred percent with you .  you can count on me back in washington .      there was no mistaking his sincerity .  birnam gripped the hand outstretched toward him and wrung it and at the moment  the door flew open and a little pixie of a man hurtled in .     the newcomer spoke in rapid jerks  and exclusively to birnam .     where   d you come from .  been trying to get in touch with you .  secretary said you weren   t in .  then five minutes later you show up on your own .  can   t understand it .     he busied himself furiously at his desk .   birnam grinned .     if you   ll take time out  doc  you might say hello to colonial commissioner orloff .  .  .   dr .  edward prosser turned on his toe like a ballet dancer and looked the earthman up and down twice .     the new un  hey .  we getting any money .  we ought to .  been working on a shoestring ever since .  at that  we might not be needing any .  it depends .     he was back at the desk .   orloff seemed a trifle disconcerted  but birnam winked impressively  and he contented himself with a glassy stare through the monocle .   prosser pounced upon a black leather booklet in the recesses of a pigeonhole  threw himself into his swivel chair and wheeled about .      glad you came  birnam     he said  leafing through the booklet .     got something to show you .  commissioner orloff  too .         what were you keeping us waiting for .     demanded birnam .     where were you .         busy .  busy as a pig .  no sleep for three nights .     he looked up  and his small puckered face fairly hushed with delight .     everything fell into place of a sudden .  like a jig saw puzzle .  never saw anything like it .  kept us hopping  i tell you .         you   ve gotten the dense force fields you   re after .     asked orloff in sudden excitement .   prosser seemed annoyed .     no  not that .  something else .  come on .     he glared at his watch and jumped out of his seat .     we   ve got half an hour .  let   s go .      an electric motored flivver waited outside and prosser spoke excitedly as he sped the purring vehicle down the ramps into the depths of the station .      theory .     he said .     theory .  damned important  that .  you set a technician on a problem .  he   ll fool around .  waste lifetimes .  get nowhere .  just putter about at random .  a true scientist works with theory .  lets math solve his problems .     he overflowed with self satisfaction .   the flivver stopped on a dime before a huge double door and prosser tumbled out  followed by the other two at a more leisurely pace .      through here .  through here .     he said .  he shoved the door open and led them down the corridor and up a narrow flight of stairs onto a wall hugging passageway that circled a huge three level room .  orloff recognized the gleaming quartz and steel pipe sprouting ellipsoid two levels below as an atomic generator .   he adjusted his monocle and watched the scurrying activity below .  an earphoned man on a high stool before a control board studded with dials looked up and waved .  prosser waved back and grinned .   orloff said     you create your force fields here .         that   s right .  ever see one .         no .     the commissioner smiled  ruefully .     i don   t even know what one is  except that it can be used as a meteor shield .      prosser said     it   s very simple .  elementary matter .  all matter is composed of atoms .  atoms are held together by interatomic forces .  take away atoms .  leave interatomic forces behind .  that   s a force field .      orloff looked blank  and birnam chuckled deep in his throat and scratched the back of his ear .      that explanation reminds me of our ganymedan method of suspending an egg a mile high in the air .  it goes like this .  you find a mountain just a mile high and put the egg on top .  then  keeping the egg where it is  you take the mountain away .  that   s all .      the colonial commissioner threw his head back to laugh  and the irascible dr .  prosser puckered his lips in a pursed symbol of disapproval .      come  come .  no joke  you know .  force fields most important .  got to be ready for the jovians when they come        a sudden rasping bur from below sent prosser back from the railing .      get behind screen here     he babbled .     the twenty millimeter field is going up .  bad radiation .      the bur muted almost into silence  and the three walked out onto the passageway again .  there was no apparent change  but prosser shoved his hand out over the railing and said     feel .      orloff extended a cautious finger  gasped  and slapped out with the palm of his hand .  it was like pushing against very soft sponge rubber or superresilient steel springs .   birnam tried  too .     that   s better than anything we   ve done yet  isn   t it .     he explained to orloff      a twenty millimeter screen is one that can hold an atmosphere of a pressure of twenty millimeters of mercury against a vacuum without appreciable leakage .      the commissioner nodded     i see .  you    d need a seven hundred sixty millimeter screen to hold earth   s atmosphere then .         yes .  that would be a unit atmosphere screen .  well  prosser  is this what got you excited .         this twenty millimeter screen .  of course not .  i can go up to two hundred fifty millimeters using the activated vanadium pentasulphide in the praseodymium breakdown .  but it   s not necessary .  technician would do it and blow up the place .  scientist checks on theory and goes slow .     he winked .     we   re hardening the field now .  watch .         shall we get behind the screen .         not necessary now .  radiation bad only at beginning .  .  .   the burring waxed again  but not as loudly as before .  prosser shouted to the man at the control board  and a spreading wave of the hand was the only reply .   then the control man waved a clenched fist and prosser cried     we   ve passed fifty millimeters .  feel the field .      orloff extended his hand and poked it curiously .  the sponge rubber had hardened .  he tried to pinch it between finger and thumb so perfect was the illusion  but here the    rubber .  .  faded to unresisting air .   prosser tch tched impatiently .     no resistance at right angles to force .  elementary mechanics  that is .  .  .   the control man was gesturing again .     past seventy     explained prosser .     we   re slowing down now .  critical point is    .    .      he hung over the railing and kicked out with his feet at the other two .     stay away .  dangerous .      and then he yelled     careful .  the generator   s bucking .      the bur had risen to a hoarse rnaximum and the control man worked frantically at his switches .  from within the quartz heart of the central atomic generator  the sullen red glow of the bursting atoms had brightened dangerously .   there was a break in the bur  a reverberant roar  and a blast of air that threw orloff hard against the wall .   prosser dashed up .  there was a cut over his eye .     hurt .  no .  good  good .  i was expecting something of the sort .  should have warned you .  let   s go down .  where   s birnam .      the tall ganymedan picked herself up off the floor and brushed at his clothes .     here i am .  what blew up .         nothing blew up .  something buckled .  come on  down we go .     he debbed at his forehead with a handkerchief and led the way downward .   the control man removed his earphones as he approached and got off his stool .  he looked tired  and his dirt smeared face was greasy with perspiration .      the damn thing started going at    .    boss .  it almost caught me .         it did  did it .     growled prosser .     within limits of error  isn   t it .  how   s the generator .  hey  stoddard .      the technician addressed replied from his station at the generator     tube   died .  it   ll take two days to replace .      prosser turned in satisfaction and said     it worked .  went exactly as presumed .  problem solved  gentlemen .  trouble over .  let   s get back to my office .  i want to eat .  and then i want to sleep .        he did not refer to the subject again until once more behind the desk in his office  and then he spoke between huge bites of a liver and onion sandwich .   he addressed birnam     remember the work on space strain last june .  it hopped  but we kept at it .  finch got a lead last week and i developed it .  everything fell into place .  slick as goose grease .  never saw anything like it .         go ahead     said birnam  calmly .  he knew prosser sufficiently well to avoid showing impatience .      you saw what happened .  when a field tops    .    millimeters  it becomes unstable .  space won   t stand the strain .  it buckles and the field blows .  boom      birnam   s mouth dropped open and the arms of orloff   s chair creaked under sudden pressure .  silence for a while  and then birnam said unsteadily     you mean force fields stronger than that are impossible .         they   re possible .  you can create them .  but the denser they are  the more unstable they are .  if i had turned on the two hundred and fifty millimeter field  it would have lasted one tenth of a second .  then  blooie .  would have blown up the station .  and myself .  technician would have done it .  scientist is warned by theory .  works carefully  the way i did .  no harm done .      orloff tucked his monocle into his vest pocket and said tremulously     but if a force field is the same thing as interatomic forces  why is it that steel has such a strong interatomic binding force without bucking space .  there   s a haw there .      prosser eyed him in annoyance .     no haw .  critical strength depends on number of generators .  in steel  each atom is a force field generator .  that means about three hundred billion trillion generators for every ounce of matter .  if we could use that many as it is  one hundred generators would be the practical limit .  that only raises the critical point to ninety seven or thereabout .      he got to his feet and continued with sudden fervor     no .  problem   s over  i tell you .  absolutely impossible to create a force field capable of holding earth   s atmosphere for more than a hundredth of a second .  jovian atmosphere entirely out of question .  cold figures say that  backed by experiment .  space won   t stand it .      let the jovians do their damnedest .  they can   t get out .  that   s final .  that   s final .  that   s final .      orloff said     mr .  secretary  can i send a spacegram anywhere in the station .  i want to tell earth that i   m returning by the next ship and that the jovian problem is liquidated entirely and for good .      birnam said nothing  but the relief of his face as he shook hands with the colonial commissioner  transfigured the gaunt homeliness of it unbelievably .   and dr .  prosser repeated  with a birdlike jerk of his head     that   s final .        hal tuttle looked up as captain everett of the spaceship transparent  newest ship of the comet space lines  entered his private observation room in the nose of the ship .   the captain said      a spacegram has just reached me from the home offices at tucson .  we   re to pick up colonial commissioner orloff at jovopolis  ganymede  and take him back to earth .         good .  we haven   t sighted any ships .         no  no .  we   re way off the regular space lanes .  the first the system will know of us will be the landing of the transparent on ganymede .  it will be the greatest thing in space travel since the first trip to the moon .     his voice softened suddenly     what   s wrong  hal .  this is your triumph  after all      hal tuttle looked up and out into the blackness of space .     i suppose it is .  ten years of work  sam .  i lost an arm and an eye in that first explosion  but i don   t regret them .  it   s the reaction that   s got me .  the problem is solved  my lifework is finished .          so is every steel hulled ship in the system .      tuttle smiled .     yes .  it   s hard to realize  isn   t it .     he gestured outward .     you see the stars .  part of the time  there   s nothing between them and us .  it gives me a queazy feeling .     his voice brooded     nine years i worked for nothing .  i wasn   t a theoretician  and never really knew where i was headed just tried everything .  i tried a little too hard and space wouldn   t stand it .  i paid an arm and an eye and started fresh .      captain everett balled his fist and pounded the hull the hull through which the stars shone unobstructed .  there was the muffled thud of flesh striking an unyielding surface but no response whatever from the invisible wall .   tuttle nodded     it   s solid enough  now though it flicks on and off eight hundred thousand times a second .  i got the idea from the stroboscopic lamp .  you know them they flash on and off so rapidly that it gives all the impression of steady illumination .      and so it is with the hull .  it   s not on long enough to buckle space .  it   s not off long enough to allow appreciable leakage of the atmosphere .  and the net effect is a strength better than steel .      he paused and added slowly     and there   s no telling how far we can go .  speed up the intermission effect .  have the field flick off and on millions of times per second billions of times .  you can get fields strong enough to hold an atomic explosion .  my lifework .      captain everett pounded the other   s shoulder .     snap out of it  man .  think of the landing on ganymede .  the devil .  it will be great publicity .  think of orloff   s face  for instance  when he finds he is to be the first passenger in history ever to travel in a spaceship with a force field hull .  how do you suppose he   ll feel .      hal tuttle shrugged .     i imagine he   ll be rather pleased .        the end    with    not final .     i completed my third year as a writer three years since my initial trip to campbell   s office .  in that time i had earned just a hair short of a thousand dollars  not as bad as it sounds in days when college tuition was only four hundred dollars a year  and i had about a quarter of that in my savings account .     still  you can see that there was nothing in that financial record to lead me to think that writing was a possible way of making a living especially since i had no dream of ever writing anything but magazine science fiction .     on june           in the course of a talk with fred pohl  i mentioned my frustration at not being able to make a sale to unknown .  fred said he had a good idea for a fantasy  and from that it was a short step to an agreement to go halfies .  we    d talk the idea over  i would write it  and we   d split the sale  if any  fifty fifty .   fred must have been willing because  as i found out three days later  his magazines were doing poorly and he was being relieved of his editorial position .   it was too bad  of course  but not an irredeemable catastrophe .  pohl had had nearly two years of valuable editorial experience  and the time would come when this would stand him in good stead in a much more important and longer enduring role as editor of galaxy  which during the     s and     s was to compete with astounding for leadership in the field .   as for myself  i could scarcely complain .  pohl had accepted eight of my stories  over a quarter of those i had written and nearly half of those i had sold up to then  . of these  six had already been published and one     super neutron     was safely slated for publication in the forthcoming issue of astonishing .  that left the ninth     christmas on ganymede .     it was not yet paid for  nor had it actually been set in type  and  regretfully  pohl had to return it .  however  i sold it within two weeks to thrilling wonder stories for a little more than pohl would have been able to pay me  so no harm was done even there .  and though i regretted the loss of a market  pohl had safely seen me through the period during which i developed to the point where campbell and astounding itself could become my major market .   at first  when    christmas on ganymede    was returned  i thought it was because the pohl magazines had been suspended altogether .  if the publishers had intended that  they changed their minds .  astonishing continued a couple of years  until it was killed by the world war ii paper shortage .  super science stories survived world war ii and even a little past the     s  and was yet to publish one more story of mine .   but back to june    taking fred   s fantasy idea  i wrote the story entirely on my own  calling it    legal rights .     once again  though  a collaboration didn   t succeed .  on july    campbell rejected it  the first rejection i had received from him in half a year .   by that time  though  fred was agenting again .  i gave him the story  rather shamefacedly  and forgot about it .  he changed the name to    legal rites     much better  and rewrote it quite a bit .  seven years later  he actually sold it .       legal rites    with james maccreigh     i    already the stars were out  though the sun had just dipped under the horizon  and the sky of the west was a blood stuck gold behind the sierra nevadas .      hey .     squawked russell harley .     come back .      but the one lunged motor of the old ford was making too much noise  the driver didn   t hear him .  harley cursed as he watched the old car careen along the sandy ruts on its half flat tires .  its taillight was saying a red no to him .  no  you can   t get away tonight  no  you   ll have to stay here and fight it out .   harley grunted and climbed back up the porch stairs of the old wooden house .  it was well made  anyhow .  the stairs  though half a century old  neither creaked beneath him nor showed cracks .   harley picked up the bags he   d dropped when he experienced his abrupt change of mind fake leather and worn out  they were and carted them into the house .  he dumped them on a dust jacketed sofa and looked around .   it was stifling hot  and the smell of the desert outside had permeated the room .  harley sneezed .      water     he said out loud .     that   s what i need .      he   d prowled through every room on the ground floor before he stopped still and smote his head .  plumbing naturally there   d be no plumbing in this hole eight miles out on the desert .  a well was the best he could hope for  if that .   it was getting dark .  no electric lights either  of course .  he blundered irritatedly through the dusky rooms to the back of the house .  the screen door shrieked metallically as he opened it .  a bucket hung by the door .  he picked it up  tipped it  shook the loose sand out of it .  he looked over the    back yard    about thirty thousand visible acres of hilly sand  rock and patches of sage and flame tipped ocotillo .   no well .   the old fool got water from somewhere  he thought savagely .  obstinately he climbed down the back steps and wandered out into the desert .  overhead the stars were blinding  a million billion of them  but the sunset was over already and he could see only hazily .  the silence was murderous .  only a faint whisper of breeze over the sand  and the slither of his shoes .   he caught a glimmer of starlight from the nearest clump of sage and walked to it .  there was a pool of water  caught in the angle of two enormous boulders .  he stared at it doubtfully  then shrugged .  it was water .  it was better than nothing .  he dipped the bucket in the little pool .  knowing nothing of the procedure  he filled it with a quart of loose sand as he scooped it along the bottom .  when he lifted it  brimful  to his lips  he spat out the first mouthful and swore violently .   then he used his head .  he set the bucket down  waited a second for the sand grains to settle  cupped water in his hands  lifted it to his lips .  .  .  .   pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss      what the hell .     harley stood up  looked around in abrupt puzzlement .  it sounded like water dripping from somewhere  onto a redhot stove  hashing into sizzling steam .  he saw nothing  only the sand and the sage and the pool of tepid  sickly water .   pat .  hiss  then he saw it  and his eyes bulged .  out of nowhere it was dripping  a drop a second  a sticky  dark drop that was thicker than water  that fell to the ground lazily  in slow defiance of gravity .  and when it struck each drop sizzled and skittered about  and vanished .  it was perhaps eight feet from him  just visible in the starlight .   and then     get off my land .     said the voice from nowhere .     harley got .  by the time he got to rebel butte three hours later  he was barely managing to walk  wishing desperately that he   d delayed long enough for one more good drink of water  despite all the fiends of hell .  but he   d run the first three miles .  he   d had plenty of encouragement .  he remembered with a shudder how the clear desert air had taken milkly shape around the incredible trickle of dampness and had advanced on him threateningly .   and when he got to the first kerosene lighted saloon of rebel butte  and staggered inside  the saloonkeeper   s fascinated stare at the front of his shoddy coat showed him strong evidence that he hadn   t been suddenly taken with insanity  or drunk on the unaccustomed sensation of fresh desert air .  all down the front of him it was  and the harder he rubbed the harder it stayed  the stickier it got .  blood .      whiskey .     he said in a strangled voice  tottering to the bar .  he pulled a threadbare dollar bill from his pocket  flapped it onto the mahogany .   the blackjack game at the back of the room had stopped .  harley was acutely conscious of the eyes of the players  the bartender and the tall  lean man leaning on the bar .  all were watching him .   the bartender broke the spell .  he reached for a bottle behind him without looking at it  placed it on the counter before harley .  he poured a glass of water from a jug  set it down with a shot glass beside the bottle .      i could of told you that would happen      he said casually .     only you wouldn   t of believed me .  you had to meet hank for yourself before you   d believe he was there      harley remembered his thirst and drained the glass of water  then poured himself a shot of the whiskey and swallowed it without waiting for the chaser to be refilled .  the whiskey felt good going down  almost good enough to stop his internal shakes .      what are you talking about .     he said finally .  he twisted his body and leaned forward across the bar to partly hide the stains on his coat .  the saloonkeeper laughed .      old hank     he said .     i knowed who you was right away  even before tom came back and told me where he   d took you .  i knowed you was zeb harley   s no good nephew  come to take harley hall an    sell it before he was cold in the grave .      the blackjack players were still watching him  russell harley saw .  only the lean man farther along the bar seemed to have dismissed him .  he was pouring himself another drink  quite occupied with his task .   harley flushed .     listen     he said     i didn   t come in here for advice .  i wanted a drink .  i   m paying for it .  keep your mouth out of this .      the saloonkeeper shrugged .  he turned his back and walked away to the blackjack table .  after a couple of seconds one of the players turned  too  and threw a card down .  the others followed suit .   harley was just getting set to swallow his pride and talk to the saloonkeeper again he seemed to know something about what harley   d been through  and might be helpful when the lean man tapped his shoulder .  harley whirled and almost dropped his glass .  absorbed and jumpy  he hadn   t seen him come up .      young man      said the lean one     my name   s nicholls .  come along with me  sir  and we   ll talk this thing over .  i think we may be of service to each other .        even the twelve cylinder car nicholls drove jounced like a haywagon over the sandy ruts leading to the place old zeb had laughingly named    harley hall .      russell harley twisted his neck and stared at the heap of paraphernalia in the open rumble seat .     i don   t like it      he complained .     i never had anything to do with ghosts .  how do i know this stuff   ll work .      nicholls smiled .     you   ll have to take my word for it .  i   ve had dealings with ghosts before .  you could say that i might qualify as a ghost exterminator  if i chose .      harley growled .     i still don   t like it .     nicholls turned a sharp look on him .     you like the prospect of owning harley hall  don   t you .  and looking for all the money your late uncle is supposed to have hidden around somewhere .     harley shrugged .     certainly you do     said nicholls  returning his eyes to the road .      and with good reason .  the local reports put the figure pretty high  young man .         that   s where you come in  i guess     harley said sullenly .     i find the money that i own anyhow and give some of it to you .  how much .         we   ll discuss that later     nicholls said .  he smiled absently as he looked ahead .      we   ll discuss it right now .      the smile faded from nicholls    face .     no     he said .     we won   t .  i   ve doing you a favor  young harley .  remember that .  in return you   ll do as i say  all the way .      harley digested that carefully  and it was not a pleasant meal .  he waited a couple of seconds before he changed the subject .      i was out here once when the old man was alive     he said .     he didn   t say nothing about any ghost .          perhaps he felt you might think him well  peculiar     nicholls said .     and perhaps you would have .  when were you here .         oh  a long time ago     harley said evasively .     but i was here a whole day  and part of the night .  the old man was crazy as a coot  but he didn   t keep any ghosts in the attic .  .  .      this ghost was a friend of his .     nicholls said .     the gentleman in charge of the bar told you that .  surely .  your late uncle was something of a recluse .  he lived in this house a dozen miles from nowhere .  came into town hardly ever .  wouldn   t let anyone get friendly with him .  but he wasn   t exactly a hermit .  he had hank for company .         fine company .  .  .     nicholls inclined his head seriously .     oh  i don   t know .     he said .     from all accounts  they got on well together .  they played pinochle and chess hank   s supposed to have been a great pinochle player .  he was killed that way  according to the local reports .  caught somebody dealing from the bottom and shot it out with him .  he lost .  a bullet pierced his throat and he died quite bloodily .  .  .  he turned the wheel  putting his weight into the effort  and succeeded in twisting the car out of the ruts of the    road      sent it jouncing across unmarked sand to the old frame house to which they were going .      that     he finished as he pulled up before the porch .     accounts for the blood that accompanies his apparition .  .  .   harley opened the door slowly and got out  looking uneasily at the battered old house .  nicholls cut the motor  got out and walked at once to the back of the car .      come on .     he said  dragging things out of the compartment .     give me a hand with this .  i   ve not going to carry this stuff all by myself .  .  .   harley came around reluctantly  regarded the curious assortment of bundles of dried faggots  lengths of colored cord  chalk pencils  ugly little bunches of wilted weeds  bleached bones of small animals and a couple of less pleasant things without pleasure .   pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss      he   s here .     harley yelped .     listen .  he   s someplace around here watching us .         ha .      the laugh was deep  unpleasant and bodiless .  harley looked around desperately for the tell tale trickle of blood .  and he found it  from the air it issued  just beside the car  sinking gracefully to the ground and sizzling  vanishing  there .      i   m watching you  all right     the voice said grimly .     russell  you worthless piece of corruption  i   ve got no more use for you than you used to have for me .  dead or alive  this is my land .  i shared it with your uncle  you young scalawag  but i won   t share it with you .  get out .      harley   s knees weakened and he tottered dizzily to the rear bumper  sat on it .     nicholls     he said confusedly .      oh  brace up     nicholls said with irritation .  he tossed a ball of gaudy twine  red and green  with curious knots tied along it  to harley .  then he confronted the trickle of blood and made a few brisk passes in the air before it .  his lips were moving silently  harley saw  but no words came out .   there was a gasp and a chopped off squawk from the source of the blood drops .  nicholls clapped his hands sharply  then turned to young harley .      take that cord you have in your hands and stretch it around the house     he said .      all the way around  and make sure it goes right across the middle of the doors and windows .  it isn   t much  but it   ll hold him till we can get the good stuff set up .      harley nodded  then pointed a rigid finger at the drops of blood  now sizzling and fuming more angrily than before .     what about that .     he managed to get out .   nicholls grinned complacently .     i   ll hold him here till the cows come home     he said .     get moving .        harley inadvertently inhaled a lungful of noxious white smoke and coughed till the tears rolled down his cheeks .  when he recovered he looked at nicholls  who was reading silently from a green leather book with dog eared pages .  he said     can i stop stirring this now .      nicholls grimaced angrily and shook his head without looking at him .  he went on reading  his lips contorting over syllables that were not in any language harley had ever heard  then snapped the book shut and wiped his brow .      fine     he said .     so far  so good .     he stepped over to windward of the boiling pot harley was stirring on the hob over the fireplace  peered down into it cautiously .      that   s about done     he said .     take it off the fire and let it cool a bit .      harley lifted it down  then squeezed his aching biceps with his left hand .  the stuff was the consistency of sickly green fudge .      now what .     he asked .   nicholls didn   t answer .  he looked up in mild surprise at the sudden squawk of triumph from outside  followed by the howling of a chill wind .      hank must be loose     he said casually .     he can   t do us any harm  i think  but we   d better get a move on .     he rummaged in the dwindled pile of junk he   d brought from the car  extracted a paintbrush .     smear this stuff around all the windows and doors .  all but the front door .  for that i have something else .     he pointed to what seemed to be the front axle of an old model t .     leave that on the doorsill .  cold iron .  you can just step over it  but hank won   t be able to pass it .  it   s been properly treated already with the very best thaumaturgy .         step over it      harley repeated .     what would i want to step over it for .  he   s out there .         he won   t hurt you     said nicholls .     you will carry an amulet with you that one  there that will keep him away .  probably he couldn   t really hurt you anyhow  being a low order ghost who can   t materialize to any great density .  but just to take no chances  carry the amulet and don   t stay out too long .  it won   t hold him off forever  not for more than half an hour .  if you ever have to go out and stay for any length of time  tie that bundle of herbs around your neck .     nicholls smiled .     that   s only for emergencies  though .  it works on the asafoetida principle .  ghosts can   t come anywhere near it but you won   t like it much yourself .  it has ah a rather definite odor .      he leaned gingerly over the pot again  sniffing .  he sneezed .      well  that   s cool enough     he said .     before it hardens  get moving .  start spreading the stuff upstairs and make sure you don   t miss any windows .         what are you going to do .         i     said nicholls sharply     will be here .  start .      but he wasn   t .  when harley finished his disagreeable task and came down  he called nicholls    name  but the man was gone .  hurley stepped to the door and looked out  the car was gone  too .   he shrugged .     oh  well      he said  and began taking the dust cloths off the furniture .     ii    somewhere within the cold  legal mind of lawyer turnbull  he weighed the comparative likeness of nightmare and insanity .   he stared at the plush chair facing him  noted with distinct uneasiness how the strangely weightless  strangely sourceless trickle of redness disappeared as it hit the floor  but left long  mud ochre streaks matted on the upholstery .  the sound was unpleasant  too  pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss   the voice continued impatiently     damn your human stupidity .  i may be a ghost  but heaven knows i   m not trying to haunt you .  friend  you   re not that important to me .  get this i   m here on business .      turnbull learned that you cannot wet dry lips with a dehydrated tongue .     legal business .         sure .  the fact that i was once killed by violence  and have to continue my existence on the astral plane  doesn   t mean i   ve lost my legal rights .  does it .      the lawyer shook his head in bafflement .  he said     this would be easier on me if you weren   t invisible .  can   t you do something about it .      there was a short pause .     well  i could materialize for a minute     the voice said .     it   s hard work damn hard  for me .  there are a lot of us astral entities that can do it easy as failing out of bed  but well  if i have to i shall try to do it once .      there was a shimmering in the air above the armchair  and a milky  thin smoke condensed into an intangible seated figure .  turnbull took no delight in noting that  through the figure  the outlines of the chair were still hazily visible .  the figure thickened .  just as the features took form just as turnbull   s bulging eyes made out a prominent hooked nose and a crisp beard it thinned and exploded with a soft pop .   the voice said weakly     i didn   t think i was that bad .  i   m way out of practice .  i guess that   s the first daylight materialization i   ve made in seventy five years .      the lawyer adjusted his rimless glasses and coughed .  hell   s binges  he thought  the worst thing about this is that i   m believing it .         oh  well      he said aloud .  then he hurried on before the visitor could take offense     just what did you want .  i   m just a small town lawyer  you know .  my business is fairly routine         i know all about your business     the voice said .     you can handle my case it   s a land affair .  i want to sue russell harley .         harley .     turnbull fingered his cheek .      any relation to zeb harley .         his nephew and his heir  too .      turnbull nodded .     yes  i remember now .  my wife   s folks live in rebel butte  and i   ve been there .  quite a coincidence you should come to me      the voice laughed .     it was no coincidence     it said softly .      oh .     turnbull was silent for a second .  then     i see     he said .  he cast a shrewd glance at the chair .     lawsuits cost money  mr .  i don   t think you mentioned your name .         hank jenkins     the voice prompted .     i know that .  would let   s see .  would six hundred and fifty dollars be sufficient .      turnbull swallowed .     i think so     he said in a relatively unemotional tone relative to what he was thinking .      then suppose we call that your retainer .  i happen to have cached a considerable sum in gold when i was that is to say  before i became an astral entity .  i   m quite certain it hasn   t been disturbed .  you will have to call it treasure trove  i guess  and give half of it to the state  but there   s thirteen hundred dollars altogether .      turnbull nodded judiciously .     assuming we can locate your trove     he said     i think that would be quite satisfactory .     he leaned back in his chair and looked legal .  his aplomb had returned .   and half an hour later he said slowly     i   ll take your case .        judge lawrence gimbel had always liked his job before .  but his thirteen honorable years on the bench lost their flavor for him as he grimaced wearily and reached for his gavel .  this case was far too confusing for his taste .   the clerk made his speech  and the packed courtroom sat down en masse .  gimbel held a hand briefly to his eyes before he spoke .      is the counsel for the plaintiff ready .         i am  your honor .     turnbull  alone at his table  rose and bowed .      the counsel for the defendant .         ready  your honor .     fred wilson snapped .  he looked with a hard flicker of interest at turnbull and his solitary table  then leaned over and whispered in russell harley   s ear .  the youth nodded glumly  then shrugged .   gimbel said     i understand the attorneys for both sides have waived jury trial in this case of henry jenkins versus russell joseph harley .      both lawyers nodded .  gimbel continued     in view of the unusual nature of this case  i imagine it will prove necessary to conduct it with a certain amount of informality .  the sole purpose of this court is to arrive at the true facts at issue  and to deliver a verdict in accord with the laws pertaining to these facts .  i will not stand on ceremony .  nevertheless  i will not tolerate any disturbances or unnecessary irregularities .  the spectators will kindly remember that they are here on privilege .  any demonstration will result in the clearing of the court .      he looked severely at the white faces that gleamed unintelligently up at him .  he suppressed a sigh as he said     the counsel for the plaintiff will begin .      turnbull rose quickly to his feet  faced the judge .      your honor     he said     we propose to show that my client  henry jenkins  has been deprived of his just rights by the defendant .  mr .  jenkins  by virtue of a sustained residence of more than twenty years in the house located on route     eight miles north of the town of rebel butte  with the full knowledge of its legal owner  has acquired certain rights .  in legal terminology we define these as the rights of adverse possession .  the layman would call them common law rights squatters    rights .      gimbel folded his hands and tried to relax .  squatters    rights for a ghost .  he sighed  but listened attentively as turnbull went on .      upon the death of zebulon harley  the owner of the house involved it is better known  perhaps  as harley hall the defendant inherited title to the property .  we do not question his right to it .  but my client has an equity in harley hall  the right to free and full existence .  the defendant has forcefully evicted my client  by means which have caused my client great mental distress  and have even endangered his very existence .      gimbel nodded .  if the case only had a precedent somewhere .  .  .  .  but it hadn   t  he remembered grimly the hours he   d spent thumbing through all sorts of unlikely law books  looking for anything that might bear on the case .  it had been his better judgment that he throw the case out of court outright a judge couldn   t afford to have himself laughed at  not if he were ambitious .  and public laughter was about the only certainty there was to this case .  but wilson had put up such a fight that the judge   s temper had taken over .  he never did like wilson  anyhow .      you may proceed with your witnesses     he said .   turnbull nodded .  to the clerk he said     call henry jenkins to the stand .      wilson was on his feet before the clerk opened his mouth .      objection .     he bellowed .     the so called henry jenkins cannot qualify as a witness .         why not .     demanded turnbull .      because he   s dead .      the judge clutched his gavel with one hand  forehead with the other .  he banged on the desk to quiet the courtroom .   turnbull stood there  smiling .     naturally     he said     you   ll have proof of that statement .      wilson snarled .     certainly .     he referred to his brief .     the so called henry jenkins is the ghost  spirit or specter of one hank jenkins  who prospected for gold in this territory a century ago .  he was killed by a bullet through the throat from the gun of one long tom cooper  and was declared legally dead on september          .  cooper was hanged for his murder .  no matter what hocus pocus you produce for evidence to the contrary now  that status of legal death remains completely valid .         what evidence have you of the identity of my client with this hank jenkins .     turnbull asked grimly .      do you deny it .      turnbull shrugged .     i deny nothing .  i   m not being cross examined .  furthermore  the sole prerequisite of a witness is that he understand the value of an oath .  henry jenkins was tested by john quincy fitzjames  professor of psychology at the university of southern california .  the results i have dr .  fitzjames    sworn statement of them here  which i will introduce as an exhibit show clearly that my client   s intelligence quotient is well above normal  and that a psychiatric examination discloses no important aberrations which would injure his validity as a witness .  i insist that my client be allowed to testify on his own behalf .         but he   s dead .     squawked wilson .     he   s invisible right now .         my client .     said turnbull stiffly     is not present just now .  undoubtedly that accounts for what you term his invisibility .     he paused for the appreciative murmur that swept through the court .  things were breaking perfectly  he thought  smiling .     i have here another affidavit     he said .     it is signed by elihu james and terence macrae  who respectively head the departments of physics and biology at the same university .  it states that my client exhibits all the vital phenomena of life .  i am prepared to call all three of my expert witnesses to the stand  if necessary .      wilson scowled but said nothing .  judge gimbel leaned forward .     i don   t see how it is possible for me to refuse the plaintiff the right to testify     he said .     if the three experts who prepared these reports will testify on the stand to the facts contained in them  henry jenkins may then take the stand .      wilson sat down heavily .  the three experts spoke briefly and dryly .  wilson put them through only the most formal of cross examinations .     the judge declared a brief recess .  in the corridor outside  wilson and his client lit cigarettes and looked unsympathetically at each other .      i feel like a fool     said russell harley .     bringing suit against a ghost .         the ghost brought the suit     wilson reminded him .     if only we   d been able to hold fire for a couple more weeks  till another judge came on the bench  i could   ve got this thing thrown right out of court .         well  why couldn   t we wait .         because you were in such a damn hurry .     wilson said .     you and that idiot nicholls so confident that it would never come to trial .      harley shrugged  and thought unhappily of their failure in completely exorcising the ghost of hank jenkins .  that had been a mess .  jenkins had somehow escaped from the charmed circle they   d drawn around him  in which they   d hoped to keep him till the trial was forfeited by non appearance .      that   s another thing     said wilson .     where is nicholls .      harley shrugged again .     i dunno .  the last i saw of him was in your office .  he came around to see me right after the deputy slapped the show cause order on me at the house .  he brought me down to you said you   d been recommended to him .  then you and him and i talked about the case for a while .  he went out  after he lent me a little money to help meet your retainer .  haven   t seen him since .         i   d like to know who recommended me to him     wilson said grimly .     i don   t think he   d ever recommend anybody else .  i don   t like this case and i don   t much like you .      harley growled but said nothing .  he flung his cigarette away .  it tasted of the garbage that hung around his neck everything did .  nicholls had told no lies when he said harley wouldn   t much like the bundle of herbs that would ward off the ghost of old jenkins .  they smelled .   the court clerk was in the corridor  bawling something  and people were beginning to trickle back in .  harley and his attorney went with them .   when the trial had been resumed  the clerk said     henry jenkins .      wilson was on his feet at once .  he opened the door of the judge   s chamber  said something in a low tone .  then he stepped back  as if to let someone through .   pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss   there was a concerted gasp from the spectators as the weirdly appearing trickle of blood moved slowly across the open space to the witness chair .  this was the ghost the plaintiff in the most eminently absurd case in the history of jurisprudence .      all right  hank     turnbull whispered .     you   ll have to materialize long enough to let the clerk swear you in .      the clerk drew back nervously at the pillar of milky fog that appeared before him  vaguely humanoid in shape .  a phantom hand  half transparent  reached out to touch the bible .  the clerk   s voice shook as he administered the oath  and heard the response come from the heart of the cloudpillar .   the haze drifted into the witness chair  bent curiously at about hip height  and popped into nothingness .   the judge banged his gavel wildly .  the buzz of alarm that had arisen from the spectators died out .      i   ll warn you again     he declared     that unruliness will not be tolerated .  the counsel for the plaintiff may proceed .      turnbull walked to the witness chair and addressed its emptiness .          your name .         my name is henry jenkins .         your occupation .      there was a slight pause .     i have none .  i guess you   d say i   m retired .         mr .  jenkins  just what connection have you with the building referred to as harley hall .         i have occupied it for ninety years .         during this time  did you come to know the late zebulon harley  owner of the hall .         i knew zeb quite well .      turnbull nodded .     when did you make his acquaintance .     he asked .      in the spring of      .  zeb had just lost his wife .  after that  you see  he made harley hall his year round home .  he became well  more or less of a hermit .  before that we had never met  since he was only seldom at the hall .  but we became friendly then .         how long did this friendship last .         until he died last fall .  i was with him when he died .  i still have a few keepsakes he left me then .     there was a distinct nostalgic sigh from the witness chair  which by now was liberally spattered with muddy red liquid .  the falling drops seemed to hesitate for a second  and their sizzling noise was muted as with a strong emotion .   turnbull went on     your relations with him were good  then .         i   d call them excellent     the emptiness replied firmly .     every night we sat up together .  when we didn   t play pinochle or chess or cribbage  we just sat and talked over the news of the day .  i still have the book we used to keep records of the chess and pinochle games .  zeb made the entries himself  in his own handwriting .        turnbull abandoned the witness for a moment .  he faced the judge with a smile .     i offer in evidence     he said     the book mentioned .  also a ring given to the plaintiff by the late mr .  harley  and a copy of the plays of gilbert and sullivan .  on the flyleaf of this book is inscribed     to old hank     in harley   s own hand .      he turned again to the empty  blood leaking witness chair .   he said     in all your years of association  did zebulon harley ever ask you to leave  or to pay rent .         of course not .  not zeb .      turnbull nodded .     very good     he said .     now  just one or two more questions .  will you tell in your own words what occurred  after the death of zebulon harley  that caused you to bring this suit .         well  in january young harley         you mean russell joseph harley  the defendant .         yes .  he arrived at harley hall on january fifth .  i asked him to leave  which he did .  on the next day he returned with another man .  they placed a talisman upon the threshold of the main entrance  and soon after sealed every threshold and windowsill in the hall with a substance which is noxious to me .  these activities were accompanied by several of the most deadly spells in the ars magicorum .  he further added an exclusion circle with a radius of a little over a mile  entirely surrounding the hall .         i see     the lawyer said .     will you explain to the court the effects of these activities .         well     the voice said thoughtfully     it   s a little hard to put in words .  i can   t pass the circle without a great expenditure of energy .  even if i did i couldn   t enter the building because of the talisman and the seals .         could you enter by air .  through a chimney  perhaps .         no .  the exclusion circle is really a sphere .  i   m pretty sure the effort would destroy me .         in effect  then  you are entirely barred from the house you have occupied for ninety years  due to the wilful acts of russell joseph harley  the defendant  and an unnamed accomplice of his .         that is correct .      turnbull beamed .     thank you .  that   s all .      he turned to wilson  whose face had been a study in dourness throughout the entire examination .     your witness     he said .   wilson snapped to his feet and strode to the witness chair .   he said belligerently     you say your name is henry jenkins .         yes .         that is your name now  you mean to say .  what was your name before .         before .     there was surprise in the voice that emanated from above the trickling blood drops .     before when .      wilson scowled .     don   t pretend ignorance     he said sharply .     before you died  of course .         objection .     turnbull was on his feet  glaring at wilson .     the counsel for the defense has no right to speak of some hypothetical death of my client .      gimbel raised a hand wearily and cut off the words that were forming on wilson   s lips .     objection sustained     he said .     no evidence has been presented to identify the plaintiff as the prospector who was killed in      or anyone else .      wilson   s mouth twisted into a sour grimace .  he continued on a lower key .      you say  mr .  jenkins  that you occupied harley hall for ninety years .         ninety two years next month .  the hall wasn   t built in its present form  anyhow until       but i occupied the house that stood on the site previously .         what did you do before then .         before then .     the voice paused  then said doubtfully     i don   t remember .         you   re under oath .     wilson flared .   the voice got firmer .     ninety years is a long time     it said .     i don   t remember .         let   s see if i can   t refresh your memory .  is it true that ninety one years ago  in the very year in which you claim to have begun your occupancy of harley hall  hank jenkins was killed in a gun duel .         that may be true  if you say so .  i don   t remember .         do you remember that the shooting occurred not fifty feet from the present site of harley hall .         it may be .         well  then     wilson thundered     is it not a fact that when hank jenkins died by violence his ghost assumed existence .  that it was then doomed to haunt the site of its slaying throughout eternity .      the voice said evenly     i have no knowledge of that .         do you deny that it is well known throughout that section that the ghost of hank jenkins haunts harley hall .         objection .     shouted turnbull .     popular opinion is not evidence .         objection sustained .  strike the question from the record .      wilson  badgered  lost his control .  in a dangerously uneven voice  he said     perjury is a criminal offense .  mr .  jenkins  do you deny that you are the ghost of hank jenkins .      the tone was surprised .     why  certainly .         you are a ghost  aren   t you .      stiffly     i   m an entity on the astral plane .         that  i believe  is what is called a ghost .         i can   t help what it   s called .  i   ve heard you called a lot of things .  is that proof .      there was a surge of laughter from the audience .  gimbel slammed his gavel down on the bench .      the witness     he said     will confine himself to answering questions .      wilson bellowed     in spite of what you say  it   s true  isn   t it  that you are merely the spirit of a human being who had died through violence .      the voice from above the blood drops retorted     i repeat that i am an entity of the astral plane .  i am not aware that i was ever a human being .      the lawyer turned an exasperated face to the bench .      your honor     he said     i ask that you instruct the witness to cease playing verbal hide and seek .  it is quite evident that the witness is a ghost  and that he is therefore the relict of some human being  ipso facto .  circumstantial evidence is strong that he is the ghost of the hank jenkins who was killed in      .  but this is a non essential point .  what is definite is that he is the ghost of someone who is dead  and hence is unqualified to act as witness .  i demand his testimony be stricken from the record .        turnbull spoke up at once .     will the counsel for the defense quote his authority for branding my client a ghost in the face of my client   s repeated declaration that he is an entity of the astral plane .  what is the legal definition of a ghost .      judge gimbel smiled .     counsel for the defense will proceed with the cross examination     he said .   wilson   s face hushed dark purple .  he mopped his brow with a large bandanna  then glared at the dropping  sizzling trickle of blood .      whatever you are     he said     answer me this question .  can you pass through a wall .         why  yes .  certainly .     there was a definite note of surprise in the voice from nowhere .     but it isn   t as easy as some people think .  it definitely requires a lot of effort .         never mind that .  you can do it .         yes .         could you be bound by any physical means .  would handcuffs hold you .  or ropes  chains  prison walls  a hermetically sealed steel chest .      jenkins had no chance to answer .  turnbull  scenting danger  cut in hastily .     i object to this line of questioning .  it is entirely irrelevant .          on the contrary     wilson cried loudly     it bears strongly on the qualifications of the so called henry jenkins as a witness .  i demand that he answer the question .      judge gimbel said     objection overruled .  witness will answer the question .      the voice from the chair said superciliously     i don   t mind answering .  physical barriers mean nothing to me  by and large .      the counsel for the defense drew himself up triumphantly .      very good     he said with satisfaction .     very good .     then to the judge  the words coming sharp and fast     i claim  your honor  that the so called henry jenkins has no legal status as a witness in court .  there is clearly no value in understanding the nature of an oath if a violation of the oath can bring no punishment in its wake .  the statements of a man who can perjure himself freely have no worth .  i demand they be stricken from the record .      turnbull was at the judge   s bench in two strides .      i had anticipated that  your honor     he said quickly .     from the very nature of the case  however  it is clear that my client can be very definitely restricted in his movements spells  pentagrams  talismans  amulets  exclusion circles and what not .  i have here which i am prepared to deliver to the bailiff of the court a list of the various methods of confining an astral entity to a restricted area for periods ranging from a few moments to all eternity .  moreover  i have also signed a bond for five thousand dollars  prior to the beginning of the trial  which i stand ready to forfeit should my client be confined and make his escape  if found guilty of any misfeasance as a witness .      gimbel   s face  which had looked startled for a second  slowly cleared .  he nodded .     the court is satisfied with the statement of the counsel for the plaintiff     he declared .     there seems no doubt that the plaintiff can be penalized for any misstatements  and the motion of the defense is denied .      wilson looked choleric  but shrugged .      all right     he said .     that will be all         you may step down  mr .  jenkins     gimbel directed  and watched in fascination as the blood dripping column rose and floated over the floor  along the corridor  out the door .   turnbull approached the judge   s bench again .  he said     i would like to place in evidence these notes  the diary of the late zebulon harley .  it was presented to my client by harley himself last fall .  i call particular attention to the entry for april sixth  nineteen seventeen  in which he mentions the entrance of the united states into the first world war  and records the results of a series of eleven pinochle games played with a personage identified as    old hank .     with the court   s permission  i will read the entry for that day  and also various other entries for the next four years .  please note the references to someone known variously as    jenkins        hank jenkins    and in one extremely significant passage    old invisible       wilson stewed silently during the slow reading of harley   s diary .  there was anger on his face  but he paid close attention  and when the reading was over he leaped to his feet .      i would like to know     he asked     if the counsel for the plaintiff is in possession of any diaries after nineteen twenty .      turnbull shook his head .     harley apparently never kept a diary  except during the four years represented in this .         then i demand that the court refuse to admit this diary as evidence on two counts     wilson said .  he raised two fingers to tick off the points .     in the first place  the evidence presented is frivolous .  the few vague and unsatisfactory references to jenkins nowhere specifically describe him as what he is ghost  astral entity or what you will .  second  the evidence  even were the first point overlooked  concerns only the years up to nineteen twenty one .  the case concerns itself only with the supposed occupation of harley hall by the so called jenkins in the last twenty years since    twenty one .  clearly  the evidence is therefore irrelevant .      gimbel looked at turnbull  who smiled calmly .      the reference to    old invisible    is far from vague     he said .     it is a definite indication of the astral character of my client .  furthermore  evidence as to the friendship of my client with the late mr .  zebulon harley before nineteen twenty one is entirely relevant  as such a friendship  once established  would naturally be presumed to have continued indefinitely .  unless of course  the defense is able to present evidence to the contrary .      judge gimbel said     the diary is admitted as evidence .      turnbull said     i rest my case .      there was a buzz of conversation in the courtroom while the judge looked over the diary  and then handed it to the clerk to be marked and entered .   gimbel said     the defense may open its case .      wilson rose .  to the clerk he said     russell joseph harley .      but young harley was recalcitrant .     nix      he said  on his feet  pointing at the witness chair .     that thing   s got blood all over it .  you don   t expect me to sit down in that large puddle of blood  do you .      judge gimbel leaned over to look at the chair .  the drip drop trickle of blood from the apparition who   d been testifying had left its mark .  muddy brown all down the front of the chair .  gimbel found himself wondering how the ghost managed to replenish its supply of the fluid  but gave it up .      i see your point     he said .     well  it   s getting a bit late anyhow .  the clerk will take away the present witness chair and replace it .  in the interim  i declare the court recessed till tomorrow morning at ten o   clock .        iii    russell harley noticed how the elevator boy   s back registered repulsion and disapproval  and scowled .  he was not a popular guest in the hotel  he knew well .  where he made his mistake  though  was in thinking that the noxious bundle of herbs about his neck was the cause of it .  his odious personality had a lot to do with the chilly attitude of the management and his fellow guests .   he made his way to the bar  ignoring the heads that turned in surprise to follow the reeking comet tail of his passage .  he entered the red leather and chromium drinking room  and stared about for lawyer wilson .   and blinked in surprise when he saw him .  wilson wasn   t alone .  in the booth with him was a tall  dark figure  with his back to harley .  the back alone was plenty for recognition .  nicholls .   wilson had seen him .     hello  harley     he said  all smiles and affability in the presence of the man with the money .     come on and sit down .  mr .  nicholls dropped in on me a little while ago  so i brought him over .         hello     harley said glumly  and nicholls nodded .  the muscles of his cheeks pulsed  and he seemed under a strain  strangely uncomfortable in harley   s presence .  still there was a twinkle in the look he gave young harley  and his voice was friendly enough though supercilious as he said      hello  harley .  how is the trial going .         ask him     said harley  pointing a thumb at wilson as he slid his knees under the booth   s table and sat down .     he   s the lawyer .  he   s supposed to know these things .         doesn   t he .      harley shrugged and craned his neck for the waitress .     oh  i guess so .  .  .  . rye and water .     he watched the girl appreciatively as she nodded and went off to the bar  then turned his attention back to nicholls .     the trouble is     he said     wilson may think he knows  but i think he   s all wet      wilson frowned .     do you imply     he began  but nicholls put up a hand .      let   s not bicker     said nicholls .     suppose you answer my question .  i have a stake in this  and i want to know .  how   s the trial going .      wilson put on his most open faced expression .     frankly     he said     not too well .  i   m afraid the judge is on the other side .  if you   d listened to me and stalled till another judge came along         i had no time to stall      said nicholls .     i have to be elsewhere within a few days .  even now  i should be on my way .  do you think we might lose the case .      harley laughed sharply .  as wilson glared at him he took his drink from the waitress    tray and swallowed it .  the smile remained on his face as he listened to wilson say smoothly      there is a good deal of danger  yes .         hum .     nicholls looked interestedly at his fingernails .     perhaps i chose the wrong lawyer .         sure you did .     harley waved at the waitress  ordered another drink .     you want to know what else i think .  i think you picked the wrong client  spelled s t o o g e .  i   m getting sick of this .  this damn thing around my neck smells bad .  how do i know it   s any good  anyhow .  far as i can see  it just smells bad  and that   s all .         it works     nicholls said succinctly .     i wouldn   t advise you to go without it .  the late hank jenkins is not a very strong ghost a strong one would tear you apart and chew up your herbs for dessert but without the protection of what you wear about your neck  you would become a very uncomfortable human as soon as jenkins heard you   d stopped wearing it .      he put down the glass of red wine he   d been inhaling without drinking  looked intently at wilson .     i   ve put up the money in this     he said .     i had hoped you   d be able to handle the legal end .  i see i   ll have to do more .  now listen intently  because i have no intention of repeating this .  there   s an angle to this case that   s got right by your blunted legal acumen .  jenkins claims to be an astral entity  which he undoubtedly is .  now  instead of trying to prove him a ghost  and legally dead  and therefore unfit to testify  which you have been doing  suppose you do this .  .  .  .      he went on to speak rapidly and to the point .   and when he left them a bit later  and wilson took harley up to his room and poured him into bed  the lawyer felt happy for the first time in days .     russell joseph harley  a little hung over and a lot nervous  was called to the stand as first witness in his own behalf .   wilson said     your name .         russell joseph harley .         you are the nephew of the late zebulon harley  who bequeathed the residence known as harley hall to you .         yes .      wilson turned to the bench .     i offer this copy of the late mr .  zebulon harley   s will in evidence .  all his possessions are left to his nephew and only living kin  the defendant .      turnbull spoke from his desk .     the plaintiff in no way disputes the defendant   s equity in harley hall .      wilson continued     you passed part of your childhood in harley hall  did you not  and visited it as a grown man on occasion .         yes .         at any time  has anything in the shape of a ghost  specter or astral entity manifested itself to you in harley hall .         no .  i   d remember it .         did your late uncle ever mention any such manifestation to you .         him .  no .         that   s all .      turnbull came up for the cross examination .      when  mr .  harley  did you last see your uncle before his death .         it was in nineteen thirty eight .  in september  some time around the tenth or eleventh of the month .         how long a time did you spend with him .       harley flushed unaccountably .     ah just one day     he said .      when before that did you see him .          well  not since i was quite young .  my parents moved to pennsylvania in nineteen twenty .  .  .      and since then except for that one day visit in nineteen thirty eight has any communication passed between your uncle and yourself .            no  i guess not .  he was a rather queer duck solitary .  a little bit balmy  i think .            well  you   re a loving nephew .  but in view of what you   ve just said  does it sound surprising that your uncle never told you of mr .  jenkins .  he never had much chance to  did he .         he had a chance in nineteen thirty eight  but he didn   t     harley said defiantly .   turnbull shrugged .     i   m finished      he said .   gimbel began to look bored .  he had anticipated something more in the way of fireworks .  he said     has the defense any further witnesses .      wilson smiled grimly .     yes  your honor  .  .  he said .  this was his big moment  and he smiled again as he said gently     i would like to call mr .  henry jenkins to the stand .        in the amazed silence that followed  judge gimbel leaned forward .        you mean you wish to call the plaintiff as a witness for the defense .      serenely     yes  your honor .      gimbel grimaced .     call henry jenkins     he said wearily to the clerk  and sank back in his chair .   turnbull was looking alarmed .  he bit his lip  trying to decide whether to object to this astonishing procedure  but finally shrugged as the clerk bawled out the ghost   s name .   turnbull sped do vd the corridor  out the door .  his voice was heard in the anteroom  then he returned more slowly .  behind him came the trickle of blood drops  pat .  hiss .  pat .  hiss      one moment      said gimbel  coming to life again .     i have no objection to your testifying  mr .  jenkins  but the state should not be subjected to the needless expense of reupholstering its witness chair every time you do .  bailiff  find some sort of a rug or something to throw over the chair before mr .  jenkins is sworn in      a tarpaulin was hurriedly procured and adjusted to the chair  jenkins materialized long enough to be sworn in  then sat .      tell me  mr .  jenkins     he said     just how many    astral entities    i believe that is what you call yourself are there .         i have no way of knowing .  many billions .         as many  in other words  as there have been human beings to die by violence .      turnbull rose to his feet in sudden agitation  but the ghost neatly evaded the trap .     i don   t know .  i only know there are billions .      the lawyer   s cat who ate canary smile remained undimmed .     and all these billions are constantly about us  everywhere  only remaining invisible .  is that it .         oh  no .  very few remain on earth .  of those  still fewer have anything to do with humans .  most humans are quite boring to us .         well  how many would you say are on earth .  a hundred thousand .         even more  maybe .  but that   s a good guess .      turnbull interrupted suddenly .     i would like to know the significance of these questions .  i object to this whole line of questioning as being totally irrelevant .      wilson was a study in legal dignity .  he retorted     i am trying to elicit some facts of major value  your honor .  this may change the entire character of the case .  i ask your patience for a moment or two .         counsel for the defense may continue     gimbel said curtly .  wilson showed his canines in a grin .  he continued to the blood dripping before him .     now  the contention of your counsel is that the late mr .  harley allowed an    astral entity    to occupy his home for twenty years or more  with his full knowledge and consent .  that strikes me as being entirely improbable  but shall we for the moment assume it to be the case .         certainly .  it   s the truth .         then tell me  mr .  jenkins  have you fingers .         have i what .         you heard me .     wilson snapped .     have you fingers  flesh and blood fingers  capable of making an imprint .         why  no .  i     wilson rushed on .     or have you a photograph of yourself or specimens of your handwriting or any sort of material identification .  have you any of these .      the voice was definitely querulous .     what do you mean .      wilson   s voice became harsh  menacing .     i mean  can you prove that you are the astral entity alleged to have occupied zebulon harley   s home .  was it you or was it another of the featureless  faceless  intangible unknowns one of the hundreds of thousands of them that  by your own admission  are all over the face of the earth  rambling where they choose  not halted by any locks or bars .  can you prove that you are anyone in particular .         your honor .     turnbull   s voice was almost a shriek as he found his feet at last .     my client   s identity was never in question .         it is now .     roared wilson .     the opposing counsel has presented a personage whom he styles    henry jenkins  who is this jenkins .  what is he .  is he even an individual or a corporate aggregation of these mysterious    astral entities    which we are to believe are everywhere  but which we never see .  if he is an individual  is he the individual .  and how can we know that  even if he says he is .  let him produce evidence photographs  a birth certificate  fingerprints .  let him bring in identifying witnesses who have known both ghosts  and are prepared to swear that these ghosts are the same ghost .  failing this  there is no case .  your honor  i demand the court declare an immediate judgment in favor of the defendant .      judge gimbel stared at turnbull .     have you anything to say .     he asked .     the argument of the defense would seem to have every merit with it .  unless you can produce some sort of evidence as to the identity of your client  i have no alternative but to find for the defense .      for a moment there was a silent tableau .  wilson triumphant  turnbull furiously frustrated .   how could you identify a ghost .   and then came the quietly amused voice from the witness chair .      this thing has gone far enough      it said above the sizzle and splatter of its own leaking blood .     i believe i can present proof that will satisfy the court .      wilson   s face fell with express elevator speed .  turnbull held his breath  afraid to hope .   judge gimbel said     you are under oath .  proceed .      there was no other sound in the courtroom as the voice said     mr .  harley  here  spoke of a visit to his uncle in nineteen thirty eight .  i can vouch for that .  they spent a night and a day together .  they weren   t alone .  i was there .      no one was watching russell harley  or they might have seen the sudden sick pallor that passed over his face .   the voice  relentless  went on .     perhaps i shouldn   t have eavesdropped as i did  but old zeb never had any secrets from me anyhow .  i listened to what they talked about .  young harley was working for a bank in philadelphia at the time .  his first big job .  he needed money  and needed it bad .  there was a shortage in his department .  a woman named sally         hold on .     wilson yelled .     this has nothing to do with your identification of yourself .  keep to the point .      but turnbull had begun to comprehend .  he was shouting  too  almost too excited to be coherent .     your honor  my client must be allowed to speak .  if he shows knowledge of an intimate conversation between the late mr .  harley and the defendant  it would be certain proof that he enjoyed the late mr .  harley   s confidence  and thus  q . e . d .   that he is no other than the astral entity who occupied harley hall for so long .      gimbel nodded sharply .     let me remind counsel for the defense that this is his own witness .  mr .  jenkins  continue .        the voice began again     as i was saying  the woman   s name         shut up  damn you .     harley yelled .  he sprang upright .  turned beseechingly toward the judge .     he   s twisting it .  make him stop .  sure  i knew my uncle had a ghost .  he   s it .  all right  curse his black soul .  he can have the house if he wants it i   ll clear out .  i   ll clear out of the whole damned state .      he broke off into babbling and turned about wildly .  only the intervention of a marshal kept him from hurtling out of the courtroom .   banging of the gavel and hard work by the court clerk and his staff restored order in the courtroom .  when the room had returned almost to normalcy  judge gimbel  perspiring and annoyed  said      as far as i am concerned  identification of the witness is complete .  has the defense any further evidence to present .      wilson shrugged morosely .     no  your honor .         counsel for the plaintiff .         nothing  your honor .  i rest my case .     gimbel plowed a hand through his sparse hair and blinked .     in that case     he said     i find for the plaintiff .  an order is entered hereby that the defendant .  russell joseph harley  shall remove from the premises of harley hall all spells  pentagrams  talismans and other means of exorcism employed  that he shall cease and desist from making any attempts  of whatever nature  to evict the tenant in the future  and that henry jenkins  the plaintiff  shall be permitted to full use and occupancy of the premises designated as harley hall for the full term of his natural ah existence .      the gavel banged .     the case is closed .           don   t take it so hard     said a mild voice behind russell harley .  he whirled surlily .  nicholls was coming up the street after him from the courthouse  wilson in tow .   nicholls said     you lost the case  but you   ve still got your life .  let me buy you a drink .  in here  perhaps .      he herded them into a cocktail lounge  sat them down before they had a chance to object .  he glanced at his expensive wrist watch .     i have a few minutes     he said    then i really must be off .  it   s urgent .      he hailed a barman  ordered for all .  then he looked at young harley and smiled broadly as he dropped a bill on the counter to pay for the drinks .      harley     he said     i have a motto that you would do well to remember at times like these .  i   ll make you a present of it  if you like .         what is it .            the worst is yet to come .          harley snarled and swallowed his drink without replying .  wilson said     what gets me is  why didn   t they come to us before the trial with that stuff about this charmingly illicit client you wished on me .  we   d have had to settle out of court .      nicholls shrugged .     they had their reasons     he said     after all  one case of exorcism  more or less  doesn   t matter .  but lawsuits set precedents .  you   re a lawyer  of sorts  wilson  do you see what i mean .         precedents .     wilson looked at him slack jawed for a moment  then his eyes widened     i see you understand me .     nicholls nodded .     from now on in this state and by virtue of the full faith and credence clause of the constitution  in every state of the country a ghost has a legal right to haunt a house .         good lord .     said wilson .  he began to laugh  not loud  but from the bottom of his chest .   harley stared at nicholls .     once and for all     he whispered     tell me  what   s your angle on all this .      nicholls smiled again .      think about it a while     he said lightly .     you   ll begin to understand .     he sniffed his wine once more  then sat the glass down gently  and vanished .     the end    as i   ve mentioned before  i was never a reader of weird tales  and its type of fiction did not captivate me .  in       though  when    legal rites    finally appeared  weird tales was nearing the end of its thirty year road and i   m rather glad i made its pages at least once before its end  even if only as half of a collaboration .  it was the longest story in the issue and it received the cover .        legal rites    and    the little man on the subway    are the only pieces of fiction i ever wrote in collaboration  and i didn   t really enjoy the process .  later on in my career  i had occasion to collaborate on four or five non fiction books and never really enjoyed that either  nor were any of the collaborations successful i   m essentially a loner and like to take full responsibility for what i write .   in the case of    legal rites    it seems to me that the beginning is mostly pohl   s rewriting  the trial scene is mostly mine  the ending i don   t remember .     fantasy was not the only type of story i kept bullheadedly trying  over and over  without much success .  another type was the broadly farcical .  i never sold either type to campbell  but i at least sold the latter elsewhere .   even while i was writing    legal rites     i was working on another robot story  but a humorous one or what i considered humor .  i called it    source of power    and at least knew better than to waste time trying it on campbell .  i sent it directly to thrilling wonder  and when it was rejected there  i tried amazing .   amazing bought it on october         my first sale to that magazine since those exciting beginning days of the fall of      .  when it appeared on the stands  two days after pearl harbor  in the february      .  issue  i found that amazing had retitled it    robot al    goes astray .      although    robot al    goes astray    was a    positronic robot    story  it didn   t really fit in with the other three i had thus far written .  when i  robot  my first collection of    positronic robot    stories  was put together  in       i did not include    robot al    goes astray    in that volume .  when  however  in       the rest of the robots was put together  i felt honor bound by the title  if nothing else  to include all the remaining robot stories published till then  and therefore    robot al    goes astray    was included .     august             robot al    goes astray    was then still working its slow way through the typewriter  because the nazi invasion of the soviet union distracted me  was another important day in my writing career .  i went to see john campbell that day and  not liking to come to him without an idea  i thought hard on the subway ride there .   the fate of    pilgrimage     soon to become    black friar of the flame     was still rankling  and i wanted to write another future historical .  i therefore suggested to him that i do a short story against the background of the slow fall of the galactic empire  something i intended to model quite frankly on the fall of the roman empire  .   campbell caught fire .  we spent two hours together  and by the time it was over it was not going to be a short story at all  but an indefinitely long series of stories dealing with the fall of the first galactic empire and the rise of the second .   i submitted the first story of the series     foundation     to campbell on september          and it was accepted on the fifteenth .  it appeared in the may      issue of astounding .   over the next eight years i was to write seven more stories of what came to be called the    foundation    series  and these were finally collected into three volumes  foundation  foundation and empire  and second foundation  which collectively were called the foundation trilogy .   of all my science fiction  these books were most successful .  first published in             and       respectively  they have been in print constantly as hard covers ever since  despite the appearance of numerous soft cover editions .  and in       at the   th world science fiction convention  in cleveland  the    foundation    series received a hugo  science fiction   s equivalent of the oscar  as the    best all time series .        after    foundation    i was ready to try a serious positronic robot story for the first time in half a year .  this one     runaround      was submitted to campbell on october           and he accepted it on the twenty third .  it appeared in the march      issue of astounding and was eventually included in i  robot .   i then had to get to work at once on a sequel to    foundation .        foundation    had been brought to an inconclusive ending on the assumption that a sequel would be forthcoming  and i had to come through .  on november     the sequel     bridle and saddle     which was the second story of the    foundation    series  was submitted to campbell  and he accepted it the same day a record in speed .  what   s more  it was the longest story i had yet written eighteen thousand words and even though i received no bonus  the check  for       was the largest single check i had yet received .     bridle and saddle    was eventually included in foundation .   now  at last  i had a series of long stories going  together with my    positronic robot    series of short stories .  i was feeling quite good .     on november           the day i submitted and sold    bridle and saddle     campbell told me his plan for starting a new department in astounding  one to be called    probability zero .     this was to be a department of short shorts  five hundred to one thousand words  which were to be in the nature of plausible and entertaining munchausen like lies .  campbell   s notion was that  aside from the entertainment value of these things  they would offer a place where beginners could penetrate the market without having to compete quite so hard with established writers .  it would form a stairway to professional status .   this was a good idea in theory and even worked a little .  ray bradbury  later to be one of the best known and successful of all science fiction writers  broke into the field with a    probability zero    item in the july      astounding .  hal clement and george   .  smith also published in    probability zero    near the very start of their careers .   unfortunately  it didn   t work enough .  campbell had to start the department going with professionals  hoping to let the amateurs carry on once they saw what it was campbell wanted .  there were  however  never enough amateurs who could meet campbell   s standards even for short shorts of an undemanding nature  and after twelve appearances of    probability zero    over a space of two and a half years  campbell gave up .   on november     however  he was just beginning  and he wanted me to do a    probability zero    for him .  i was delighted that he considered me to be at that stage of virtuosity where he could order me to do something for him according to measure .  i promptly sat down and wrote a short short called    big game .     on november           i showed it to campbell .  he glanced over it and  rather to my astonishment  handed it back .  it wasn   t what he wanted .   i wish i could remember what    big game    was about  for i thought enough of it to try submitting it to collier   s magazine  an over awing slick  in      and it was  of course  rejected .  the title  however  recalls nothing to my mind  and the story now no longer exists .   i tried a second time and did a humorous little positronic robot story called    first law .     i showed it to campbell on december    and he didn   t like that  either .  this time  though  i kept the story .  thank goodness  i had finally learned that stories must be carefully saved for eternity  however many times they are rejected  and however firmly you imagine they are retired .     big game    was the eleventh of my stories to disappear  but it was also the last .   in the case of    first law    there came a time when a magazine that did not exist in      was to ask me for something .  the magazine in question was fantastic universe  whose editor  hans stefan santesson  asked me for a story at rates that would have been fine in      but that by the mid     s i was reluctant to accept .  i remembered    first law     however  and sent it in .  santesson took it and ran it in the october      issue of fantastic universe  and  eventually  i included it in the rest of the robots .   but back to    probability zero      i tried a third time with a short story called    time pussy     which i wrote on the morning of sunday  december          finishing it just before the radio went crazy with the news of pearl harbor .  i brought it in to campbell the next day  life goes on .    and this time he took it  but    not too enthusiastically     according to my diary .       time pussy     this was told me long ago by old mac  who lived in a shack just over the hill from my old house .  he had been a mining prospector out in the asteroids during the rush of        and spent most of his time now in feeding his seven cats .      what makes you like cats so much  mr .  mac .     i asked him .   the old miner looked at me and scratched his chin .     well     he said     they reminds me o    my leetle pets on pallas .  they was something like cats same kind of head  sort o    and the cleverest leetle fellers y    ever saw .  all dead .      i felt sorry and said so .  mac heaved a sigh .     cleverest leetle fellers     he repeated .     they was four dimensional pussies .         four dimensional  mr .  mac .  but the fourth dimension is time .     i had learned that the year before  in the third grade .      so you   ve had a leetle schooling  hey .     he took out his pipe and filled it slowly .     sure  the fourth dimension is time .  these pussies was about a foot long and six inches high and four inches wide and stretched somewheres into middle o    next week .  that   s four dimensions  ain   t it .  why  if you petted their heads  they wouldn   t wag their tails till next day  mebbe .  some   the big ones wouldn   t wag till day after .  fact .      i looked dubious  but didn   t say anything .   mac went on     they was the best leetle watchdogs in all creation  too .  they had to be .  why  if they spotted a burglar or any suspicious character  they   d shriek like a banshee .  and when one saw a burglar today  he   d shriek yesterday  so we had twenty four hours    notice every time .      my mouth opened .     honest .         cross my heart .  y    want to know how we used to feed them .  we    d wait for them to go to sleep  see  and then we   d know they was busy digesting their meals .  these leetle time pussies  they always digested their meals exactly three hours before they ate it  on account their stomachs stretched that far back in time .  so when they went to sleep  we used to look at the time  get their dinner ready and feed it to them exactly three hours later .      he had lit his pipe now and was puffing away .  he shook his head sadly .     once  though  i made a mistake .  poor leetle time pussy .  his name was joe  and he was just about my favorite  too .  he went to sleep one morning at nine and somehow i got the idea it was eight .  naturally  i brought him his feed at eleven .  i looked allover for him  but i couldn   t find him .         what had happened  mr .  mac .         well  no time pussy   s insides could be expected to handle his breakfast only two hours after digesting it .  its too much to expect .  i found him finally under the tool kit in the outer shed .  he had crawled there and died of indigestion an hour before .  poor leetle feller .  after that  i always set an alarm  so i never made that mistake again .      there was a short  mournful silence after that  and i resumed in a respectful whisper     you said they all died  before .  were they all killed like that .      mac shook his head solemnly .     no .  they used to catch colds from us fellers and just die anywhere from a week to ten days before they caught them .  they wasn   t too many to start with  and a year after the miners hit pallas they wasn   t but about ten left and them ten sort o    weak and sickly .  the trouble was  leetle feller  that when they died  they went all to pieces  just rotted away fast .  especially the little four dimensional jigger they had in their brains which made them act the way they did .  it cost us all millions o    dollars .         how was that  mr .  mac .         y    see  some scientists back on earth got wind of our leetle time pussies  and they knew they   d all be dead before they could get out there next conjunction .  so they offered us all a million dollars for each time pussy we preserved for them .         and did you .         well  we tried  but they wouldn   t keep .  after they died  they were just no good any more  and we had to bury them .  we tried packing them in ice  but that only kept the outside all right .  the inside was a nasty mess  and it was the inside the scientists wanted .      natur   lly  with each dead time pussy costing us a million dollars  we didn   t want that to happen .  one of us figured out that if we put a time pussy into hot water when it was about to die  the water would soak all through it .  then  after it died  we could freeze the water so it would just be one solid chunk o    ice  and then it would keep .      my lower jaw was sagging .     did it work .         we tried and we tried  son  but we just couldn   t freeze the water fast enough .  by the time we had it all iced  the four dimensional jigger in the time pussy   s brain had just corrupted away .  we froze the water faster and faster but it was no go .  finally  we had only one time pussy left  and he was just fixing to die  too .  we was desperate and then one of the fellers thought o    something .  he figured out a complicated contraption that would freeze all the water just like that  in a split second .      we picked up the last leetle feller and put him into the hot water and hooked on the machine .  the leetle feller gave us a last look and made a funny leetle sound and died .  we pressed the button and iced the whole thing into a solid block in about a quarter of a second .     here mac heaved a sigh that must have weighed a ton .     but it was no use .  the time pussy spoiled inside      fifteen minutes and we lost the last million dollars .      i caught my breath .     but mr .  mac  you just said you iced the time pussy in a quarter of a second .  it didn   t have time to spoil .         that   s just it  leetle feller     he said heavily .     we did it too doggoned fast .  the time pussy didn   t keep because we froze that hot water so derned fast that the ice was still warm .        the end    the most unusual thing about this small item is that it was not published under my own name .  campbell wanted one item in that first    probability zero    to appear to be by a non professional  just to encourage the newcomers he hoped would try to break in .  he had three entries in that first department and the other two were by l .  sprague de camp and malcolm jameson .  both were longer established and  despite    nightfall     more renowned than i .  as low man  it was up to me to use a pseudonym and pretend to be a newcomer .     i saw campbell   s point and  just a little sullenly  agreed .  i used the name george e .  dale .  it is the only time i ever used a pseudonym in the magazines .  in later years i used the pseudonym paul french on a series of six teen age science fiction novels for reasons that are another story altogether .  that was a special case  and in      and      those six novels appeared as paperbacks under my own name .  now    time pussy    appears here under my own name  and the record is at last absolutely clean .     there followed a two month period during which i wrote nothing .   the reasons were twofold .  in the first place  pearl harbor put the united states in the war the day i wrote    time pussy     and those first two months after the debacle were too disastrous and heartbreaking to allow much in the way of fiction composing .   if that in itself weren   t enough  the time had come to try  once again  the qualifying examinations that would  or would not  grant me permission to do research .  i very much felt myself to be dangling over the abyss .  a second failure to pass would probably mean an end for me at columbia .  consequently  during those hours when i wasn   t working in my father   s candy store or hanging over the radio  i had to be studying .  there was time for nothing else at all .   hedging my bets rather desperately  i registered for graduate work at new york university  just in case i did not pass once again .  after i took my qualifying examinations  at the end of january       i actually attended a few classes at n . y . u .  while waiting for the results to be announced .   but i won   t keep you in suspense .  on friday  the thirteenth of february  the results were announced .  i had passed  this time .   during the interval between the taking of the qualifying examinations and the annunciation  i managed to do    victory unintentional .     this was a positronic robot story that was a sequel to    not final .     which had not been a positronic robot story .  obviously i was trying to ride the series notion all i could  in the hope of surer sales .   i submitted it to campbell on february          and if i thought campbell would find himself unable to reject a series story  i was roundly disabused .  nor was he so impressed by    nightfall    and by my    foundation    series as to find himself incapable of making the rejection a severe one .   on february    .  the very day of my passing into the sacred list of those permitted to do research toward their ph . d .   my spirits were somewhat dashed when i received    victory unintentional .     back with a cryptic rejection  which consisted of the following  in toto     ch c ch ch sh .     campbell very well knew that this was the formula for    butyl mercaptan      which gives the skunk its smell  and i very well knew it  too  and campbell very well knew i knew .   oh  well .  i managed to sell it anyway  to super science stories under its post pohl editor  on march           and it appeared in the august      issue of that magazine .  though i did not include it in i  robot  i did include it  of necessity  in the rest of the robots .     after that  though  there came another dry period  the longest i was ever to experience .  once    victory unintentional    was finished  fourteen months  i  were to pass before i turned back to the typewriter .  it was not the conventional    writer   s block     of course  for that i have never experienced .  rather  it was the coming of a vast  triple change in my life .   the first change was the fact that i was now beginning chemical research in earnest under professor charles r .  dawson .  research is a full time job and i still had to work it around  somehow  my duties in my father   s candy store  so there was bound to be very little time for writing .   then  as though that weren   t enough  a second change took place simultaneously  in january      i joined an organization called    the brooklyn writers    club     which had sent me a postcard of invitation .  i took the invitation to be a recognition of my status as a    writer    and i couldn   t possibly have refused .   the first meeting i attended was on january          .  it turned out to be rather pleasant .  i welcomed the chance to get my mind off the qualifying examinations and the war disasters  though i remember spending part of that first meeting discussing the possibility that new york might be bombed  .   most of the members of the club were no further advanced in the profession than i was  nor were any of them  aside from myself  science fiction writers .  the chief activity consisted of reading from our own manuscripts so that criticism from the others might be invited .  since it was quickly discovered that i read    with expression      i became chief reader  a role i enjoyed it was to be eight years yet before i discovered that i had a natural hair for the lecture platform .    on february          the third meeting i attended  there was present a young man  joseph goldberger  whom i had not met before .  he was a couple of years older than i was .  i did most of the reading that day and goldberger was sufficiently impressed to suggest  after the meeting had adjourned  that the two of us  with our girls  go out on a double date and get to know each other .  embarrassed  i had to explain that i had no girl .  with an expansive gesture  he said he would get one for me .   and so he did .  on february    .        valentine   s day and the day after i had passed my qualifying examinations  i met him at the astor hotel at      p . m .  with him was his girl friend  and with her was her girl friend  gertrude blugerman  who was going to be my blind date .   i fell in love  and when i wasn   t thinking of research i was thinking of her .   but there was also a third change  in a way the most drastic   with war  the job situation suddenly changed  technically trained men of all sorts were in demand .   robert heinlein  for instance  was an engineer who had been trained at annapolis .  his health had retired him from active service in the navy and had kept him retired  but his annapolis connections made it possible for him to work as a civilian engineer at the naval air experimental station of the u .  s .  navy yard in philadelphia .  he cast about for other qualified people he might persuade to join him there  particularly among his fellow science fiction writers .   he got l .  sprague de camp to come to the n . a . e . s .   and on march           i received a letter from the navy yard asking if i would consider joining them .   i am rather single minded and  having labored toward my ph . d .  for a year and a half  i would not ordinarily have considered letting go for anything short of a major force .   but the major force was there .  i was in love and i wanted to get married even more than i wanted my degree .  it occurred to me that i could suspend work toward my ph . d .  with the full approval of the school  thanks to the war emergency  and that i could also get full permission to resume after the war .  and by taking a job and postponing merely postponing my research  i could get married .   i went down to philadelphia for an interview on april    and apparently met their requirements .  i took the job  and on may     having left my father   s candy store at last and  at least as a worker  forever  i moved to philadelphia .  fortunately  philadelphia was only an hour and a half from new york by train  in those days  i couldn   t drive a car and  even if i could  i wouldn   t have been able to get the gasoline because of rationing  .  i was therefore back in new york every weekend .   by the twenty fourth of the month i had persuaded gertrude to agree to marry me  and on july    we were married .     during those months it did not bother me that i was doing no writing .  i had too much to think of first the war  then research  then the job  then the marriage .   besides  in the years up to early       i never thought of my writing as anything but a way to help out with my college tuition .  it was fun  it was exciting  and such success as i managed to achieve was deeply satisfying but it had been done to serve a purpose and that purpose had been served .  i had no notion that writing could be my career  that it could ever possibly be my career .   my career was to be chemistry .  all the time i was writing and selling stories  i was also slaving away at columbia .  once i earned my ph . d .   i intended to make my living by doing chemical research for some large industry at some munificent salary such as a hundred dollars a week .   as the son of a candy store keeper  brought up in the depression  i suffered dizzy spells if i tried to think of more than a hundred dollars a week  so i confined my ambitions to that .    my philadelphia job  to be sure  paid me only fifty dollars a week at the beginning  but a young couple could live on that  those days  with taxes very small  with an apartment costing     .    a month and dinner for two at a restaurant coming to two dollars  including tip  .   it wasn   t the height of my dreams  but it was only a temporary war job  after all .  once the war was over  i would go back to my research and get my ph . d .  and a better job .  meanwhile  even a salary of        a year seemed to make it unnecessary for me to write .  by my marriage day  i had written forty two stories  of which twenty eight had been sold  and three more were yet to sell  . my total bachelor earnings over a space of four years had been        .    for those twenty eight stories .  this amounted to an average earning of just under    .    per week or     per story .   i never dreamed at that time that i could ever do much better .  i had no intention of ever writing anything but science fiction or fantasy for the pulp magazines  which paid one cent a word at most a cent and a quarter with bonus .   to make even the feeble fifty dollars a week that my job paid me would make it necessary for me to write and sell some forty stories a year  and  at that time  that didn   t seem conceivable to me .   it had been all right to labor at the typewriter to pay my way through school  when i had no other source of income  but for what purpose ought i to be writing now .  and with a six day  fifty four hour week  and the excitement of a new marriage  who had time .   the very existence of science fiction seemed to fade .  i had left my magazine collection in new york  i no longer saw campbell regularly  or pohl  or any of my science fiction cronies .  i scarcely even read the current magazines as they came out .   i might have let science fiction die altogether  and my writing career with it  except that there were little reminders from the outside world  and little itchings inside me that meant  though i didn   t know it at the time  that writing was a great deal more to me than just a handy device to make a little spare cash .     i had hardly begun to work at the n . a . e . s .   for instance  when the june      issue of astounding came out with my story    bridle and saddle .     and it made the cover .   it was quite beyond my power to resist the temptation to take a copy to work and show it around .  i couldn   t help but feel the status i gained as a    writer .     later that summer and fall  three other stories were published     victory unintentional    and    the imaginary    in the post pohl super science stories and    the hazing    in thrilling wonder stories .  each kept the science fiction world alive for me .   and although my new york coterie of science fiction editors  writers  and readers were gone  i was left not entirely bereft .   working with me at the n . a . e . s .  were robert heinlein and l .  sprague de camp  and i kept up a close social relationship with both .  to be sure  each had quit writing for the duration but they were far more successful writers than i was and i hero worshipped them .  in addition  john d .  clark  who was an ardent science fiction fan and who had written and published a couple of stories in       was living in philadelphia at the time and we frequently saw one another .  all three kept the science fiction atmosphere about me .   it was on january          though  that the real trigger came .  on that day i received a letter from fred pohl to the effect that he was planning to rewrite    legal rites    and was going to try to sell it again .  that was exciting .  he wasn   t to succeed in selling the story for six more years  but of course i had no way of telling that .  to me it seemed that another sale was in the offing and that i was an as yet active writer .   besides     legal rites    was a fantasy and i had never yet satisfied that long standing desire to write and sell a fantasy to unknown .  five times i had tried  and five times i had failed .   on january     quite suddenly  a week after the letter had come and fourteen months after my last written story  the urge overwhelmed me .  i sat down to write a fantasy called     author .  author .      quickly i found there was something lacking .  it was the first time i had ever tried to write something for campbell without conferences with him .  i missed the inspiration that invariably came through talks with him  i missed his encouragement .  in fact  i wasn   t sure that i could write at all without him .  so the story limped and there were dry spells .  i didn   t finish the first draft till march    and the final version wasn   t ready for mailing till april   .       .   it had taken me nearly three months to write the story .  to be sure  it was twelve thousand words long  but    bridle and saddle     which was half again as long  had taken me only three weeks .   perhaps if     author .  author .     had been rejected  it might have been a long time before i would have had the courage to try again .  fortunately  that was never put to the test .  i mailed the story to campbell on april          the first time i ever mailed him a story instead of handing it to him   and on the twelfth the check of acceptance arrived .  there was not even a revision requested  and what   s more  campbell paid me a bonus for the first time since    nightfall .     i received one and a quarter cents a word  or      in all .  my sixth try at unknown had succeeded .   it was the equivalent of three weeks    pay at the n . a . e . s .  for something that had taken me  off and on  three months .  however  the three months    work on    author .  author .     had been of a totally different kind than the three weeks    work at the n . a . e . s .  would have been  and the receipt of the      check was infinitely more exciting than picking up a similar check  or even a larger one  earned in the course of a punch the time clock job .   yes  indeed  i punched a time clock at the n . a . e . s .    as it happened  though  the happy excitement with which i greeted the sale was premature .  i had scaled the heights of unknown too late  and though i had the money  i didn   t have the magazine .  robert heinlein brought me the sad news on august    less than four months after the sale .   unknown had been having a difficult time of it .  sales weren   t high enough  and after its first two years of operation it had had to switch from monthly to bimonthly issues .  now the war had introduced a paper shortage and street   smith publications decided to save what paper it could receive for the more successful astounding and let unknown go .   at the time i made my sale  there were only three more issues of unknown fated to be issued and there was no room in any of them for    author .  author .     the story remained in the vaults of street   smith indefinitely  a story sold  but not published  and the      check was deprived of most of its fun as a result .   there is  however  a happy ending .  twenty years later  don bensen of pyramid publications was publishing a paperback anthology of stories from unknown  he asked me for an introduction .  with glad nostalgia i complied  writing it on january           almost twenty years to the day after i had started writing the only story i ever sold to the magazine .  in the course of the introduction  i referred to the sad story of my attempts to write for unknown .   the     s were not the     s .  in       the mere mention of an existing asimov story that had never been published produced excitement  and bensen wrote to me within three days  asking to see the story .  i dug out the manuscript  i saved them now  you see  even for twenty years  and sent it to him .   he asked permission to include it in a second anthology of unknown stories  pointing out that it had been accepted by the magazine  .  i explained he would also need permission from campbell and the publisher .  they very kindly granted the permission  and in january      .  twenty one years after it was written      author .  author .     was finally published and i finally after a fashion  and glancingly made unknown .       author .  author .      it occurred to graham dorn  and not for the first time  either  that there was one serious disadvantage in swearing you   ll go through fire and water for a girl  however beloved .  sometimes she takes you at your miserable word .   this is one way of saying that he had been waylaid  shanghaied and dragooned by his fianc  e into speaking at her maiden aunt   s literary society .  don   t laugh .  it   s not funny from the speaker   s rostrum .  some of the faces you have to look at .   to race through the details  graham dorn had been jerked onto a platform and forced upright .  he had read a speech on    the place of the mystery novel in american literature    in an appalled tone .  not even the fact that his own eternally precious june had written it  part of the bribe to get him to speak in the first place  could mask the fact that it was essentially tripe .   and then when he was weltering  figuratively speaking  in his own mental gore  the harpies closed in  for lo  it was time for the informal discussion and assorted feminine gush .    oh  mr .  dorn  do you work from inspiration .  i mean  do you just sit down and then an idea strikes you all at once .  and you must sit up all night and drink black coffee to keep you awake till you get it down .    oh  yes .  certainly .   his working hours were two to four in the afternoon every other day  and he drank milk .     oh  mr .  dorn  you must do the most awful research to get all those bizarre murders .  about how much must you do before you can write a story .    about six months  usually .   the only reference books he ever used were a six volume encyclopedia and year before last   s world almanac .     oh  mr .  dom  did you make up your reginald de meister from a real character .  you must have .  he   s oh  so convincing in his every detail .    he   s modeled after a very dear boyhood chum of mine .   dom had never known anyone like de meister .  he lived in continual fear of meeting someone like him .  he had even a cunningly fashioned ring containing a subtle oriental poison for use just in case he did .  so much for de meister .    somewhere past the knot of women  june billings sat in her seat and smiled with sickening and proprietary pride .   graham passed a finger over his throat and went through the pantomime of choking to death as unobtrusively as possible .  june smiled  nodded  threw him a delicate kiss  and did nothing .   graham decided to pass a stern  lonely  woman less life and to have nothing but villainesses in his stories forever after .   he was answering in monosyllables  alternating yesses and noes .  yes  he did take cocaine on occasion .  he found it helped the creative urge .  no  he didn   t think he could allow hollywood to take over de meister .  he thought movies weren   t true expressions of real art .  besides  they were just a passing fad .  yes  he would read miss crum   s manuscripts if she brought them .  only too glad to .  reading amateur manuscripts was such fun  and editors are really such brutes .   and then refreshments were announced  and there was a sudden vacuum .  it took a split second for graham   s head to clear .  the mass of femininity had coalesced into a single specimen .  she was four feet ten and about eighty five pounds in weight .  graham was six two and two hundred ten worth of brawn .  he could probably have handled her without difficulty  especially since both her arms were occupied with a pachyderm of a purse .  still  he felt a little delicate  to say nothing of queasy  about knocking her down .  it didn   t seem quite the thing to do .   she was advancing  with admiration and fervor disgustingly clear in her eyes  and graham felt the wall behind him .  there was no doorway within armreach on either side .      oh  mr .  de meister do  do please let me call you mr .  de meister .  your creation is so real to me  that i can   t think of you as simply graham dorn .  you don   t mind  do you .         no  no  of course not     gargled graham  as well as he could through thirty two teeth simultaneously set on edge .     i often think of myself as reginald in my more frivolous moments .         thank you .  you can have no idea  dear mr .  de meister  how i have looked forward to meeting you .  i have read all your works  and i think they are wonderful .         i   m glad you think so .     he went automatically into the modesty routine .     really nothing  you know .  ha  ha  ha .  like to please the readers  but lots of room for improvement .  ha  ha  ha .         but you really are  you know .     this was said with intense earnestness .     i mean good  really good .  i think it is wonderful to be an author like you .  it must be almost like being god .      graham stared blankly .     not to editors  sister .      sister didn   t get the whisper .  she continued     to be able to create living characters out of nothing  to unfold souls to all the world  to put thoughts into words  to build pictures and create worlds .  i have often thought that an author was the most gloriously gifted person in creation .  better an inspired author starving in a garret than a king upon his throne .  don   t you think so .         definitely     lied graham .      what are the crass material goods of the world to the wonders of weaving emotions and deeds into a little world of its own .         what  indeed .         and posterity  think of posterity .         yes  yes .  i often do .      she seized his hand .     there   s only one little request .  you might     she blushed faintly     you might give poor reginald if you will allow me to call him that just once a chance to marry letitia reynolds .  you make her just a little too cruel to him .  i   m sure i weep over it for hours together sometimes .  but then he is too  too real to me .      and from somewhere  a lacy frill of handkerchief made its appearance  and went to her eyes .  she removed it  smiled bravely  and scurried away .  graham dorn inhaled  closed his eyes  and gently collapsed into june   s arms .   his eyes opened with a jerk .     you may consider     he said severely     our engagement frazzled to the breaking point .  only my consideration for your poor  aged parents prevents your being known henceforward as the ex fianc  e of graham dom .         darling  you are so noble .     she massaged his sleeve with her cheek .     come  i   ll take you home and bathe your poor wounds .         all right  but you   ll have to carry me .  has your precious  loveable aunt got an axe .         but why .         for one thing  she had the gall to introduce me as the brain father  god help me  of the famous reginald de meister .         and aren   t you .         let   s get out of this creep joint .  and get this .  i   m no relative by brain or otherwise  of that character .  i disown him .  i cast him into the darkness .  i spit upon him .  i declare him an illegitimate son  a foul degenerate  and the offspring of a hound  and i   ll be damned if he ever pokes his lousy patrician nose into my typewriter again .      they were in the taxi  and june straightened his tie .      all right  sonny  let   s see the letter .         what letter .      she held out her hand .     the one from the publishers .      graham snarled and flipped it out of his jacket pocket .     i   ve thought of inviting myself to his house for tea  the damned flintheart .  he   s got a rendezvous with a pinch of strychnine .         you may rave later .  what does he say .  hmm uh huh    doesn   t quite come up to what is expected feel that de meister isn   t in his usual form a little revision perhaps towards feel sure the novel can be adjusted are returning under separate cover          she tossed it aside .     i told you you shouldn   t have killed off sancha rodriguez .  she was what you needed .  you   re getting skimpy on the love interest .         you write it .  i   m through with de meister .  it   s getting so clubwomen call me mr .  de meister  and my picture is printed in newspapers with the caption mr .  de meister .  i have no individuality .  no one ever heard of graham dom .  i   m always  dom  dom  you know  the guy who writes the de meister stuff  you know .      june squealed     silly .  you   re jealous of your own detective .         i am not jealous of my own character .  listen .  i hate detective stories .  i never read them after i got into the two syllable words .  i wrote the first as a clever  trenchant  biting satire .  it was to blast the entire false school of mystery writers .  that   s why i invented this de meister .  he was the detective to end all detectives .  the compleat ass  by graham dom .      so the public  along with snakes  vipers  and ungrateful children takes this filth to its bosom .  i wrote mystery after mystery trying to convert the public     graham dom drooped a little at the futility of it all .      oh  well .     he smiled wanly  and the great soul rose above adversity .     don   t you see .  i   ve got to write other things .  i can   t waste my life .  but who   s going to read a serious novel by graham dorn  now that i   m so thoroughly identified with de meister .         you can use a pseudonym .         i will not use a pseudonym .  i   m proud of my name .         but you can   t drop de meister .  be sensible  dear .         a normal fianc  e     graham said bitterly     would want her future husband to write something really worthwhile and become a great name in literature .         well  i do want you to  graham .  but just a little de meister once in a while to pay the bills that accumulate .         ha .     graham knocked his hat over his eyes to hide the sufferings of a strong spirit in agony .     now you say that i can   t reach prominence unless i prostitute my art to that unmentionable .  here   s your place .  get out i   m going home and write a good scorching letter on asbestos to our senile mr .  macdunlap .         do exactly as you want to  cookie     soothed june .     and tomorrow when you feel better  you   ll come and cry on my shoulder  and we   ll plan a revision of death on the third deck together  shall we .         the engagement      said graham  loftily     is broken .          yes  dear .  i   ll be home tomorrow at eight        that is of no possible interest to me .  good bye .        publishers and editors are untouchables  of course .  theirs is a heritage of the outstretched hand and the well toothed smile  the nod of the head and the slap of the back .   but perhaps somewhere  in the privacy of the holes to which authors scurry when the night falls  a private revenge is taken .  there  phrases may be uttered where no one can overhear  and letters may be written that need not be mailed  and perhaps a picture of an editor  smiling pensively  is enshrined above the typewriter to act the part of bulls eye in an occasional game of darts .   such a picture of macdunlap  so used  enlightened graham dom   s room .  and graham dom himself  in his usual writing costume  street clothes and typewriter   scowled at the fifth sheet of paper in his typewriter .  the other four were draped over the edge of the wastebasket  condemned for their milk and watery mildness .   he began      dear sir     and added slowly and viciously     or madam  as the case may be .      he typed furiously as the inspiration caught him  disregarding the faint wisp of smoke curling upward from the overheated keys      you say you don   t think much of de meister in this story .  well  i don   t think much of de meister  period .  you can handcuff your slimy carcass to his and jump off the brooklyn bridge .  and i hope they drain the east river just before you jump .      from now on  my works will be aimed higher than your scurvy press .  and the day will come when i can look back on this period of my career with the loathing that is its just      someone had been tapping graham on the shoulder during the last paragraph .  graham twitched it angrily and ineffectively at intervals .   now he stopped  turned around  and addressed the stranger in his room courteously     who the devilish damnation are you .  and you can leave without bothering to answer .  i won   t think you rude .      the newcomer smiled graciously .  his nod wafted the delicate aroma of some unobtrusive hair oil toward graham .  his lean  hard bitten jaw stood out keenly  and he said in a well modulated voice      de meister is the name .  reginald de meister .      graham rocked to his mental foundations and heard them creak .      glub     he said .      pardon .      graham recovered .     i said     glub     a little code word meaning which de meister .         the de meister     explained de meister  kindly .     my character .  my detective .      de meister helped himself to a seat  and his finely chiseled features assumed that air of well bred boredom so admired in the best circles .  he lit a turkish cigarette  which graham at once recognized as his detective   s favorite brand  tapping it slowly and carefully against the back of his hand first  a mannerism equally characteristic .      really  old man     said de meister .     this is really excruciatin   ly funny .  i suppose i am your charcter  y   know  but let   s not work on that basis .  it would be so devastatin   ly awkward .         glub     said graham again  by way of rejoinder .   his mind was feverishly setting up alternatives .  he didn   t drink  more  at the moment  was the pity  so he wasn   t drunk .  he had a chrome steel digestion and he wasn   t overheated  so it wasn   t a hallucination .  he never dreamed  and his imagination as befitted a paying commodity was under strict control .  and since  like all authors  he was widely considered more than half a screwball  insanity was out of the question .   which left de meister simply an impossibility  and graham felt relieved .  it   s a very poor author indeed who hasn   t learned the fine art of ignoring impossibilities in writing a book .   he said smoothly     i have here a volume of my latest work .  do you mind naming your page and crawling back into it .  i   m a busy man and god knows i have enough of you in the tripe i write .         but i   m here on business  old chap .  i   ve got to come to a friendly arrangement with you first .  things are deucedly uncomfortable as they are .         look  do you know you   re bothering me .  i   m not in the habit of talking to mythical characters .  as a general thing  i don   t pal around with them .  besides which  it   s time your mother told you that you really don   t exist .         my dear fellow  i always existed .  existence is such a subjective thing .  what a mind thinks exists  does exist .  i existed in your mind  for instance  ever since you first thought of me .      graham shuddered .     but the question is  what are you doing out of my mind .  getting a little narrow for you .  want elbow room .         not at all .  rather satisfact   ry mind in its way  but i achieved a more concrete existence only this afternoon  and so i seize the opportunity to engage you face to face in the aforementioned business conversation .  you see  that thin  sentimental lady of your society         what society .     questioned graham hollowly .  it was all awfully clear to him now .      the one at which you made a speech     de meister shuddered in his turn    on the detective novel .  she believed in my existence  so naturally  i exist .      he finished his cigarette and flicked it out with a negligent twist of the wrist .      the logic     declared graham     is inescapable .  now  what do you want and the answer is no .         do you realize  old man  that if you stop writing de meister stories  my existence will become that dull  wraithlike one of all superannuated fictional detectives .  i   d have to gibber through the gray mists of limbo with holmes  lecocq  and dupin .         a very fascinating thought  i think .  a very fitting fate .      reginald de meister   s eyes turned icy  and graham suddenly remembered the passage on page     of the case of the broken ashtray     his eyes  hitherto lazy and unattentive  hardened into twin pools of blue ice and transfixed the butler  who staggered back  a stifled cry on his lips .     evidently  de meister lost none of his characteristics out of the novels he adorned .   graham staggered back  a stifled cry on his lip .   de meister said menacingly     it would be better for you if the de meister mysteries continue .  do you understand .      graham recovered and summoned a feeble indignation .     now  wait a while .  you   re getting out of hand .  remember  in a way  i   m your father .  that   s right .  your mental father .  you can   t hand me ultimatums or make threats .  it isn   t filial .  it   s lacking in the proper respect and love .         and another thing     said de meister  unmoved .     we   ve got to straighten out this business of letitia reynolds .  it   s gettin    deucedly borin     y   know         now you   re getting silly .  my love scenes have been widely heralded as miracles of tenderness and sentiment not found in one murder mystery out of a thousand .   wait  i   ll get you a few reviews .  i don   t mind your attempts to dictate my actions so much  but i   m damned if you   ll criticize my writing .         forget the reviews .  tenderness and all that rot is what i don   t want .  i   ve been driftin    after the fair lady for five volumes now  and behavin    the most insufferable ass .  this has got to stop .         in what way .         i   ve got to marry her in your present story .  either that  or make her a good  respectable mistress .  and you   ll have to stop making me so damned victorian and gentlemanly towards ladies .  i   m only human  old man .         impossible .     said graham     and that includes your last remark .      de meister grew severe .     really  old chap  for an author  you display the most appallin    lack of concern for the well bein    of a character who has supported you for a good many years .      graham choked eloquently .     supported me .  in other words  you think i couldn   t sell real novels  hey .  well  i   ll show you .  i wouldn   t write another de meister story for a million dollars .  not even for a fifty percent royalty and all television rights .  how   s that .      de meister frowned and uttered those words that had been the sound of doom to so many criminals     we shall see  but you are not yet done with me .      with firmly jutting jaw  he vanished .   graham   s twisted face straightened out  and slowly very slowly  he brought his hands up to his cranium and felt carefully .   for the first time in a long and reasonably ribald mental life  he felt that his enemies were right and that a good dry cleaning would not hurt his mind at all .   the things that existed in it .     graham dorn shoved the doorbell with his elbow a second time .  he distinctly remembered her saying she would be home at eight  the peep hole shoved open .     hello .         hello .      silence .   graham said plaintively     it   s raining outside .  can   t i come in to dry .         i don   t know .  are we engaged  mr .  dorn .         if i   m not     was the stiff reply     then i   ve been turning down the frenzied advances of a hundred passion stricken girls beautiful ones  all of them for no apparent reason .         yesterday  you said         ah  but who listens to what i say .  i   m just quaint that way .  look  i brought you posies .     he flourished roses before the peep hole .   june opened the door .     roses .  how plebeian .  come in  cookie  and sully the sofa .  whoa  whoa  before you move a step  what have you got under the other arm .  not the manuscript of death on the third deck .         correct .  not that excrescence of a manuscript this is something different     june   s tone chilled .     that isn   t your precious novel  is it .      graham flung his head up     how did you know about it .         you slobbered the plot all over me at macdunlap   s silver anniversary party .         i did not i couldn   t unless i were drunk .         oh  but you were .  stinking is the term .  and on two cocktails too .         well  if i was drunk  i couldn   t have told you the right plot        is the setting a coal mine district .          uh yes .         and are the people concerned real  earthy  unartificial  down to earth characters  speaking and thinking just like you and me .  is it a story of basic economic forces .  are the human characters lifted up and thrown down and whirled around  all at the mercy of the coal mine and mechanized industry of today .          uh yes .      she nodded her head retrospectively .     i remember distinctly .  first  you got drunk and were sick .  then you got better  and told me the first few chapters .  then i got sick .      she approached the glowering author .     graham .     she leant her golden head upon his shoulder and cooed softly .     why don   t you continue with the de meister stories .  you get such pretty checks out of them .      graham writhed out of her grasp .     you are a mercenary wretch  incapable of understanding an author   s soul .  you may consider our engagement broken .      he sat down hard on the sofa  and folded his arms .     unless you will consent to read the script of my novel and give me the usual story analysis .         may i give you my analysis of death on the third deck first .         no .         good .  in the first place  your love interest is becoming sickening .         it is not .     graham pointed his finger indignantly .     it breathes a sweet and sentimental fragrance  as of an older day .  i   ve got the review here that says it .     he fumbled in his wallet .      oh  bullfeathers .  are you going to start quoting that guy in the pillsboro  okla .   clarion .  he   s probably your second cousin .  you know that your last two novels were completely below par in royalties .  and third deck isn   t even being sold .         so much the better ow .     he rubbed his head violently .     what did you do that for .         because the only place i could hit as hard as i wanted to  without disabling you  was your head .  listen .  the public is tired of your corny letitia reynolds .  why don   t you let her soak her    gleaming golden crown of hair    in kerosene and get familiar with a match .         but june  that character is drawn from life .  from you .         graham dorn .  i am not here to listen to insults .  the mystery market today is swinging towards action and hot  honest love and you   re still in the sweet  sentimental stickiness of five years ago .         but that   s reginald de meister   s character .         well  change his character .  listen .  you introduce sancha rodriguez .  that   s fine .  i approve of her .  she   s mexican  flaming  passionate  sultry  and in love with him .  so what do you do .  first he behaves the impeccable gentleman  and then you kill her off in the middle of the story .         hmm  i see you really think it would improve things to have de meister forget himself .  a kiss or so      june clenched her lovely teeth and her lovely fists .     oh  darling  how glad i am love is blind .  if it ever peeked one tiny little bit  i couldn   t stand it .  look  you squirrel   s blue plate special  you   re going to have de meister and rodriquez fall in love .  they   re going to have an affair through the entire book and you can put your horrible letitia into a nunnery .  she probably be happier there from the way you make her sound .         that   s all you know about it  my sweet .  it so happens that reginald de meister is in love with letitia reynolds and wants her  not this roderiguez person .         and what makes you think that .         he told me so .         who told you so .         reginald de meister .         what reginald de meister .         my reginald de meister .         what do you mean  your reginald de meister .         my character  reginald de meister .      june got up  indulged in some deep breathing and then said in a very calm voice     let   s start all over .      she disappeared for a moment and returned with an aspirin .     your reginald de meister  from your books  told you  in person  he was in love with letitia reynolds .         that   s right .      june swallowed the aspirin .      well  i   ll explain  june  the way he explained it to me .  all characters really exist at least  in the minds of the authors .  but when people really begin to believe in them  they begin to exist in reality  because what people believe in  is  so far as they   re concerned  and what is existence anyway .      june   s lips trembled .     oh  gramie  please don   t .  mother will never let me marry you if they put you in an asylum .         don   t call me gramie  june  for god   s sake .  i tell you he was there  trying to tell me what to write and how to write it .  he was almost as bad as you .  aw  come on  baby  don   t cry .         i can   t help it .  i always thought you were crazy  but i never thought you were crazy .         all right  what   s the difference .  let   s not talk about it  any more .  i   m never going to write another mystery novel .  after all      he indulged in a bit of indignation     when it gets so that my own character my own character tries to tell me what to do  it   s going too far .  .  .   june looked over her handkerchief .     how do you know it was really de meister .         oh  golly .  as soon as he tapped his turkish cigarette on the back of his hand and started dropping g   s like snowflakes in a blizzard  i knew the worst had come .      the telephone rang .  june leaped up .     don   t answer  graham .  it   s probably from the asylum .  i   ll tell them you   re not here .  hello .  hello .  oh  mr .  macdunlap .  .  .  she heaved a sigh of relief  then covered the mouthpiece and whispered horasely     it might be a trap .         hello  mr .  macdunlap .  .  .  . no  he   s not here .  .  .  . yes  i think i can get in touch with him .  .  .  . at martin   s tomorrow  noon .  .  .  .  i   ll tell him .  .  . with who .  .  .  . with who .  .  .     she hung up suddenly .      graham  you   re to lunch with macdunlap tomorrow .  .  .      at his expense .  only at his expense .      her great blue eyes got greater and bluer     and reginald de meister is to dine with you .  .  .      what reginald de meister .         your reginald de meister .         my reg         oh  gramie  don   t .  .  .  her eyes misted     don   t you see  gramie  now they   ll put us both in an insane asylum and mr .  macdunlap  too .  and they   ll probably put us all in the same padded cell .  oh  gramie  three is such a dreadful crowd .      and her face crumpled into tears .     grew s .  macdunlap  that the s .  stands for    some    is a vile untruth spread by his enemies  was alone at the table when graham dorn entered .  out of this fact  graham extracted a few fleeting drops of pleasure .   it was not so much  you understand  the presence of macdunlap that did it  as the absence of de meister .   macdunlap looked at him over his spectacles and swallowed a liver pill  his favorite sweetmeat     aha .  you   re here .  what is this corny joke you   re putting over on me .  you had no right to mix me up with a person like de meister without warning me he was real .  i might have taken precautions .  i could have hired a bodyguard .  i could have bought a revolver .         he   s not real .  god damn it .  half of him was your idea .      that     returned macdunlap with heat     is libel .  and what do you mean  he   s not real .  when he introduced himself  i took three liver pills at once and he didn   t disappear .  do you know what three pills are .  three pills  the kind i   ve got  the doctor should only drop dead   could make an elephant disappear if he weren   t real .  i know .      graham said wearily     just the same  he exists only in my mind .         in your mind  i know he exists .  your mind should be investigated by the pure food and drugs act .      the several polite rejoinders that occurred simultaneously to graham were dismissed almost immediately as containing too great a proportion of pithy anglo saxon expletives .  after all ha  ha a publisher is a publisher however anglo saxony he may be .   graham said     the question arises  then  how we   re to get rid of de meister .         get rid of de meister .     macdunlap jerked the glasses off his nose in his sudden start  and caught them in one hand .  his voice thickened with emotion .     who wants to get rid of him .         do you want him around .         god forbid     macdunlap said between shudders .     next to him  my brother in law is an angel .         he has no business outside my books .         for my part  he has no business inside them .  since i started reading your manuscripts  my doctor added kidney pills and cough syrups to my medicines .     he looked at his watch  and took a kidney pill .     my worst enemy should be a book publisher only a year .         then why     asked graham patiently     don   t you want to get rid of de meister .         because he is publicity .      graham stared blankly .      look .  what other writer has a real detective .  all the others are fictional .  everyone knows that .  but yours yours is real .  we can let him solve cases and have big newspaper writeups .  he   ll make the police department look silly .  he   ll make         that      interrupted graham  categorically     is by all odds the most obscene proposal i have ever had my ears manured with .         it will make money .         money isn   t everything .         name one thing it isn   t .  .  .  . shh .     he kicked a near fracture into graham   s left ankle and rose to his feet with a convulsive smile     mi .  de meister .         sorry  old dear     came a lethargic voice .     couldn   t quite make it  you know .  loads of engagements .  must have been most borin    for you .      graham dom   s ears quivered spasmodically .  he looked over his shoulder and reeled backward as far as a person could reel while in a sitting position .  reginald de meister had sprouted a monocle since his last visitation  and his monocular glance was calculated to freeze blood .   de meister   s greeting was casual .     my dear watson .  so glad to meet you .  overjoyed deucedly .         why don   t you go to hell .     graham asked curiously .      my dear fellow .  oh  my dear fellow .      macdunlap cackled     that   s what i like .  jokes .  fun .  makes everything pleasant to start with .  now shall we get down to business .         certainly .  the dinner is on the way  i trust .  then i   ll just order a bottle of wine .  the usual  henry .     the waiter ceased hovering  flew away  and skimmed back with a bottle that opened and gurgled into a glass .   de meister sipped delicately     so nice of you  old chap  to make me a habitu   of this place in your stories .  it holds true even now  and it is most convenient .  the waiters all know me .  mr .  macdunlap  i take it you have convinced mr .  dom of the necessity of continuing the de meister stories .         yes     said macdunlap .          no     said graham .      don   t mind him     said macdunlap .     he   s temperamental .  you know these authors .         don   t mind him     said graham .     he   s microcephalic .  you know these publishers .         look  old chappie .  i take it macdunlap hasn   t pointed out to you the unpleasanter side of acting stubborn .         for instance what  old stinkie .     asked graham  courteously .      well  have you ever been haunted .         like coming behind me and saying  boo .         my dear fellow  i say .  i   m much more subtle than that .  i can really haunt one in modem  up to date methods .  for instance  have you ever had your individuality submerged .      he snickered .   there was something familiar about that snicker .  graham suddenly remembered .  it was on page     of murder rides the range     his lazy eyelids flicked down and up .  he laughed lightly and melodiously  and though he said not a word  hank marslowe covered .  there was hidden menace and hidden power in that light laugh  and somehow the burly rancher did not dare reach for his guns .     to graham it still sounded like a nasty snicker  but he cowered  and did not dare reach for his guns .   macdunlap plunged through the hole the momentary silence had created .      you see  graham .  why play around with ghosts .  ghosts aren   t reasonable things .  they   re not human .  if it   s more royalties  you want      graham fired up .     will you refrain from speaking of money .  from now on  i write only great novels of tearing human emotions .      macdunlap   s flushed face changed suddenly .          no     he said .      in fact  to change the subject just a moment     and graham   s tone became surpassingly sweet  as the words got all sticky with maple syrup    i have a manuscript here for you to look at .      he grasped the perspiring macdunlap by the lapel firmly .     it is a novel that is the work of five years .  a novel that will grip you with its intensity .  a novel that will shake you to the core of your being .  a novel that will open a new world .  a novel that will         no     said macdunlap .      a novel that will blast the falseness of this world .  a novel that pierces to the truth .  a novel      macdunlap  being able to stretch his hand no higher  took the manuscript .      no     he said .      why the bloody hell don   t you read it .     inquired graham .      now .         well  start it .         look  supposing i read it tomorrow  or even the next day .  i have to take my cough syrup now .         you haven   t coughed once since i got here .         i   ll let you know immediately         this     said graham     is the first page .  why don   t you begin it .  it will grip you instantly .      macdunlap read two paragraphs and said     is this laid in a coalmining town .         yes .         then i can   t read it .  i   m allergic to coal dust .         but it   s not real coal dust  mac idiot .         that     pointed out macdunlap     is what you said about de meister .      reginald de meister tapped a cigarette carefully on the back of his hand in a subtle manner which graham immediately recognized as betokening a sudden decision .      that is all devastatin   ly borin     you know .  not quite gettin    to the point  you might say .  go ahead  macdunlap  this is no time for half measures .      macdunlap girded his spiritual loins and said      all right mister dorn  with you it   s no use being nice .  instead of de meister  i   m getting coal dust .  instead of the best publicity in fifty years  i   m getting social significance .  all right  mister smartaleck dorn  if in one week you don   t come to terms with me  good terms  you will be blacklisted in every reputable publishing firm in the united states and foreign parts .     he shook his finger and added in a shout     including scandinavian .      graham dorn laughed lightly     pish     he said     tush .  i happen to be an officer of the author   s union  and if you try to push me around i   ll have you blacklisted .  how do you like that .         i like it fine .  because supposing i can prove you   re a plagiarist .         me     gasped graham  recovering narrowly from merry suffocation .      me  the most original writer of the decade .         is that so .  and maybe you don   t remember that in each case you write up  you casually mention de meister   s notebooks on previous cases .         so what .         so he has them .  reginald  my boy  show mister dom your notebook of your last case .   you see that .  that   s mystery of the milestones and it has  in detail  every incident in your book and dated the year before the book was published .  very authentic .         again so what .         have you maybe got the right to copy his notebook and call it an original murder mystery .         why  you case of mental poliomyelitis  that notebook is my invention .         who says so .  it   s in de meister   s handwriting  as any expert can prove .  and maybe you have a piece of paper  some little contract or agreement  you know  that gives you the right to use his notebooks .         how can i have an agreement with a mythical personage .         what mythical personage .         you and i know de meister doesn   t exist .         ah  but does the jury know .  when i testify that i took three strong liver pills and he didn   t disappear  what twelve men will say he doesn   t exist .         this is blackmail .         certainly .  i   ll give you a week .  or in other words  seven days .      graham dorn turned desperately to de meister .     you   re in on this  too .  in my books i give you the keenest sense of honor .  is this honorable .      de meister shrugged .     my dear fellow .  all this and haunting  too .      graham rose .      where are you going .         home to write you a letter .     graham   s brows beetled defiantly .      and this time i   ll mail it .  i   m not giving in .  i   ll fight to the last ditch .  and  de meister  you let loose with one single little haunt and i   ll rip your head out of its socket and spurt the blood all over macdunlap   s new suit .      he stalked out  and as he disappeared through the door  de meister disappeared through nothing at all .   macdunlap let out a soft yelp and then took a liver pill  a kidney pill  and a tablespoon of cough syrup in rapid succession .     graham dorn sat in june   s front parlor  and having long since consumed his fingernails  was starting on the first knuckles .   june  at the moment  was not present  and this  graham felt  was just as well .  a dear girl  in fact  a dear  sweet girl but his mind was not on her .   it was concerned instead with a miasmic series of flashbacks over the preceding six days    say  graham  i met your side kick at the club yesterday .  you know  de meister .  got an awful shock .  i always had the idea he was a sort of sherlock holmes that didn   t exist .  that   s one on me  boy .  didn   t know hey  where are you going .    hey  dorn  i hear your boss de meister is back in town .  ought to have material for more stories soon .  you   re lucky you   ve got someone to grind out your plots ready made huh .  well  goodbye .       why  graham  darling  wherever were you last night .  ann   s affair didn   t get anywhere without you  or at least  it wouldn   t have  if it hadn   t been for reggie de meister .  he asked after you  but then  i guess he felt lost without his watson .  it must feel wonderful to watson for such mister dorn .  and the same to you  sir .    you put one over on me .  i thought you made up those wild things .  well  truth is stranger than fiction  ha  ha .    police officials deny that the famous amateur criminologist reginald de meister has interested himself in this case .  mr .  de meister himself could not be reached by our reporters for comment .  mr .  de meister is best known to the public for his brilliant solutions to over a dozen crimes  as chronicled in fiction form by his so called    watson     mr .  grayle doone .   graham quivered and his arms trembled in an awful desire for blood .  de meister was haunting him but good .  he was losing his individuality  exactly as had been threatened .   it gradually dawned upon graham that the monotonous ringing noise he heard was not in his head  but  on the contrary  from the front door .   such seemed likewise the opinion of miss june billings  whose piercing call shot down the stairs and biffed graham a sharp uppercut to the ear drums .      hey  dope  see who   s at the front door  before the vibration tears the house down .  i   ll be down in half an hour .         yes  dear .      graham shuffled his way to the front door and opened it .      ah  there .  greetin   s     said de meister  and brushed past .   graham   s dull eyes stared  and then fired high  as an animal snarl burst from his lips .  he took up that gorilla posture  so comforting to red blooded american males at moments like this  and circled the slightly confused detective .      my dear fellow  are you ill .         i     explained graham     am not ill  but you will soon be past all interest in that  for i am going to bathe my hands in your heart   s reddest blood .         but i say  you   ll only have to wash them afterwards .  it would be such an obvious clue  wouldn   t it .         enough of this gay banter .  have you any last words .         not particularly .         it   s just as well .  i   m not interested in your last words .      he thundered into action  bearing down upon the unfortunate de meister like a bull elephant .  de meister faded to the left  shot out an arm and a foot  and graham described a parabolic arc that ended in the total destruction of an end table  a vase of flowers  a fish bowl  and a five foot section of wall .   graham blinked  and brushed away a curious goldfish from his left eyebrow .      my dear fellow     murmured de meister     oh  my dear fellow .      too late  graham remembered that passage in pistol parade     de meister   s arms were whipcord lightning  as with sure  rapid thrusts  he rendered the two thugs helpless .  not by brute force  but by his expert knowledge of judo  he defeated them easily without hastening his breath .  the thugs groaned in pain .     graham groaned in pain .   he lifted his right thigh an inch or so to let his femur slip back into place .      hadn   t you better get up  old chap .         i will stay here     said graham with dignity     and contemplate the floor in profile view  until such time as it suits me or until such time as i find myself capable of moving a muscle .  i don   t care which .  and now  before i proceed to take further measures with you  what the hell do you want .      reginald de meister adjusted his monocle to a nicety .     you know  i suppose  that macdunlap   s ultimatum expires tomorrow .         and you and he with it  i trust .         you will not reconsider .         ha .         really     de meister sighed     this is borin    no end .  you have made things comfortable for me in this world .  after all  in your books you   ve made me well known in all the clubs and better restaurants  the bosom friend  y   know  of the mayor and commissioner of police  the owner of a park avenue penthouse and a magnificent art collection .  and it all lingers over  old chap .  really quite afiectin    .         it is remarkable     mused graham     the intensity with which i am not listening and the distinctness with which i do not hear a word you say .         still     said de meister     there is no denyin    my book world suits me better .  it is somehow more fascinatin     freer from dull logic  more apart from the necessities of the world .  in short  i must go back  and to active participation .  you have till tomorrow .      graham hummed a gay little tune with flat little notes .      is this a new threat  de meister .         it is the old threat intensified .  i   m going to rob you of every vestige of your personality .  and eventually public opinion will force you to write as  to paraphrase you  de meister   s compleat stooge .  did you see the name the newspaper chappies pinned on you today  old man .         yes  mr .  filthy de meister  and did you read a half column item on page ten in the same paper .  i   ll read it for you     noted criminologist in l a .  will be inducted shortly draft board says .         for a moment  de meister said and did nothing .  and then one  after another  he did the following things  removed his monocle slowly  sat down heavily  rubbed his chin abstractedly  and lit a cigarette after long and careful tamping .  each of these  graham dorn   s trained authorial eye recognized as singly representing perturbation and distress on the part of his character .   and never  in any of his books  did graham remember a time when de meister had gone through all four consecutively .   finally  de meister spoke .     why you had to bring up draft registrations in your last book  i really don   t know .  this urge to be topical  this fiendish desire to be up to the minute with the news is the curse of the mystery novel .  a true mystery is timeless  should have no relation to current events  should         there is one way     said graham     to escape induction         you might at least have mentioned a deferred classification on some vital ground .         there is one way     said graham     to escape induction         criminal negligence     said de meister .      look .  go back to the books and you   ll never be filled with lead .         write them and i   ll do it .         think of the war .         think of your ego .      two strong men stood face to face  or would have  if graham weren   t still horizontal  and neither flinched .   impasse .   and the sweet  feminine voice of june billings interrupted and snapped the tension      may i ask  graham dom  what you are doing on the floor .  it   s been swept today and you   re not complimenting me by attempting to improve the job .         i am not sweeping the floor .  if you looked carefully     replied graham gently     you would see that your own adored fianc   is lying here a mass of bruises and a hotbed of pains and aches .         you   ve ruined my end table .         i   ve broken my leg .         and my best lamp .         and two ribs .         and my fishbowl .         and my adam   s apple .         and you haven   t introduced your friend .         and my cervical verte what friend .         this friend .         friend .  ha .     and a mist came over his eyes .  she was so young  so fragile to come into contact with hard  brutal facts of life .     this     he muttered brokenly     is reginald de meister .      de meister at this point broke a cigarette sharply in two  a gesture pregnant with the deepest emotion .   june said slowly     why why  you   re different from what i had thought .         how had you expected me to look .     asked de meister  in soft  thrilling tones .      i don   t know .  differently than you do  from the stories i heard .         you remind me  somehow  miss billings  of letitia reynolds .         i think so .  graham said he drew her from me .         a very poor imitation  miss billings .  devastatin   ly poor .      they were six inches apart now  eyes fixed with a mutual glue  and graham yelled sharply .  he sprang upright as memory smote him a nasty smite on the forehead .   a passage from case of the muddy overshoe occurred to him .  likewise one from the primrose murders .  also one from the tragedy of hartley manor  death of a hunter  white scorpion and  to put it in a small nutshell  from every one of the others .   the passage read     there was a certain fascination about de meister that appealed irresistibly to women .     and june billings was as it had often  in graham   s idler moments  occurred to him a woman .   and fascination simply gooed out of her ears and coated the floor six inches deep .      get out of this room  june     he ordered .      i will not .         there is something i must discuss with mi .  de meister  man to man .  i demand that you leave this room .         please go  miss billings     said de meister .   june hesitated  and in a very small voice said     very well .         hold on     shouted graham .     don   t let him order you about .  i demand that you stay .      she closed the door very gently behind her .   the two men faced each other .  there was that in either pair of eyes that indicated a strong man brought to bay .  there was stubborn  undying antagonism  no quarter  no compromise .  it was exactly the sort of situation graham dom always presented his readers with  when two strong men fought for one hand  one heart  one girl .   the two said simultaneously     let   s make a deal .      graham said     you have convinced me  reggie .  our public needs us .  tomorrow i shall begin another de meister story .  let us shake hands and forget the past .      de meister struggled with his emotion .  he laid his hand on graham   s lapel     my dear fellow  it is i who have been convinced by your logic .  i can   t allow you to sacrifice yourself for me .  there are great things in you that must be brought out .  write your coal mining novels .  they count  not i .         i couldn   t  old chap .  not after all you   ve done for me  and all you   ve meant to me .  tomorrow we start anew .         graham  my my spiritual father  i couldn   t allow it .  do you think i have no feelings  filial feelings in a spiritual sort of way .         but the war  think of the war .  mangled limbs .  blood all that .         i must stay .  my country needs me .         but if i stop writing  eventually you will stop existing .  i can   t allow that .         oh  that .     de meister laughed with a careless elegance .     things have changed since .  so many people believe in my existence now that my grip upon actual existence has become too firm to be broken .  i don   t have to worry about limbo any more .         oh .     graham clenched his teeth and spoke in searing sibilants     so that   s your scheme  you snake .  do you suppose i don   t see you   re stuck on june .         look here  old chap     said de meister haughtily .     i can   t permit you to speak slightingly of a true and honest love .  i love june and she loves me i know it .  and if you   re going to be stuffy and victorian about it  you can swallow some nitro glycerine and tap yourself with a hammer .         i   ll nitro glycerine you .  because i   m going home tonight and beginning another de meister story .  you   ll be part of it and you   ll get back into it  and what do you think of that .         nothing  because you can   t write another de meister story .  i   m too real now  and you can   t control me just like that .  and what do you think of that .      it took graham dom a week to make up his mind what to think of that  and then his thoughts were completely and startlingly unprintable .   in fact  it was impossible to write .   that is  startling ideas occurred to him for great novels  emotional dramas  epic poems  brilliant essays but he couldn   t write anything about reginald de meister .   the typewriter was simply fresh out of capital r   s .   graham wept  cursed  tore his hair  and anointed his finger tips with liniment .  he tried typewriter  pen  pencil  crayon  charcoal  and blood .   he could not write .   the doorbell rang  and graham threw it open .   macdunlap stumbled in  falling over the first drifts of torn paper directly into graham   s arms .   graham let him drop .     hah .     he said  with frozen dignity .      my heart .     said macdunlap  and fumbled for his liver pills .      don   t die there     suggested graham  courteously .     the management won   t permit me to drop human flesh into the incinerator .         graham  my boy     macdunlap said  emotionally     no more ultimatums .  no more threats .  i come now to appeal to your finer feelings  graham     he went through a slight choking interlude    i love you like a son .  this skunk de meister must disappear .  you must write more de meister stories for my sake .  graham i will tell you something in private .  my wife is in love with this detective .  she tells me i am not romantic .  i .  not romantic .  can you understand it .         i can     was the tragic response .     he fascinates all women .         with that face .  with that monocle .         it says so in all my books .      macdunlap stiffened .     ah ha .  you again .  dope .  if only you ever stopped long enough to let your mind know what your typewriter was saying .         you insisted .  feminine trade .     graham didn   t care any more .  women .  he snickered bitterly .  nothing wrong with any of them that a block buster wouldn   t fix .   macdunlap hemmed .     well  feminine trade .  very necessary .   but graham  what shall i do .  it   s not only my wife .  she owns fifty shares in macdunlap  inc .  in her own name .  if she leaves me  i lose control .  think of it  graham .  the catastrophe to the publishing world .         grew  old chap     graham sighed a sigh so deep  his toenails quivered sympathetically .     i might as well tell you .  june  my fianc  e  you know  loves this worm .  and he loves her because she is the prototype of letitia reynolds .         the what of letitia .     asked macdunlap  vaguely suspecting an insult .      never mind .  my life is ruined .     he smiled bravely and choked back the unmanly tears  after the first two had dripped off the end of his nose .      my poor boy .     the two gripped hands convulsively .      caught in a vise by this foul monster     said graham .      trapped like a german in russia     said macdunlap .      victim of an inhuman fiend     said graham .      exactly     said macdunlap .  he wrung graham   s hand as if he were milking a cow .     you   ve got to write de meister stories and get him back where  next to hell  he most belongs .  right .         right .  but there   s one little catch .         what .         i can   t write .  he   s so real now  i can   t put him into a book .      macdunlap caught the significance of the massed drifts of used paper on the floor .  he held his head and groaned     my corporation .  my wife .         there   s always the army     said graham .   macdunlap looked up .     what about death on the third deck  the novel i rejected three weeks ago .         that doesn   t count .  it   s past history .  it   s already affected him .         without being published .         sure .  that   s the story i mentioned his draft board in .  the one that put him in l a .         i could think of better places to put him .         macdunlap .     graham dorn jumped up  and grappled macdunlap   s lapel .     maybe it can be revised .      macdunlap coughed hackingly  and stifled out a dim grunt .      we can put anything we want into it .     macdunlap choked a bit .      we can fix things up .      macdunlap turned blue in the face .   graham shook the lapel and everything thereto attached     say something  won   t you .      macdunlap wrenched away and took a tablespoon of cough syrup .  he held his hand over his heart and patted it a bit .  he shook his head and gestured with his eyebrows .   graham shrugged .     well  if you just want to be sullen  go ahead .  i   ll revise it without you .      he located the manuscript and tried his fingers gingerly on the typewriter .  they went smoothly  with practically no creaking at the joints .  he put on speed  more speed  and then went into his usual race  with the portable jouncing along merrily under the accustomed head of steam .      it   s working     he shouted .     i can   t write new stories  but i can revise old  unpublished ones .      macdunlap watched over his shoulder .  he breathed only at odd moments .        faster     said macdunlap     faster .         faster than thirty five .     said graham  sternly .     opa  the office of price administration was in charge of gasoline rationing at this period .  remember    a    stickers .  d . r . b .   forbid .  five more minutes .         will he be there .         he   s always there .  he   s been at her house every evening this week .     he spat out the fine ivory dust into which he had ground the last inch of his incisors .     but god help you if your secretary falls down on the job .         my boy  on my secretary you can depend .         she   s got to read that revision by nine .         if she doesn   t drop dead .         with my luck  she will .  will she believe it .         every word .  she   s seen de meister .  she knows he exists .      brakes screeched  and graham   s soul cringed in sympathy with every molecule of rubber frictioned off the tires .   he bounded up the stairs  macdunlap hobbling after .   he rang the bell and burst in at the door .  reginald de meister standing directly inside received the full impact of a pointing finger  and only a rapid backward movement of the head kept him from becoming a one eyed mythical character .   june billings stood aside  silent and uncomfortable .      reginald de meister     growled graham  in sinister tones     prepare to meet your doom .         oh  boy     said macdunlap     are you going to get it .         and to what     asked de meister     am i indebted for your dramatic but unilluminatin    statement .  confusin     don   t you know .     he lit a cigarette with a fine gesture and smiled .      hello  gramie     said june  tearfully .          scram  vile woman .      june sniffed .  she felt like a heroine out of a book  tom by her own emotions .  naturally  she was having the time of her life .   so she let the tears dribble and looked forlorn .      to return to the subject  what is this all about .     asked de meister  wearily .      i have rewritten death on the third deck .         well .         the revision     continued graham     is at present in the hands of macdunlap   s secretary  a girl on the style of miss billings  my fianc  e that was .  that is  she is a girl who aspires to the status of a moron  but has not yet quite attained it .  she   ll believe every word .          well .      graham   s voice grew ominous     you remember  perhaps  sancho rodriguez .      for the first time  reginald de meister shuddered .  he caught his cigarette as it dropped .     she was killed by sam blake in the sixth chapter .  she was in love with me .  really  old fellow  what messes you get me into .         not half the mess you   re in now  old chap .  sancha rodriguez did not die in the revision .         die .     came a sharp  but clear female voice     i   ll show him if i died .  and where have you been this last month  you two crosser .      de meister did not catch his cigarette this time .  he didn   t even try .  he recognized the apparition .  to an unprejudiced observer  it might have been merely a svelte latin girl equipped with dark  flashing eyes  and long  glittering fingernails  but to de meister  it was sancha rodriguez undead .   macdunlap   s secretary had read and believed .      miss rodriguez     throbbed de meister  charmingly     how fascinatin    to see you .         mrs .  de meister to you  you double timer  you two crosser  you scum of the ground  you scorpion of the grass .  and who is this woman .      june retreated with dignity behind the nearest chair .   mrs .  de meister     said reginald pleadingly  and turned helplessly to graham dom .      oh  you have forgotten  have you  you smooth talker  you low dog .  i   ll show you what it means to deceive a weak woman .  i   ll make you mince meat with my fingernails .      de meister back pedaled furiously .     but darling         don   t you make sweet talk .  what are you doing with this woman .         but  darling         don   t give me any explanation .  what are you doing with this woman .         but darling         shut up .  what are you doing with this woman .      reginald de meister was up in a comer  and mrs .  de meister shook her fists at him .      answer me .      de meister disappeared .   mrs .  de meister disappeared right after him .  june billings collapsed into real tears .   graham dorn folded his arms and looked sternly at her .  macdunlap rubbed his hands and took a kidney pill .      it wasn   t my fault  gramie     said june .     you said in your books he fascinated all women  so i couldn   t help it .  deep inside  i hated him all along .  you believe me  don   t you .         a likely story .     said graham  sitting down next to her on the sofa .      a likely story .  but i forgive you  maybe .      macdunlap said tremulously     my boy  you have saved my stocks .  also  my wife  of course .  and remember you promised me one de meister story each year .      graham gritted     just one  and i   ll henpeck him to death  and keep one unpublished story forever on hand  just in case .  and you   re publishing my novel  aren   t you  grew  old boy .         glug     said macdunlap .      aren   t you .         yes  graham .  of course  graham .  definitely  graham .  positively  graham .         then leave us now .  there are matters of importance i must discuss with my fianc  e .      macdunlap smiled and tiptoed out the door .   ah  love  love  he mused  as he took a liver pill and followed it up by a cough syrup chaser .     the end    i might make two points about    author .  author .     it seems to me that i was rather easier about handling romance in this story than in any previous one .  perhaps this is a reflection of the fact that it was the first story i ever wrote as a married man .     secondly  there are the very dated references to rationing  the draft  and other social phenomena much on the mind of anyone living through world war ii .  i had warned bensen of the existence of these references and of the inability of getting them out of the story by revision since they were integral to the plot .  bensen  however  shrugged them off and in his short introduction to the story said to the readers      and don   t worry about the references to the opa and selective service consider them as part of the historical setting  just as you would a bodkin or a furbelow in a story of an earlier time .      and i second that statement here .     had i rested on the pink cloud of gratification that came with the sale of     author .  author .     for a few months  the death of unknown might have disheartened me .  it might have seemed to prove that i was not fated to reignite my career after all  and perhaps again everything would have turned out differently .   however  within three weeks of the sale i was at the typewriter again .  the new story was    death sentence    and it was science fiction .  writing was still slow work  seven weeks to do a       word story .  on june           however  i sent it off to campbell  and on july    it was accepted one and a quarter cents per word again .   this meant that when the news of unknown   s demise arrived  it was cushioned by the fact that i already had another story written and sold .       death sentence     brand gorla smiled uncomfortably     these things exaggerate  you know .         no  no  no .     the little man   s albino pink eyes snapped .     dorlis was great when no human had ever entered the vegan system .  it was the capital of a galactic confederation greater than ours .         well  then  let   s say that it was an ancient capital .  i   ll admit that and leave the rest to an archaeologist .         archaeologists are no use .  what i   ve discovered needs a specialist in its own field .  and you   re on the board .      brand gorla looked doubtful .  he remembered theor realo in senior year a little white misfit of a human who skulked somewhere in the background of his reminiscences .  it had been a long time ago  but the albino had been queer .  that was easy to remember .  and he was still queer .      i   ll try to help     brand said     if you   ll tell me what you want .      theor watched intently     i want you to place certain facts before the board .  will you promise that .      brand hedged     even if i help you along  theor  i   ll have to remind you that i   m junior member of the psychological board .  i haven   t much influence .         you must do your best .  the facts will speak for themselves .     the albino   s hands were trembling .      go ahead .     brand resigned himself .  the man was an old school fellow .  you couldn   t be too arbitrary about things .   brand gorla leaned back and relaxed .  the light of arcturus shone through the ceiling high windows  diffused and mellowed by the polarizing glass .  even this diluted version of sunlight was too much for the pink eyes of the other  and he shaded his eyes as he spoke .      i   ve lived on dorlis twenty five years  brand     he said     i   ve poked into places no one today knew existed  and i   ve found things .  dorlis was the scientific and cultural capital of a civilization greater than ours .  yes it was  and particularly in psychology .         things in the past always seem greater .     brand condescended a smile .     there is a theorem to that effect which you   ll find in any elementary text .  freshmen invariably call it the    cod theorem .     stands for    good old days     you know .  but go on .      theor frowned at the digression .  he hid the beginning of a sneer     you can always dismiss an uncomfortable fact by pinning a dowdy label to it .  but tell me this .  what do you know of psychological engineering .      brand shrugged     no such thing .  anyway  not in the strict mathematical sense .  all propaganda and advertising is a crude form of hit and miss psych engineering and pretty effective sometimes .  maybe that   s what you mean .         not at all .  i mean actual experimentation  with masses of people  under controlled conditions  and over a period of years .         such things have been discussed .  it   s not feasible in practice .  our social structure couldn   t stand much of it  and we don   t know enough to set up effective controls .      theor suppressed excitement     but the ancients did know enough .  and they did set up controls .      brand considered phlegmatically     startling and interesting  but how do you know .         because i found the documents relating to it .     he paused breathlessly .     an entire planet  brand .  a complete world picked to suit  peopled with beings under strict control from every angle .  studied  and charted  and experimented upon .  don   t you get the picture .      brand noted none of the usual stigmata of mental uncontrol .  a closer investigation  perhaps  he said evenly     you must have been misled .  it   s thoroughly impossible .  you can   t control humans like that .  too many variables .         and that   s the point  brand .  they weren   t humans .         what .         they were robots  positronic robots .  a whole world of them  brand  with nothing to do but live and react and be observed by a set of psychologists that were teal psychologists .         that   s mad .         i have proof because that robot world still exists .  the first confederation went to pieces  but that robot world kept on going .  it still exists .         and how do you know .      theor realo stood up .     because i   ve been there these last twenty five years .        the board master threw his formal red edged gown aside and reached into a pocket for a long  gnarled and decidedly unofficial cigar .      preposterous     he grunted     and thoroughly insane .         exactly     said brand     and i can   t spring it on the board just like that .  they wouldn   t listen .  i   ve got to get this across to you first  and then  if you can put your authority behind it         oh  nuts .  i never heard anything as who is the fellow .      brand sighed      a crank  i   ll admit that .  he was in my class at arcturus u .  and a crack pot albino even then .  maladjusted as the devil  hipped on ancient history  and just the kind that gets an idea and goes through with it by plain .  dumb plugging .  he   s poked about in dorlis for twenty five years  he says .  he   s got the complete records of practically an entire civilization .      the board master puffed furiously .     yeah  i know .  in the telestat serials  the brilliant amateur always uncovers the great things .  the free lance .  the lone wolf .  nuts .  have you consulted the department of archaeology .         certainly .  and the result was interesting .  no one bothers with dorlis .  this isn   t just ancient history  you see .  it   s a matter of fifteen thousand years .  it   s practically myth .  reputable archaeologists don   t waste too much time with it .  it   s just the thing a book struck layman with a single track mind would uncover .  after this  of course  if the business turns out right  dorlis will become an archaeologist   s paradise .      the board master screwed his homely face into an appalling grimace .     it   s very unflattering to the ego .  if there   s any truth in all this  the so called first confederation must have had a grasp of psychology so far past ours  as to make us out to be blithering imbeciles .  too  they   d have to build positronic robots that would be about seventy five orders of magnitude above anything we   ve even blueprinted .  galaxy .  think of the mathematics involved .         look  sir  i   ve consulted just about everybody .  i wouldn   t bring this thing to you if i weren   t certain that i had every angle checked .  i went to blak just about the first thing  and he   s consultant mathematician to united robots .  he says there   s no limit to these things .  given the time  the money  and the advance in psychology get that robots like that could be built right now .         what proof has he .         who  blak .         no  no .  your friend .  the albino .  you said he had papers .         he has .  i   ve got them here .  he   s got documents and there   s no denying their antiquity .  i   ve had that checked every way from sunday .  i can   t read them  of course .  i don   t know if anyone can  except theor realo .         that   s stacking the deck  isn   t it .  we have to take his say so .         yes  in a way .  but he doesn   t claim to be able to decipher more than portions .  he says it is related to ancient centaurian  and i   ve put linguists to work on it .  it can be cracked and if his translation isn   t accurate  we   ll know about it .         all right .  let   s see it .      brand gorla brought out the plastic mounted documents .  the board master tossed them aside and reached for the translation .  smoke billowed as he read .      humph     was his comment .     further details are on dorlis  i suppose .         theor claims that there are some hundred to two hundred tons of blueprints altogether  on the brain plan of the positronic robots alone .  they   re still there in the original vault .  but that   s the least of it .  he   s been on the robot world itself .  he   s got photocasts  teletype recordings  all sorts of details .  they   re not integrated  and obviously the work of a layman who knows next to nothing about psychology .  even so  he   s managed to get enough data to prove pretty conclusively that the world he was on wasn   t .  .  . uh .  .  . natural .         you   ve got that with you  too .         all of it .  most of it   s on microfilm  but i   ve brought the projector .  here are your eyepieces .      an hour later  the board master said     i   ll call a board meeting tomorrow and push this through .      brand gorla grinned tightly     we   ll send a commission to dorlis .         when     said the board master dryly     and if we can get an appropriation out of the university for such an affair .  leave this material with me for the while  please .  i want to study it a little more .        theoretically  the governmental department of science and technology exercises administrative control over all scientific investigation .  actually  however  the pure research groups of the large universities are thoroughly autonomous bodies  and  as a general rule  the government does not care to dispute that .  but a general rule is not necessarily a universal rule .   and so  although the board master scowled and fumed and swore  there was no way of refusing wynne murry an interview .  to give murry his complete title  he was under secretary in charge of psychology  psychopathy and mental technology .  and he was a pretty fair psychologist in his own right .   so the board master might glare  but that was all .   secretary murry ignored the glare cheerfully .  he rubbed his long chin against the grain and said     it amounts to a case of insufficient information .  shall we put it that way .      the board master said frigidly     i don   t see what information you want .  the government   s say in university appropriations is purely advisory  and in this case  i might say  the advice is unwelcome .      murry shrugged     i have no quarrel with the appropriation .  but you   re not going to leave the planet without government permit .  that   s where the insufficient information comes in .         there is no information other than we   ve given you .         but things have leaked out .  all this is childish and rather unnecessary secrecy .   the old psychologist flushed .     secrecy .  if you don   t know the academic way of life  i can   t help you .  investigations  especially those of major importance  aren   t  and can   t be  made public  until definite progress has been made .  when we get back  we   ll send you copies of whatever papers we publish .      murry shook his head     uh uh .  not enough .  you   re going to dorlis  aren   t you .         we   ve informed the department of science of that .         why .         why do you want to know .         because it   s big  or the board master wouldn   t go himself .  what   s this about an older civilization and a world of robots .         well  then  you know .         only vague notions we   ve been able to scrabble up .  i want the details .         there are none that we know now .  we won   t know until we   re on dorlis .         then i   m going with you .         what .         you see  i want the details  too .         why .         ah     murry unfolded his legs and stood up     now you   re asking the questions .  it   s no use  now .  i know that the universities aren   t keen on government supervision  and i know that i can expect no willing help from any academic source .  but  by arcturus  i   m going to get help this time  and i don   t care how you fight it .  your expedition is going nowhere  unless i go with you representing the government .         dorlis  as a world  is not impressive .  it   s importance to galactic economy is nil  its position far off the great trade routes  its natives backward and unenlightened  its history obscure .  and yet somewhere in the heaps of rubble that clutter an ancient world  there is obscure evidence of an influx of flame and destruction that destroyed the dorlis of an earlier day the greater capital of a greater federation .   and somewhere in that rubble  men of a newer world poked and probed and tried to understand .   the board master shook his head and then pushed back his grizzling hair .  he hadn   t shaved in a week .      the trouble is     he said     that we have no point of reference .  the language can be broken  i suppose  but nothing can be done with the notation .         i think a great deal has been done .         stabs in the dark .  guessing games based on the translations of your albino friend .  i won   t base any hopes on that .      brand said     nuts .  you spent two years on the nimian anomaly  and so far only two months on this  which happens to be a hundred thousand times the job .  it   s something else that   s getting you .     he smiled grimly .     it doesn   t take a psychologist to see that the government man is in your hair .      the board master bit the end off a cigar and spat it four feet .  he said slowly     there are three things about the mule headed idiot that make me sore .  first  i don   t like government interference .  second  i don   t like a stranger sniffing about when we   re on top of the biggest thing in the history of psychology .  third  what in the galaxy does he want .  what is he after .         i don   t know .         what should he be after .  have you thought of it at all .         no .  frankly  i don   t care .  i   d ignore him if i were you .         you would     said the board master violently .     you would .  you think the government   s entrance into this affair need only be ignored .  i suppose you know that this murry calls himself a psychologist .         i know that .         and i suppose you know he   s been displaying a devouring interest in all that we   ve veen doing .         that  i should say  would be natural .         oh .  and you know further     his voice dropped with startling suddenness .     all right  murry   s at the door .  take it easy .      wynne murry grinned a greeting  but the board master nodded unsmilingly .      well  sir     said murry bluffly     do you know i   ve been on my feet for forty eight hours .  you   ve got something here .  something big .         thank you .         no  no .  i   m serious .  the robot world exists .         did you think it didn   t .      the secretary shrugged amiably .     one has a certain natural skepticism .  what are your future plans .         why do you ask .     the board master grunted his words as if they were being squeezed out singly .      to see if they jibe with my own .         and what are your own .      the secretary smiled .     no  no .  you take precedence .  how long do you intend staying here .         as long as it takes to make a fair beginning on the documents involved .         that   s no answer .  what do you mean by a fair beginning .         i haven   t the slightest idea .  it might take years .         oh  damnation .      the board master raised his eyebrows and said nothing .   the secretary looked at his nails .     i take it you know the location of this robot world .         naturally .  theor realo was there .  his information up to now has proven very accurate .         that   s right .  the albino .  well  why not go there .         go there .  impossible .         may i ask why .         look     said the board master with restrained impatience     you   re not here by our invitation  and we   re not asking you to dictate our course of actions  but just to show you that i   m not looking for a fight  i   ll give you a little metaphorical treatment of our case .  suppose we were presented with a huge and complicated machine  composed of principles and materials of which we knew next to nothing .  it is so vast we can   t even make out the relationship of the parts  let alone the purpose of the whole .  now  would you advise me to begin attacking the delicate mysterious moving parts of the machine with a detonating ray before i know what it   s all about .         i see your point  of course  but you   re becoming a mystic .  the metaphor is farfetched .         not at all .  these positronic robots were constructed along lines we know nothing of as yet and were intended to follow lines with which we are entirely unacquainted .  about the only thing we know is that the robots were put aside in complete isolation  to work out their destiny by themselves .  to ruin that isolation would be to ruin the experiment .  if we go there in a body  introducing new  unforeseen factors  inducing unintended reactions  everything is ruined .  the littlest disturbance         poppycock .  theor realo has already gone there .      the board master lost his temper suddenly .     don   t you suppose i know that .  do you suppose it would ever have happened if that cursed albino hadn   t been an ignorant fanatic without any knowledge of psychology at all .  galaxy knows what the idiot has done in the way of damage .      there was a silence .  the secretary clicked his teeth with a thoughtful fingernail .     i don   t know .  .  .  . i don   t know .  but i   ve got to find out .  and i can   t wait years .      he left  and the board master turned seethingly to brand      and how are we going to stop him from going to the robot world if he wants to .         i don   t see how he can go if we don   t let him .  he doesn   t head the expedition .         oh  doesn   t he .  that   s what i was about to tell you just before he came in .  ten ships of the fleet have landed on dorlis since we arrived .         what .         just that .         but what for .         that  my boy  is what i don   t understand  either .  .  .        mind if i drop in .     said wynne murry  pleasantly  and theor realo looked up in sudden anxiety from the papers that lay in hopeless disarray on the desk before him .      come in .  i   ll clear off a seat for you .     the albino hustled the mess off one of the two chairs in a state of twittering nerves .   murry sat down and swung one long leg over the other .     are you assigned a job here  too .     he nodded at the desk .   theor shook his head and smiled feebly .  almost automatically  he brushed the papers together in a heap and turned them face down .   in the months since he had returned to dorlis with a hundred psychologists of various degrees of renown  he had felt himself pushed farther and farther from the center of things .  there was room for him no longer .  except to answer questions on the actual state of things upon the robot world  which he alone had visited  he played no part and even there he detected  or seemed to detect  anger that he should have gone  and not a competent scientist  it was a thing to be resented .  yet  somehow  it had always been like that     pardon me .     he had let murry   s next remark slip .   the secretary repeated     i say it   s surprising you   re not put to work  then .  you made the original discovery  didn   t you .         yes     the albino brightened .     but it went out of my hands .  it got beyond me .         you were on the robot world  though .         that was a mistake  they tell me .  i might have ruined everything .      murry grimaced .     what really gets them  i guess  is that you   ve got a lot of first hand dope that they didn   t don   t let their fancy titles fool you into thinking you   re a nobody .  a layman with common sense is better than a blind specialist you and i i   m a layman  too  you know have to stand up for our rights .  here  have a cigarette .         i don   t sm i   ll take one  thank you .     the albino felt himself warming to the long bodied man opposite .  he turned the papers face upward again  and lit up  bravely but uncertainly .      twenty five years .     theor spoke carefully  skirting around urgent coughs .      would you answer a few questions about the world .         i suppose so .  that   s all they ever ask me about but hadn   t you better ask them .  they   ve probably got it all worked out now .     he blew the smoke as far from himself as possible .   murry said     frankly  they haven   t even begun  and i want the information without benefit of confusing psychological translation .  first of all  what kind of people or things are these robots .  you haven   t a photocast of one of them  have you .         well  no .  i didn   t like to take    casts of them .  but they   re not things .  they   re people .         no .  do they look like people .         yes mostly .  outside  anyway .  i brought some microscopic studies of the cellular structure that i got hold of .  the board master has them .  they   re different inside  you know  greatly simplified .  but you   d never know that .  they   re interesting and nice .         are they simpler than the other life of the planet .         oh  no .  it   s a very primitive planet .  and .  .  . and     he was interrupted by a spasm of coughing and crushed the cigarette to death as unobtrusively as possible .     they   ve got a protoplasmic base  you know .  i don   t think they have the slightest idea they   re robots .         no .  i don   t suppose they would have .  what about their science .         i don   t know .  i never got a chance to see .  and everything was so different .  i guess it would take an expert to understand .         did they have machines .      the albino looked surprised .     well  of course .  a good many  of all sorts .         large cities .         yes .      the secretary   s eyes grew thoughtful .      and you like them .  why .      theor realo was brought up sharply .     i don   t know .  they were just likable .  we got along .  they didn   t bother me so .  it   s nothing i can put my finger on .  maybe it   s because i have it so hard getting along back home  and they weren   t as difficult as real people .         they were more friendly .         n no .  can   t say so .  they never quite accepted me .  i was a stranger  didn   t know their language at first all that .  but    he looked up with sudden brightness    i understood them better .  i could tell what they were thinking better .  i but i don   t know why .         hm m m .  well another cigarette .  no .  i   ve got to be walloping the pillow now .  it   s getting late .  how about a twosome at golf tomorrow .  i   ve worked up a little course .  it   ll do .  come on out .  the exercise will put hair on your chest .      he grinned and left .   he mumbled one sentence to himself     it looks like a death sentence    and whistled thoughtfully as he passed along to his own quarters .     he repeated the phrase to himself when he faced the board master the next day  with the sash of office about his waist .  he did not sit down .      again .     said the board master  wearily .      again .     assented the secretary .     but real business this time .  i may have to take over direction of your expedition .         what .  impossible  sir .  i will listen to no such proposition .         i have my authority .     wynne murry presented the metalloid cylinder that snapped open at a flick of the thumb .     i have full powers and full discretion as to their use .  it is signed  as you will observe  by the chairman of the congress of the federation .         so but why .     the board master  by an effort  breathed normally .     short of arbitrary tyranny  is there a reason .         a very good one  sir .  all along  we have viewed this expedition from different angles .  the department of science and technology views the robot world not from the point of view of a scientific curiosity  but from the standpoint of its interference with the peace of the federation .  i don   t think you   ve ever stopped to consider the danger inherent in this robot world .         none that i can see .  it is thoroughly isolated and thoroughly harmless .         how can you know .         from the very nature of the experiment     shouted the board master angrily .     the original planners wanted as nearly a completely closed system as possible .  here they are  just as far off the trade routes as possible  in a thinly populated region of space .  the whole idea was to have the robots develop free of interference .      murry smiled .     i disagree with you there .  look  the whole trouble with you is that you   re a theoretical man .  you look at things the way they ought to be and i  a practical man  look at things as they are .  no experiment can be set up and allowed to run indefinitely under its own power .  it is taken for granted that somewhere there is at least an observer who watches and modifies as circumstances warrant .         well .     said the board master stolidly .      well  the observers in this experiment  the original psychologists of dorlis  passed away with the first confederation  and for fifteen thousand years the experiment has proceeded by itself .  little errors have added up and become big ones and introduced alien factors which induced still other errors .  it   s a geometric progression .  and there   s been no one to halt it .         pure hypothesis .         maybe .  but you   re interested only in the robot world  and i   ve got to think of the entire federation .         and just what possible danger call the robot world be to the federation .  i don   t know what in arcturus you   re driving at  man .      murry sighed .     i   ll be simple  but don   t blame me if i sound melodramatic .  the federation hasn   t had any internal warfare for centuries .  what will happen if we come into contact with these robots .         are you afraid of one world .         could be .  what about their science .  robots can do funny things sometimes .         what science call they have .  they   re not metal electricity supermen .  they   re weak protoplasmic creatures  a poor imitation of actual humanity  built around a positronic brain adjusted to a set of simplified human psychological laws .  if the word    robot    is scaring you         no  it isn   t  but i   ve talked to theor realo .  he   s the only one who   s seen them  you know .      the board master cursed silently and fluently .  it came of letting a weak minded freak of a layman get underfoot where he could babble and do harm .   he said     we   ve got realo   s full story  and we   ve evaluated it fully and capably .  i assure you  no harm exists in them .  the experiment is so thoroughly academic  i wouldn   t spend two days on it if it weren   t for the broad scope of the thing .  from what we see  the whole idea was to build up a positronic brain containing modifications of one or two of the fundamental axioms .  we haven   t worked out the details  but they must be minor  as it was the first experiment of this nature ever tried  and even the great mythical psychologists of that day had to progress stepwise .  those robots  i tell you  are neither supermen nor beasts .  i assure you as a psychologist .         sorry .  i   m a psychologist  too .  a little more rule of thumb  i   m afraid .  that   s all .  but even little modifications .  take the general spirit of combativeness .  that isn   t the scientific term  but i   ve no patience for that .  you know what i mean .  we humans used to be combative .  but it   s being bred out of us .  a stable political and economic system doesn   t encourage the waste energy of combat .  it   s not a survival factor .  but suppose the robots are combative .  suppose as the result of a wrong turn during the millennia they   ve been unwatched  they   ve become far more combative than ever their first makers intended .  they   d be uncomfortable things to be with .         and suppose all the stars in the galaxy became novae at the same time .  let   s really start worrying .           and there   s another point .     murry ignored the other   s heavy sarcasm .     theor realo liked those robots .  he liked robots better than he likes real people .  he felt that he fitted there  and we all know he   s been a bad misfit in his own world .         and what     asked the board master     is the significance of that .         you don   t see it .     wynne murry lifted his eyebrows .     theor realo likes those robots because he is like them  obviously .  i   ll guarantee right now that a complete psychic analysis of theor realo will show a modification of several fundamental axioms  and the same ones as in the robots .      and     the secretary drove on without a pause     theor realo worked for a quarter of a century to prove a point  when all science would have laughed him to death if they had known about it .  there   s fanaticism there  good  honest  inhuman perseverance .  those robots are probably like that .         you   re advancing no logic .  you   re arguing like a maniac  like a moon struck idiot .         i don   t need strict mathematical proof .  reasonable doubt is sufficient .  i   ve got to protect the federation .  look  it is reasonable  you know .  the psychologists of dorlis weren   t as super as all that .  they had to advance stepwise  as you yourself pointed out .  their humanoids let   s not call them robots were only imitations of human beings and they couldn   t be good ones .  humans possess certain very  very complicated reaction systems things like social consciousness  and a tendency toward the establishment of ethical systems  and more ordinary things like chivalry  generosity  fair play and so on  that simply can   t possibly be duplicated .  i don   t think those humanoids can have them .  but they must have perseverance  which practically implies stubbornness and combativeness  if my notion on theor realo holds good .  well  if their science is anywhere at all  then i don   t want to have them running loose in the galaxy  if our numbers are a thousand or million times theirs .  and i don   t intend to permit them to do so .      the board master   s face was rigid .     what are your immediate intentions .         as yet undecided .  but i think i am going to organize a small scale landing on the planet .         now  wait .     the old psychologist was up and around the desk .  he seized the secretary   s elbow .     are you quite certain you know what you   re doing .  the potentialities in this massive experiment are beyond any possible precalculation by you or me .  you can   t know what you   re destroying .         i know .  do you think i enjoy what i   m doing .  this isn   t a hero   s job .  i   m enough of a psychologist to want to know what   s going on  but i   ve been sent here to protect the federation  and to the best of my ability i intend doing it and a dirty job it is .  but i can   t help .      you can   t have thought it out .  what can you know of the insight it will give us into the basic ideas of psychology .  this will amount to a fusion of two galactic systems  that will send us to heights that will make up in knowledge and power a million times the amount of harm the robots could ever do  if they were metal electricity supermen .      the secretary shrugged .     now you   re the one that is playing with faint possibilities .         listen  i   ll make a deal .  blockade them .  isolate them with your ships .  mount guards .  but don   t touch them .  give us more time .  give us a chance .  you must .         i   ve thought of that .  but i would have to get congress to agree to that .  it would be expensive  you know .      the board master flung himself into his chair in wild impatience .     what kind of expense are you talking about .  do you realize the nature of the repayment if we succeed .      murry considered  then  with a half smile     what if they develop interstellar travel .      the board master said quickly     then i   ll withdraw my objections .      the secretary rose     i   ll have it out with congress .        brand gorla   s face was carefully emotionless as he watched the board master   s stooped back .  the cheerful pep talks to the available members of the expedition lacked meat  and he listened to them impatiently .   he said     what are we going to do now .      the board master   s shoulders twitched and he didn   t turn .     i   ve sent for theor realo .  that little fool left for the eastern continent last week      why .      the older man blazed at the interruption .     how can i understand anything that freak does .  don   t you see that murry   s right .  he   s a psychic abnormality .  we had no business leaving him unwatched .  if i had ever thought of looking at him twice  i wouldn   t have .  he   s coming back now  though  and he   s going to stay back .     his voice fell to a mumble .     should have been back two hours ago .         it   s an impossible position  sir     said brand  flatly .      think so .         well do you think congress will stand for an indefinite patrol off the robot world .  it runs into money  and average galactic citizens aren   t going to see it as worth the taxes .  the psychological equations degenerate into the axioms of common sense .  in fact  i don   t see why murry agreed to consult congress .         don   t your the board master finally faced his junior .     well  the fool considers himself a psychologist  galaxy help us  and that   s his weak point .  he flatters himself that he doesn   t want to destroy the robot world in his heart  but that it   s the good of the federation that requires it .  and he   ll jump at any reasonable compromise .  congress won   t agree to it indefinitely  you don   t have to point that out to me .     he was talking quietly  patiently .     but i will ask for ten years  two years  six months as much as i can get .  i   ll get something .  in that time  we   ll learn new facts about the world .  somehow we   ll strengthen our case and renew the agreement when it expires .  we   ll save the project yet .      there was a short silence and the board master added slowly and bitterly     and that   s where theor realo plays a vital part      brand gorla watched silently  and waited .  the board master said     on that one point  murry saw what we didn   t .  realo is a psychological cripple  and is our real clue to the whole affair .  if we study him  we   ll have a rough picture of what the robot is like  distorted of course  since his environment has been a hostile  unfriendly one .  but we can make allowance for that  estimate his nature in a ahh  i   m tired of the whole subject      the signal box flashed  and the board master sighed .     well  he   s here .  all right  gorla  sit down  you make me nervous .  let   s take a look at him .        theor realo came through the door like a comet and brought himself to a panting halt in the middle of the floor .  he looked from one to the other with weak  peering eyes .      how did all this happen .         all what .     said the board master coldly .     sit down .  i want to ask you some questions .         no .  you first answer me .         sit down .      realo sat his eyes were brimming .     they   re going to destroy the robot world .         don   t worry about that        but you said they could if the robots discovered interstellar travel .  you said so .  you fool .  don   t you see     he was choking .   the board master frowned uneasily .     will you calm down and talk sense .      the albino gritted his teeth and forced the words out .     but they   ll have interstellar travel before long .      and the two psychologists shot toward the little man .      what .  .         well .  .  . well  what do you think .     realo sprang upward with all the fury of desperation .     did you think i landed in a desert or in the middle of an ocean and explored a world all by myself .  do you think life is a storybook .  i was captured as soon as i landed and taken to a big city .  at least  i think it was a big city .  it was different from our kind .  it had but i won   t tell you .         never mind the city     shrieked the board master .     you were captured .  go ahead .         they studied me .  they studied my machine .  and then  one night  i left  to tell the federation .  they didn   t know i left .  they didn   t want me to leave .     his voice broke .      and i would have stayed as soon as not  but the federation had to know .         did you tell them anything about your ship .         how could i .  i   m no mechanic .  i don   t know the theory or construction .  but i showed them how to work the controls and let them look at the motors .  that   s all .      brand gorla said  to himself mostly     then they   ll never get it .  that isn   t enough .      the albino   s voice raised itself in sudden shrieking triumph .     oh  yes  they will .  i know them .  they   re machines  you know .  they   ll work on that problem .  and they   ll work .  and they   ll work .  and they   ll never quit .  and they   ll get it .  they got enough out of me .  i   ll bet they got enough .      the board master looked long  and turned away wearily .     why didn   t you tell us .         because you took my world away from me .  i discovered it by myself all by myself .  and after i had done all the real work  and invited you in  you threw me out .  all you had for me was complaints that i had landed on the world and might have ruined everything by interference .  why should i tell you .  find out for yourselves if you   re so wise  that you could afford to kick me around .      the board master thought bitterly     misfit .  inferiority complex .  persecution mania .  nice .  it all fits in  now that we   ve bothered to take our eyes off the horizon and see what was under our nose .  and now it   s all ruined .      he said     all right  realo  we all lose .  go away .      brand gorla said tightly     allover .  really all over .      the board master answered     really all over .  the original experiment  as such  is over .  the distortions created by realo   s visit will easily be large enough to make the plans we are studying here a dead language .  and besides murry is right .  if they have interstellar travel  they   re dangerous .      realo was shouting     but you   re not going to destroy them .  you can   t destroy them .  they haven   t hurt anyone .      there was no answer  and he raved on     i   m going back .  i   ll warn them .  they   ll be prepared .  i   ll warn them .      he was backing toward the door  his thin  white hair bristling  his red rimmed eyes bulging .   the board master did not move to stop him when he dashed out .      let him go .  it was his lifetime .  i don   t care any more .      theor realo smashed toward the robot world at an acceleration that was half choking him .   somewhere ahead was the dustspeck of an isolated world with artificial imitations of humanity struggling along in an experiment that had died .  struggling blindly toward a new goal of interstellar travel that was to be their death sentence .   he was heading toward that world  toward the same city in which he had been    studied    the first time .  he remembered it well .  its name was the first words of their language he had learned .   new york .     the end    on july           which was a monday  i had one of the rare days off i could take during wartime .   it was  after all  my first wedding anniversary .   i was in new york that day  and i visited campbell just as in the good old days .  i discussed with him another story in the    foundation    series  as well as another in the    positronic robot    series .  from then on  i always saw campbell on the rare days when i was in new york on a weekday  and of course we corresponded regularly .     i was definitely back at writing .  output was low  but during the remaining war years i wrote two positronic robot stories     catch that rabbit    and    paradoxical escape     which appeared in the february      and august      issues of astounding  respectively .  both were eventually included in i  robot .   the latter story appears in i  robot under the title of    escape .     the word    paradoxical    had been added by campbell in one of his few title changes  and i didn   t like it .    i also wrote no less than four stories of the    foundation    series during those same years .  these were    the big and the little        the wedge        dead hand     and    the mule .     all appeared in astounding  of course  the first three in the august       october       and april      issues  respectively .      the mule    set several records for me .  it was the longest story i had ever written up to that time fifty thousand words long .  yet even so  and despite the fact that i had to work on it in small scraps of time left over from job and marriage  i managed to complete it in three and a half months .  it was submitted on may           and was accepted on the twenty ninth .   indeed  throughout the war i never got a single rejection  or even a delayed acceptance .  nor did i submit to anyone but campbell .    what   s more  at the beginning of      campbell raised his basic rate to one and a half cents a word and some months later to a cent and three quarters .  for    the mule    i received a check at the higher rate  for      .  it was by far the largest check i ever received for a single story .  by the end of the war  in fact  i was making half as much money writing in my spare time as i was making at my n . a . e . s .  job  even though i had been promoted and was receiving sixty dollars a week by the end of the war .   then  too     the mule    was the first story i ever had published as a serial .  it appeared in two parts in the november and december      issues of astounding .   of the wartime    foundation    stories     the big and the little    and    the wedge    are included in foundation  while    dead hand    and    the mule     together  make up all of foundation and empire .     during the two years between mid      and mid       i wrote only one story that was neither one of the    foundation    series nor one of the    positronic robot    series  and that one was inspired directly by the n . a . e . s .  this story was    blind alley     which was written during september and early october of      .  it was submitted to campbell on october     and accepted on the twentieth .       blind alley     only once in galactic history was an intelligent race of non humans discovered        essays on history .      by ligurn vier  i .     from  bureau for the outer provinces  to  loodun antyok  chief public administrator  a      subject  civilian supervisor of cepheus     administrative position as   references    a  act of council   .      of the year     of the galactic empire  entitled      appointment of officials of the administrative service  methods for  revision of .       b  imperial directive  ja   .      dated   .        g . e .     .  by authorization of reference  a   you are hereby appointed to the subject position .  the authority of said position as civilian supervisor of cepheus    will extend over non human subjects of the emperor living upon the planet under the terms of autonomy set forth in reference  b  .     .  the duties of the subject position shall comprise the general supervision of all non human internal affairs  co ordination of authorized government investigating and reporting committees  and the preparation of semiannual reports on all phases of non human affairs .     c .  morily  chief  buouprov          g . e .     loodun antyok had listened carefully  and now he shook his round head mildly     friend  i   d like to help you  but you   ve grabbed the wrong dog by the ears .  you   d better take this up with the bureau .      tomor zammo flung himself back into his chair  rubbed his beak of a nose fiercely  thought better of whatever he was going to say  and answered quietly     logical  but not practical .  i can   t make a trip to trantor now .  you   re the bureau   s representative on cepheus    .  are you entirely helpless .         well  even as civilian supervisor  i   ve got to work within the limits of bureau policy .         good     zammo cried     then  tell me what bureau policy is .  i head a scientific investigating committee  under direct imperial authorization with  supposedly  the widest powers  yet at every angle in the road i am pulled up short by the civilian authorities with only the parrot shriek of    bureau policy    to justify themselves .  what is bureau policy .  i haven   t received a decent definition yet .      antyok   s gaze was level and unruffled .  he said     as i see it and this is not official  so you can   t hold me to it bureau policy consists in treating the non humans as decently as possible .         then  what authority have they         ssh .  no use raising your voice .  as a matter of fact  his imperial majesty is a humanitarian and a disciple of the philosophy of aurelion .  i can tell you quietly that it is pretty well known that it is the emperor himself who first suggested that this world be established .  you can bet that bureau policy will stick pretty close to imperial notions .  and you can bet that i can   t paddle my way against that sort of current .         well  m   boy     the physiologist   s fleshy eyelids quivered     if you take that sort of attitude  you   re going to lose your job .  no  i won   t have you kicked out .  that   s not what i mean at all .  your job will just fade out from under you  because nothing is going to be accomplished here .         really .  why .     antyok was short  pink  and pudgy  and his plump cheeked face usually found it difficult to put on display any expression other than one of bland and cheerful politeness but it looked grave now .      you haven   t been here long .  i have .     zammo scowled .     mind if i smoke .     the cigar in his hand was gnarled and strong and was puffed to life carelessly .   he continued roughly     there   s no place here for humanitarianism  administrator .  you   re treating non humans as if they were humans  and it won   t work .  in fact  i don   t like the word    non human .     they   re animals .         they   re intelligent      interjected antyok  softly .      well  intelligent animals  then .  i presume the two terms are not mutually exclusive .  alien intelligences mingling in the same space won   t work  anyway .         do you propose killing them off .         galaxy  no .     he gestured with his cigar .     i propose we look upon them as objects for study  and only that .  we could learn a good deal from these animals if we were allowed to .  knowledge  i might point out  that would be used for the immediate benefit of the human race .  there   s humanity for you .  there   s the good of the masses  if its this spineless cult of aurelion that interests you .         what  for instance  do you refer to .         to take the most obvious you have heard of their chemistry  i take it .         yes     antyok admitted .     i have leafed through most of the reports on the non humans published in the last ten years .  i expect to go through more .         hmp .  well then  all i need say is that their chemical therapy is extremely thorough .  for instance  i have witnessed personally the healing of a broken bone what passes for a broken bone with them  i mean by the use of a pill .  the bone was whole in fifteen minutes .  naturally  none of their drugs are any earthly use on humans .  most would kill quickly .  but if we found out how they worked on the non humans on the animals         yes  yes .  i see the significance .         oh  you do .  come  that   s gratifying .  a second point is that these animals communicate in an unknown manner .         telepathy .        the scientist   s mouth twisted  as he ground out     telepathy .  telepathy .  telepathy .  might as well say by witch brew .  nobody knows anything about telepathy except its name .  what is the mechanism of telepathy .  what is the physiology and the physics of it .  i would like to find out  but i can   t .  bureau policy  if i listen to you  forbids .      antyok   s little mouth pursed itself .     but pardon me  doctor  but i don   t follow you .  how are you prevented .  surely the civil administration has made no attempt to hamper scientific investigation of these non humans .  i cannot speak for my predecessor entirely  of course  but i myself         no direct interference has occurred .  i don   t speak of that .  but by the galaxy  administrator  we   re hampered by the spirit of the entire set up .  you   re making us deal with humans .  you allow them their own leader and internal autonomy .  you pamper them and give them what aurelion   s philosophy would call    rights  i can   t deal with their leader .         why not .         because he refuses to allow me a free hand .  he refuses to allow experiments on any subject without the subject   s own consent .  the two or three volunteers we get are not too bright .  it   s an impossible arrangement .      antyok shrugged helplessly .   zammo continued     in addition  it is obviously impossible to learn anything of value concerning the brains  physiology  and chemistry of these animals without dissection  dietary experiments  and drugs .  you know  administrator  scientific investigation is a hard game .  humanity hasn   t much place in it .       loodun antyok tapped his chin with a doubtful finger     must it be quite so hard .  these are harmless creatures  these non humans .  surely  dissection perhaps  if you were to approach them a bit differently i have the idea that you antagonize them .  your attitude might be somewhat overbearing .         overbearing .  i am not one of these whining social psychologists who are all the fad these days .  i don   t believe you can solve a problem that requires dissection by approaching it with what is called the    correct personal attitude    in the cant of the times .         i   m sorry you think so .  sociopsychological training is required of all administrators above the grade of a   .      zammo withdrew his cud of a cigar from his mouth and replaced it after a suitably contemptuous interval     then you   d better use a bit of your technique on the bureau .  you know  i do have friends at the imperial court .         well  now  i can   t take the matter up with them  not baldly .  basic policy does not fall within my cognizance  and such things can only be initiated by the bureau .  but  you know  we might try an indirect approach on this .     he smiled faintly     strategy .         what sort .      antyok pointed a sudden finger  while his other hand fell lightly on the rows of gray bound reports upon the floor just next his chair     now  look  i   ve gone through most of these .  they   re dull  but contain some facts .  for instance  when was the last non human infant born on cepheus    .   zammo spent little time in consideration .     don   t know .  don   t care either .         but the bureau would .  there   s never been a non human infant born on cepheus    not in the two years the world has been established .  do you know the reason .      the physiologist shrugged     too many possible factors .  it would take study .         all right  then .  suppose you write a report         reports .  i   ve written twenty .         write another .  stress the unsolved problems .  tell them you must change your methods .  harp on the birth rate problem .  the bureau doesn   t dare ignore that .  if the non humans die out  someone will have to answer to the emperor .  you see      zammo stared  his eyes dark     that will swing it .         i   ve been working for the bureau for twenty seven years .  i know its ways .         i   ll think about it .     zammo rose and stalked out of the office .  the door slammed behind him .   it was later that zammo said to a co worker     he   s a bureaucrat  in the first place .  he won   t abandon the orthodoxies of paper work and he won   t risk sticking his neck out .  he   ll accomplish little by himself  yet maybe more than a little if we work through him .         from  administrative headquarters  cepheus     to  buouprov

it is brought to the attention of the buouprov that reference  b  has already discussed possible changes in investigating methods and that it remains the opinion of adhq ceph   that such changes are as yet premature .  it is nevertheless suggested that the question of non human birth rate be made the subject of a buouprov project assigned to adhq ceph   in view of the importance attached by scigroup    to the problem  as evidenced in section v of enclosure   .     l .  antyok  supery  adhq ceph                from  buouprov  to  adhq ceph    subject  outer province project      scientific investigations of non humans of cepheus     co ordination of   reference    a  adhq ceph   letr .  aa la mn  dated         g . e .     .  in response to the suggestion contained in paragraph   of reference  a   it is considered that the question of the non human birth rate does not fall within the cognizance of adhq ceph   .  in view of the fact that scigroup    has reported said sterility to be probably due to a chemical deficiency in the food supply  all investigations in the field are relegated to scigroup    as the proper authority .     .  investigating procedures by the various scigroups shall continue according to current directives on the subject .  no changes in policy are envisaged .     c .  morily  chief  buouprov           g . e .     ii .     there was a loose jointed gauntness about the news reporter which made him appear somberly tall .  he was gustiv bannerd  with whose reputation was combined ability two things which do not invariably go together despite the maxims of elementary morality .   loodum antyok took his measure doubtfully and said     there   s no use denying that you   re right .  but the scigroup report was confidential .  i don   t understand how         it leaked     said bannerd  callously .     everything leaks      antyok was obviously baffled  and his pink face furrowed slightly     then i   ll just have to plug the leak here .  i can   t pass your story .  all references to scigroup complaints have to come out .  you see that  don   t your     no .     bannerd was calm enough .     it   s important  and i have my rights under the imperial directive .  i think the empire should know what   s going on .  .  .      but it isn   t going on     said antyok  despairingly .     your claims are all wrong .  the bureau isn   t going to change its policy .  i showed you the letters .  .  .      you think you can stand up against zammo when he puts the pressure on .     the newsman asked derisively .      i will if i think he   s wrong .         if .     stated bannerd flatly .  then  in a sudden fervor     antyok  the empire has something great here  something greater by a good deal than the government apparently realizes .  they   re destroying it .  they   re treating these creatures like animals .         really     began antyok  weakly .      don   t talk about cepheus    .  it   s a zoo .  it   s a high class zoo  with your petrified scientists teasing those poor creatures with their sticks poking through the bars .  you throw them chunks of meat  but you cage them up .  i know .  i   ve been writing about them for two years now .  i   ve almost been living with them .         zammo says         zammo .     this with hard contempt .      zammo says     insisted antyok with worried firmness     that we treat them too like humans as it is .      the newsman   s straight  long cheeks were rigid     zammo is rather animallike in his own right .  he is a science worshiper .  we can do with less of them .  have you read aurelion   s worksr the last was suddenly posed .      umm .  yes .  i understand the emperor         the emperor tends towards us .  that is good better than the hounding of the last reign .         i don   t see where you   re heading .         these aliens have much to teach us .  you understand .  it is nothing that zammo and his scigroup can use  no chemistry  no telepathy .  it   s a way of life  a way of thinking .  the aliens have no crime  no misfits .  what effort is being made to study their philosophy .  or to set them up as a problem in social engineering .      antyok grew thoughtful  and his plump face smoothed out     it is an interesting consideration .  it would be a matter for psychologists         no good .  most of them are quacks .  psychologists point out problems  but their solutions are fallacious .  we need men of aurelion .  men of the philosophy         but look here  we can   t turn cepheus    into .  .  . into a metaphysical study .         why not .  it can be done easily .         how .         forget your puny test tube peerings .  allow the aliens to set up a society free of humans .  give them an untrammeled independence and allow an intermingling of philosophies      antyok   s nervous response came     that can   t be done in a day .         we can start in a day .      the administrator said slowly     well  i can   t prevent you from trying to start     he grew confidential  his mild eyes thoughtful     you   ll ruin your own game  though  if you publish scigroup      s report and denounce it on humanitarian grounds .  the scientists are powerful .         and we of the philosophy as well .         yes  but there   s an easy way .  you needn   t rave .  simply point out that the scigroup is not solving its problems .  do so unemotionally and let the readers think out your point of view for themselves .  take the birth rate problem  for instance .  there   s something for you .  in a generation  the non humans might die out  for all science can do .  point out that a more philosophical approach is required .  or pick some other obvious point .  use your judgment  eh .      antyok smiled ingratiatingly as he arose     but  for the galaxy   s sake  don   t stir up a bad smell      bannerd was stiff and unresponsive     you may be right      it was later that bannerd wrote in a capsule message to a friend     he is not clever  by any means .  he is confused and has no guiding line through life .  certainly utterly incompetent in his job .  but he   s a cutter and a trimmer  compromises his way around difficulties  and will yield concessions rather than risk a hard stand .  he may prove valuable in that .  yours in aurelion .        from  adhq ceph    to

 reported to the buouprov in reference  a   has become the subject of news reports to the galactic press .  the news reports in question are submitted herewith for the information of the buouprov as enclosures   and   .  although said reports are based on material considered confidential and closed to the public  the news reporter in question maintained his rights to free expression under the terms of reference  b  .     .  in view of the unavoidable publicity and misunderstanding on the part of the general public now inevitable  it is requested that the buouprov direct future policy on the problem of non human sterility .     l .  antyok  superv .  adhq ceph      o      g . e .     from  buouprov  to  adhq ceph    subject  birth rate of non humans on cepheus     investigation of .

precluding the unfavorable birth rate phenomena mentioned in references  a  and  b  . a project is therefore set up  entitled     birth rate of non humans on cepheus     investigation of    to which  in view of the crucial importance of the subject  a priority of aa is given .     .  the number assigned to the subject project is       and all expenses incidental to it shall be assigned to

friendliness had not thereby increased .  antyok found himself standing alone at the viewing window into the main field laboratory .   the main field laboratory was a broad court set at the environmental conditions of cepheus    itself for the discomfort of the experimenters and the convenience of the experimentees .  through the burning sand  and the dry  oxygen rich air  there sparkled the hard brilliance of hot  white sunlight .  and under the blaze  the brick red non humans  wrinkled of skin and wiry of build  huddled in their squatting positions of ease  by ones and twos .   zammo emerged from the laboratory .  he paused to drink water thirstily .  he looked up  moisture gleaming on his upper lip     like to step in there .      antyok shook his head definitely     no  thank you .  what   s the temperature right now .         a hundred twenty  if there were shade .  and they complain of the cold .  it   s drinking time now .  want to watch them drink .      a spray of water shot upward from the fountain in the center of the court  and the little alien figures swayed to their feet and hopped eagerly forward in a queer  springy half run .  they milled about the water  jostling one another .  the centers of their faces were suddenly disfigured by the projection of a long and flexible fleshy tube  which thrust forward into the spray and was withdrawn dripping .   it continued for long minutes .  the bodies swelled and the wrinkles disappeared .  they retreated slowly  backing away  with the drinking tube flicking in and out  before receding finally into a pink  wrinkled mass above a wide  lipless mouth .  they went to sleep in groups in the shaded angles  plump and sated .      animals .     said zammo  with contempt .      how often do they drink .     asked antyok .      as often as they want .  they can go a week if they have to .  we water them every day .  they store it under their skin .  they eat in the evenings .  vegetarians  you know .      antyok smiled chubbily     it   s nice to get a bit of firsthand information occasionally .  can   t read reports all the time .         yes .     noncommittally .  then     what   s new .  what about the lacy pants boys on trantor .      antyok shrugged dubiously     you can   t get the bureau to commit itself  unfortunately .  with the emperor sympathetic to the aurelionists  humanitarianism is the order of the day .  you know that .      there was a pause in which the administrator chewed his lip uncertainly .     but there   s this birth rate problem now .  it   s finally been assigned to adhq  you know and double a priority  too .      zammo muttered wordlessly .   antyok said     you may not realize it  but that project will now take precedence over all other work proceeding on cepheus    .  it   s important .      he turned back to the viewing window and said thoughtfully with a bald lack of preamble .     do you think those creatures might be unhappy .         unhappy .     the word was an explosion .      well  then     antyok corrected hastily     maladjusted .  you understand .  it   s difficult to adjust an environment to a race we know so little of .         say did you ever see the world we took them from .         i   ve read the reports         reports .     infinite contempt .     i   ve seen it .  this may look like desert out there to you  but it   s a watery paradise to those devils .  they have all the food and water they can get .  they have a world to themselves with vegetation and natural water flow  instead of a lump of silica and granite where fungi were force grown in caves and water had to be steamed out of gypsum rock .  in ten years  they would have been dead to the last beast  and we saved them .  unhappy .  ga a ah  if they are  they haven   t the decency of most animals .         well  perhaps .  yet i have a notion .         a notion .  what is your notion .     zammo reached for one of his cigars .      it   s something that might help you .  why not study the creatures in a more integrated fashion .  let them use their initiative .  after all  they did have a highly developed science .  your reports speak of it continually .  give them problems to solve .         such as .         oh .  .  . oh     antyok waved his hands helplessly .     whatever you think might help most .  for instance  spaceships .  get them into the control room and study their reactions .         why .     asked zammo with dry bluntness .      because the reaction of their minds to tools and controls adjusted to the human temperament can teach you a lot .  in addition  it will make a more effective bribe  it seems to me  than anything you   ve yet tried .  you   ll get more volunteers if they think they   ll be doing something interesting .         that   s your psychology coming out .  hm m m .  sounds better than it probably is .  i   ll sleep on it .  and where would i get permission  in any case  to let them handle spaceships .  i   ve none at my disposal  and it would take a good deal longer than it was worth to follow down the line of red tape to get one assigned to us .      antyok pondered  and his forehead creased lightly     it doesn   t have to be spaceships .  but even so lf you would write up another report and make the suggestion yourself strongly  you understand i might figure out some way of tying it up with my birth rate project .  a double a priority can get practically anything  you know  without questions .      zammo   s interest lacked a bit even of mildness     well  maybe .  meanwhile  i   ve some basal metabolism tests in progress  and it   s getting late .  i   ll think about it .  it   s got its points .        from  adhq ceph    to  buouprov  subject  outer

upon the subject project  that immediate consideration be given the scigroup   s request .     l .  antyok  superv .  adhq ceph             g . e .     from  buouprov  to  adhq ceph    subject  outer

have been more uncomfortable than his bearing would admit to .  he was carefully wrapped in a temperature already adjusted to the point where his human companions steamed in their open shirts .   his speech was high pitched and careful     i find it damp  but not unbearably so at this low temperature .      antyok smiled     it was nice of you to come .  i had planned to visit you  but a trial run in your atmosphere out there     the smile had become rueful .      it doesn   t matter .  you other worldlings have done more for us than ever we were able to do for ourselves .  it is an obligation that is but imperfectly returned by the endurance on my part of a trilling discomfort .     his speech seemed always indirect  as if he approached his thoughts sidelong  or as if it were against all etiquette to be blunt .   gustiv bannerd  seated in an angle of the room  with one long leg crossing the other  scrawled nimbly and said     you don   t mind if i record all this .      the cepheid non human glanced briefly at the journalist     i have no objection .      antyok   s apologetics persisted     this is not a purely social affair  sir .  i would not have forced discomfort on you for that .  there are important questions to be considered  and you are the leader of your people .      the cepheid nodded     i am satisfied your purposes are kindly .  please proceed .      the administrator almost wriggled in his difficulty in putting thoughts into words .     it is a subject     he said     of delicacy  and one i would never bring up if it weren   t for the overwhelming importance of the .  .  . uh .  .  . question .  i am only the spokesman of my government         my people consider the otherworld government a kindly one .         well  yes  they are kindly .  for that reason  they are disturbed over the fact that your people no longer breed .      antyok paused  and waited with worry for a reaction that did not come .  the cepheid   s face was motionless except for the soft  trembling motion of the wrinkled area that was his deflated drinking tube .   antyok continued     it is a question we have hesitated to bring up because of its extremely personal angles .  noninterference is my government   s prime aim  and we have done our best to investigate the problem quietly and without disturbing your people .  but  frankly  we         have failed .     finished the cepheid  at the other   s pause .      yes .  or at least  we have not discovered a concrete failure to reproduce the exact environment of your original world  with  of course  the necessary modification to make it more livable .  naturally  it is thought there is some chemical shortcoming .  and so i ask your voluntary help in the matter .  your people are advanced in the study of your own biochemistry .  if you do not choose  or would rather not         no  no  i can help     the cepheid seemed cheerful about it .  the smooth hat planes of his loose skinned  hairless skull wrinkled in an alien response to an uncertain emotion .     it is not a matter that any of us would have thought would have disturbed you other worldlings .  that it does is but another indication of your well meaning kindness .  this world we find congenial  a paradise in comparison to our old .  it lacks in nothing .  conditions such as now prevail belong in our legends of the golden age .         well         but there is a something  a something you may not understand .  we cannot expect different intelligences to think alike .         i shall try to understand .     the cepheid   s voice had grown soft  its liquid undertones more pronounced     we were dying on our native world  but we were fighting .  our science  developed through a history older than yours  was losing  but it had not yet lost .  perhaps it was because our science was fundamentally biological  rather than physical as yours is .  your people discovered new forms of energy and reached the stars .  our people discovered new truths of psychology and psychiatry and built up a working society free of disease and crime .      there is no need to question which of the two angles of approach was the more laudable  but there is no uncertainty as to which proved more successful in the end .  in our dying world  without the means of life or sources of power  our biological science could but make the dying easier     and yet we fought .  for centuries past  we had been groping toward the elements of atomic power  and slowly the spark of hope had glimmered that we might break through the two dimensional limits of our planetary surface and reach the stars .  there were no other planets in our system to serve as stepping stones .  nothing but some twenty light years to the nearest star  without the knowledge of the possibility of the existence of other planetary systems  but rather of the contrary .      but there is something in all life that insists on striving  even on useless striving .  there were only five thousand of us left in the last days .  only five thousand .  and our first ship was ready .  it was experimental .  it would probably have been a failure .  but already we had all the principles of propulsion and navigation correctly worked out .   .   there was a long pause  and the cepheid   s small black eyes seemed glazed in retrospect .   the newspaperman put in suddenly  from his comer     and then we came .         and then you came     the cepheid agreed simply .     it changed everything .  energy was ours for the asking .  a new world  congenial and  indeed  ideal  was ours even without asking .  if our problems of society had long been solved by ourselves  our more difficult problems of environment were suddenly solved for us  no less completely .         well .     urged antyok .      well it was somehow not well .  for centuries  our ancestors had fought towards the stars  and now the stars suddenly proved to be the property of others .  we had fought for life  and it had become a present handed to us by others .  there is no longer any reason to fight .  there is no longer anything to attain .  all the universe is the property of your race .         this world is yours     said antyok  gently .      by sufferance .  it is a gift .  it is not ours by right .         you have earned it  in my opinion .      and now the cepheid   s eyes were sharply fixed on the other   s countenance     you mean well  but i doubt that you understand .  we have nowhere to go  save this gift of a world .  we are in a blind alley .  the function of life is striving  and that is taken from us .  life can no longer interest us .  we have no offspring voluntarily .  it is our way of removing ourselves from your way .        absent mindedly  antyok had removed the fluoro globe from the window seat  and spun it on its base .  its gaudy surface reflected light as it spun  and its three foot high bulk floated with incongruous grace and lightness in the air .   antyok said     is that your only solution .  sterility .         we might escape still     whispered the cepheid     but where in the galaxy is there place for us .  it is all yours .         yes  there is no place for you nearer than the magellanic clouds if you wished independence .  the magellanic clouds         and you would not let us go of yourselves .  you mean kindly  i know .         yes  we mean kindly but we could not let you go .         it is a mistaken kindness .         perhaps  but could you not reconcile yourselves .  you have a world .         it is something past complete explanations .  your mind is different .  we could not reconcile ourselves .  i believe  administrator  that you have thought of all this before .  the concept of the blind alley we find ourselves trapped in is not new to you .      antyok looked up  startled  and one hand steadied the fluoro globe     can you read my mind .         it is just a guess .  a good one  i think .         yes but can you read my mind .  the minds of humans in general  i mean .  it is an interesting point .  the scientists say you cannot  but sometimes i wonder if it is that you simply will not .  could you answer that .  i am detaining you  unduly  perhaps .         no .  .  . no     but the little cepheid drew his enveloping robe closer  and buried his face in the electrically heated pad at the collar for a moment .     you other worldlings speak of reading minds .  it is not so at all  but it is assuredly hopeless to explain .      antyok mumbled the old proverb     one cannot explain sight to a man blind from birth .         yes  just so .  this sense which you call    mind reading   quite erroneously  cannot be applied to us .  it is not that we cannot receive the proper sensations  it is that your people do not transmit them  and we have no way of explaining to you how to go about it .         hm m m .         there are times  of course  of great concentration or emotional tension on the part of an other worldling when some of us who are more expert in this sense  more sharp eyed  so to speak  detect vaguely something .  it is uncertain  yet i myself have at times wondered      carefully  antyok began spinning the fluoro globe once more .  his pink face was set in thought  and his eyes were fixed upon the cepheid .  gustiv bannerd stretched his fingers and reread his notes  his lips moving silently .   the fluoro globe spun  and slowly the cepheid seemed to grow tense as well  as his eyes shifted to the colorful sheen of the globe   s fragile surface .   the cepheid said     what is that .      antyok started  and his face smoothed into an almost chuckling placidity     this .  a galactic fad of three years ago  which means that it is a hopelessly old fashioned relic this year .  it is a useless device but it looks pretty .  bannerd  could you adjust the windows to non transmission .        there was the soft click of a contact  and the windows became curved regions of darkness  while in the center of the room  the fluoro globe was suddenly the focus of a rosy effulgence that seemed to leap outward in streamers .  antyok  a scarlet figure in a scarlet room  placed it upon the table and spun it with a hand that dripped red .  as it spun  the colors changed with a slowly increasing rapidity  blended and fell apart into more extreme contrasts .   antyok was speaking in an eerie atmosphere of molten  shifting rainbow     the surface is of a material that exhibits variable fluorescence .  it is almost weightless  extremely fragile  but gyroscopically balanced so that it rarely falls  with ordinary care .  it is rather pretty  don   t you think .      from somewhere the cepheid   s voice came     extremely pretty .         but it has outworn its welcome  outlived its fashionable existence .      the cepheid   s voice was abstracted     it is very pretty .      bannerd restored the light at a gesture  and the colors faded .  the cepheid said     that is something my people would enjoy .     he stared at the globe with fascination .   and now antyok rose .     you had better go .  if you stay longer  the atmosphere may have bad effects .  i thank you humbly for your kindness .         i thank you humbly for yours .     the cepheid had also risen .   antyok said     most of your people  by the way  have accepted our offers to them to study the make up of our modem spaceships .  you understand  i suppose  that the purpose was to study the reactions of your people to our technology .  i trust that conforms with your sense of propriety .         you need not apologize .  i  myself  have now the makings of a human pilot .  it was most interesting .  it recalls our own efforts and reminds us of how nearly on the right track we were .      the cepheid left  and antyok sat  frowning .      well     he said to bannerd  a little sharply .     you remember our agreement  i hope .  this interview can   t be published .      bannerd shrugged     very well .      antyok was at his seat  and his fingers fumbled with the small metal figurine upon his desk     what do you think of all this  bannerd .         i am sorry for them .  i think i understand how they feel .  we must educate them out of it .  the philosophy can do it .         you think so .         yes .         we can   t let them go  of course .         oh  no .  out of the question .  we have too much to learn from them .  this feeling of theirs is only a passing stage .  they   ll think differently  especially when we allow them the completest independence .         maybe .  what do you think of the fluoro globes  bannerd .  he liked them .  it might be a gesture of the right sort to order several thousand of them .  the galaxy knows  they   re a drug on the market right now  and cheap enough .         sounds like a good idea     said bannerd .      the bureau would never agree  though .  i know them .      the newsman   s eyes narrowed     but it might be just the thing .  they need new interests .         yes .  well  we could do something .  i could include your transcript of the interview as part of a report and just emphasize the matter of the globes a bit .  after all  you   re a member of the philosophy and might have influence with important people  whose word with the bureau might carry much more weight than mine .  you understand  .         yes     mused bannerd .     yes .        from  adhq ceph    to  buouprov  subject  ouprov project       part ii  birth rate

brought in  and the cigars were out .  the groups of talkers had formed  and the captain of the merchant fleet was the center of the largest .  his brilliant white uniform quite outsparkled his listeners .   he was almost complacent in his speech     the trip was nothing .  i   ve had more than three hundred ships under me before this .  still  i   ve never had a cargo quite like this .  what do you want with five thousand fluoro globes on this desert  by the galaxy .      loodun antyok laughed gently .  he shrugged     for the non humans .  it wasn   t a difficult cargo  i hope .         no  not difficult .  but bulky .  they   re fragile  and i couldn   t carry more than twenty to a ship  with all the government regulations concerning packing and precautions against breakage .  but it   s the government   s money  i suppose .      zammo smiled grimly .     is this your first experience with government methods  captain .         galaxy  no     exploded the spaceman .     i try to avoid it  of course  but you can   t help getting entangled on occasion .  and it   s an abhorrent thing when you are  and that   s the truth .  the red tape .  the paper work .  it   s enough to stunt your growth and curdle your circulation .  it   s a tumor  a cancerous growth on the galaxy .  i   d wipe out the whole mess .      antyok said     you   re unfair  captain .  you don   t understand .         yes .  well  now  as one of these bureaucrats     and he smiled amiably at the word     suppose you explain your side of the situation  administrator .         well  now     antyok seemed confused     government is a serious and complicated business .  we   ve got thousands of planets to worry about in this empire of ours and billions of people .  it   s almost past human ability to supervise the business of governing without the tightest sort of organization .  i think there are something like four hundred million men today in the imperial administrative service alone  and in order to co ordinate their efforts and to pool their knowledge  you must have what you call red tape and paper work .  every bit of it  senseless though it may seem  annoying though it may be  has its uses .  every piece of paper is a thread binding the labors of four hundred million humans .  abolish the administrative service and you abolish the empire  and with it  interstellar peace  order  and civilization .         come     said the captain .      no .  i mean it .     antyok was earnestly breathless .     the rules and system of the administrative set up must be sufficiently all embracing and rigid so that in case of incompetent officials  and sometimes one is appointed you may laugh  but there are incompetent scientists  and newsmen  and captains  too in case of incompetent officials  i say  little harm will be done .  for  at the worst  the system can move by itself .         yes     grunted the captain  sourly     and if a capable administrator should be appointed .  he is then caught by the same rigid web and is forced into mediocrity .         not at all      replied antyok  warmly .      a capable man can work within the limits of the rules and accomplish what he wishes .         how .     asked bannerd .      well .  .  . well     antyok was suddenly ill at ease .     one method is to get yourself an a priority project  or double a  if possible .      the captain leaned his head back for laughter  but never quite made it  for the door was flung open and frightened men were pouring in .  the shouts made no sense at first .  then      sir  the ships are gone .  these non humans have taken them by force .         what .  all .         every one .  ships and creatures        it was two hours later that the four were together again  alone in antyok   s office now .   antyik said coldly     they   ve made no mistakes .  there   s not a ship left behind  not even your training ship  zammo .  and there isn   t a government ship available in this entire half of the sector .  by the time we organize a pursuit they   ll be out of the galaxy and halfway to the magellanic clouds .  captain  it was your responsibility to maintain an adequate guard .      the captain cried     it was our first day out of space .  who could have known      zammo interrupted fiercely     wait a while  captain .  i   m beginning to understand .  antyok      his voice was hard     you engineered this .         i .     antyok   s expression was strangely cool  almost indifferent .      you told us this evening that a clever administrator got an a priority project assigned to accomplish what he wished .  you got such a project in order to help the non humans escape .         i did .  i beg your pardon  but how could that be .  it was you yourself in one of your reports that brought up the problem of the failing birth rate .  it was bannerd  here  whose sensational articles frightened the bureau into making a double a priority project out of it .  i had nothing to do with it .         you suggested that i mention the birth rate     said zammo  violently .      did i .     said antyok  composedly .      and for that matter     roared bannerd  suddenly     you suggested that i mention the birth rate in my articles .      the three ringed him now and hemmed him in .  antyok leaned back in his chair and said easily     i don   t know what you mean by suggestions .  if you are accusing me  please stick to evidence legal evidence .  the laws of the empire go by written  filmed  or transcribed material  or by witnessed statements .  all my letters as administrator are on me here  at the bureau  and at other places .  i never asked for an a priority project .  the bureau assigned it to me  and zammo and bannerd are responsible for that .  in print  at any rate .      zammo   s voice was an almost inarticulate growl     you hoodwinked me into teaching the creatures how to handle a spaceship .         it was your suggestion .  i have your report proposing they be studied in their reaction to human tools on file .  so has the bureau .  the evidence the legal evidence  is plain .  i had nothing to do with it .         nor with the globes .     demanded bannerd .   the captain howled suddenly     you had my ships brought here purposely .  five thousand globes .  you knew it would require hundreds of craft .          i never asked for globes     said antyok  coldly .     that was the bureau   s idea  although i think bannerd   s friends of the philosophy helped that along .      bannerd fairly choked .  he spat out     you were asking that cepheid leader if he could read minds .  you were telling him to express interest in the globes .         come  now .  you prepared the transcript of the conversation yourself  and that  too  is on file .  you can   t prove it .     he stood up     you   ll have to excuse me .  i must prepare a report for the bureau .      at the door  antyok turned .     in a way  the problem of the non humans is solved  even if only to their own satisfaction .  they   ll breed now  and have a world they   ve earned themselves .  it   s what they wanted .      another thing .  don   t accuse me of silly things .  i   ve been in the service for twenty seven years  and i assure you that my paper work is proof enough that i have been thoroughly correct in everything i have done .  and captain  i   ll be glad to continue our discussion of earlier this evening at your convenience and explain how a capable administrator can work through red tape and still get what he wants .      it was remarkable that such a round .  smooth baby face could wear a smile quite so sardonic .     from  buouprov  to  loodun antyok  chief public administrator  a    subject  administrative service  standing in .   reference    a  adserv court decision       q  dated       g . e .     .  in view of the favorable opinion handed down in reference   a  you are hereby absolved of all responsibility for the flight of non humans on cepheus    .  it is requested that you hold yourself in readiness for your next appointment .     r .  horpritt  chief  adserv          g . e .     the end    the letters that form a major part of this story  which contains one of my rare examples of extraterrestrial intelligences  are  you will be glad to know  based on the kind of material that routinely passed in and out of the n . a . e . s .   and  for all i know  still does  . the turgid style is not my invention .  i couldn   t invent it if i tried .     when the story appeared  l .  sprague de camp happily pointed out one haw in the letter style  i had carelessly made someone in lower position  who was addressing someone in higher position  say     it is requested    instead of    it is suggested .     the underling can humbly suggest  but only an overling can harshly request .      blind alley    has one distinction i would like to mention .   after the war  there began that hood of science fiction anthologies that has been growing in width and depth ever since .  few  if any  science fiction writers have been anthologized as often as i have and the first one of my stories to be anthologized was not    nightfall    or a    positronic robot    story or a    foundation    story .  it was    blind alley .      in early      groff conklin was putting out the first of his many science fiction anthologies one called    the best of science fiction    and there you will find    blind alley .     that story  for which campbell had paid      .             a word  then earned another     .          a word  .  this meant that    blind alley    had earned me        a word  which was a record high at the time .   strictly speaking  the money for the anthologization was paid to street   smith  but street   smith had the enlightened habit of turning such money over to the author voluntarily and without legal compulsion .  and this was the first indication i ever received  by the way  that a story could earn more money than that which it earned at the time of its original sale .     on may          one week before    the mule    was completed  the war ended in europe .  naturally  there was at once a move to demobilize as many of the men who had been fighting in europe as possible  and to draft replacements from among those who had luxuriated at home .   all through the war  till then  i had been receiving regular draft deferments as a research chemist working in a position important to the war effort .  periodically  there were revisions of the draft rules  and it was a rare month in which it did not look at one time or another as though i might be drafted .   it kept me on my toes  i can tell you  but i did not feel particularly ill used .  my predominant feeling was that of a sneaking guilt at not being drafted and some shame that i was relieved at my deferment .    during       the uncertainty went so far that i was called in for a physical examination  and it at once turned out that my nearsightedness was so bad as to render me ineligible for the draft anyway .   after v e day  the navy yard was ordered to retain only some percentage of those of its deferred employees  allowing the remainder to be drafted .  presumably  the navy yard would select its most important employees to keep  but they knew a better trick  according to the tale we employees heard .  they retained all draftable employees who met the physical requirements  and removed protection from those who did not meet them either because of age or physical defect .  in this way  they hoped to keep them all those who were fit  because they were declared necessary  and those who were overage or unfit  because they were overage or unfit .   i  as an unfit employee  was one of those declared non essential .   and then  you guessed it  the army lowered its physical requirements .  the result was that those navy yard employees with bad eyes or other mild deficiencies were put in imminent peril of the draft  while others  who were in every way equivalent except that they were in good shape  were not .   you may well laugh .    for four months after v e day  it was up and down with me and the draft and i never knew  on one day  whether i might not receive my induction notice on the next .  while i waited  the atom bombs were dropping on hiroshima and nagasaki and the japanese formally surrendered on september   .   on september          i received my notice of induction .  i didn   t enjoy it  of course  but i tried to be philosophical .  the war was over  and  whatever difficulties i might have during the two years i expected to be in  at least no one would be shooting at me .  i entered the army on november          as a buck private .   naturally  during all the fuss over the draft  culminating in my induction  i did no writing .  there was an eight month hiatus  in fact  the longest in three years .   on january          however  while i was still working my way through basic training in camp lee  virginia  i began another    positronic robot    story  called    evidence .     i made use of a typewriter in one of the administrative buildings .   naturally  it was slow work .  i didn   t finish first draft till february     and then everything came to a halt when  the very next day  i discovered that i would be among those sent out to the south pacific to participate in    operation crossroads .     this was the first postwar atom bomb test  on the island of bikini  which later gave its name to a bathing suit so skimpy as to react on the male constitution in theory like an atom bomb  . the fact that a week later i received my check for the anthologization of    blind alley    did little to raise my spirits .   we left on march          traveling by train and ship  and arrived in honolulu on march    .  there then began a long wait before we could go on to bikini  the atom bomb test was postponed  of course  . when time began to hang heavy enough  i returned to    evidence .     i persuaded a sympathetic librarian to lock me up in the building when it closed for lunch so that i had an hour each day absolutely alone at the typewriter .  i finished the story on april     and mailed it off to campbell the next day .   on april     i received word of its acceptance .  by that time  the word rate had reached two cents .   i never did go to bikini  by the way .  some administrative error back home ended the allotment being sent to my wife .  i was sent back to the united states on may    to inquire into the matter  it was all straightened out by the time i was back at camp lee .  as long as i was there  however  i applied for a    research discharge    on the ground that i was going back to my ph . d .  work .  i was out of the army  as a corporal  on july    .      evidence    was the only story i wrote while in uniform .     as soon as i got out of the army i made arrangements to return to columbia  after an absence of a little over four years  and to resume my work toward my ph . d .  under professor dawson .   there was still no question in my mind that chemistry was my career  and my only career .  in the four years of my marriage i had written nine science fiction stories and one fantasy and had sold them all but all the sales had been to campbell .   since unknown had died  i was terribly conscious that astounding might die as well .  if that happened  or if campbell retired  i was not at all sure that i could continue selling .   the situation looked better postwar than prewar  to be sure .  during the first four years of my marriage  i had earned       as a writer  or an average of under     per week .  this was about half again as well as i had been doing in my bachelor days  even though i was writing fewer stories .   the word rate had doubled  you see  and there was even the hope of subsidiary rights extra money for already sold stories .     blind alley    had already placed in an anthology  and on august           only a month after i got out of the army  i discovered that i had made a second such sale .  a new science fiction anthology     adventures in time and space     edited by raymond j .  healey and j .  francis mccomas  was to include    nightfall    and i was to receive     .    for that .   there was even more than anthologization sales .  in that same month of august  the september      issue of astounding hit the stands with    evidence     had i but known when writing it that by the time it was published i would be safely out of the army .   almost at once i received a telegram asking for the movie rights .  the gentleman interested turned out to be none other than orson welles .  in great excitement  i sold him the radio  television  and movie rights to the story on september     and waited to become famous .   i couldn   t become wealthy  because the entire payment in full was only      .    unfortunately  nothing happened .  to this day  mr .  welles has never used the story .  but the check was certainly useful toward paying my tuition .   despite everything  though  it still seemed quite out of the question that i could ever possibly depend on writing for a year in  year out living  especially now that i was married and hoped  eventually  to have children .   so back to school it was  with a small savings account to serve as a cushion  with some veterans    benefits supplied by the government  and  of course  with the hope that i would make a little extra cash writing .   in september i wrote still another    positronic robot    story     little lost robot     racing to complete it before the fall semester started and i grew immersed in my work .  campbell took it promptly and it appeared in the march      issue of astounding .  eventually  it and    evidence    were included in i  robot .   once the semester started  it became difficult to find time to write .  toward the end of       i managed to begin another    foundation    story     now you see it  .     i finished it on february         and submitted it to campbell on the fourth .  by that time i was rather sick of the    foundation    series and i tried to write    now you see it     in such a way as to make it the last of the series .   campbell would have none of that .  i had to revise the ending to permit a sequel  and on the fourteenth he took it .  it appeared in the january      astounding and eventually made up the first third of my book second foundation .   in may      i wrote a story that  for the first time in over two years  was neither a    foundation    story nor a    positronic robot    story .  it was    no connection .     i submitted it to campbell on may     and it was accepted on the thirty first .       no connection     raph was a typical american of his times .  remarkably ugly  too  by american standards of our times .  the bony structure of his jaws was tremendous and the musculature suited it .  his nose was arched and wide and his black eyes were small and forced wide apart by the span of said nose .  his neck was thick  his body broad  his fingers spatulate  with strongly curved nails .   if he had stood erect  on thick legs with large  well padded feet  he would have topped two and a half yards .  standing or sitting  his mass neared a quarter of a ton .   yet his forehead rose in an unrestricted arc and his cranial capacity did not stint .  his enormous hand dealt delicately with a pen  and his mind droned comfortably on as he bent over his desk .   in fact  his wife and most of his fellow americans found him a fine looking fellow .   which shows the alchemy of a long displacement along the time axis .     raph  junior  was a smaller edition of our typical american .  he was adolescent and had not yet lost the hairy covering of childhood .  it spread in a dark  close curled mat across his chest and back  but it was already thinning and perhaps within the year he would first don the adult shirt that would cover the proudly naked skin of manhood .   but  meanwhile  he sat in breeches alone  and scratched idly at a favorite spot just above the diaphragm .  he felt curious and just a little bored .  it wasn   t bad to come with his father to the museum when people were there .  today was a closed day  however  and the empty corridors rang lonesomely when he walked along them .   besides  he knew everything in it mostly bones and stones .   junior said     what   s that thing .         what thing .     raph lifted his head and looked over his shoulder .  then he looked pleased .     oh  that   s something quite new .  that   s a reconstruction of primate primeval .  it was sent to me from the north river grouping .  isn   t it a nice job  though .     and he returned to his work  in the grip of a momentary twinge of pleasure .  private primeval wasn   t to go on exhibition for a week at least not until he prepared an honorable place for it with suitable surroundings  but  for the moment  it was in his office and his own private darling .   raph looked at the    nice job    with quite other emotions  however .  what he saw was a spindly figure of contemptuous size  with thin legs and arms  hair covered and owning an ugly  small featured face with large  protruding eyes .   he said     well  what is it  pa .      raph stirred impatiently     it   s a creature that lived many millions of years ago  we think .  that   s the way we think it looks .         why .     insisted the youngster .   raph gave up .  apparently  he would have to root out the subject and do away with it .      well  for one thing we can tell about the muscles from the shape of the bones  and the positions where the tendons would fit and where some of the nerves would go .  from the teeth we can tell the type of digestive system the animal would have  and from the foot bones  what type of posture it would have .  for the rest  we go by the principle of analogy  that is  by the outside appearance of creatures that exist today that have the same kind of skeleton .  for instance  that   s why he   s covered with red hair .  most of the primates today they   re little insignificant creatures  practically extinct are red haired  have bare callosities on the rump      junior scurried behind the figure and satisfied himself on that score .       have long  fleshy probosces  and short  shriveled ears .  their diets are unspecialized  hence the rather all purpose teeth  and they are nocturnal  hence the large eyes .  it   s all simple  really .  now  does that dispose of you  youngster .      and then junior  having thought and thought about it  came out with a disparaging     he looks just like an eekah to me  though .  just like an ugly  old eekah .      raph stared at him .  apparently he had missed a point     an eekah .     he said     what   s an eekah .  is that an imaginary creature you   ve been reading about .         imaginary .  say  pa  don   t you ever stop at the recorder   s .      this was an embarrassing question to answer  for    pa    never did  or at least  never since his maturity .  as a child  the recorder  as custodian of the world   s spoken  written  and recorded fiction  had  of course  had an unfailing fascination .  but he had grown up   he said  tolerantly     are there new stories about eekahs .  i remember none when i was young .         you don   t get it  pa .     one would almost suppose that the young raph was on the very verge of an exasperation he was too cautious to express .  he explained in wounded fashion     the eekahs are real things .  they come from the other world .  haven   t you heard about that .  we   ve been hearing about it in school  even  and in the group magazine .  they stand upside down in their country  only they don   t know it  and they look just like ol    primeval there .      raph collected his astonished wits .  he felt the incongruity of cross examining his half grown child for archeological data and he hesitated a moment .  after all  he had heard some things .  there had been word of vast continents existing on the other hemisphere of earth .  it seemed to him that there were reports of life on them .  it was all hazy perhaps it wasn   t always wise to stick so closely to the field of one   s own interest .   he asked junior     are there eekahs here among the groupings .      junior nodded rapidly     the recorder says they can think as good as us .  they got machines that go through the air .  that   s how they got here .         junior .     said raph severely .      i ain   t lying     junior cried with aggrieved virtue .     you ask the recorder and see what he says .      raph slowly gathered his papers together .  it was closed day  but he could find the recorder at his home  no doubt .     the recorder was an elderly member of the red river gurrow grouping and few alive could remember a time when he was not .  he had succeeded to the post by general consent and filled it well  for he was recorder for the same reason that raph was curator of the museum .  he liked to be  he wanted to be  and he could conceive no other life .   the social pattern of the gurrow grouping is difficult to grasp unless born into it  but there was a looseness about it that almost made the word    pattern    incongruous .  the individual gurrow took whatever job he felt an aptitude for  and such work as was left over and needed to be done was done either in common  or consecutively by each according to an order determined by lot .  put so  it sounds too simple to work  but actually the traditions that had gathered with the five thousand years since the first voluntary grouping of gurrahs was supposed to have been established  made the system complicated  flexible and workable .   the recorder was  as raph had anticipated  at his home  and there was the embarrassment of renewing an old and unjustly neglected acquaintanceship .  he had made use of the recorder   s reference library  of course  but always indirectly yet he had once been a child  an intimate learner at the feet of accumulated wisdom  and he had let the intimacy lapse .   the room he now entered was more or less choked with recordings and  to a lesser degree  with printed material .  the recorder interspersed greetings with apologies .      shipments have come from some of the other groupings     he said .     it needs time for cataloguing  you know  and i can   t seem to find the time i used to .     he lit a pipe and puffed strongly .     seems to me i   ll have to find a full time assistant .  what about your son  raph .  he clusters about here the way you did twenty years ago .         you remember those times .         better than you do  i think .  think your son would like that .         suppose you talk to him .  he might like to .  i can   t honestly say he   s fascinated by archaeology .     raph picked up a recording at random and looked at the identification tag     um m m from the joquin valley grouping .  that   s a long way from here .         a long way .  .  .  the recorder nodded .     i have sent them some of ours  of course .  the works of our own grouping are highly regarded throughout the continent     he said  with proprietary pride .     in fact    he pointed the stem of his pipe at the other    your own treatise on extinct primates has been distributed everywhere .  i   ve sent out two thousand copies and there are still requests .  that   s pretty good for archaeology .         well  archaeology is why i am here that and what my son says you   ve been telling him .  .  .  raph had a little trouble starting     it seems you have spoken of creatures called eekahs from the antipodes  and i would like to have such information as you have on them .      the recorder looked thoughtful     well  i could tell you what i know offhand  or we could go to the library and look up the references .         don   t bother opening the library for me .  it   s a closed day .  just give me some notion of things and i   ll search the references later .      the recorder bit at his pipe  shoved his chair back against the wall and de focused his eyes thoughtfully .     well     he said     i suppose it starts with the discovery of the continents on the other side .  that was five years ago .  you know about that  perhaps .         only the fact of it .  i know the continents exist  as everyone does now .  i remember once speculating on what a shining new field it would be for archaeological research  but that is all .         ah  then there is much else to tell you of .  the new continents were never discovered by us directly  you know .  it was five years ago that a group of non gurrow creatures arrived at the east harbor grouping in a machine that flew by definite scientific principles  we found out later  based essentially on the buoyancy of air .  they spoke a language  were obviously intelligent  and called themselves eekahs .  the gurrows  of the east harbor grouping  learned their language a simple one though full of unpronounceable sounds and i have a grammar of it  if you   re interested      raph waved that away .   the recorder continued     the gurrows of the grouping  with the aid of those of the iron mountain grouping which specialize in steel works  you know built duplicates of the flying machine .  a flight was made across the ocean  and i should say there are several dozens of volumes on all that volumes on the flying machine  on a new science called aerodynamics  new geographies  even a new system of philosophy based on the plurality of intelligences .  all produced at the east harbor and iron mountain groupings .  remarkable work for only five years  and all are available here         but the eekahs are they still at the east harbor groupings .         um m m .  i   m pretty certain they are .  they refused to return to their own continents .  they call themselves    political refugees .             politi .  .  . what .         it   s their own language     said the recorder     and it   s the only translation available .         well  why political refugees .  why not geological refugees  or oompah refugees .  i should think a translation ought to make sense .      the recorder shrugged     i refer you to the books .  they   re not criminals  they claim .  i know only what i tell you .         well  then  what do they look like .  do you have pictures .         at the library .         did you read my    principles of archaeology .             i looked through it .         do you remember the drawings of primate primeval .         i   m afraid not .         then  look  let   s go down to the library  after all .         well  sure .     the recorder grunted as he rose .     the administrator of the red river gurrow grouping held a position in no way different in essentials from that of the museum curator  the recorder or any other voluntary job holder .  to expect a difference is to assume a society in which executive ability is rare .   actually  all jobs in a gurrow grouping where a    job    is defined as regular work  the fruits of which adhere to others in addition to the worker himself are divided into two classes  one  voluntary jobs  and the other  involuntary or community jobs .  all of the first classification are equal .  if a gurrow enjoys the digging of useful ditches  his bent is to be respected and his job to be honored .  if no one enjoys such burrowing and yet it is found necessary for comfort  it becomes a community job  done by lot or rotation according to convenience annoying but unavoidable .   and so it was that the administrator lived in a house no more ample and luxurious than others  sat at the head of no tables  had no particular title other than the name of his job  and was neither envied  hated  nor adored .   he liked to arrange inter group trade  to supervise the common finances of the group  and to judge the infrequent disagreements that arose .  of course  he received no additional food or energy privileges for doing what he liked .   it was not  therefore  to obtain permission  but to place his accounts in decent order  that raph stopped in to see the administrator .  the closed day had not yet ended .  the administrator sat peacefully in his after dinner armchair  with an after dinner cigar in his mouth  and an after dinner book in his hand .  although there was something rather timeless about six children and a wife  even they had an after dinner air about them .   raph received a multiple greeting upon entering  and raised two hands to his ears  for if the various administratelets  only applicable title .  author .   had a job  it was noisemaking .  certainly  it was what they liked to do  and certainly others reaped most of the fruits therefrom  for their own eardrums were apparently impervious .   the administrator shooed them .   raph accepted a cigar .      i intend leaving the grouping for a time  lahr     he said .     my job necessitates it .         we won   t enjoy your going  raph .  i hope it will not be for long .         i hope not .  what have we in common units .         oh  ample for your purposes  i   m sure .  where do you intend going .         to the east harbor grouping .      the administrator nodded and blew out a thoughtful puff of smoke     unfortunately  east harbor has a surplus in their favor registered in our books i can verify that  if you wish but the common units of exchange on hand will take care of transportation and necessary expenses .         well  that   s fine .  but tell me  what is my status on the community job roster .         um m m i   ll have to get the rolls .  you   ll excuse me a moment .     he trundled away  heaving his great weight across the room and out into the hallway .  raph paused to poke at the youngest of the children who rolled up to him  growling in mock ferocity with gleaming teeth a black little bundle of thick fur  with the long  childish snout that had not yet broadened away from the shape of the animal ancestry of half a million years earlier .   the administrator returned with a heavy ledger and large spectacles .  he opened the ledger meticulously  riffled the pages to the proper place and then drew a careful finger down the columns .   he said     there   s only the question of the water supply  raph .  you   re due on the maintenance gang for this next week .  there   s nothing else due for at least two months .         i   ll be back before then .  is there any chance of someone subbing for me on the water maintenance .         um m m i   ll get someone .  i can always send my oldest .  he   s getting to job age and he might as well taste everything .  he may like working on the dam .         yes .  you tell me if he does  then .  he can replace me  regularly .      the administrator smiled gently     don   t plan on that  raph .  if he can figure out a way of making sleeping useful to all of us  he   ll certainly take it up as a job .  and why are you going to east harbor grouping  by the way  if it   s something you care to talk about .         you   ll laugh  perhaps  but i have just found out that there exist such things as eekahs .         eekahs .  yes  i know .     the administrator pointed a finger .     creatures from across the seal right .         right .  but that   s not all .  i   ve come from the library .  i   ve seen trimensional reproductions  lahr  and they   re primate primeval  or almost .  they   re primates  anyway  intelligent primates .  they   ve got small eyes  hat noses  and completely different jawbones but they   re at least second cousins .  i   ve got to see them  lahr .      the administrator shrugged .  he felt no interest in the matter himself .     why .  i ask out of ignorance  raph .  does it matter  your seeing them .         matter .     raph was obviously appalled at the question .     don   t you know what   s been going on these last years .  have you read my archaeology book .         no     said the administrator  definitely     i wouldn   t read it to save myself a turn at garbage disposal .      raph said     which probably proves you more suited to garbage disposal than archaeology .  but never mind .  i   ve been fighting single handed for nearly ten years in favor of my theory that primate primeval was an intelligent creature with a developed civilization .  i have nothing on my side so far but logical necessity  which is the last thing most archaeologists will accept .  they want something solid .  they want the remains of a grouping  or artifacts  structures  books get it .  all i can give them is a skeleton with a huge brain pan .  stars above  lahr  what do they expect to survive in ten million years .  metal dies .  paper dies .  film dies .      only stone lasts  lahr .  and bone that   s turned to stone .  i   ve got that .  a skull with room for a brain .  and stone  too  old sharpened knives .  ground flints .         well .      said lahr     there are your artifacts .         those are called eoliths  dawn stones .  they won   t accept them .  they call them natural products  fortuitously shaped by erosion into the shapes they have  the idiots .      then he grinned with a scientific ferocity     but if the eekahs are intelligent primates  i   ve practically proven my case .        raph had traveled before  but never eastward  and the decline of agriculture on the road impressed him .  in early history  the gurrow groupings had been entirely unspecialized .  each had been self sufficient  and trade was a gesture of friendliness rather than a matter of necessity .   and so it was still in most groupings .  his own grouping  the red river  was perhaps typical .  some five hundred miles inland  set in lush farm land  agriculture remained centric .  the river yielded some fish and there was a well developed dairy industry .  in fact  it was food exports that provided cause for the healthy state of the store of common units .   as they traveled eastward  however  the groupings through which they passed paid less and less mind to the shallowing soil and more and more to the smoking factory structures .   in the east harbor grouping  raph found a trading center which depended for its prosperity primarily upon ships .  it was a more populous grouping than the average  more densely packed  with houses  on occasion  within a hundred yards of each other .   raph felt an uncomfortable prickling at the thought of living in such close quarters .  the docks were even worse  with gurrows engaged at the huge community jobs of loading and unloading .   the administrator of this east harbor grouping was a young man  new at his job  overwhelmed with the joy of his work  and beside himself with the pleasure of welcoming a distinguished stranger .   raph sat through an excellent meal  and was treated to a long discourse as to the exact derivation of each dish .  to his provincial ears  beef from the prairie grouping  potatoes from the northeast woods grouping  coffee from the isthmus grouping  wine from the pacific grouping  and fruit from the central lakes grouping were something strange and wonderful .   over the cigars south island grouping he brought up the subject of the eekahs .  the east harbor administrator grew solemn and a little uneasy .      the man you want to see is lernin .  he   ll be glad to help you all he can .  you say you know something of these eekahs .         i say i would like to know something .  they resemble an extinct species of animal i am familiar with .         then that is your field of interest .  i see .         perhaps you can tell me some of the details of their arrival  administrator     suggested raph  politely .      i was not administrator at the time  friend  so that i lack firsthand information  but the records are plain .  this group of eekahs that arrived in their flying machine .  .  . you   ve heard about these aeronautical devices .         yes  yes .         yes .  well .  .  . apparently they were fugitives .         so i have heard .  yet they claim not to be criminals .  isn   t that so .         yes .  queer  isn   t it .  they admitted that they had been condemned this was after long and skillful questioning  once we had learned their language but denied that they were evildoers .  apparently  they had disagreed with their administrator on principles of policy .      raph nodded his head knowingly      ah  and refused to abide by the common decision .  is that it .         more confusing than that .  they insist there was no common decision .  they claim that the administrator decided on policy of his own accord .         and was not replaced .         apparently those who believe he should are considered criminals  as these were .      there was a frank pause of disbelief .  then raph said     does that sound reasonable to you .         no  i merely relay to you their words .  of course  the eekah language is quite a barrier .  some of the sounds can   t be pronounced  words have different meanings according to position in the sentence and according to tiny differences in inflection .  and it happens often that eekah words even when best translated are a complete puzzle .         they must have been surprised to find gurrows here     suggested raph     if they are members of a different genus .         surprised .     the administrator   s voice sank     i   ll say they were surprised .  now  this information has not been generally published for obvious reasons  so i hope you remember that it   s confidential .  these eekahs killed five gurrows before they could be disarmed .  they had an instrument that expelled metal pellets at high speed by means of a controlled explosive chemical reaction .  we have duplicated it since .  naturally  under the circumstances  we are not branding them criminals  for it is reasonable to assume that they did not realize we were intelligent beings .  apparently     and the administrator smiled ruefully     we resemble certain animals in their world .  or so they say .      but raph was galvanized into a sudden enthusiasm     stars above .  they said that  did they .  did they go into details .  what kind of animals .      the administrator was taken back     well  i don   t know .  they give names in their language .  what meaning has that .  they called us giant    bears .             giant what .         bears .  i haven   t the slightest idea what they are  except presumably that they look like us .  i know of no such in america .         bears .  bears .     raph stumbled over the word .     that   s interesting .  it   s more than interesting .  it   s stupendous .  do you know  administrator  that there is a great dispute among us as to the ancestry of gurrows .  living animals related to gurrow sapiens would be of immense importance .     raph rubbed his huge hands with pleasure .   the administrator was pleased at the sensation he had caused .  he said     and a puzzling thing in addition is that they call themselves by two names .         two names .         yes .  no one knows the distinction yet  no matter how much the eekahs explain it to us  except that one is a more general name  and one a more specific .  the basis of the difference escapes us .         i see .  which is    eekah    .         that is the specific one .  the general one is    the administrator stumbled slowly over the harsh syllables    chim pan zee .  there  that   s it .  there are a group called eekahs and there are other groups with other names .  but they are all called chim .  .  . what i said before .      the administrator sought through his mind for other juicy items of miscellany with which he was acquainted  but raph interrupted him .      may i see lernin tomorrow .         of course .         then i shall do so .  thank you for your courtesy  administrator .        lernin was a slight individual .  it is doubtful if he weighed more than two hundred and fifty .  there was also an imperfection in his walk  a slight lameness .  but neither of these facts made much of an impression on raph once the conversation had begun  for lernin was a thinker who could impose his vigor upon others .   it was raph whose eagerness dominated the first half of the conversation  and lernin   s comments were as luminous and as brief as lightning flashes .  and then  there was a sudden whirl of the center of gravity  and lernin took over .      you will excuse me  learned friend     lernin said with a characteristic stiffness that he could make so amiable     if i find your problem unimportant .  no  no    he lifted a long fingered hand    not  in the uncomplicated talk of the times  merely unimportant to myself because my interest lies elsewhere  but unimportant to the grouping of all the groupings to every single gurrow from end to end of the world .      the concept was staggering .  for a moment  raph was offended  offended deep in his sense of individuality .  it showed in his face .   lernin added quickly     it may sound impolite  crude  uncivilized .  but i must explain .  i must explain because you are primarily a social scientist and will understand perhaps better than we ourselves .         my life interest     said raph angrily     is important to myself .  i cannot assume those of others in preference .         what i talk about should be the life interest of all if only because it may be the means of saving the lives of all of us .      raph was beginning to suspect all sorts of things from a queer form of joking to the unbalance of mind that sometimes came with age .  yet lernin was not old .   lernin said  with an impressive fervor     the eekahs of the other world are a danger to us  for they are not friendly to us .      and raph replied naturally     how do you know .         no one other than myself  my friend  has lived more closely with these eekahs who have arrived here  and i find them people with minds of emotional content strange to us .  i have collected queer facts which we find difficult to interpret  but which point  at any rate  in disquieting directions .      i   ll list a few  eekahs in organized groups kill one another periodically for obscure reasons .  eekahs find it impossible to live in manner other than those of ants that is  in huge conglomerate societies yet find it impossible to allow for the presence of one another .  or  to use the terminology of the social scientists  they are gregarious without being social  just as we gurrows are social without being gregarious .  they have elaborate codes of behavior  which  we are told  are taught to the young  but which are disobeyed in universal practice  for reasons obscure to us .  et cetera .  et cetera .  et cetera .         i am an archaeologist     said raph  stiffly .     these eekahs are of interest to me biologically only .  if the curvature of the thigh bone is known to me  i care little for the curvature of their cultural processes .  if i can follow the shape of the skull  it is immaterial to me that the shape of their ethics is mysterious .         you don   t think that their insanities may affect us here .         we are six thousand miles apart  or more  along either ocean     said raph .     we have our world .  they have theirs .  there is no connection between us .         no connection     mused lernin     so others have said .  no connection at all .  yet eekahs have reached us  and others may follow .  we are told that the other world is dominated by a few  who are in turn dominated by their queer need for security which they confuse with an eekah word called    power     which  apparently  means the prevailing of one   s own will over the sum of the will of the community .  what if this    power    should extend to us .      raph bent his mind to the task .  the matter was utterly ridiculous .  it seemed impossible to picture the strange concepts .   lernin said     these eekahs say that their world and ours in the long past were closer together .  they say that there is a well known scientific hypothesis in their world of a continental drift .  that may interest you  since otherwise you might find it difficult to reconcile the existence of fossils of primate primeval closely related to living eekahs six thousand miles away .        and the mists cleared from the archaeologist   s brain as he glanced up with a live interest untroubled by insanities      ah  you should have said this sooner .         i say it now as an example of what you may achieve for yourself by joining us and helping us .  there is another thing .  these eekahs are physical scientists  like ourselves here in east harbor  but with a difference dictated by their own cultural pattern .  since they live in hives  they think in hives  and their science is the result of an ant society .  individually  they are slow and unimaginative  collectively  each supplies a crumb different from that supplied by his fellow so that a vast structure is erected quickly .  here the individual is infinitely brighter  but he works alone .  you  for instance  know nothing of chemistry  i imagine .         a few of the fundamentals  but nothing else     admitted raph .     i leave that  naturally  to the chemist .         yes  naturally .  but i am a chemist .  yet these eekahs  though my mental inferiors  and no chemists in their own world  know more chemistry than i .  for instance  did you know that there exist elements that spontaneously disintegrate .         impossible     exploded raph .     elements are eternal  changeless      lernin laughed     so you have been taught .  so i have been taught .  so i taught others .  yet the eekahs are right  for in my laboratories i have checked them  and in every detail they are right .  uranium gives rise to a spontaneous radiation .  you   ve heard of uranium  of course .  and furthermore  i have detected radiations of energy beyond that produced by uranium which must be due to traces of elements unknown to us but described by the eekahs .  and these missing elements fit well into the so called periodic tables some chemists have tried to foist upon the science .  though i do wrong to use the word    foist    now .         well     said raph     why do you tell me this .  does this  too  help me in my problem .         perhaps     said lernin  ironically     you will yet find it a royal bribe .  you see  the energy production of uranium is absolutely constant .  no known outward change in environment can affect it and as a result of the loss in energy  uranium slowly turns to lead at an absolutely constant rate .  a group of our men is even now using this fact as a basis for a method of determining the age of the earth .  you see  to determine the age of a stratum of rock in the earth  then  it is but necessary to discover a region in it containing a trace of uranium a widely spread element and to determine about it the quantity of lead and i might here add that the lead produced from uranium differs from ordinary lead and can be easily characterized and it is then simple to determine the length of time in which that stratum has been solid .  and of course  if a fossil is found in that stratum  it is of the same age  am i not correct .         stars above     and raph rose to his feet in a tremble     you do not deceive me .  it is really possible to do this .         it is possible .  it is even easy .  i tell you that our great defense  even at this late date  is co operation in science .  we are a group now of many  my friend  from many groupings  and we want you among us .  if you join us  it would be a simple matter to extend our earthage project to such regions as you may indicate regions rich in fossils .  what do you say .         i will help you .        it is doubtful if the gurrow groupings had ever before seen a community venture of such breadth as now took place .  east harbor grouping  as has been remarked  was a shipping center  and certainly a trans atlantic vessel was not beyond the capacity of a grouping that traded along the full lengths of both coasts of the americas .  what was unusual was the vastness of the co operation of gurrows from many groupings  gurrows of many interests .   not that they were all happy .   raph  for instance  on the particular morning that now concerns us  six months from the date of his first arrival in east harbor  was searching anxiously for lernin .   lernin  for his part  was searching for nothing but greater speed .   they met on the docks  where lernin  biting the end off a cigar and leading the way to a region where smoking was permitted .  said     and you  my friend  seem concerned .  not .  certainly  about the progress of our ocean liner .         i am concerned     said raph  gravely     about the reports i have received of the expedition testing the age of the rocks .         oh and you are unhappy about it .         unhappy .     exploded raph .     have you seen them .         i have received a copy .  i have looked at it .  i have even read parts of it .  but i have had little time and most of it bounced off .  will you please enlighten me .         certainly .  in the last several months  three of the regions i have indicated as being fossiliferous have been tested .  the first region was in the area of east harbor grouping itself .  another was in the pacific bay grouping  and a third in the central lakes grouping .  i purposely asked that those be done first because they are the richest areas and because they are widely separated .  do you know  for instance  what age they tell me the rocks upon which we stand are .         two billion years  i think  is the oldest figure i noticed .         and that   s the figure for the oldest rocks the basic igneous stratum of basalt .  the upper strata  however the recent sedimentary layers containing dozens of fossils of primate primeval how old do you think these are supposed to be .  five hundred trillion years .  how is that .  do you understand .         trillion .     lernin squinted upwards and shook his head .     that   s strange .         i   ll add to it .  the pacific coast grouping is one hundred trillion years old so i am told and central lakes almost eighty trillion years old .      lernin said     and the other measurements .  the ones that did not involve your strata .         that is the most peculiar thing of all .  most of the chosen investigations were carried on in strata that were not particularly fossiliferous .  they had their own criteria of choice based on geological reasoning and they got consistent results one million to two billion years depending upon the depth and geological history of the particular region tested .  only my areas give these strange and impossible vagaries .      and lernin said     but what do the geologists say about all this .  call there be some error .         undoubtedly .  but they have fifty decent  reasonable measurements .  for themselves  they have proved the method and are happy .  there are three anomalies  to be sure  but they view them with equanimity as involving some unknown factors .  i don   t see it that way .  these three measurements mean everything .     raph interrupted himself fiercely     how sure are you that radioactivity is an absolute constant .         sure .  can one ever be sure .  nothing we know of so far affects it  and such is likewise the definite testimony of our eekahs .  besides  my friend  if you are implying that radioactivity was more extensive in the past than in the present  why only in your fossil regions .  why not everywhere .         why  indeed .  it   s another aspect of a problem which is growing more important daily .  consider .  we have regions which show a past of abnormal radioactivity .  we have regions which show abnormal fossil frequencies .  why should these regions coincide  lernin .         one obvious answer suggests itself  my friend .  if your primate primeval existed at a time when certain regions were highly radioactive  certain individuals would wander into them and die .  radioactive radiation is deadly in excess  of course .  radioactivity and fossils  there you are .  .  .      why not other creatures     demanded raph .     only primate primeval occurs in excess  and he was intelligent .  he would not be trapped by dangerous radiation .         perhaps he was not intelligent .  that is  after all  only your theory and not a proven fact .         certainly  then  he was more intelligent than his small brained contemporaries .  .  .      perhaps not even that .  you romanticize too much .         perhaps i do .     raph spoke in half a whisper .     it seems to me that i can conjure up visions of a great civilization of a million years back or more .  a great power  a great intelligence that has vanished completely  except for the tiny whispers of ossified bones which retain that huge cavity in which a brain once existed  and a bony five fingered hand curving into slender signs of manipulative skill with an opposing thumb .  they must have been intelligent .         then  what killed them .     lernin shrugged     several million species of living things have survived .         raph looked up  half in anger     i cannot accompany your group  lernin  on a voluntary basis .  to go to the other world would be useful  yes  if i could engage in my own studies .  for your purposes  it can be only a community job to me .  i cannot give my heart to it .      but lernin   s jaw was set     that arrangement would not be fair .  there are many of us  my friend  who are sacrificing our own interests .  if we all placed them first and investigated the other world in terms of our own particular provincialisms only  our great purpose would be destroyed .  my friend  there is not one of our men that we can spare .  we must all work as if our lives depended on our instant solution of the eekah problem  which  believe me  it does .      raph   s jaws twisted in distaste .     on your side  you have a vague apprehension of these weak  stupid little creatures .  on my side i have a definite problem of great intellectual attraction to myself .  and between the two i can see no connection no possible connection at all .         nor can i .  but listen to me a moment .  a small group of our most trusted men returned last week from a visit to the other world .  it was not official  as ours will be .  it made no contacts .  it was a frank piece of espionage  which i am telling you about now .  i ask your discretion on the matter .         naturally .         our men possessed themselves of eekah event sheets .         pardon me .         it is a created name to describe the objects .  printed records are issued daily in the various centers of eekah population of events and occurrences of the day  and what passes for literary efforts as well .      raph was momentarily interested     it strikes me as an excellent idea .         yes  in its essence .  the eekah notion of interesting events  however  appears to consist entirely of antisocial events .  however  leave that be .  my point is that the existence of the americas is well known there these days and it is universally spoken of as a    new land of opportunity .     the various divisions of eekahs eye it with a universal desire .  the eekahs are many  they are crowded  their economy is irrational .  they want new land  and that is what this is to them new and empty land .         not empty     pointed out raph  mildly .      empty to them     insisted lernin terribly .     that is the vast danger .  lands occupied by gurrows are to them empty and they mean to take it  all the more so since they have often enough striven to take the lands of one another .      raph shrugged     even so  they         yes .  they are weak and stupid .  you said that  and so they are .  but only singly .  they will unite for a purpose .  to be sure  they will fall apart when the purpose is done but momentarily they will join and become strong  which we perhaps cannot do  witness yourself .  and their weapons of war have been keened in the fire of conflict .  their flying machines  for instance  are superb war weapons .         but we have duplicated it         in quantity .  we have also duplicated their chemical explosives  but only in the laboratory  and their firing tubes and armored vehicles  but only in experimental plants .  and yet there is more something developed within the last five years  for our own eekahs know nothing about it .         and what is that .         we don   t know .  their event sheets speak of it the names applied to it mean nothing to us but the context implies the terror of it  even on the part of these kill mad eekahs .  there seems no evidence that it has been used  or that all the eekah groups have it but it is used as a supreme threat .  it will perhaps be clearer to you when all the evidence is presented once our voyage is under way .         but what is it .  you talk of it as if it were a bogey .         why  they talk of it as if it were a bogey .  and what could be a bogey to an eekah .  that is the most frightening aspect of it .  so far  we know only that it involves the bombardment of an element they call plutonium of which we have never heard and of which our own eekahs have never heard either by objects called neutrons  which our eekahs say are subatomic particles without charge  which seems to us completely ridiculous .         and that is all .         all .  will you suspend judgment till we show you the sheets .      raph nodded reluctantly     very well .        raph   s leaden thoughts revolved in their worn groove as he stood there alone .   eekahs and primate primeval .  a living creature of erratic habits and a dead creature that must have aspired to heights .  a sordid present of explosives and neutron bombardments and a glorious  mysterious past  no connection .  no connection .     the end    by june      i had already been working on my ph . d .  research with near total concentration  i was no longer working in the candy store  my younger brother  stanley  had taken over  for nearly a year .  i was in the homestretch and beginning to think forward to writing my ph . d .  dissertation .  i rather dreaded that  since the obligatory style of dissertations is turgid in the extreme  and i had by now spent nine years trying to write well and was afraid i simply might not be able to write badly enough to qualify for my degree .     the experiments i was doing at the time required me  periodically  to dissolve a compound called catechol in water .  the catechol existed in fine  feathery  fluffy needles that dissolved very readily in water .  in fact  when i sprinkled catechol into the beaker of water  the individual needles dissolved as soon as they snuck the water surface .  idly  it occurred to me that if the catechol were any more soluble than it was  it would dissolve before it snuck the water surface .   naturally  i thought at once that this notion might be the basis for an amusing story .  it occurred to me  however  that instead of writing an actual story based on the idea  i might write up a fake research paper on the subject and get a little practice in turgid writing .   i did the job on june          even giving it the kind of long winded title that research papers so often have    the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline    and added tables  graphs  and fake references to non existent journals .   i was not at all sure that    thiotimoline     no use trying to quote the entire name every time  was publishable .  astounding  however  ran serious articles on scientific subjects of particular interest to science fiction readers and i thought it just possible campbell might be interested in a gag article that would be on the borders of science fiction .   i brought it in to him on the tenth  and he took it almost at once .       the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline     the correlation of the structure of organic molecules with their various properties  physical and chemical  has in recent years afforded much insight into the mechanism of organic reactions  notably in the theories of resonance and mesomerism as developed in the last decade .  the solubilities of organic compounds in various solvents has become of particular interest in this connection through the recent discovery of the endochronic nature of thiotimoline .   it has been long known that the solubility of organic compounds in polar solvents such as water is enhanced by the presence upon the hydrocarbon nucleus of hydrophilic i . e .   water loving groups  such as the hydroxy   oh   amino   nh    or sulfonic acid  so h  groups .  where the physical characteristics of two given compounds particularly the degree of subdivision of the material are equal  then the time of solution expressed in seconds per gram of material per milliliter of solvent decreases with the number of hydrophilic groups present .  catechol  for instance  with two hydroxy groups on the benzene nucleus  dissolves considerably more quickly than does phenol  with only one hydroxy group on the nucleus .  feinschreiber and hravlek in their studies on the problem have contended that with increasing hydrophilism  the time of solution approaches zero .  that this analysis is not entirely correct was shown when it was discovered that the compound thiotimoline will dissolve in water in the proportions of   gm .  ml .  in minus   .    seconds .  that is  it will dissolve before the water is added .   previous communications from these laboratories indicated thiotimoline to contain at least fourteen hydroxy groups  two amino groups and one sulfonic acid group .  the presence of a nitro group   no   in addition has not yet been confirmed  and no evidence as yet exists as to the nature of the hydrocarbon nucleus  though an at least partly aromatic structure seems certain .     the endochronometer first attempts to measure the time of solution of thiotimoline quantitatively met with considerable difficulty because of the very negative nature of the value .  the fact that the chemical dissolved prior to the addition of the water made the attempt natural to withdraw the water after solution and before addition .  this  fortunately for the law of conservation of mass energy  never succeeded  since solution never took place unless the water was eventually added .  the question is  of course  instantly raised as to how the thiotimoline can    know    in advance whether the water will ultimately be added or not .  though this is not properly within our province as physical chemists  much recent material has been published within the last year upon the psychological and philosophical problems thereby posed .   nevertheless  the chemical difficulties involved rest in the fact that the time of solution varies enormously with the exact mental state of the experimenter .  a period of even slight hesitation in adding the water reduces the negative time of solution  not infrequently wiping it out below the limits of detection .  to avoid this  a mechanical device has been constructed  the essential design of which has already been reported in a previous communication .   this device  termed the endochronometer  consists of a cell   cubic centimeters in size into which a desired weight of thiotimoline is placed  making certain that a small hollow extension at the bottom of the solution cell   millimeter in internal diameter is filled .  to the cell is attached an automatic pressure micro pipette containing a specific volume of the solvent concerned .  five seconds after the circuit is closed  this solvent is automatically delivered into the cell containing the thiotimoline .  during the time of action  a ray of light is focused upon the small cell extension described above  and at the instant of solution  the transmission of this light will no longer be impeded by the presence of solid thiotimoline .  both the instant of solution at which time the transmission of light is recorded by a photoelectric device and the instant of solvent addition can be determined with an accuracy of better than   .      . if the first value is subtracted from the second  the time of solution  t  can be determined .   the entire process is conducted in a thermostat maintained at    .     c .  to an accuracy of   .     c .     thiotimoline purity the extreme sensitivity of this method highlights the deviations resulting from trifling impurities present in thiotimoline .   since no method of laboratory synthesis of the substance has been devised  it may be practically obtained only through tedious isolation from its natural source  the bark of the shrub rosacea karl . ybader  . s   i  rufo .   great efforts were therefore made to purify the material through repeated recrystallizations from conductivity watertwice re distilled in an all tin apparatus and through final sublimations .  a comparison of the solution times  t  at various stages of the purification process is shown in table i .   it is obvious from table i that for truly quantitative significance  thiotimoline purified as described must be used .  after the second resublimation  for instance  the error involved in an even dozen determinations is less than   .     with the extreme values being   .     seconds and    .     seconds .     table i    purification stage   average    t        observations       t    extremes     error  as isolated      .         .        .         .

described subsequently in this study  thiotimoline so purified has been used .     time of solution and volume of solvent as would seem reasonable  experiments have shown that increasing the volume of solvent enables the thiotimoline to dissolve more quickly i . e .   with an increasingly negative time of solution .  from figure    however  we can see that this increase in endochronic properties levels off rapidly after a volume of solvent of approximately   .    ml .  this interesting plateau effect has appeared with varying volume of solvent for ail varieties of solvents used in these laboratories  just as in all cases the time of solution approaches zero with decreasing volume of solvent .       time of solution and concentration of a given ion in figure    the results are given of the effect of the time of solution  t  of varying the volume of solvent  where the solvent consists of varying concentrations of sodium chloride solution .  it can be seen that  although in each case the volume at which this plateau is reached differs markedly with the concentration  the heights of the plateau are constant  i . e .  l .     .  the volume at which it is reached  hereinafter termed the plateau volume  pv   decreases with decreasing      concentration of sodium chloride  approaching the pv for water as the nacl concentration approaches zero .  it is  therefore  obvious that a sodium chloride solution of unknown concentration can be quite accurately characterized by the determination of its pv  where other salts are absent .       this usefulness of pv extends to other ions as well .  figure   gives the endochronic curves for   .     molar solutions of sodium chloride  sodium bromide  and potassium chloride .  here  the pv in each case is equal within the limits of experimental error since the concentrations in each case are equal but the plateau heights  ph  are different .   a tentative conclusion that might be reached from this experimental data is that the ph is characteristic of the nature of the ions present in solution  whereas the pv is characteristic of the concentration of these ions .  table ii gives the values of plateau height and plateau volume for a wide variety of salts in equal concentrations  when present alone .   the most interesting variation to be noted in table ii is that of the pv with the valence type of the salt present .  in the case of salts containing pairs of singly charged ions i . e .   sodium chloride  potassium chloride  and sodium bromide the pv is constant for all .  this holds also for those salts containing one singly charged ion and one doubly charged ion i . e .  sodium sulphate  calcium chloride  and magnesium chloride where the pv  though equal among the three  varies markedly from those of the first set .  the pv is  therefore  apparently a function of the ionic strength of the solution .   this effect also exists in connection with the plateau height  though less regularly .  in the case of singly charged ions  such as in the first three salts listed in table     the ph is fairly close to that of water itself .  it falls considerably where doubly charged ions  such as sulphate or calcium  are present .  and when the triply charged phosphate ion or ferric ion is present  the value sinks to merely a quarter of its value in water .     table ii    solvent  salt solutions in  .

progress in these laboratories are concerned with the extremely important question of the variation of these endochronic properties of thiotimoline in the presence of mixtures of ions .  the state of our data at present does not warrant very general conclusions  but even our preliminary work gives hope of the further development of the endochronic methods of analysis .  thus  in figure    we have the endochronic curve where a mixture of   .     m sodium chloride and   .    m ferric chloride solutions is the solvent .  here  two sharp changes in slope can be seen  the first at a solution time of    .     and the second at   .    .  these being the ph   s characteristic of ferric chloride and sodium chloride respectively see table ii .  the ph for a given salt would thus appear not to be affected by the presence of other salts .   this is definitely not the case  however  for the pv  and it is to a quantitative elucidation of the variation of pv with impurities in the solvent that our major efforts are now directed .       summary investigations of the endochronic qualities of thiotimoline have shown that   a careful purification of the material is necessary for obtaining quantitative results .  .   b increasing the volume of solvent results in increasing the negative time of solution to a constant value known as the plateau height  ph   at a volume of solvent known as the plateau volume  pv  .   c the value of the ph is characteristic of the nature of the ions present in the solvent  varying with the ionic strength of the solution and not varying with the addition of other ions .   d the value of the pv is characteristic of the concentration of the ions present in the solvent  being constant for different ions in solution of equal ionic strength  but varying markedly with the admixtures of second varieties of ions .   as a result of all this  it is suggested that endochronic methods offer a means of rapid   minutes or less and accurate within   .     at least analysis of inorganic  water soluble materials .     bibliography     p .  krum and l .  eshkin .  journal of chemical solubilities                     .    concerning the anomalous solubility

and i knew that in the spring i would come up for my    oral examinations    the last hurdle on the path to my ph . d .  i didn   t want any austere member of the examining board to decide i was making fun of chemical research and to be sufficiently offended to vote against me on the grounds that i wasn   t temperamentally suited to the high honor of the doctorate .   so i asked campbell to run it under a pseudonym .     when the magazine with the article finally reached the newsstands  in mid february       i was appalled to discover that campbell had utterly forgotten the matter of the pseudonym .  the article appeared under my own name and i was scheduled to have my orals within three months .  my nervousness was increased when  almost at once  copies of the magazine began circulating in the chemistry department .   on may           i had my orals .  the examining board had seen the article .  after i had been on the grill for an hour and twenty minutes  the last question  asked by professor ralph s .  halford  was     mr .  asimov  tell us something about the thermodynamic properties of the compound thiotimoline .      i broke into hysterical laughter out of sheer relief  for it struck me instantly that they wouldn   t play good natured jokes with me  professor halford sounded jovial and everyone else was smiling  if they were going to hunk me .  i was led out  still laughing  and after a twenty minute wait  the examiners emerged  shook my hand  and said     congratulations  dr .  asimov .      my fellow students insisted on forcing five manhattans down my throat that afternoon and  since i am a teetotaler under normal conditions and have no tolerance for alcohol  i was royally drunk at once .  it took them three hours to sober me up .   after the official ceremonies  on june i        i was isaac asimov  ph . d .     as it turned out  campbell   s non use of a pseudonym  and i bet he did it deliberately  because he was smarter than i was  was a lucky break indeed .  not only did the examining board not take it amiss  but the article became  in a minor way  famous  and i with it .   although    thiotimoline    appeared in astounding  as did all my stories of the time  it received circulation far outside the ordinary science fiction world .  it passed from chemist to chemist  by way of the magazine itself  or by reprints in small trade journals  or by copies pirated and mimeographed  even by word of mouth .  people who had never heard of me at all as a science fiction writer  heard of thiotimoline .  it was the very first time my fame transcended the field .   what   s more  although    thiotimoline    was essentially a work of fantasy  the form was that of non fiction .  viewed from that standpoint     thiotimoline    was the first piece of non fiction i had ever published professionally the harbinger of a vast amount to come .   but what amused me most was that a surprising number of readers actually took the article seriously .  i was told that in the weeks after its appearance the librarians at the new york public library were driven out of their minds by hordes of eager youngsters who demanded to see copies of the fake journals i had used as pseudo references .     but back to the summer of        over a period of five years i had sold fourteen stories  every one of them to campbell .  this didn   t mean that he was the only editor in the field  at all .  almost all the magazines that had been published before the war still existed  although only astounding was really doing well  and would have welcomed submissions from me .  had campbell rejected any of the stories i had submitted to him  i would certainly have tried one of those other magazines .  but he didn   t  so i didn   t .   the magazine startling stories  in which i had published    christmas on ganymede    five and a half years before  published a forty thousand word    short novel    in each issue .  it wasn   t easy to get a publishable story of that length every month though  especially since startling   s rate was only half that of astounding .   sometimes it was necessary  therefore  for the editor of the magazine  who at that time was sam merwin  jr .   to canvass those authors known to be capable of turning out such a story .  about the time i was doing    thiotimoline     merwin approached me with a suggestion that i write a lead short novel .   startling  he explained  had always published stories with the accent on adventure  but  in imitation of astounding   s success  he had persuaded the publisher to try the experiment of publishing stories with a heavier accent on science .  would i consider  then  doing a lead for startling .   i was terribly flattered .  also  as i said earlier  i was nervous about having become a one editor author and would have welcomed a chance to prove to myself that i could write beyond campbell   s protective shadow .  i agreed  therefore  and a good part of the summer of       when i wasn   t engaged in preparing my experimental data for the upcoming ph . d .  dissertation  was spent in preparing a story i called    grow old with me .      this was inspired by robert browning   s poem rabbi ben ezra and was a misquotation which shows you the level of my culture .  the first line of the poem is    grow old along with me .        by august   i had completed first draft .  on august     i had the first part of it in final copy and submitted that to merwin .  he approved .  on september    the entire story was submitted and i had no doubt  whatever  of its acceptance .  on october           however  merwin told me that  alas  startling had decided not to go for heavy science  after all  but for adventure  and that    grow old with me    would have to be completely rewritten with no guarantee of acceptance after that .   i suppose it is an indication of how things had advanced when i tell you it was the first time that i did not accept a request for revision philosophically .  quite otherwise .  it had been five years and more since even campbell had rejected one of my stories  how  then  dare a comparative nonentity like merwin do so .  particularly since he had approached me for the story .   i made no effort to hide my annoyance .  in fact  i seized the manuscript and stalked out of the office  and in an obvious rage .   years afterward  as a result of the subsequent history of that story  merwin took to apologizing for that rejection every time he met me but he didn   t have to  and i kept telling him so .  he was editor  and he was completely within his rights to reject the story  and i was being pettily temperamental to be angry about it .  i have made every effort  since  to avoid evident anger at any rejection  however unjustified it might seem at the time  and i think i have succeeded .   i submitted the story to campbell  giving him a full account of events .   i have always made it a practice to tell any editor to whom i submit a story of any rejection it has previously received .  there is no necessity to do this  it is not  as far as i know  an ethical requirement for a writer .  i just do it  and it has not  again as far as i know  ever cost me an acceptance .   as it happened  campbell rejected the story  but not  i   m sure  because it had been somewhere else first .  he told me enough things wrong with the story to make me feel that perhaps merwin had not been so arbitrary in rejecting it .  i thrust the story in the drawer in disgust and thought no more about it for nearly two years .   the rejection came at a bad time .  more and more  i was wrapped up in trying to complete my research  in writing my dissertation  and  most of all  in anxiously looking for a job .  there wasn   t much time to write  and the rejection had sufficiently disheartened and humiliated me so that i withdrew from writing for nearly a year .  this was the third long withdrawal of my writing career  and  to this date  the last .   i did not find a job  my expected ph . d .  degree was no passport to affluence  after all .  that was humiliating  too .   i accepted an offer from professor robert c .  elderfield to do a year   s postdoctoral research for him for         working on anti malarial drugs .  i accepted  though not with great enthusiasm  and started work for him on june          the day after i had officially gained my ph . d .  at least it would give me another year to find a job .   by the next month  i had settled down sufficiently to consider writing a science fiction story     the red queen   s race .     on july    it was finished and i submitted it to campbell .  it was accepted on the sixteenth and once again i was back in business .       the red queen   s race     here   s a puzzle for you  if you like .  is it a crime to translate a chemistry textbook into greek .   or let   s put it another way .  if one of the country   s largest atomic power plants is completely ruined in an unauthorized experiment  is an admitted accessory to that act a criminal .   these problems only developed with time  of course .  we started with the atomic power plant drained .  i really mean drained .  i don   t know exactly how large the fissionable power source was but in two hashing microseconds  it had all fissioned .   no explosion .  no undue gamma ray density .  it was merely that every moving part in the entire structure was fused .  the entire main building was mildly hot .  the atmosphere for two miles in every direction was gently warm .  just a dead  useless building which later on took a hundred million dollars to replace .   it happened about three in the morning  and they found elmer tywood alone in the central source chamber .  the findings of twenty four close packed hours can be summarized quickly .     .  elmer tywood ph . d .   sc . d .   fellow of this and honorary that  one time youthful participant of the original manhattan project  and now full professor of nuclear physics was no interloper .  he had a class a pass unlimited .  but no record could be found as to his purpose in being there just then .  a table on casters contained equipment which had not been made on any recorded requisition .  it  too  was a single fused mass not quite too hot to touch .     .  elmer tywood was dead .  he lay next to the table  his face congested  nearly black .  no radiation effect .  no external force of any sort .  the doctor said apoplexy .     .  in elmer tywood   s office safe were found two puzzling items  i . e .  twenty foolscap sheets of apparent mathematics  and a bound folio in a foreign language which turned out to be greek  the subject matter  on translation  turning out to be chemistry .   the secrecy which poured over the whole mess was something so terrific as to make everything that touched it  dead .  it   s the only word that can describe it .  twenty seven men and women  all told  including the secretary of defense  the secretary of science  and two or three others so top notch that they were completely unknown to the public  entered the power plant during the period of investigation .  all who had been in the plant that night  the physicist who had identified tywood  the doctor who had examined him  were retired into virtual home arrest .   no newspaper ever got the story .  no inside dopester got it .  a few members of congress got part of it .   and naturally sol anyone or any group or any country that could suck all the available energy out of the equivalent of perhaps fifty to a hundred pounds of plutonium without exploding it  had america   s industry and america   s defense so snugly in the palm of the hand that the light and life of one hundred sixty million people could be turned off between yawns .   was it tywood .  or tywood and others .  or just others  through tywood .   and my job .  i was decoy  or front man  if you like .  someone has to hang around the university and ask questions about tywood .  after all  he was missing .  it could be amnesia  a hold up  a kidnapping  a killing  a runaway  insanity  accident i could busy myself with that for five years and collect black looks  and maybe divert attention .  to be sure  it didn   t work out that way .   but don   t think i was in on the whole case at the start .  i wasn   t one of the twenty seven men i mentioned a while back  though my boss was .  but i knew a little enough to get started .   professor john keyser was also in physics .  i didn   t get to him right away .  there was a good deal of routine to cover first in as conscientious a way as i could .  quite meaningless .  quite necessary .  but i was in keyser   s office now .   professors    offices are distinctive .  nobody dusts them except some tired cleaning woman who hobbles in and out at eight in the morning  and the professor never notices the dust anyway .  lots of books without much arrangement .  the ones close to the desk are used a lot lectures are copied out of them .  the ones out of reach are wherever a student put them back after borrowing them .  then there are professional journals that look cheap and are darned expensive  which are waiting about and which may some day be read .  and plenty of paper on the desk  some of it scribbled on .   keyser was an elderly man one of tywood   s generation .  his nose was big and rather red  and he smoked a pipe .  he had that easygoing and non predatory look in his eyes that goes with an academic job either because that kind of job attracts that kind of man or because that kind of job makes that kind of man .   i said     what kind of work is professor tywood doing .         research physics .      answers like that bounce off me .  some years ago they used to get me mad .  now i just said     we know that  professor .  it   s the details i   m after .      and he twinkled at me tolerantly     surely the details can   t help much unless you   re a research physicist yourself .  does it matter under the circumstances .         maybe not .  but he   s gone .  if anything   s happened to him in the way of    i gestured  and deliberately clinched    foul play  his work may have something to do with it unless he   s rich and the motive is money .     .   keyser chuckled dryly     college professors are never rich .  the commodity we peddle is but lightly considered  seeing how large the supply is .           i ignored that  too  because i know my looks are against me .  actually  i finished college with a    very good    translated into latin so that the college president could understand it  and never played in a football game in my life .  but i look rather the reverse .   i said     then we   re left with his work to consider .         you mean spies .  international intrigue .         why not .  it   s happened before .  after all  he   s a nuclear physicist  isn   t he .         he is .  but so are others .  so am i .         ah  but perhaps he knows something you don   t .       there was a stiffening to the jaw .  when caught off guard  professors can act just like people .  he said  stiffly     as i recall offhand  tywood has published papers on the effect of liquid viscosity on the wings of the rayleigh line  on higher orbit field equations  and on spin orbit coupling of two nucleons  but his main work is on quadrupole moments .  i am quite competent in these matters .         is he working on quadrupole moments now .     i tried not to bat an eye  and i think i succeeded .      yes in a way .     he almost sneered     he may be getting to the experimental stage finally .  he   s spent most of his life  it seems  working out the mathematical consequences of a special theory of his own .         like this     and i tossed a sheet of foolscap at him .   that sheet was one of those in the safe in tywood   s office .  the chances  of course  were that the bundle meant nothing  if only because it was a professor   s safe .  that is  things are sometimes put in at the spur of the moment because the logical drawer was filled with unmarked exam papers .  and  of course  nothing is ever taken out .  we had found in that safe dusty little vials of yellowish crystals with scarcely legible labels  some mimeographed booklets dating back to world war ii and marked    restricted     a copy of an old college yearbook  and some correspondence concerning a possible position as director of research for american electric  dated ten years back  and  of course  chemistry in greek .   the foolscap was there  too .  it was rolled up like a college diploma with a rubber band about it and had no label or descriptive title .  some twenty sheets were covered with ink marks  meticulous and small  i had one sheet of that foolscap .  i don   t think anyone man in the world had more than one sheet .  and i   m sure that no man in the world but one knew that the loss of his particular sheet and of his particular life would be as nearly simultaneous as the government could make it .   so i tossed the sheet at keyser  as if it were something i   d found blowing about the campus .   he stared at it and then looked at the back side  which was blank .  his eyes moved down from the top to the bottom  then jumped back to the top .      i don   t know what this is about     he said  and the words seemed sour to his own taste .   i didn   t say anything .  just folded the paper and shoved it back into the inside jacket pocket .   keyser added petulantly     it   s a fallacy you laymen have that scientists can look at an equation and say   ah  yes     and go on to write a book about it .  mathematics has no existence of its own .  it is merely an arbitrary code devised to describe physical observations or philosophical concepts .  every man can adapt it to his own particular needs .  for instance no one can look at a symbol and be sure of what it means .  so far  science has used every letter in the alphabet  large  small and italic  each symbolizing many different things .  they have used bold faced letters  gothic type letters  greek letters  both capital and small  subscripts  superscripts  asterisks  even hebrew letters .  different scientists use different symbols for the same concept and the same symbol for different concepts .  so if you show a disconnected page like this to any man  without information as to the subject being investigated or the particular symbology used  he could absolutely not make sense out of it .      i interrupted     but you said he was working on quadrupole moments .  does that make this sensible .     and i tapped the spot on my chest where the foolscap had been slowly scorching a hole in my jacket for two days .      i can   t tell .  i saw none of the standard relationships that i   d expect to be involved .  at least i recognized none .  but i obviously can   t commit myself .      there was a short silence  then he said     i   ll tell you .  why don   t you check with his students .      i lifted my eyebrows     you mean in his classes .      he seemed annoyed     no  for heaven   s sake .  his research students .  his doctoral candidates .  they   ve been working with him .  they   ll know the details of that work better than i  or anyone in the faculty  could possibly know it .         it   s an idea     i said  casually .  it was  too .  i don   t know why  but i wouldn   t have thought of it myself .  i guess it   s because it   s only natural to think that any professor knows more than any student .   keyser latched onto a lapel as i rose to leave .      and  besides     he said     i think you   re on the wrong track .  this is in confidence  you understand  and i wouldn   t say it except for the unusual circumstances  but tywood is not thought of too highly in the profession .  oh  he   s an adequate teacher  i   ll admit  but his research papers have never commanded respect .  there has always been a tendency towards vague theorizing  unsupported by experimental evidence .  that paper of yours is probably more of it .  no one could possibly want to .  .  . er  kidnap him because of it .         is that so .  i see .  any ideas  yourself  as to why he   s gone  or where he   s gone .         nothing concrete     he said pursing his lips     but everyone knows he is a sick man .  he had a stroke two years ago that kept him out of classes for a semester .  he never did get well .  his left side was paralyzed for a while and he still limps .  another stroke would kill him .  it could come any time .         you think he   s dead  then .         it   s not impossible .         but where   s the body  then .         well  really that is your job  i think .      it was  and i left .     i interviewed each one of tywood   s four research students in a volume of chaos called a research laboratory .  these student research laboratories usually have two hopefuls working therein  said two constituting a floating population  since every year or so they are alternately replaced .   consequently  the laboratory has its equipment stack in tiers .  on the laboratory benches is the equipment immediately being used  and in three or four of the handiest drawers are replacements or supplements which are likely to be used .  in the farther drawers  in the shelves reaching up to the ceiling  in odd corners  are fading remnants of the past student generations oddments never used and never discarded .  it is claimed  in fact  that no research student ever knew all the contents of his laboratory .   all four of tywood   s students were worried .  but three were worried mainly by their own status .  that is  by the possible effect the absence of tywood might have on the status of their    problem .     i dismissed those three who all have their degrees now  i hope and called back the fourth .   he had the most haggard look of all  and had been least communicative which i considered a hopeful sign .   he now sat stiffly in the straight backed chair at the right of the desk  while i leaned back in a creaky old swivel chair and pushed my hat off my forehead .  his name was edwin howe and he did get his degree later on  i know that for sure  because he   s a big wheel in the department of science now .   i said     you do the same work the other boys do  i suppose .         it   s all nuclear work  in a way .         but it   s not all exactly the same .      he shook his head slowly .     we take different angles .  you have to have something clear cut  you know  or you won   t be able to publish .  we   ve got to get our degrees .      he said it exactly the way you or i might say     we   ve got to make a living .     at that  maybe it   s the same thing for them .   i said     all right .  what   s your angle .      he said     i do the math .  i mean  with professor tywood .         what kind of math .      and he smiled a little  getting the same sort of atmosphere about him that i had noticed in professor keyser   s case that morning .  a sort of     do you really think i can explain all my profound thoughts to stupid little you .     sort of atmosphere .   all he said aloud  however  was     that would be rather complicated to explain .         i   ll help you     i said .     is that anything like it .     and i tossed the foolscap sheet at him .   he didn   t give it any once over .  he just snatched it up and let out a thin wail     where   d you get this .         from tywood   s safe .         do you have the rest of it  too .         it   s safe     i hedged .   he relaxed a little just a little     you didn   t show it to anybody  did you .      i showed it to professor keyser .      howe made an impolite sound with his lower lip and front teeth     that jackass .  what did he say .      i turned the palms of my hands upward and howe laughed .  then he said  in an offhand manner     well  that   s the sort of stuff i do .         and what   s it all about .  put it so i can understand it .      there was distinct hesitation .  he said     now  look .  this is confidential stuff .  even pop   s other students don   t know anything about it .  i don   t even think i know all about it .  this isn   t just a degree i   m after  you know .  it   s pop tywood   s nobel prize  and it   s going to be an assistant professorship for me at cal tech .  this has got to be published before it   s talked about .      and i shook my head slowly and made my words very soft     no  son .  you have it twisted .  you   ll have to talk about it before it   s published  because tywood   s gone and maybe he   s dead and maybe he isn   t .  and if he   s dead  maybe he   s murdered .  and when the department has a suspicion of murder  everybody talks .  now  it will look bad for you  kid  if you try to keep some secrets .      it worked .  i knew it would  because everyone reads murder mysteries and knows all the clich  s .  he jumped out of his chair and rattled the words off as if he had a script in front of him .      surely     he said     you can   t suspect me of .  .  . of anything like that .  why .  .  . why  my career      i shoved him back into his chair with the beginnings of a sweat on his forehead .  i went into the next line     i don   t suspect anybody of anything yet .  and you won   t be in any trouble  if you talk  chum .      he was ready to talk .     now this is all in strict confidence .      poor guy .  he didn   t know the meaning of the word    strict .     he was never out of eyeshot of an operator from that moment till the government decided to bury the whole case with the one final comment of     .     quote .  unquote .   i   m not kidding .  to this day  the case is neither opened nor closed .  it   s just     .       he said  dubiously     you know what time travel is  i suppose .      sure i knew what time travel was .  my oldest kid is twelve and he listens to the afternoon video programs till he swells up visibly with the junk he absorbs at the ears and eyes .      what about time travel .     i said .      in a sense  we can do it .  actually  it   s only what you might call micro temporal translation       i almost lost my temper .  in fact  i think i did .  it seemed obvious that the squirt was trying to diddle me  and without subtlety .  i   m used to having people think i look dumb  but not that dumb .   i said through the back of my throat     are you going to tell me that tywood is out somewhere in time like ace rogers  the lone time ranger .      that was junior   s favorite program ace rogers was stopping genghis khan single handed that week .    but he looked as disgusted as i must have .     no     he yelled .     i don   t know where pop is .  if you   d listen to me i said micro temporal translation .  now  this isn   t a video show and it isn   t magic  this happens to be science .  for instance  you know about matter energy equivalence  i suppose .      i nodded sourly .  everyone knows about that since hiroshima in the last war but one .      all right  then     he went on     that   s good for a start .  now  if you take a brown mass of matter and apply temporal translation to it you know  send it back in time you are  in effect  creating matter at the point in time to which you are sending it .  to do that  you must use an amount of energy equivalent to the amount of matter you have created .  in other words  to send a gram or  say  an ounce of anything back in time  you have to disintegrate an ounce of matter completely  to furnish the energy required .         hm m m     i said     that   s to create the ounce of matter in the past .  but aren   t you destroying an ounce of matter by removing it from the present .  doesn   t that create the equivalent amount of energy .      and he looked just about as annoyed as a fellow sitting on a bumblebee that wasn   t quite dead .  apparently laymen are never supposed to question scientists .   he said     i was trying to simplify it so you would understand it .  actually  it   s more complicated .  it would be very nice if we could use the energy of disappearance to cause it to appear  but that would be working in a circle  believe me .  the requirements of entropy would forbid it .  to put it more rigorously  the energy is required to overcome temporal inertia and it just works out so that the energy in ergs required to send back a mass  in grams  is equal to that mass times the square of the speed of light in centimeters per second .  which just happens to be the einstein mass energy equivalence equation .  i can give you the mathematics  you know .         i know     i waxed some of that misplaced eagerness back .     but was all this worked out experimentally .  or is it just on paper .      obviously  the thing was to keep him talking .   he had that queer light in his eye that every research student gets  i am told  when he is asked to discuss his problem .  hell discuss it with anyone  even with a    dumb flatfoot    which was convenient at the moment .      you see     he said like a man slipping you the inside dope on a shady business deal     what started the whole thing was this neutrino business .  they   ve been trying to find that neutrino since the late thirties and they haven   t succeeded .  it   s a subatomic particle which has no charge and has a mass much less than even an electron .  naturally  it   s next to impossible to spot  and hasn   t been spotted yet .  but they keep looking because  without assuming that a neutrino exists  the energetics of some nuclear reactions can   t be balanced .  so pop tywood got the idea about twenty years ago that some energy was disappearing  in the form of matter  back into time .  we got working on that or he did and i   m the first student he   s ever had tackle it along with him .      obviously  we had to work with tiny amounts of material and .  .  .  well  it was just a stroke of genius on pop   s part to think of using traces of artificial radioactive isotopes .  you could work with just a few micrograms of it  you know  by following its activity with counters .  the variation of activity with time should follow a very definite and simple law which has never been altered by any laboratory condition known .      well  we   d send a speck back fifteen minutes  say  and fifteen minutes before we did that everything was arranged automatically  you see the count jumped to nearly double what it should be  fell off normally  and then dropped sharply at the moment it was sent back below where it would have been normally .  the material overlapped itself in time  you see  and for fifteen minutes we counted the doubled material      i interrupted     you mean you had the same atoms existing in two places at the same time .         yes     he said  with mild surprise     why not .  that   s why we use so much energy the equivalent of creating those atoms .     and then he rushed on     now i   ll tell you what my particular job is .  if you send back the material fifteen minutes  it is apparently sent back to the same spot relative to the earth despite the fact that in fifteen minutes  the earth moved sixteen thousand miles around the sun  and the sun itself moves more thousand miles and so on .  but there are certain tiny discrepancies which i   ve analyzed and which turn out to be due  possibly  to two causes .      first  there is a frictional effect if you can use such a term so that matter does drift a little with respect to the earth  depending on how far back in time it is sent  and on the nature of material .  then  too  some of the discrepancy can only be explained by the assumption that passage through time itself takes time .         how   s that .     i said .      what i mean is that some of the radioactivity is evenly spread throughout the time of translation as if the material tested had been reacting during backward passage through time by a constant amount .  my figures show that well  if you were to be moved backward in time  you would age one day for every hundred years .  or  to put it another way  if you could watch a time dial which recorded the time outside a    time machine     your watch would move forward twenty four hours while the time dial moved back a hundred years .  that   s a universal constant  i think  because the speed of light is a universal constant .  anyway  that   s my work .      after a few minutes  in which i chewed all this  i asked     where did you get the energy needed for your experiments .         they ran out a special line from the power plant .  pop   s a big shot there  and swung the deal .         hm m m .  what was the heaviest amount of material you sent into the past .         oh    he sent his eyes upwards    i think we shot back one hundredth of a milligram once .  that   s ten micrograms .         ever try sending anything into the future .         that won   t work     he put in quickly .     impossible .  you can   t change signs like that  because the energy required becomes more than infinite .  it   s a one way proposition .      i looked hard at my fingernails     how much material could you send back in time if you fissioned about .  .  . oh  say  one hundred pounds of plutonium .     things  i thought  were becoming  if anything  too obvious .   the answer came quickly     in plutonium fission     he said     not more than one or two percent of the mass is converted into energy .  therefore  one hundred pounds of plutonium when completely used up would send a pound or two back into time .         is that all .  but could you handle all that energy .  i mean  a hundred pounds of plutonium can make quite an explosion .         all relative     he said  a bit pompously .     if you took all that energy and let it loose a little at a time  you could handle it .  if you released it all at once  but used it just as fast as you released it  you could still handle it .  in sending back material through time  energy can be used much faster than it can possibly be released even through fission .  theoretically  anyway .  .  .      but how do you get rid of it .         it   s spread through time  naturally .  of course  the minimum time through which material could be transferred would  therefore  depend on the mass of the material .  otherwise  you   re liable to have the energy density with time too high .         all right  kid     i said .     i   m calling up headquarters  and they   ll send a man here to take you home .  you   ll stay there a while .         but what for .         it won   t be for long .      it wasn   t and it was made up to him afterwards .   i spent the evening at headquarters .  we had a library there a very special kind of library .  the very morning after the explosion  two or three operators had drifted quietly into the chemistry and physics libraries of the university .  experts in their way .  they located every article tywood had ever published in any scientific journal and had snapped each page .  nothing was disturbed otherwise .   other men went through magazine files and through book lists .  it ended with a room at headquarters that represented a complete tywoodana .  nor was there a definite purpose in doing this .  it merely represented part of the thoroughness with which a problem of this sort is met .   i went through that library .  not the scientific papers .  i knew there   d be nothing there that i wanted .  but he had written a series of articles for a magazine twenty years back  and i read those .  and i grabbed at every piece of private correspondence they had available .   after that  i just sat and thought and got scared .   i got to bed about four in the morning and had nightmares .   but i was in the boss    private office at nine in the morning just the same .   he   s a big man  the boss  with iron gray hair slicked down tight .  he doesn   t smoke  but he keeps a box of cigars on his desk and when he doesn   t want to say anything for a few seconds  he picks one up  rolls it about a little  smells it  then sticks it right into the middle of his mouth and lights it in a very careful way .  by that time  he either has something to say or doesn   t have to say anything at all .  then he puts the cigar down and lets it bum to death .   he used up a box in about three weeks  and every christmas  half his gift wraps held boxes of cigars .   he wasn   t reaching for any cigars now  though .  he just folded his big fists together on the desk and looked up at me from under a creased forehead .     what   s boiling .      i told him .  slowly  because micro temporal translation doesn   t sit well with anybody  especially when you call it time travel  which i did .  it   s a sign of how serious things were that he only asked me once if i were crazy .   then i was finished and we stared at each other .   he said     and you think he tried to send something back in time something weighing a pound or two and blew an entire plant doing it .         it fits in     i said .   i let him go for a while .  he was thinking and i wanted him to keep on thinking .  i wanted him  if possible  to think of the same thing i was thinking  so that i wouldn   t have to tell him  because i hated to have to tell him   because it was nuts  for  one thing .  and too horrible  for another .   so i kept quiet and he kept on thinking and every once in a while some of his thoughts came to the surface .   after a while  he said     assuming the student  howe  to have told the truth and you   d better check his notebooks  by the way  which i hope you   ve impounded         the entire wing of that floor is out of bounds  sir .  edwards has the notebooks .      he went on      all right .  assuming he told us all the truth he knows  why did tywood jump from less than a milligram to a pound .      his eyes came down and they were hard     now you   re concentrating on the time travel angle .  to you  i gather  that is the crucial point  with the energy involved as incidental purely incidental .         yes  sir     i said grimly .     i think exactly that .         have you considered that you might be wrong .  that you might have matters inverted .         i don   t quite get that .         well  look .  you say you   ve read up on tywood .  all right .  he was one of that bunch of scientists after world war ii that fought the atom bomb  wanted a world state you know about that  don   t you .      i nodded .      he had a guilt complex      the boss said with energy .     he   d helped work out the bomb  and he couldn   t sleep nights thinking of what he   d done .  he lived with that fear for years .  and even though the bomb wasn   t used in world war iii  can you imagine what every day of uncertainty must have meant to him .  can you imagine the shriveling horror in his soul as he waited for others to make the decision at every crucial moment till the final compromise of sixty five .      we have a complete psychiatric analysis of tywood and several others just like him  taken during the last war .  did you know that .         no  sir .         it   s true .  we let up after sixty five  of course  because with the establishment of world control of atomic power  the scrapping of the atomic bomb stockpile in all countries  and the establishment of research liaison among the various spheres of influence on the planet  most of the ethical conflict in the scientific mind was removed .      but the findings at the time were serious .  in       tywood had a morbid subconscious hatred for the very concept of atomic power .  he began to make mistakes  serious ones .  eventually  we were forced to take him off research of any kind .  and several others as well  even though things were pretty bad at the time .  we had just lost india  if you remember .      considering that i was in india at the time  i remembered .  but i still wasn   t seeing his point .      now  what     he continued     if dregs of that attitude remained buried in tywood to the very end .  don   t you see that this time travel is a double edged sword .  why throw a pound of anything into the past  anyway .  for the sake of proving a point .  he had proved his case just as much when he sent back a fraction of a milligram .  that was good enough for the nobel prize  i suppose .      but there was one thing he could do with a pound of matter that he couldn   t do with a milligram  and that was to drain a power plant .  so that was what he must have been after .  he had discovered a way of consuming inconceivable quantities of energy .  by sending back eighty pounds of dirt  he could remove all the existing plutonium in the world  end atomic power for an indefinite period .      i was completely unimpressed  but i tried not to make that too plain .  i just said     do you think he could possibly have thought he could get away with it more than once .         this is all based on the fact that he wasn   t a normal man .  how do i know what he could imagine he could do .  besides  there may be men behind him with less science and more brains who are quite ready to continue onwards from this point .         have any of these men been found yet .  any evidence of such men .      a little wait  and his hand reached for the cigar box .  he stared at the cigar and turned it end for end .  just a little wait more .  i was patient .   then he put it down decisively without lighting it .          no     he said .   he looked at me  and clear through me  and said     then  you still don   t go for that .      i shrugged     well it doesn   t sound right .         do you have a notion of your own .         yes .  but i can   t bring myself to talk about it .  if i   m wrong  i   m the wrongest man that ever was  but if i   m right  i   m the rightest .         i   ll listen     he said  and he put his hand under the desk .   that was the pay off .  the room was armored  sound proof  and radiation proof to anything short of a nuclear explosion .  and with that little signal showing on his secretary   s desk  the president of the united states couldn   t have interrupted us .   i leaned back and said     chief  do you happen to remember how you met your wife .  was it a little thing .      he must have thought it a non sequitur .  what else could he have thought .  but he was giving me my head now  having his own reasons  i suppose .   he just smiled and said     i sneezed and she turned around .  it was at a street comer .         what made you be on that street corner just then .  what made her be .  do you remember just why you sneezed .  where you caught the cold .  or where the speck of dust came from .  imagine how many factors had to intersect in just the right place at just the right time for you to meet your wife .         i suppose we would have met some other time  if not then .         but you can   t know that .  how do you know whom you didn   t meet  because once when you might have turned around .  you didn   t  because once when you might have been late  you weren   t .  your life forks at every instant  and you go down one of the forks almost at random  and so does everyone else .  start twenty years ago  and the forks diverge further and further with time .      you sneezed  and met a girl  and not another .  as a consequence  you made certain decisions  and so did the girl  and so did the girl you didn   t meet  and the man who did meet her  and the people you all met thereafter .  and your family  her family  their family and your children .      because you sneezed twenty years ago  five people  or fifty  or five hundred  might be dead now who would have been alive  or might be alive who would have been dead .  move it two hundred years ago  two thousand years ago  and a sneeze even by someone no history ever heard of might have meant that no one now alive would have been alive .  .  .   the boss rubbed the back of his head     widening ripples .  i read a story once         so did i .  it   s not a new idea but i want you to think about it for a while  because i want to read to you from an article by professor elmer tywood in a magazine twenty years old .  it was just before the last war .  .  .   i had copies of the film in my pocket and the white wall made a beautiful screen  which was what it was meant to do .  the boss made a motion to turn about  but i waved him back .      no  sir     i said .     i want to read this to you .  and i want you to listen to it .      he leaned back .      the article  .  .  i went on  is entitled     man   s first great failure .     remember  this was just before the war  when the bitter disappointment at the final failure of the united nations was at its height .  what i will read are some excerpts from the first part of the article .  it goes like this            that man  with his technical perfection  has failed to solve the great sociological problems of today is only the second immense tragedy that has come to the race .  the first  and perhaps the greater  was that  once  these same great sociological problems were solved  and yet these solutions were not permanent  because the technical perfection we have today did not then exist        it was a case of having bread without butter  or butter without bread .  n ever both together .  .  .  .         consider the hellenic world  from which our philosophy  our mathematics  our ethics  our art  our literature our entire culture  in fact stem .  .  . in the days of pericles  greece  like our own world in microcosm  was a surprisingly modem potpourri of conflicting ideologies and ways of life .  but then rome came  adopting the culture  but bestowing  and enforcing  peace .  to be sure  the pax romana lasted only two hundred years  but no like period has existed since .  .  .  .         war was abolished .  nationalism did not exist .  the roman citizen was empire wide .  paul of tarsus and flavius josephus were roman citizens .  spaniards  north africans  illyrians assumed the purple .  slavery existed  but it was an indiscriminate slavery  imposed as a punishment  incurred as the price of economic failure  brought on by the fortunes of war .  no man was a natural slave because of the color of his skin or the place of his birth .         religious toleration was complete .  if an exception was made early in the case of the christians  it was because they refused to accept the principle of toleration  because they insisted that only they themselves knew truth a principle abhorrent to the civilized roman .  .  .  .         with all of western culture under a single polis  with the cancer of religious and national particularism and exclusivism absent  with a high civilization in existence why could not man hold his gains .         it was because  technologically  ancient hellenism remained backward .  it was because without a machine civilization  the price of leisure and hence civilization and culture for the few  was slavery for the many .  because the civilization could not find the means to bring comfort and ease to all the population .         therefore  the depressed classes turned to the other world  and to religions which spurned the material benefits of this world so that science was made impossible in any true sense for over a millennium .  and further  as the initial impetus of hellenism waned  the empire lacked the technological powers to beat back the barbarians .  in fact  it was not till after      a . d .  that war became sufficiently a function of the industrial resources of a nation to enable the settled people to defeat invading tribesmen and nomads with ease .  .  .  .         imagine  then  if somehow the ancient greeks had learned just a hint of modem chemistry and physics .  imagine if the growth of the empire had been accompanied by the growth of science  technology and industry .  imagine an empire in which machinery replaced slaves  in which all men had a decent share of the world   s goods  in which the legion became the armored column against which no barbarians could stand .  imagine an empire which would therefore spread all over the world  without religious or national prejudices         an empire of all men all brothers eventually all free .  .  .  .          if history could be changed .  if that first great failure could have been prevented          and i stopped at that point .      well .     said the boss .      well     i said     i think it isn   t difficult to connect all that with the fact that tywood blew an entire power plant in his anxiety to send something back to the past  while in his office safe we found sections of a chemistry textbook translated into greek .      his face changed  while he considered .   then he said heavily     but nothing   s happened .         i know .  but then i   ve been told by tywood   s student that it takes a day to move back a century in time .  assuming that ancient greece was the target area  we have twenty centuries  hence twenty days .         but can it be stopped .         i wouldn   t know .  tywood might  but he   s dead .      the enormity of it all hit me at once  deeper than it had the night before   all humanity was virtually under sentence of death .  and while that was merely horrible abstraction  the fact that reduced it to a thoroughly unbearable reality was that i was  too .  and my wife  and my kid .   further  it was a death without precedence .  a ceasing to exist  and no more .  the passing of a breath .  the vanishing of a dream .  the drift into eternal non space and non time of a shadow .  i would not be dead at all  in fact i would merely never have been born .   or would i .  would i exist my individuality my ego my soul  if you like .  another life .  other circumstances .   i thought none of that in words then .  but if a cold knot in the stomach could ever speak under the circumstances  it would sound like that  i think .   the boss moved in on my thoughts hard .      then  we have about two and a half weeks .  no time to lose .  come on .      i grinned with one side of my mouth     what do we do .  chase the book .         no     he replied coldly     but there are two courses of action we must follow .  first  you may be wrong altogether .  all of this circumstantial reasoning may still represent a false lead  perhaps deliberately thrown before us  to cover up the real truth .  that must be checked .      secondly  you may be right but there may be some way of stopping the book  other than chasing it in a time machine  i mean .  if so  we must find out how .         i would just like to say  sir  if this is a false lead  only a madman would consider it a believable one .  so suppose i   m right  and suppose there   s no way of stopping it .         then  young fellow  i   m going to keep pretty busy for two and a half weeks  and i   d advise you to do the same .  the time will pass more quickly that way .      of course he was right .      where do we start .     i asked .      the first thing we need is a list of all men and women on the government payroll under tywood .         why .         reasoning .  your specialty  you know .  tywood doesn   t know greek  i think we can assume with fair safety  so someone else must have done the translating .  it isn   t likely that anyone would do a job like that for nothing  and it isn   t likely that tywood would payout of his personal funds not on a professor   s salary .         he might      i pointed out     have been interested in more secrecy than a government payroll affords .         why .  where was the danger .  is it a crime to translate a chemistry textbook into greek .  who would ever deduce from that a plot such as you   ve described .      it took us half an hour to turn up the name of mycroft james boulder  listed as    consultant      and to find out that he was mentioned in the university catalogue as assistant professor of philosophy and to check by telephone that among his many accomplishments was a thorough knowledge of attic greek .   which was a coincidence because with the boss reaching for his hat  the interoffice teletype clicked away and it turned out that mycroft james boulder was in the anteroom  at the end of a two hour continuing insistence that he see the boss .   the boss put his hat back and opened his office door .   professor mycroft james boulder was a gray man .  his hair was gray and his eyes were gray .  his suit was gray  too .   but most of all  his expression was gray  gray with a tension that seemed to twist at the lines in his thin face .   boulder said  softly     i   ve been trying for three days to get a hearing  sir  with a responsible man .  i can get no higher than yourself .         i may be high enough     said the boss .     what   s on your mind .         it is quite important that i be granted an interview with professor tywood .         do you know where he is .         i am quite certain that he is in government custody .         why .         because i know that he was planning an experiment which would entail the breaking of security regulations .  events since  as nearly as i can make them out  flow naturally from the supposition that security regulations have indeed been broken .  i can presume  then  that the experiment has at least been attempted .  i must discover whether it has been successfully concluded .         professor boulder     said the boss     i believe you can read greek .         yes  i can      coolly .      and have translated chemical texts for professor tywood on government money .         yes as a legally employed consultant .         yet such translation  under the circumstances  constitutes a crime  since it makes you an accessory to tywood   s crime .         you can establish a connection .         can   t you .  or haven   t you heard of tywood   s notions on time travel  or .  .  . what do you call it .  .  . micro temporal translation .         ah .     and boulder smiled a little .     he   s told you  then .         no  he hasn   t     said the boss  harshly .     professor tywood is dead .         what .     then    i don   t believe you .         he died of apoplexy .  look at this .      he had one of the photographs taken that first night in his wall safe .  tywood   s face was distorted but recognizable sprawled and dead .   boulder   s breath went in and out as if the gears were clogged .  he stared at the picture for three full minutes by the electric clock on the wall .     where is this place .     he asked .      the atomic power plant .          had he finished his experiment .      the boss shrugged     there   s no way of telling .  he was dead when we found him .      boulder   s lips were pinched and colorless .     that must be determined  somehow .  a commission of scientists must be established  and  if necessary  the experiment must be repeated      but the boss just looked at him  and reached for a cigar .  i   ve never seen him take longer and when he put it down  curled in its unused smoke  he said     tywood wrote an article for a magazine  twenty years ago         oh      and the professor   s lips twisted     is that what gave you your clue .  you may ignore that .  the man is only a physical scientist and knows nothing of either history or sociology .  a schoolboy   s dreams and nothing more .         then  you don   t think sending your translation back will inaugurate a golden age  do you .         of course not .  do you think you can graft the developments of two thousand years of slow labor onto a child society not ready for it .  do you think a great invention or a great scientific principle is born full grown in the mind of a genius divorced from his cultural milieu .  newton   s enunciation of the law of gravity was delayed for twenty years because the then current figure for the earth   s diameter was wrong by ten percent .  archimedes almost discovered calculus  but failed because arabic numerals  invented by some nameless hindu or group of hindus  were unknown to him .      for that matter  the mere existence of a slave society in ancient greece and rome meant that machines could scarcely attract much attention slaves being so much cheaper and more adaptable .  and men of true intellect could scarcely be expected to spend their energies on devices intended for manual labor .  even archimedes  the greatest engineer of antiquity  refused to publish any of his practical inventions only mathematic abstractions .  and when a young man asked plato of what use geometry was  he was forthwith expelled from the academy as a man with a mean  unphilosophic soul .      science does not plunge forward it inches along in the directions permitted by the greater forces that mold society and which are in turn molded by society .  and no great man advances but on the shoulders of the society that surrounds him      the boss interrupted him at that point .     suppose you tell us what your part in tywood   s work was  then .  we   ll take your word for it that history cannot be changed .         oh it can  but not purposefully you see  when tywood first requested my services in the matter of translating certain textbook passages into greek  i agreed for the money involved .  but he wanted the translation on parchment  he insisted on the use of ancient greek terminology the language of plato  to use his words regardless of how i had to twist the literal significance of passages  and he wanted it hand written in rolls .      i was curious .  i  too  found his magazine article .  it was difficult for me to jump to the obvious conclusion  since the achievements of modem science transcend the imaginings of philosophy in so many ways .  but i learned the truth eventually  and it was at once obvious that tywood   s theory of changing history was infantile .  there are twenty million variables for every instant of time  and no system of mathematics no mathematic psychohistory  to coin a phrase has yet been developed to handle that ocean of varying functions .      in short  any variation of events two thousand years ago would change all subsequent history  but in no predictable way .      the boss suggested  with a false quietness     like the pebble that starts the avalanche  right .         exactly .  you have some understanding of the situation  i see .  i thought deeply for weeks before i proceeded  and then i realized how i must act must act .      there was a low roar .  the boss stood up and his chair went over backward .  he swung around his desk  and he had a hand on boulder   s throat .  i was stepping out to stop him  but he waved me back   he was only tightening the necktie a little .  boulder could still breathe .  he had gone very white  and for all the time that the boss talked  he restricted himself to just that breathing .   and the boss said     sure  i can see how you decided you must act .  i know that some of you brain sick philosophers think the world needs fixing .  you want to throw the dice again and see what turns up .  maybe you don   t even care if you   re alive in the new setup or that no one can possibly know what you   ve done .  but you   re going to create  just the same .  you   re going to give god another chance  so to speak .      maybe i just want to live but the world could be worse .  in twenty million different ways  it could be worse .  a fellow named wilder once wrote a play called the skin of our teeth .  maybe you   ve read it .  its thesis was that mankind survived by just that skin of their teeth .  no  i   m not going to give you a speech about the ice age nearly wiping us out .  i don   t know enough .  i   m not even going to talk about the greeks winning at marathon  the arabs being defeated at tours  the mongols turning back at the last minute without even being defeated because i   m no historian .      but take the twentieth century .  the germans were stopped at the marne twice in world war i .  dunkirk happened in world war ii  and somehow the germans were stopped at moscow and stalingrad .  we could have used the atom bomb in the last war and we didn   t  and just when it looked as if both sides would have to  the great compromise happened just because general bruce was delayed in taking off from the ceylon airfield long enough to receive the message directly .  one after the other  just like that  all through history lucky breaks .  for every    if that didn   t come true that would have made wonder men of all of us if it had  there were twenty    ifs    that didn   t come true that would have brought disaster to all of us if they had .      you   re gambling on that one in twenty chance gambling every life on earth .  and you   ve succeeded  too  because tywood did send that text back .      he ground out that last sentence  and opened his fist  so that boulder could fall out and back into his chair .   and boulder laughed .      you fool      he gasped  bitterly     how close you can be and yet how widely you can miss the mark .  tywood did send his book back  then .  you are sure of that .         no chemical textbook in greek was found on the scene     said the boss  grimly     and millions of calories of energy had disappeared .  which doesn   t change the fact  however  that we have two and a half weeks in which to make things interesting for you .         oh  nonsense .  no foolish dramatics  please .  just listen to me  and try to understand .  there were greek philosophers once  named leucippus and democritus  who evolved an atomic theory .  all matter  they said  was composed of atoms .  varieties of atoms were distinct and changeless and by their different combinations with each other formed the various substances found in nature .  that theory was not the result of experiment or observation .  it came into being  somehow  full grown .      the didactic roman poet lucretius  in his    de rerum natura        on the nature of things    elaborated on that theory and throughout manages to sound startlingly modem .      in hellenistic times  hero built a steam engine and weapons of war became almost mechanized .  the period has been referred to as an abortive mechanical age  which came to nothing because  somehow  it neither grew out of nor fitted into its social and economic milieu .  alexandrian science was a queer and rather inexplicable phenomenon .      then one might mention the old roman legend about the books of the sibyl that contained mysterious information direct from the gods     in other words  gentlemen  while you are right that any change in the course of past events  however trifling  would have incalculable consequences  and while i also believe that you are right in supposing that any random change is much more likely to be for the worse than for the better  i must point out that you are nevertheless wrong in your final conclusions .      because this is the world in which the greek chemistry text was sent back .      this has been a red queen   s race  if you remember your    through the looking glass .     in the red queen   s country  one had to run as fast as one could merely to stay in the same place .  and so it was in this case .  tywood may have thought he was creating a new world  but it was i who prepared the translations  and i took care that only such passages as would account for the queer scraps of knowledge the ancients apparently got from nowhere would be included     and my only intention  for all my racing  was to stay in the same place .      three weeks passed  three months  three years .  nothing happened .  when nothing happens  you have no proof .  we gave up trying to explain  and we ended  the boss and i  by doubting it ourselves .   the case never ended .  boulder could not be considered a criminal without being considered a world savior as well  and vice versa .  he was ignored .  and in the end  the case was neither solved  nor closed out  merely put in a file all by itself  under the designation     .     and buried in the deepest vault in washington .   the boss is in washington now  a big wheel .  and i   m regional head of the bureau .   boulder is still assistant professor  though .  promotions are slow at the university .     the end       the red queen   s race     my fifty eighth story  was the first to be written by dr .  asimov .     in september i began another story     mother earth     and submitted it to campbell on october          .  after a comparatively small revision of the ending  he took that one  too .       mother earth        but can you be certain .  are you sure that even a professional historian can always distinguish between victory and defeat .      gustav stein  who delivered himself of that mocking question with a whiskered smile and a gentle wipe at the gray mustache from the neighborhood of which he had just removed an empty glass  was not an historian .  he was a physiologist .   but his companion was an historian  and he accepted the gentle thrust with a smile of his own .   stein   s apartment was  for earth  quite luxurious .  it lacked the empty privacy of the outer worlds  of course  since from its window there stretched outward a phenomenon that belonged only to the home planet a city .  a large city  full of people  rubbing shoulders  mingling sweat  nor was stein   s apartment fitted with its own power and its own utility supply .  it lacked even the most elementary quota of positronic robots .  in short  it lacked the dignity of self sufficiency  and like all things on earth  it was merely part of a community  a pendant unit of a cluster  a portion of a mob .   but stein was an earthman by birth and used to it .  and after all  by earth standards the apartment was still luxurious .   it was just that looking outward through the same windows before which lay the city  one could see the stars and among them the outer worlds  where there were no cities but only gardens  where the lawns were streaks of emerald  where all human beings were kings  and where all good earthmen earnestly and vainly hoped to go some day .   except for a few who knew better like gustav stein .     the friday evenings with edward field belonged to that class of ritual which comes with age and quiet life .  it broke the week pleasantly for two elderly bachelors  and gave them an innocuous reason to linger over the sherry and the stars .  it took them away from the crudities of life  and  most of all  it let them talk .   field  especially  as a lecturer  scholar and man of modest means quoted chapter and verse from his still uncompleted history of terrestrian empire .      i wait for the last act      he explained .     then i can call it the    decline and fall of empire    and publish it .         you must expect the last act to come soon  then .         in a sense  it has come already .  it is just that it is best to wait for all to recognize that fact .  you see  there are three times when an empire or an economic system or a social institution falls  you skeptic      field paused for effect and waited patiently for stein to say      and those times are .         first     field ticked off a right forefinger     there is the time when just a little nub shows up that points an inexorable way to finality .  it can   t be seen or recognized until the finality arrives  when the original nub becomes visible to hindsight .         and you can tell what that little nub is .         i think so  since i already have the advantage of a century and a half of hindsight .  it came when the sirian sector colony  aurora  first obtained permission of the central government at earth to introduce positronic robots into their community life .  obviously  looking back at it  the road was clear for the development of a thoroughly mechanized society based upon robot labor and not human labor .  and it is this mechanization that has been and will yet be the deciding factor in the struggle between the outer worlds and earth .         it is .     murmured the physiologist .     how infernally clever you historians are .  what and where is the second time the empire fell .         the second point in time     and field gently bent his right middle finger backward     arrives when a signpost is raised for the expert so large and plain that it can be seen even without the aid of perspective .  and that point has been passed  too  with the first establishment of an immigration quota against earth by the outer worlds .  the fact that earth found itself unable to prevent an action so obviously detrimental to itself was a shout for all to hear  and that was fifty years ago .         better and better .  and the third point .         the third point .     down went the ring finger .     that is the least important .  that is when the signpost becomes a wall with a huge    the end    scrawled upon it .  the only requirement for knowing that the end has come  then  is neither perspective nor training  but merely the ability to listen to the video .         i take it that the third point in time has not yet come .         obviously not  or you would not need to ask .  yet it may come soon  for instance  if there is war .         do you think there will be .      field avoided commitment .     times are unsettled  and a good deal of futile emotion is sweeping earth on the immigration question .  and if there should be a war  earth would be defeated quickly and lastingly  and the wall would be erected .         can you be certain .  are you sure that even a professional historian can always distinguish between victory and defeat .      field smiled .  he said     you may know something i do not .  for instance  they talk about something called the    pacific project .             i never heard of it .     stein refilled the two glasses     let us speak of other things .      he held up his glass to the broad window so that the far stars flickered rosily in the clear liquid and said     to a happy ending to earth   s troubles .      field held up his own     to the pacific project .      stein sipped gently and said     but we drink to two different things .         do we .        it is quite difficult to describe any of the outer worlds to a native earthman  since it is not so much a description of a world that is required as a description of a state of mind .  the outer worlds some fifty of them  originally colonies  later dominions  later nations differ extremely among themselves in a physical sense .  but the state of mind is somewhat the same throughout .   it is something that grows out of a world not originally congenial to mankind  yet populated by the cream of the difficult  the different  the daring  the deviant .   if it is to be expressed in a word  that word is    individuality .      there is the world of aurora  for instance  three parsecs from earth .  it was the first planet settled outside the solar system  and represented the dawn of interstellar travel .  hence its name .   it had air and water to start with  perhaps  but on earthly standards it was rocky and infertile .  the plant life that did exist  sustained by a yellow green pigment completely unrelated to chlorophyll and not as efficient  gave the comparatively fertile regions a decidedly bilious and unpleasant appearance to unaccustomed eyes .  no animal life higher than unicellular  and the equivalent of bacteria as well  were present .  nothing dangerous  naturally  since the two biological systems  of earth and aurora  were chemically unrelated .   aurora became  quite gradually  a patchwork .  grains and fruit trees came first  shrubs  flowers  and grass afterward .  herds of livestock followed .  and  as if it were necessary to prevent too close a copy of the mother planet  positronic robots also came to build the mansions  carve the landscapes  lay the power units .  in short  to do the work  and turn the planet green and human .   there was the luxury of a new world and unlimited mineral resources .  there was the splendid excess of atomic power laid out on new foundations with merely thousands  or  at most  millions  not billions  to service .  there was the vast flowering of physical science  in worlds where there was room for it .   take the home of franklin maynard  for instance  who  with his wife  three children  and twenty seven robots  lived on an estate more than forty miles away  in distance  from the nearest neighbor .  yet by community wave he could  if he wished  share the living room of any of the seventy five million on aurora with each singly  with all simultaneously .   maynard knew every inch of his valley .  he knew just where it ended  sharply  and gave way to the alien crags  along whose undesirable slopes the angular  sharp leaves of the native furze clung sullenly as if in hatred of the softer matter that had usurped its place in the sun .   maynard did not have to leave that valley .  he was a deputy in the gathering  and a member of the foreign agents committee  but he could transact all business but the most extremely essential  by community wave  without ever sacrificing that precious privacy he had to have in a way no earthman could understand .   even the present business could be performed by community wave .  the man  for instance  who sat with him in his living room  was charles hijkman  and he  actually  was sitting in his own living room on an island in an artificial lake stocked with fifty varieties of fish  which happened to be twenty five hundred miles distant  in space .   the connection was an illusion  of course .  if maynard were to reach out a hand  he could feel the invisible wall .   even the robots were quite accustomed to the paradox  and when hijkman raised a hand for a cigarette  maynard   s robot made no move to satisfy the desire  though a half minute passed before hijkman   s own robot could do so .   the two men spoke like outer worlders  that is  stiffly and in syllables too clipped to be friendly  and yet certainly not hostile .  merely undefinably lacking in the cream however sour and thin at times of human sociability which is so forced upon the inhabitants of earth   s ant heaps .   maynard said     i have long wanted a private communion  hijkman .  my duties in the gathering  this year         quite .  that is understood .  you are welcome now  of course .  in fact  especially so  since i have heard of the superior nature of your grounds and landscaping .  is it true that your cattle are fed on imported grass .         i   m afraid that is a slight exaggeration .  actually  certain of my best milkers feed on terrestrial imports during calving time  but such a procedure would be prohibitively expensive  i   m afraid  if made general .  it yields quite extraordinary milk  however .  may i have the privilege of sending you a day   s output .         it would be most kind of you .     hijkman bent his head  gravely .     you must receive some of my salmon in return .      to a terrestrial eye  the two men might have appeared much alike .  both were tall  though not unusually so for aurora  where the average height of the adult male is six feet one and one half inches .  both were blond and hard muscled  with sharp and pronounced features .  though neither was younger than forty  middle age as yet sat lightly upon them .   so much for amenities .  without a change in tone  maynard proceeded to the serious purpose of his call .   he said     the committee  you know  is now largely engaged with moreanu and his conservatives .  we would like to deal with them firmly  we of the independents  that is .  but before we can do so with the requisite calm and certainty  i would like to ask you certain questions .         why me .         because you are aurora   s most important physicist .     modesty is an unnatural attitude  and one which is only with difficulty taught to children .  in an individualistic society it is useless and hijkman was  therefore  unencumbered with it .  he simply nodded objectively at maynard   s last words .      and     continued maynard        as one of us .  you are an independent .         i am a member of the party .  dues paying  but not very active .         nevertheless safe .  now  tell me  have you heard of the pacific project .         the pacific project .     there was a polite inquiry in his words .      it is something which is taking place on earth .  the pacific is a terrestrial ocean  but the name itself probably has no significance .         i have never heard of it .         i am not surprised .  few have  even on earth .  our communion  by the way  is via tight beam and nothing must go further .         i understand .         whatever pacific project is and our agents are extremely vague  it might conceivably be a menace .  many of those who on earth pass for scientists seem to be connected with it .  also  some of earth   s more radical and foolish politicians .         hm m m .  there was once something called the manhattan project .         yes     urged maynard     what about it .         oh  it   s an ancient thing .  it merely occurred to me because of the analogy in names .  the manhattan project was before the time of extra terrestrial travel .  some petty war in the dark ages occurred  and it was the name given to a group of scientists who developed atomic power .         ah     maynard   s hand became a fist     and what do you think the pacific project can do  then .      hijkman considered .  then  softly     do you think earth is planning war .      on maynard   s face there was a sudden expression of distaste .     six billion people .  six billion half apes  rather  jammed into one system to a near explosion point  facing only some millions of us  total .  don   t you think it is a dangerous situation .         oh  numbers .         all right .  are we safe despite the numbers .  tell me .  i   m only an administrator  and you   re a physicist .  can earth win a war in any way .      hijkman sat solemnly in his chair and thought carefully and slowly .  then he said     let us reason .  there are three broad classes of methods whereby an individual or group can gain his ends against opposition .  on an increasing level of subtlety  those three classes can be termed the physical  the biological  and the psychological .      now  the physical can be easily eliminated .  earth does not have an industrial background .  it does not have a technical know how .  it has very limited resources .  it lacks even a single outstanding physical scientist .  so it is as impossible as anything in the galaxy can be that they can develop any form of physico chemical application that is not already known to the outer worlds .  provided  of course  that the conditions of the problem imply single handed opposition on the part of earth against any or all of the outer worlds .  i take it that none of the outer worlds intends leaguing with earth against us .      maynard indicated violent opposition even to the suggestion     no  no  no .  there is no question of that .  put it out of your mind .         then  ordinary physical surprise weapons are inconceivable .  it is useless to discuss it further .         then  what about your second class  the biological .      slowly  hijkman lifted his eyebrows     now  that is less certain .  some terrestrial biologists are quite competent  i am told .  naturally  since i am myself a physicist  i am not entirely qualified to judge this .  yet i believe that in certain restricted fields  they are still expert .  in agricultural science  of course  to give an obvious example .  and in bacteriology .  um m m         yes  what about bacteriological warfare .         a thought .  but no  no  quite inconceivable .  a teeming  constricted world such as earth cannot afford to fight an open latticework of fifty sparse worlds with germs .  they are infinitely more subject to epidemics  that is  to retaliation in kind .  in fact  i would say that given our living conditions here on aurora and on the other outer worlds  no contagious disease could really take hold .  no  maynard .  you can check with a bacteriologist  but i think he   ll tell you the same .      maynard said     and the third class .         the psychological .  now  that is unpredictable .  and yet the outer worlds are intelligent and healthy communities and not amenable to ordinary propaganda  or for that matter to any form of unhealthy emotionalism .  now  i wonder         yes .         what if the pacific project is just that .  i mean  a huge device to keep us off balance .  something top secret  but meant to leak out in just the right fashion  so that the outer worlds yield a little to earth .  simply in order to play safe .      there was a longish silence .      impossible     burst out maynard  angrily .      you react properly .  you hesitate .  but i don   t seriously press the interpretation .  it is merely a thought .      a longer silence  then hijkman spoke again      are there any other questions .      maynard started out of a reverie     no .  .  . no      the wave broke off and a wall appeared where space had been a moment before .   slowly  with stubborn disbelief  franklin maynard shook his head .     ernest keilin mounted the stairs with a feeling for all the past centuries .  the building was old  cobwebbed with history .  it once housed the parliament of man  and from it words went out that clanged throughout the stars .   it was a tall building .  it soared stretched strained .  out and up to the stars  it reached  to the stars that had now turned away .   it no longer even housed the parliament of earth .  that had now been switched to a newer  neoclassical building  one that imperfectly aped the architectural stylisms of the ancient pre atomic age .   yet the older building still held its great name .  officially  it was still stellar house  but it only housed the functionaries of a shriveled bureaucracy now .   keilin got out at the twelfth floor  and the lift dropped quickly down behind him .  the radiant sign said smoothly and quietly  bureau of information .  he handed a letter to the receptionist .  he waited .  and eventually  he passed through the door which said     l .  z .  cellioni secretary of information .      cellioni was little and dark .  his hair was thick and black  his mustache thin and black .  his teeth  when he smiled  were startlingly white and even so he smiled often .   he was smiling now  as he rose and held out his hand .  keilin took it  then an offered seat  then an offered cigar .   cellioni said     i am very happy to see you  mr .  keilin .  it is kind of you to fly here from new york on such short notice .      keilin curved the corners of his lips down and made a tiny gesture with one hand  deprecating the whole business     and now     continued cellioni     i presume you would like an explanation of all this .         i wouldn   t refuse one     said keilin .      unfortunately  it is difficult to know exactly how to explain .  as secretary of information  my position is difficult .  i must safeguard the security and well being of earth and  at the same time  observe our traditional freedom of the press .  naturally  and fortunately  we have no censorship  but just as naturally  there are times when we could almost wish we did have .         is this     asked keilin     with reference to me .  about censorship  i mean .      cellioni did not answer directly .  instead  he smiled again  slowly  and with a remarkable absence of joviality .   he said     you  mr .  keilin  have one of the most widely heard and influential talecasts on the video .  therefore  you are of peculiar interest to the government .         the time is mine     said keilin  stubbornly .     i pay for it i pay taxes on the income i derive from it i adhere to all the common law rulings on taboos .  so i don   t quite see of what interest i can be to the government .         oh  you misunderstand me .  it   s my fault  i suppose  for not being clearer .  you have committed no crime  broken no laws .  i have only admiration for your journalistic ability .  what i refer to is your editorial attitude at times .         with respect to what .         with respect     said cellioni  with a sudden harshness about his thin lips     to our policy toward the outer worlds .         my editorial attitude represents what i feel and think  mr .  secretary .         i allow this .  you have your right to your feelings and your thoughts .  yet it is injudicious to spread them about nightly to an audience of half a billion .         injudicious  according to you  perhaps .  but legal  according to anybody .         it is sometimes necessary to place good of country above a strict and selfish interpretation of legality .      keilin tapped his foot twice and frowned blackly .      look     he said     put this frankly .  what is it you want .      the secretary of information spread his hands out before him .     in a word co operation .  really  mr .  keilin  we can   t have you weakening the will of the people .  do you appreciate the position of earth .  six billions  and a declining food supply .  it is insupportable .  and emigration is the only solution .  no patriotic earthman can fail to see the justice of our position .  no reasonable human being anywhere can fail to see the justice of it .      keilin said     i agree with your premise that the population problem is serious  but emigration is not the only solution .  in fact  emigration is the one sure way of hastening destruction .         really .  and why do you say that .         because the outer worlds will not permit emigration  and you can force their hand by war only .  and we cannot win a war .         tell me     said cellioni softly     have you ever tried emigrating .  it seems to me you could qualify .  you are quite tall  rather light haired  intelligent      the video man hushed .  he said  curtly     i have hay fever .         well     and the secretary smiled     then you must have good reason for disapproving their arbitrary genetic and racist policies .      keilin replied with heat     i won   t be influenced by personal motives .  i would disapprove their policies  if i qualified perfectly for emigration .  but my disapproval would alter nothing .  their policies are their policies  and they can enforce them .  moreover  their policies have some reason even if wrong .  mankind is starting again on the outer worlds  and they the ones who got there first would like to eliminate some of the haws of the human mechanism that have become obvious with time .  a hay fever sufferer is a bad egg genetically .  a cancer prone even more so .  their prejudices against skin and hair colors are  of course  senseless  but i can grant that they are interested in uniformity and homogeneity .  and as for earth  we can do much even without the help of the outer worlds .         for instance  what .         positronic robots and hydroponic farming should be introduced  and most of all birth control must be instituted .  an intelligent birth control  that is  based on firm psychiatric principles intended to eliminate the psychotic trends  congenital infirmities         as they do in the outer worlds         not at all .  i have mentioned no racist principles .  i talk only of mental and physical infirmities that are held in common by all ethnic and racial groups .  and most of all  births must be held below deaths until a healthful equilibrium is reached .      cellioni said  grimly     we lack the industrial techniques and the resources to introduce a robot hydroponic technology in anything less than five centuries .  furthermore  the traditions of earth  as well as current ethical beliefs  forbid robot labor and false foods .  most of all  they forbid the slaughter of unborn children .  now  come  keilin  we can   t have you pouring this out over video .  it won   t work  it distracts the attention  it weakens the will .      keilin broke in  impatiently     mr .  secretary  do you want war .         do i want war .  that is an impudent question .         then  who are the policy makers in the government who do want war .  for instance  who is responsible for the calculated rumor of the pacific project .         the pacific project .  and where did you hear of that .         my sources are my secret .         then  i   ll tell you .  you heard of this pacific project from moreanu of aurora on his recent trip to earth .  we know more about you than you suppose  mr .  keilin .         i believe that  but i do not admit that i received information from moreanu .  why do you think i could get information from him .  is it because he was deliberately allowed to learn of this piece of trumpery .         trumpery .         yes .  i think pacific project is a fake .  a fake meant to inspire confidence .  i think the government plans to let the so called secret leak out in order to strengthen its war policy .  it is part of a war of nerves on earth   s own people  and it will be the ruin of earth in the end .         and i will take this theory of mine to the people .         you will not  mr .  keilin     said cellioni  quietly .      i will .         mr .  keilin  your friend  ion moreanu is having his troubles on aurora  perhaps for being too friendly with you .  take care that you do not have equal trouble for being too friendly with him .         i   m not worried .     the video man laughed shortly  lunged to his feet and strode to the door .   keilin smiled very gently when he found the door blocked by two large men     you mean  i am under arrest right now .         exactly     said cellioni .      on what charge .         we   ll think of some later .      keilin left under escort .     on aurora  the mirror image of the afore described events was taking place  and on a larger scale .   the foreign agents committee of the gathering had been meeting now for days ever since the session of the gathering in which ion moreanu and his conservative party made their great bid to force a vote of no confidence .  that it had failed was in part due to the superior political generalship of the independents  and in some part due to the activity of this same foreign agents committee .   for months now  the evidence had been accumulating  and when the vote of confidence turned out to be sizably in favor of the independents  the committee was able to strike in its own way .   moreanu was subpoenaed in his own home  and placed under house arrest .  although this procedure of house arrest was not  under the circumstances  legal a fact emphatically pointed out by moreanu it was nevertheless successfully accomplished .   for three days moreanu was cross examined thoroughly  in polite  even tones that scarcely ever veered from unemotional curiosity .  the seven inquisitors of the committee took turns in questioning  but moreanu had respite only for ten minute intervals during the hours in which the committee sat .   after three days  he showed the effects .  he was hoarse with demanding that he be faced with his accusers  weary with insisting that he be informed of the exact nature of the charges  throat broken with shouting against the illegality of the procedure .   the committee finally read statements at him      is this true or not .  is this true or not .      moreanu could merely shake his head wearily as the structure spidered about him .   he challenged the competency of the evidence and was smoothly informed that the proceedings constituted a committee investigation and not a trial  the chairman clapped his gavel  finally .  he was a broad man of tremendous purpose .  he spoke for an hour in his final summing up of the results of the inquiry  but only a relatively short portion of it need be quoted .   he said     if you had merely conspired with others on aurora  we could understand you  even forgive you .  such a fault would have been held in common with many ambitious men in history .  it is not that at all .  what horrifies us and removes all pity is your eagerness to consort with the disease ridden  ignorant and subhuman remnants of earth .      you  the accused  stand here under a heavy weight of evidence showing you to have conspired with the worst elements of earth   s mongrel population      the chairman was interrupted by an agonized cry from moreanu     but the motive .  what motive can you possibly attribute      the accused was pulled back into his seat .  the chairman pursed his lips and departed from the slow gravity of his prepared speech to improvise a bit .      it is not     he said     for this committee to go into your motives .  we have shown the facts of the case .  the committee does have evidence     he paused  and looked along the line of the members to the right and the left  then continued .     i think i may say that the committee has evidence that points to your intentions to use earth man power to engineer a coup that would leave you dictator over aurora .  but since the evidence has not been used  i will go no further into that  except to say that such a consummation is not inconsistent with your character as displayed at these hearings .      he went back to his speech .     those of us who sit here have heard  i think  of something termed the    pacific project     which  according to rumors  represents an attempt on the part of earth to retrieve its lost dominions .      it is needless to emphasize here that any such attempt must be doomed to failure .  and yet defeat for us is not entirely inconceivable .  one thing can cause us to stumble  and that one thing is an unsuspected internal weakness .  genetics is  after all  still an imperfect science .  even with twenty generations behind us  undesirable traits may crop up at scattered points  and each represents a flaw in the steel shield of aurora   s strength .      that is the pacific project the use of our own criminals and traitors against us  and if they can find such in our inner councils  the earthmen might even succeed .      the foreign agents committee exists to combat that threat .  in the accused  we touch the fringes of the web .  we must go on      the speech did  at any rate .   when it was concluded  moreanu  pale  wide eyed  pounded his fist     i demand my say         the accused may speak      said the chairman .   moreanu rose and looked about him for a long moment .  the room  fitted for an audience of seventy five million by community wave  was unattended .  there were the inquisitors  legal staff  official recorders and with him  in the actual flesh  his guards .   he would have done better with an audience .  to whom could he otherwise appeal .  his glance fled hopelessly from each face it touched  but could find nothing better .      first     he said     i deny the legality of this meeting .  my constitutional rights of privacy and individuality have been denied .  i have been tried by a group without standing as a court  by individuals convinced  in advance  of my guilt .  i have been denied adequate opportunity to defend myself .  in fact  i have been treated throughout as an already convicted criminal requiring only sentence .      i deny  completely and without reservation  that i have been engaged in any activity detrimental to the state or tending to subvert any of its fundamental institutions .      i accuse  vigorously and unreservedly  this committee of deliberately using its powers to win political battles .  i am guilty not of treason  but of disagreement .  i disagree with a policy dedicated to the destruction of the larger part of the human race for reasons that are trivial and inhumane .      rather than destruction  we owe assistance to these men who are condemned to a harsh  unhappy life solely because it was our ancestors and not theirs who happened to reach the outer worlds first .  with our technology and resources  they can yet re create and redevelop      the chairman   s voice rose above the intense near whisper of moreanu     you are out of order .  the committee is quite prepared to hear any remarks you make in your own defense  but a sermon on the rights of earthmen is outside the legitimate realm of the discussion .      the hearings were formally closed .  it was a great political victory for the independents  all would agree to that .  of the members of the committee  only franklin maynard was not completely satisfied .  a small  nagging doubt remained .   he wondered   should he try  one last time .  should he speak once more and then no more to that queer little monkey ambassador from earth .  he made his decision quickly and acted upon it instantly .  only a pause to arrange a witness  since even for himself an unwitnessed private communion with an earthman might be dangerous .     luiz moreno  ambassador to aurora from earth  was  to put not too fine a point on it  a miserable figure of a man .  and that wasn   t exactly an accident .  on the whole  the foreign diplomats of earth tended to be dark  short  wizen  or weakly or all four .   that was only self protection  since the outer worlds exerted strong attraction for any earthman .  diplomats exposed to the allure of aurora  for instance  could not but be exceedingly reluctant to return to earth .  worse  and more dangerous  exposure meant a growing sympathy with the demigods of the stars and a growing alienation from the slum dwellers of earth .   unless  of course  the ambassador found himself rejected .  unless he found himself somewhat despised .  and then  no more faithful servant of earth could be imagined  no man less subject to corruption .   the ambassador to earth was only five foot two  with a bald head and receding forehead  a pinkish affectation of beard and red rimmed eyes .  he was suffering from a slight cold  the occasional results whereof he smothered in a handkerchief .  and yet  withal  he was a man of intellect .   to franklin maynard  the sight and sound of the earthman was distressing .  he grew queasy at each cough and shuddered when the ambassador wiped his nose .   maynard said     your excellency  we commune at my request because i wish to inform you that the gathering has decided to ask your recall by your government .         that is kind of you  councilor .  i had an inkling of this .  and for what reason .         the reason is not within the bounds of discussion .  i believe it is the prerogative of a sovereign state to decide for itself whether a foreign representative shall be persona grata or not .  nor do i think you really need enlightenment on this matter .         very well  then .     the ambassador paused to wield his handkerchief and murmur an apology .     is that all .      maynard said     not quite .  there are matters i would like to mention .  remain .      the ambassador   s reddened nostrils flared a bit  but he smiled  and said     an honor .         your world  excellency     said maynard  superciliously     displays a certain belligerence of late that we on aurora find most annoying and unnecessary .  i trust that you will find your return to earth at this point a convenient opportunity to use your influence against further displays such as recently occurred in new york  where two aurorans were manhandled by a mob .  the payment of an indemnity may not be enough the next time .         but that is emotional overflow  councilor maynard .  surely  you cannot consider youngsters shouting in the streets to be adequate representations of belligerence .         it is backed by your government   s actions in many ways .  the recent arrest of mr .  ernest keilin  for instance .         which is a purely domestic affair     said the ambassador  quietly .      but not one to demonstrate a reasonable spirit toward the outer worlds .  keilin was one of the few earthmen who until recently could yet make their voices heard .  he was intelligent enough to realize that no divine right protects the inferior man simply because he is inferior .      the ambassador arose     i am not interested in auroran theories on racial differences .         a moment .  your government may realize that much of their plans have gone awry with the arrest of your agent  moreanu .  stress the fact that we of aurora are much wiser than we have been prior to this arrest .  it may serve to give them pause .         is moreanu my agent .  really  councilor  if i am disaccredited  i shall leave .  but surely the loss of diplomatic immunity does not affect my personal immunity as an honest man from charges of espionage .         isn   t that your job .         do aurorans take it for granted that espionage and diplomacy are identical .  my government will be glad to hear it .  we shall take appropriate precautions .         then  you defend moreanu .  you deny that he has been working for earth .         i defend only myself .  as to moreanu  i am not stupid enough to say anything .         why stupid .         wouldn   t a defense by myself be but another indictment against him .  i neither accuse nor defend him .  your government   s quarrel with moreanu  like my government   s with keilin whom you  by the way  are most suspiciously eager to defend is an internal affair .  i will leave now .      the communion broke  and almost instantly the wall faded again .  hijkman was looking thoughtfully at maynard .      what do you think of him .     asked maynard  grimly .      disgraceful that such a travesty of humanity should walk aurora  i think .         i agree with you  and yet .  .  . and yet         well .         and yet i can almost find myself able to think that he is the master and that we dance to his piping .  you know of moreanu .         of course .         well  he will be convicted  sent to an asteroid .  his party will be broken .  offhand  anyone would say that such actions represent a horrible defeat for earth .         is there doubt in your mind that such is the case .         i   m not sure .  committee chairman bond insisted on airing his theory that pacific project was the name earth gave to a device for using internal traitors on the outer worlds .  but i don   t think so .  i   m not sure the facts fit that .  for instance  where did we get our evidence against moreanu .         i certainly can   t say .         our agents  in the first place .  but how did they get it .  the evidence was a little too convincing .  moreanu could have guarded himself better      maynard hesitated .  he seemed to be attempting a blush  and failing .     well  to put it quickly  i think it was the terrestrian ambassador who somehow presented us with the most evidence .  i think that he played on moreanu   s sympathy for earth first to befriend him and then to betray him .         why .         i don   t know .  to insure war  perhaps with this pacific project waiting for us .         i don   t believe it .         i know .  i have no proof .  nothing but suspicion .  the committee wouldn   t believe me either .  it seemed to me  perhaps  that a last talk with the ambassador might reveal something  but his mere appearance antagonizes me  and i find i spend most of my time trying to remove him from my sight .         well  you are becoming emotional  my friend .  it is a disgusting weakness .  i hear that you have been appointed a delegate to the interplanetary gathering at hesperus .  i congratulate you .         thanks     said maynard  absently .     luiz moreno  ex ambassador to aurora  had been glad to return to earth .  he was away from the artificial landscapes that seemed to have no life of their own  but to exist only by virtue of the strong will of their possessors .  away from the too beautiful men and women and from their ubiquitous  brooding robots .   he was back to the hum of life and the shuffle of feet  the brushing of shoulders and the feeling of breath in the face .   not that he was able to enjoy these sensations entirely .  the first days had been spent in lively conferences with the heads of earth   s government .   in fact  it was not till nearly a week had passed  that an hour came in which he could consider himself truly relaxed .   he was in the rarest of all appurtenances of terrestrial luxury a roof garden .  with him was gustav stein  the quite obscure physiologist  who was  nevertheless  one of the prime movers of the plan  known to rumor as the pacific project .      the confirmatory tests     said moreno  with an almost dreadful satisfaction     all check so far  do they not .         so far .  only so far .  we have miles to go .         yet they will continue to go well .  to one who has lived on aurora for nearly a year  as i have  there can be no doubt but that we   re on the right track .         um m m .  nevertheless  i will go only by the laboratory reports .         and quite rightly .     his little body was almost stiff with gloating .     some day  it will be different .  stein  you have not met these men  these outer worlders .  you may have come across the tourists  perhaps  in their special hotels  or riding through the streets in inclosed cars  equipped with the purest of private  air conditioned atmospheres for their well bred nostrils  observing the sights through a movable periscope and shuddering away from the touch of an earthman .      but you have not met them on their own world  secure in their own sickly  rotting greatness .  go  stein  and be despised a while .  go  and find how well you can compete with their own trained lawns as something to be gently trod upon .      and yet  when i pulled the proper cords  ion moreanu fell ion moreanu  the only man among them with the capacity to understand the workings of another   s mind .  it is the crisis that we have passed now .  we front a smooth path now .      satisfaction .  satisfaction .      as for keilin     he said suddenly  more to himself than to stein     he can be turned loose now .  there   s little he can say  hereafter  that can endanger anything .  in fact  i have an idea .  the interplanetary conference opens on hesperus within the month .  he can be sent to report the meeting .  it will be an earnest of our friendliness and keep him away for the summer .  i think it can be arranged .      it was .   of all the outer worlds  hesperus was the smallest  the latest settled  the furthest from earth .  hence the name .  in a physical sense  it was not best suited to a great diplomatic gathering  since its facilities were small .  for instance  the available community wave network could not possibly be stretched to cover all the delegates  secretarial staff  and administrators necessary in a convocation of fifty planets .  so meetings in person were arranged in buildings impressed for the purpose .   yet there was a symbolism in the choice of meeting place that escaped practically nobody .  hesperus  of all the worlds  was furthest removed from earth .  but the spatial distance one hundred parsecs or more was the least of it .  the important point was that hesperus had been colonized not by earthmen  but by men from the outer world of faunus .   it was therefore of the second generation  and so it had no    mother earth .     earth to it was but a vague grandmother  lost in the stars .   as is usual in all such gatherings  little work is actually done on the session floors .  that space is reserved for the official soundings of whatever is primarily intended for home ears .  the actual swapping and horse trading takes place in the lobbies and at the lunch tables and many an irresolvable conflict has softened over the soup and vanished over the nuts .   and yet particular difficulties were present in this particular case .  not in all worlds was the community wave as paramount and all pervading as it was on aurora  but it was prominent in all .  it was  therefore  with a certain sense of outrage and loss that the tall  dignified men found it necessary to approach one another in the flesh  without the comforting privacy of the invisible wall between  without the warm knowledge of the breakswitch at their fingertips .   they faced one another in uneasy semi embarrassment and tried not to watch one another eat  tried not to shrink at the unmeant touch .  even robot service was rationed .   ernest keilin  the only accredited video representative from earth  was aware of some of these matters only in the vague way they are described here .  a more precise insight he could not have .  nor could anyone brought up in a society where human beings exist only in the plural  and where a house need only be deserted to be feared .   so it was that certain of the most subtle tensions escaped him at the formal dinner party given by the hesperian government during the third week of the conference .  other tensions  however  did not pass him by .   the gathering after the dinner naturally fell apart into little groups .  keilin joined the one that contained franklin maynard of aurora .  as the delegate of the largest of the worlds  he was naturally the most newsworthy .   maynard was speaking casually between sips at the tawny hesperian cocktail in his hand .  if his flesh crawled slightly at the closeness of the others  he masked the feeling masterfully .      earth     he said     is  in essence  helpless against us if we avoid unpredictable military adventures .  economic unity is actually a necessity  if we intend to avoid such adventures .  let earth realize to how great an extent her economy depends upon us  on the things that we alone can supply her  and there will be no more talk of living space .  and if we are united  earth would never dare attack .  she will exchange her barren longings for atomic motors or not  as she pleases .      and he turned to regard keilin with a certain hauteur as the other found himself stung to comment      but your manufactured goods  councilor i mean those you ship to earth they are not given us .  they are exchanged for agricultural products .      maynard smiled silkily .     yes  i believe the delegate from tethys has mentioned that fact at length .  there is a delusion prevalent among some of us that only terrestrial seeds grow properly      he was interrupted calmly by another  who said     now  i am not from tethys  but what you mention is not a delusion .  i grow rye on rhea  and i have never yet been able to duplicate terrestrial bread .  it just hasn   t got the same taste .     he addressed the audience in general     in fact  i imported half a dozen terrestrians five years back on agricultural laborer visas so they could oversee the robots .  now  they can do wonders with the land  you know .  where they spit  corn grows fifteen feet high .  well  that helped a little .  and using terrestrian seed helped .  but even if you grow terrestrian grain  its seed won   t hold the next year .         has your soil been tested by your government   s agricultural department .     asked maynard .   the rhean grew haughty in his turn     no better soil in the sector .  and the rye is top grade .  i even sent a hundredweight down to earth for nutritional clearance  and it came back with full marks .     he rubbed one side of his chin  thoughtfully     it   s flavor i   m talking about .  doesn   t seem to have the right      maynard made an effort to dismiss him     flavor is dispensable temporarily .  they   ll be coming to us on our terms  these little men hordes of earth  when they feel the pinch .  we give up only this mysterious flavor  but they will have to give up atom powered engines  farm machinery  and ground cars .  it wouldn   t be a bad idea  in fact  to attempt to get along without the terrestrian flavors you are so concerned about .  let us appreciate the flavor of our home grown products instead which could stand comparison if we gave it a chance .         that so .     the rhean smiled .     i notice you   re smoking earthgrown tobacco .         a habit i can break if i have to .         probably by giving up smoking .  i wouldn   t use outer world tobacco for anything but killing mosquitoes .      he laughed a trifle too boisterously  and left the group .  maynard stared after him  a little pinch nosed .   to keilin  the little byplay over rye and tobacco brought a certain satisfaction .  he regarded such personalities as the tiny reflection of certain galactopolitical realities .  tethys and rhea were the largest planets in the galactic south  as aurora was the largest in the galactic north .  all three planets were identically racist  identically exclusivist .  their views on earth were similar and completely compatible .  ordinarily  one would think that there was no room to quarrel .   but aurora was the oldest of the outer worlds  the most advanced  the strongest militarily and  therefore  aspired to a sort of moral leadership of all the worlds .  that was sufficient in itself to arouse opposition  and rhea and tethys served as focal points for those who did not recognize auroran leadership .   keilin was somberly grateful for that situation .  if earth could but lean her weight properly  first in one direction  then in the other  an ultimate split  or even fragmentation  he eyed maynard cautiously  almost furtively  and wondered what effect this would have on the next day   s debate .  already  the auroran was more silent than was quite polite .   and then some under secretary or sub official threaded his way through the clusters of guests in finicking fashion  and beckoned to maynard .   keilin   s following eyes watched the auroran retreat with the newcomer  watched him listen closely  mouth a startled    what .     that was quite visible to the eye  though too far off to be heard  and then reach for a paper that the other handed him .   and as a result  the next day   s session of the conference went entirely differently than keilin would have predicted .   keilin discovered the details in the evening video casts .  the terrestrian government  it seemed  had sent a note to all the governments attending the conference .  it warned each one bluntly that any agreement among them in military or economic affairs would be considered an unfriendly act against earth and that it would be met with appropriate countermeasures .  the note denounced aurora  tethys  and rhea all equally .  it accused them of being engaged in an imperialist conspiracy against earth  and so on and on and on .      fools .  gritted keilin  all but butting his head against the wall out of sheer chagrin .     fools .  fools .  fools .     and his voice died away still muttering that same  one word .     the next session of the conference was well and early attended by a set of angry delegates who were only too eager to grind into nothingness the disagreements still outstanding .  when it ended  all matters concerning trade between earth and the outer worlds had been placed in the hands of a commission with plenary powers .   not even aurora could have expected so complete and easy a victory  and keilin  on his way back to earth  longed for his voice to reach the video  so that it could be to others  and not to himself only  that he could shout his disgust .   yet  on earth  some men smiled .     once back on earth  the voice of keilin slowly swirled under and down lost in the noisier clamor that shouted for action .   his popularity sank in proportion as trade restrictions grew .  slowly  the outer worlds drew the noose tighter .  first  they instituted a strict application of a new system of export licensing .  secondly  they banned the export to earth of all materials capable of being    used in a war effort .     and finally they applied a very broad interpretation indeed of what could be considered usable in such a connection .   imported luxuries and imported necessities  too  for that matter vanished or priced themselves upwards out of the reach of all but the very few .   so the people marched  and the voices shouted and the banners swung about in the sunlight  and the stones flew at the consulates   keilin shouted hoarsely and felt as if he were going mad .   until  suddenly  luiz moreno  quite of his own accord  offered to appear on keilin   s program and submit to unrestricted questioning in his capacity as ex ambassador to aurora and present secretary without portfolio .   to keilin it had had all the possibilities of a rebirth .  he knew moreno no fool  he .  with moreno on his program  he was assured an audience as great as his greatest .  with moreno answering questions  certain misapprehensions might be removed  certain confusions might be straightened .  the mere fact that moreno wished to use his his program as sounding board might well mean that already a more pliant and sensible foreign policy might have been decided upon .  perhaps maynard was correct  and the pinch was being felt and was working as predicted .   the list of questions had  of course  been submitted to moreno in advance  but the ex ambassador had indicated that he would answer all of them  and any follow up questions that might seem necessary .   it seemed quite ideal .  too ideal  perhaps  but only a criminal fool could worry over minutiae at this point .   there was an adequate ballyhoo and when they faced one another across the little table  the red needle that indicated the number of video sets drawing power on that channel hovered well over the two hundred million mark .  and there was an average of   .   listeners per video set .  now the theme  the official introduction .   keilin rubbed his cheek slowly  as he waited for the signal .   then  he began   q .  secretary moreno  the question which interests all earth at the moment  concerns the possibility of war .  suppose we start with that .  do you think there will be war .   a .  if earth is the only planet to be considered  i say  no  definitely not .  in its history  earth has had too much war  and has learned many times over how little can be gained by it .   q .  you say     if earth is the only planet to be considered     do you imply that factors outside our control will bring war .   a .  i do not say    will     but i could say    may .     i cannot  of course speak for the outer worlds .  i cannot pretend to know their motivations and intentions at this critical moment in galactic history .  they may choose war .  i hope not .  if so be that they do  however  we will defend ourselves .  but in any case  we will never attack  we will not strike the first blow .   q .  am i right in saying  then  that in your opinion there are no basic differences between earth and the outer worlds  which cannot be solved by negotiation .   a .  you certainly are .  if the outer worlds were sincerely desirous of a solution  no disagreement between them and us could long exist .   q .  does that include the question of immigration .   a .  definitely .  our own role in the matter is clear and beyond reproach .  as matters stand  two hundred million human beings now occupy ninety five percent of the available land in the universe .  six billions that is  ninety seven percent of all mankind are squeezed into the other five percent .  such a situation is obviously unjust and  worse  unstable .  yet earth  in the face of such injustice  has always been willing to treat this problem as soluble by degrees .  it is still so willing .  we should agree to reasonable quotas and reasonable restrictions .  yet the outer worlds have refused to discuss this matter .  over a space of five decades  they have rebuffed all efforts on the part of earth to open negotiations .   q .  if such an attitude on the part of the outer worlds continues  do you then think there will be war .   a .  i cannot believe that this attitude will continue .  our government will not cease hoping that the outer worlds will eventually reconsider their stand on the matter  that their sense of justice and right is not dead  but only sleeping .   q .  mr .  secretary  let us pass on to another subject .  do you think that the united worlds commission set up by the outer worlds recently to control trade with earth represents a danger to peace .   a .  in the sense that its actions indicate a desire on the part of the outer worlds to isolate earth  and to weaken it economically  i can say that it does .   q .  to what actions do you refer  sir .   a .  to its actions in restricting interstellar trade with earth to the point where  in credit values  the total stands now at less than ten percent of what it did three months ago .   q .  but do such restrictions really represent an economic danger to earth .  for instance  is it not true that trade with the outer worlds represents an almost insignificant part of total terrestrian trade .  and is it not true that the importations from the outer worlds reach only a tiny minority of the population at best .   a .  your questions now are representative of a profound fallacy which is very common among our isolationists .  in credit values  it is true that interstellar trade represents only five percent of our total trade  but ninety five percent of our atomic engines are imported .  eighty percent of our thorium  sixty five percent of our cesium  sixty percent of our molybdenum and tin are imported .  the list can be extended almost indefinitely  and it is quite easy to see that the five percent is an extremely important  a vital  five percent .  furthermore  if a large manufacturer receives a shipment of atomic steel shapers from rhea  it does not follow that the benefit redounds only to him .  every man on earth who uses steel implements or objects manufactured by steel implements benefits .   q .  but is it not true that the current restrictions on earth   s interstellar trade have cut our grain and cattle exports to almost nothing .  and far from harming earth  isn   t this really a boon to our own hungry people .   a .  this is another serious fallacy .  that earth   s good food supply is tragically inadequate is true .  the government would be the last to deny it .  but our food exports do not represent any serious drain upon this supply .  less than one fifth of one percent of earth   s food is exported  and in return we obtain  for instance  fertilizers and farm machinery which more than make up for that small loss by increasing agricultural efficiency .  therefore  by buying less food from us  the outer worlds are engaged  in effect  in cutting our already inadequate food supply .   q .  are you ready to admit  then  secretary moreno  that at least part of the blame for this situation should rest with earth itself .  in other words  we come to my next question  was it not a diplomatic blunder of the first magnitude for the government to issue its inflammatory note denouncing the intentions of the outer worlds before those intentions had been made clear at the interplanetary conference .   a .  i think those intentions were quite clear at the time .   q .  i beg pardon  sir  but i was at the conference .  at the time the note was issued  there was almost a stalemate among the outer world delegates .  those of rhea and tethys strongly opposed economic action against earth  and there was considerable chance that aurora and its block might have been defeated .  earth   s note ended that possibility instantly .   a .  well  what is your question  mr .  keilin .   q .  in view of my statements  do you or do you not think earth   s note to have been a criminal error of diplomacy which can now be made up only by a policy of intelligent conciliation .   a .  you use strong language .  however  i cannot answer the question directly  since i do not agree with your major premise .  i cannot believe that the delegates of the outer worlds could behave in the manner you describe .  in the first place  it is well known that the outer worlds are proud of their boast that the percentage of insanity  psychoses  and even relatively minor maladjustments of personality are almost at the vanishing point in their society .  it is one of their strongest arguments against earth  that we have more psychiatrists than plumbers and yet are more pinched for want of the former .  the delegates to the conference represented the best of this so stable society .  and now you would have me believe that these demigods would  in a moment of pique  have reversed their opinions and instituted a major change in the economic policy of fifty worlds .  i cannot believe them capable of such childish and perverse activity  and must therefore insist that any action they took was based not upon any note from earth  but upon motivations that go deeper .   q .  but i saw the effect upon them with my own eyes  sir .  remember  they were being scolded in what they considered to be insolent language from an inferior people .  there can be no doubt  sir  that as a whole  the men of the outer worlds are a remarkably stable people  despite your sarcasm  but their attitude toward earth represents a weak point in this stability .   a .  are you asking me questions  or are you defending the racist views and policies of the outer worlds .   q .  well  accepting your viewpoint that earth   s note did no harm  what good could it have done .  why should it have been sent .   a .  i think we were justified in presenting our side of the question before the bar of galactic public opinion .  i believe we have exhausted the subject .  what is your next question  please .  it is the last  isn   t it .   q .  it is .  it has recently been reported that the terrestrian government will take stern measures against those dealing in smuggling operations .  is this consistent with the government   s view that lowered trade relations are detrimental to earth   s welfare .   a .  our primary concern is peace  and not our own immediate welfare .  the outer worlds have adopted certain trade restrictions .  we disapprove of them  and consider them a great injustice .  nevertheless  we shall adhere to them  so that no planet may say that we have given the slightest pretext for hostilities .  for instance  i am privileged to announce here for the first time that in the past month  five ships  traveling under false earth registry  were stopped while being engaged in the smuggling of outer world materiel into earth .  their goods were confiscated and their personnel imprisoned .  this is an earnest of our good intentions .   q .  outer world ships .   a .  yes .  but traveling under false earth registry  remember .   q .  and the men imprisoned are citizens of the outer worlds .  a .  i believe so .  however  they were breaking not only our laws  but those of the outer worlds as well  and therefore doubly forfeited their interplanetary rights .  i think the interview had better close  now .   q .  but this   it was at this point that the broadcast came to a sudden end .  the conclusion of keilin   s last sentence was never heard by anyone but moreno .  it ended like this       means war .      but luiz moreno was no longer on the air .  so as he drew on his gloves  he smiled and  with infinite meaning  shrugged his shoulders in a little gesture of indifference .   there were no witnesses to that shrug .     the gathering at aurora was still in session .  franklin maynard had dropped out for the moment in utter weariness .  he faced his son  whom he now saw for the first time in naval uniform .      at least you   re sure of what will happen  aren   t you .      in the young man   s response  there was no weariness at all  no apprehension  nothing but utter satisfaction .     this is it  dad .         nothing bothers you  then .  you don   t think we   ve been maneuvered into this .         who cares if we have .  it   s earth   s funeral .      maynard shook his head     but you realize that we   ve been put in the wrong .  the outer world citizens they hold are law breakers .  earth is within its rights .      his son frowned     i hope you   re not going to make statements like that to the gathering  dad i don   t see that earth is justified at all .  all right  what if smuggling was going on .  it was just because some outer worlders are willing to pay black market prices for terrestrial food .  if earth had any sense  she could look the other way  and everyone would benefit .  she makes enough noise about how she needs our trade  so why doesn   t she do something about it .  anyway  i don   t see that we ought to leave any good aurorans or other outer worlders in the hands of those apemen .  since they won   t give them up  we   ll make them .  otherwise  none of us will be safe next time .         i see that you   ve adopted the popular opinions  anyway .         the opinions are my own .  if they   re popular opinion also  it   s because they make sense .  earth wants a war .  well  they   ll get it .         but why do they want a war  eh .  why do they force our hands .  our entire economic policy of the past months was only intended to force a change in their attitude without war .      he was talking to himself  but his son answered with the final argument     i don   t care why they wanted war .  they   ve got it now  and we   re going to smash them .      maynard returned to the gathering  but even as the drone of debate re filled the room  he thought  with a twinge  that there would be no terrestrian alfalfa that year .  he regretted the milk .  in fact  even the beef seemed  somehow  to be just a little less savory  the vote came in the early hours of the morning .  aurora declared war .  most of the worlds of the aurora bloc joined it by dawn .     in the history books  the war was later known as the three weeks    war .  in the first week  auroran forces occupied several of the trans plutonian asteroids  and at the beginning of the third week  the bulk of earth   s home fleet was all but completely destroyed in a battle within the orbit of saturn by an aurora fleet not one quarter its size  numerically .   declarations of war from the outer worlds yet neutral followed like the pop pop of a string of firecrackers .   on the twenty first day of the war  lacking two hours  earth surrendered .     the negotiations of peace terms took place among the outer worlds .  earth   s activities were concerned with signing only .  the conditions of peace were unusual  perhaps unique  and under the force of an unprecedented humiliation  all the hordes of earth seemed suddenly struck with a silence that came from a shamed anger too strong for words .   the terms mentioned were perhaps best commented upon by a voice on the auroran video two days after they were made public .  it can be quoted in part       .  .  . there is nothing in or on earth that we of the outer worlds can need or want .  all that was ever worthwhile on earth left it centuries ago in the persons of our ancestors .      they call us the children of mother earth  but that is not so  for we are the descendants of a mother earth that no longer exists  a mother that we brought with us .  the earth of today bears us at best a cousinly relation .  no more .      do we want their resources .  why  they have none for themselves .  can we use their industry or science .  they are almost dead for lack of ours .  can we use their man power .  ten of them are not worth a single robot .  do we even want the dubious glory of ruling them .  there is no such glory .  as our helpless and incompetent inferiors  they would be only a drag upon us .  they would divert from our own use food  labor  and administrative ability .      so they have nothing to give us but the space they occupy in our thought .  they have nothing to free us from but themselves .  they cannot benefit us in any way other than in their absence .      it is for that reason that the peace terms have been defined as they have been .  we wish them no harm  so let them have their own solar system .  let them live there in peace .  let them mold their own destiny in their own way  and we will not disturb them there by even the least hint of our presence .  but we in turn want peace .  we in turn would guide our own future in our own way .  so we do not want their presence .  and with that end in view  an outer world fleet will patrol the boundaries of their system  outer world bases will be established on their outermost asteroids  so that we may make sure they do not intrude on our territory .      there will be no trade  no diplomatic relationships  no travel  no communications .  they are fenced off  locked out  hermetically sealed away .  out here we have a new universe  a second creation of man  a higher man     they ask us  what will become of earth .  we answer  that is earth   s problem .  population growth can be controlled .  resources can be efficiently exploited .  economic systems can be revised .  we know  for we have done so .  if they cannot  let them go the way of the dinosaur  and make room .      let them make room  instead of forever demanding room .        and so an impenetrable curtain swung slowly shut about the solar system .  the stars in earth   s sky became only stars again  as in the long dead days before the first ship had penetrated the barrier of light   s speed .   the government that had made war and peace resigned  but there was no one  really  to take their place .  the legislature elected luiz moreno ex ambassador to aurora  ex secretary without portfolio as president pro tem  and the earth as a whole was too numbed to agree or disagree .  there was only a widespread relief that someone existed who would be willing to take the job of trying to guide the destinies of a world in prison .   very few realized how well planned an ending this was  or with what calculation moreno found himself in the president   s chair .     ernest keilin said hopelessly from the video screen     we are only ourselves now .  for us  there is no universe and no past only earth  and the future .      that night he heard from luiz moreno once again  and before morning he left for the capital .     moreno   s presence seemed incongruent within the stiffly formal president   s mansion .  he was suffering from a cold again  and snuffled when he talked .   keilin regarded him with a self terrifying hostility  an almost singeing hatred in which he could feel his fingers begin to twitch in the first gestures of choking .  perhaps he shouldn   t have come well  what was the difference  the orders had been plain .  if he had not come  he would have been brought .   the new president looked at him sharply     you have to alter your attitude toward me  keilin .  i know you regard me as one of the gravediggers of earth isn   t that the phrase you used last night .  but you must listen to me quietly for a while .  in your present state of suppressed rage  i doubt if you could hear me .         i will hear whatever you have to say  mr .  president .         well the external amenities  at least .  that   s hopeful or do you think a video tracer is attached to the room .      keilin merely lifted his eyebrows .   moreno said     it isn   t .  we are quite alone .  we must be alone  otherwise  how could i tell you safely that it is being arranged for you to be elected president under a constitution now being devised .  eh  what   s the matter .      then he grinned at the look of bloodless amazement in keilin   s face .     oh  you don   t believe it .  well  it   s past your stopping .  and before an hour is up  you   ll understand .         i   m to be president .     keilin struggled with a strange  hoarse voice .  then  more firmly     you are mad .         no .  not i .  those out there  rather .  out there in the outer worlds .     there was a sudden vicious intensity in moreno   s eyes  and face  and voice  so that you forgot he was a little monkey of a man with a perpetual cold .  you didn   t notice the wrinkled  sloping forehead .  you forgot the baldish head and ill fitting clothes .  there was only the bright and luminous look in his eyes  and the hard incision in his voice .  that you noticed .   keilin reached blindly backward for a chair  as moreno came closer and spoke with increasing intensity .      yes     said moreno .     those out among the stars .  the godlike ones .  the stately supermen .  the strong  handsome master race .  they are mad .  but only we on earth know it .      come  you have heard of the pacific project .  i know you have .  you denounced it to cellioni once  and called it a fake .  but it isn   t a fake .  and almost none of it is a secret .  in fact  the only secret about it was that almost none of it was a secret .      you   re no fool  keilin .  you just never stopped to work it all out .  and yet you were on the track .  you had the feel of it .  what was it you said that time you were interviewing me on the program .  some .  thing about the attitude of the outer worldling toward the earthman being the only flaw in the former   s stability .  that was it  wasn   t it .  or something like that .  very well  then  good .  you had the first third of the pacific project in your mind at the time  and it was no secret after all  was it .      ask yourself  keilin what was the attitude of the typical auroran to a typical earthman .  a feeling of superiority .  that   s the first thought  i suppose .  but  tell me  keilin  if he really felt superior  really superior  would it be so necessary for him to call such continuous attention to it .  what kind of superiority is it that must be continuously bolstered by the constant repetition of phrases such as    apemen        submen        half animals of earth     and so on .  that is not the calm internal assurance of superiority .  do you waste epithets on earthworms .  no  there is something else there .      or let us approach it from another tack .  why do outer world tourists stay in special hotels  travel in inclosed ground cars  and have rigid  if unwritten  rules against social intermingling .  are they afraid of pollution .  strange  then  that they are not afraid to eat our food and drink our wine and smoke our tobacco .      you see  keilin  there are no psychiatrists on the outer worlds .  the supermen are  so they say  too well adjusted .  but here on earth  as the proverb goes  there are more psychiatrists than plumbers  and they get lots of practice .  so it is we  and not they  who know the truth about this outer world superiority complex  who know it to be simply a wild reaction against an overwhelming feeling of guilt .      don   t you think that can be so .  you shake your head as though you disagree .  you don   t see that a handful of men who clutch a galaxy while billions starve for lack of room must feel a subconscious guilt  no matter what .  and  since they won   t share the loot  don   t you see that the only way they can justify themselves is to try to convince themselves that earthmen  after all  are inferior  that they do not deserve the galaxy  that a new race of men have been created out there and that we here are only the diseased remnants of an old race that should die out like the dinosaur  through the working of inexorable natural laws .      ah  if they could only convince themselves of that  they would no longer be guilty  but merely superior .  only  it doesn   t work  it never does .  it requires constant bolstering  constant repetition  constant reinforcement .  and still it doesn   t quite convince .      best of all  if only they could pretend that earth and its population do not exist at all .  when you visit earth  therefore  avoid earthmen  or they might make you uncomfortable by not looking inferior enough .  sometimes they might look miserable instead  and nothing more .  or worse still  they might even seem intelligent as i did  for instance  on aurora .      occasionally  an outer worlder like moreanu did crop up  and was able to recognize guilt for what it was without being afraid to say so out loud .  he spoke of the duty the outer worlds owed earth and so he was dangerous to us .  for if the others listened to him and had offered token assistance to earth  their guilt might have been assuaged in their own minds  and that without any lasting help to earth .  so moreanu was removed through our web weaving  and the way left clear to those who were unbending  who refused to admit guilt  and whose reaction could therefore be predicted and manipulated .      send them an arrogant note  for instance  and they automatically strike back with a useless embargo that merely gives us the ideal pretext for war .  then lose a war quickly  and you are sealed off by the annoyed supermen .  no communication  no contact .  you no longer exist to annoy them .  isn   t that simple .  didn   t it work out nicely .      keilin finally found his voice  because moreno gave him time by stopping .  he said     you mean that all this was planned .  you did deliberately instigate the war for the purpose of sealing earth off from the galaxy .  you sent out the men of the home fleet to sure death because you wanted defeat .  why  you   re a monster  a .  .  . a      moreno frowned     please relax .  it was not as simple as you think  and i am not a monster .  do you think the war could simply be instigated .  it had to be nurtured gently in just the right way and to just the right conclusion .  if we had made the first move  if we had been the aggressor  if we had in any way put the fault on our side why  they of the outer worlds would have occupied earth and ground it under .  they would no longer feel guilty  you see  if we committed a crime against them .  or  again  if we fought a protracted war  or one in which we inflicted damage  they could succeed in shifting the blame .      but we didn   t .  we merely imprisoned auroran smugglers  and were obviously within our rights .  they had to go to war over it because only so could they protect their superiority  which in turn protected them against the horrors of guilt .  and we lost quickly .  scarcely an auroran died .  the guilt grew deeper and resulted in exactly the peace treaty our psychiatrists had predicted .      and as for sending men out to die  that is a commonplace in every war and a necessity .  it was necessary to fight a battle  and  naturally  there were casualties .         but why .     interrupted keilin  wildly .     why .  why .  why does all this gibberish seem to make sense to you .  what have we gained .  what can we possibly gain out of the present situation .         gained  man .  you ask what we   ve gained .  why  we   ve gained the universe .  what has held us back so far .  you know what earth has needed these last centuries .  you yourself once outlined it forcefully to cellioni .  we need a positronic robot society and an atomic power technology .  we need chemical farming and we need population control .  well  what   s prevented that  eh .  only the customs of centuries which said robots were evil since they deprived human beings of jobs  that population control was merely the murder of unborn children  and so on .  and worse  there was always the safety valve of emigration either actual or hoped for .      but now we cannot emigrate .  we   re stuck here .  worse than that  we have been humiliatingly defeated by a handful of men out in the stars  and we   ve had a humiliating treaty of peace forced upon us .  what earthman wouldn   t subconsciously burn for revenge .  self preservation has frequently knuckled under to that tremendous yearning to    get even .         and that is the second third of the pacific project  the recognition of the revenge motive .  as simple as that .      and how can we know that this is really so .  why  it has been demonstrated in history scores of times .  defeat a nation  but don   t crush it entirely  and in a generation or two or three it will be stronger than it was before .  why .  because in the interval  sacrifices will have been made for revenge that would not have been made for mere conquest .      think .  rome beat carthage rather easily the first time  but was almost defeated the second .  every time napoleon defeated the european coalition  he laid the groundwork for another just a little bit harder to defeat  until he himself was crushed by the eighth .  it took four years to defeat wilhelm of medieval germany  and six much more dangerous years to stop his successor  hitler .      there you are .  until now  earth needed to change its way of life only for greater comfort and happiness .  a minor item like that could always wait .  but now it must change for revenge  and that will not wait .  and i want that change for its own sake .      only i am not the man to lead .  i am tarred with the failure of yesteryear  and will remain so until  long after i am bone dust  earth learns the truth .  but you .  .  . you  and others like you  have always fought for the road to modernization .  you will be in charge .  it may take a hundred years .  grandchildren of men unborn may be the first to see its completion .  but at least you will see the start .      eh  what do you say .     keilin was fumbling at the dream .  he seemed to see it in a misty distance a new and reborn earth .  but the change in attitude was too extreme .  it could not be done just yet .  he shook his head .   he said     what makes you think the outer worlds would allow such a change  supposing what you say to be true .  they will be watching  i am sure  and they will detect a growing danger and put a stop to it .  can you deny that .      moreno threw his head back and laughed noiselessly .  he gasped out     but we have still a third left of the pacific project  a last  subtle and ironic third      the outer worlders call the men of earth the subhuman dregs of a great race  but we are the men of earth .  do you realize what that means .  we live on a planet upon which  for a billion years  life the life that has culminated in mankind has been adapting itself .  there is not a microscopic part of man  not a tiny working of his mind  that has not as its reason some tiny facet of the physical make up of earth  or of the biological make up of earth   s other life forms  or of the sociological make up of the society about him .      no other planet can substitute for earth  in man   s present shape .      the outer worlders exist as they do  only because pieces of earth have been transplanted .  soil has been brought out there  plants  animals  men .  they keep themselves surrounded by an artificial earthborn geology which has within it  for instance  those traces of cobalt  zinc  and copper which human chemistry must have .  they surround themselves by earth born bacteria and algae which have the ability to make those inorganic traces available in just the right way and in just the right quantity .      and they maintain that situation by continued imports luxury imports  they call it from earth .      but on the outer worlds  even with terrestrian soil laid down to bedrock  they cannot keep rain from falling and rivers from flowing  so that there is an inevitable  if slow  admixture with the native soil  an inevitable contamination of terrestrian soil bacteria with the native bacteria  and an exposure  in any case  to a different atmosphere and to solar radiations of different types .  terrestrian bacteria disappear or change .  and then plant life changes .  and then animal life .      no great change  mind you .  plant life would not become poisonous or nonnutritious in a day  or year  or decade .  but already  the men of the outer worlds can detect the loss or change of the trace compounds that are responsible for that infinitely elusive thing we call    flavor .     it has gone that far .      and it will go further .  do you know  for instance  that on aurora  nearly one half the native bacterial species known have protoplasm based on a fluorocarbon rather than hydrocarbon chemistry .  can you imagine the essential foreignness of such an environment .      well  for two decades now  the bacteriologists and physiologists of earth have studied various forms of outer world life the only portion of the pacific project that has been truly secret and the transplanted terrestrian life is already beginning to show certain changes on the subcellular level .  even among the humans .      and here is the irony .  the outer worlders  by their rigid racism and unbending genetic policies are consistently eliminating from among themselves any children that show signs of adapting themselves to their respective planets in any way that departs from the norm .  they are maintaining they must maintain as a result of their own thought processes an artificial criterion of    healthy    humanity  which is based on terrestrian chemistry and not their own .      but now that earth has been cut off from them  now that not even a trickle of terrestrian soil and life will reach them  change will be piled on change .  sicknesses will come  mortality will increase  child abnormalities will become more frequent         and then .     asked keilin  suddenly caught up .      and then .  well  they are physical scientists leaving such inferior sciences as biology to us .  and they cannot abandon their sensation of superiority and their arbitrary standard of human perfection .  they will never detect the change till it is too late to fight it .  not all mutations are clearly visible  and there will be an increasing revolt against the mores of those stiff outer world societies .  there will be a century of increasing physical and social turmoil which will prevent any interference on their part with us .      we will have a century of rebuilding and revitalization  and at the end of it  we shall face an outer galaxy which will either be dying or changed .  in the first case  we will build a second terrestrian empire  more wisely and with greater knowledge than we did the first  one based on a strong and modernized earth .      in the second case  we will face perhaps ten  twenty  or even all fifty outer worlds  each with a slightly different variety of man .  fifty humanoid species  no longer united against us  each increasingly adapted to its own planet  each with a sufficient tendency toward atavism to love earth  to regard it as the great and original mother .      and racism will be dead  for variety will then be the great fact of humanity  and not uniformity .  each type of man will have a world of its own  for which no other world could quite substitute  and on which no other type could live quite as well .  and other worlds can be settled to breed still newer varieties  until out of the grand intellectual mixture  mother earth will finally have given birth not to merely a terrestrian  but to a galactic empire .      keilin said  fascinated     you foresee all this so certainly .         nothing is truly certain  but the best minds on earth agree on this .  there may be unforeseen stumbling blocks on the way  but to remove those will be the adventure of our great grandchildren .  of our adventure  one phase has been successfully concluded  and another phase is beginning .  join us  keilin .      slowly  keilin began to think that perhaps moreno was not a monster after all    the end    what interests me most about    mother earth    is that it seems to show clear premonitions of the novels caves of steel and the naked sun  which i was to write in the     s .     one thing about the story that i can   t explain is the fact that i have two characters in it  one of whom is named moreno and one moreanu .  i haven   t the slightest idea why i used such similar names .  there was no significance in it  i assure you  only carelessness .  there was also a maynard .   somehow  in reading and rereading the manuscript  the sloppiness of the situation never struck me .  it did  however  just as soon as i saw the story in print .  why campbell didn   t notice and make me change the names  i haven   t the faintest idea .   i had no sooner sold    mother earth    than i began a new    foundation    story entitled     .  .  . and now you don   t .     it was to be the last .  like    the mule     it was fifty thousand words long  and i didn   t finish it till march          .  i submitted it to campbell the next day and he took it at once .  at two cents a word  it netted me a check for one thousand dollars  the first four figure check i ever received .   it appeared as a three part serial in the november       december       and january      issues of astounding  and it made up the final two thirds of my book second foundation .     by then  though  a great change was coming over the field of science fiction .  the atom bomb had altered science fiction from a disregarded field of crazy stories into a literature of dreadful perception .  slowly  it was mounting in readership and esteem .  new magazines were about to come into being  and the large publishing houses were about to consider putting out regular lines of hardback science fiction novels  hitherto the domain of small specialty houses no more affluent than the magazines and no more hopeful as a source of income  .   the matter of hardback novels was of particular interest to doubleday   company  inc .   though  of course  i didn   t know it at the time  . on february          while i was working on the last of the    foundation    stories  i attended a meeting of the hydra club a group of science fiction professionals who lived in new york .  there i met a doubleday editor  walter i .  bradbury  for the first time .  it was he who was trying to build up a science fiction line for doubleday  and he expressed some interest in    the mule .      i paid little attention to this  however .  the thought of publishing a book  a real book  as opposed to magazine stories  was so outlandish that i simply couldn   t cram it into my head .   but fred pohl could .  he had been in the army  serving in italy and rising to the rank of sergeant .  after discharge  he became an agent again .  i had indignantly told him the story of merwin   s rejection of    grow old with me     so when bradbury continued searching  pohl suggested to him that he look at that story of mine .   bradbury was interested and  after considerable trouble  pohl managed to pry the story out of me .      it   s no good     i kept saying having never really recovered from the double rejection .    but on march           i received the word that bradbury wanted    grow old with me    if i would expand it to seventy thousand words .  what   s more  he paid me a      option  which i could keep even if the revision was unsatisfactory .  that was the first time anyone had paid me anything in advance  and i was flabbergasted .   on april    i began the revision  and on may    .        i finished it and retitled it pebble in the sky .  on may     doubleday accepted it  and i had to grasp the fact that i was going to have a book published .     but even as i struggled with that  another change was taking place simultaneously .   there was still the matter of a job .  all the time i was working for professor elderfield  i was still searching for one that i could take after that temporary position reached its natural end in may      .  i was having no success at all .   but then  on january           professor william c .  boyd of boston university school of medicine was visiting new york  and we met .   professor boyd was a science fiction reader of long standing and had liked my stories .  for a couple of years we had been corresponding and we had grown quite friendly .  now he told me that there was an opening in the biochemistry department at his school and would i be interested .  i was interested  of course  but boston is twice as far from new york as philadelphia is  and i hated to leave new york again .   i refused the offer  but not very hard .   and i continued to look for a job  and i continued to fail .   i therefore reconsidered my refusal of the position at boston university school of medicine and wrote a letter to professor boyd  saying that perhaps i might be interested  after all .   on march          i traveled to boston for the first time in my life  on a sleeper but i didn   t sleep  . i met professor burnham s .  walker  head of the department of biochemistry  the next day and he offered me a position on the faculty at five thousand per year .  i saw no way out of my jobless dilemma but to accept .   did i have to .  was there no chance that i might have made my living as a writer .   how could i honestly come to a decision that i could .  in mid       i had been writing for exactly eleven years .  in all that time  my total earnings had come to        .     averaging a little over      per year  or     .    per week .  in my better years  such as the seventh  mid      to mid       when i had sold four stories  including    the mule      i had earned         and in the tenth and eleventh together i had earned        .  it looked as though  even in good years  i could not count on much more than thirty dollars per week  and that just wasn   t enough .   of course  now that i was going to be publishing a book   but books were unknown quantities .  besides  the book sale had come too late .  by the time bradbury accepted pebble in the sky  i was committed to the new job  and two days later  on june          i left for boston .     it is at this point i must come to a halt  for the multiple changes put a final end to the first stage of my writing career .   i had left campbell  this time forever .  oh  i saw him occasionally  and we corresponded  but the steady drizzle of near weekly visits was never to take place again .  though i wrote for him and continued to publish in astounding  new magazines appeared  including the magazine of fantasy and science fiction in       galaxy science fiction in       and others .  my market broadened  and the word rate went up still further  to three cents and even four cents a word .   the appearance of my first book  pebble in the sky  on january           introduced a new dimension to my self image  to my prestige in the field  and to my earnings .  other books followed some new novels  some collections of older stories .   my position at boston university school of medicine led me to publish non fiction .  the first attempt was a textbook for medical students called biochemistry and human metabolism .  this was begun in      in collaboration with professors walker and boyd .  it went through three editions and  though rather a failure  allowed me to discover that i enjoyed non fiction writing at least as much as fiction writing and helped me start on a new phase of my writing career .     with all this taken into account  it is not surprising that my earnings as a writer began to rise rapidly almost as soon as i came to boston .  by      i was making considerably more money as a writer than as a professor  and the discrepancy grew larger in favor of writing each succeeding year .  by       i   d decided  still somewhat to my surprise  that i had been a writer all along and that that was all i was .   on july i        i gave up my salary and my duties but  with the agreement of the school  kept my title  which was then associate professor of biochemistry .  i keep that title to this day .  i give an occasional lecture at the school when asked to do so  and i also lecture elsewhere when asked to do so  and charge a fee  .  for the rest  i became a full time free lance writer .   writing is easy now  and is ever more satisfying .  i keep what amounts to a seventy hour week  if you count all the ancillary jobs of proofreading  indexing  research  and so on .  i average seven or eight books a year  and this book  the early asimov  is my    th book .   and yet  i must admit there has never been  since       anything like the real excitement of those first eleven    campbell years     when i wrote only in my spare time  and sometimes not even then  when every submission meant unbearable suspense  when every rejection meant misery and every acceptance ecstasy  and every fifty dollar check was the wealth of croesus .     and on july           john campbell  at the still early age of sixty one  while watching television  died at      p . m .  quietly and peacefully  without any pain at all .   there is no way at all to express how much he meant to me and how much he did for me except  perhaps  to write this book evoking  once more  those days of a quarter century ago .       appendix the sixty stories
