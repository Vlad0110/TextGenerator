publisher      map      sam vimes sighed when he heard the scream  but he finished shaving before he did anything about it .   then he put his jacket on and strolled out into the wonderful late spring morning .  birds sang in the trees  bees buzzed in the blossom .  the sky was hazy though  and thunderheads on the horizon threatened rain later .  but for now  the air was hot and heavy .  and in the old cesspit behind the gardener   s shed  a young man was treading water .   well   treading  anyway .   vimes stood back a little way and lit a cigar .  it probably wouldn   t be a good idea to employ a naked flame any nearer to the pit .  the fall from the shed roof had broken the crust .      good morning .     he said cheerfully .      good morning  your grace     said the industrious treadler .   the voice was higher pitched than vimes expected and he realized that  most unusually  the young man in the pit was in fact a young woman .  it wasn   t entirely unexpected   the assassins    guild was aware that women were at least equal to their brothers when it came to inventive killing   but it nevertheless changed the situation somewhat .      i don   t believe we   ve met .     said vimes .     although i see you know who i am .  you are    .         wiggs  sir     said the swimmer .     jocasta wiggs .  honored to meet you  your grace .         wiggs  eh .     said vimes .     famous family in the guild .     sir    will do  by the way .  i think i once broke your father   s leg .         yes  sir .  he asked to be remembered to you     said jocasta .      you   re a bit young to be sent on this contract  aren   t you .     said vimes .      not a contract  sir     said jocasta  still paddling .      come now  miss wiggs .  the price on my head is at least           the guild council put it in abeyance  sir     said the patient swimmer .     you   re off the register .  they   re not accepting contracts on you at present .         good grief  why not .         couldn   t say  sir     said miss wiggs .  her patient struggles had brought her to the edge of the pit  and now she was finding that the brickwork was in very good repair  quite slippery  and offered no handholds .  vimes knew this  because he   d spent several hours one afternoon carefully arranging that this should be so .      so why were you sent  then .         miss band sent me as an exercise     said jocasta .     i say  these bricks really are jolly tricky  aren   t they .         yes     said vimes     they are .  have you been rude to miss band lately .  upset her in any way .         oh  no  your grace .  but she did say i was getting overconfident and would benefit from some advanced field work .         ah .  i see .     vimes tried to recall miss alice band  one of the assassins    guild   s stricter teachers .  she was  he   d heard  very hot on practical lessons .      so   she sent you to kill me  then .     he said .      no  sir .  it   s an exercise .  i don   t even have any crossbow bolts .  i just had to find a spot where i could get you in my sights and then report back .         she   d believe you .         of course  sir     said jocasta  looking rather hurt .     guild honor  sir .      vimes took a deep breath .     you see  miss wiggs  quite a few of your chums have tried to kill me at home in recent years .  as you might expect  i take a dim view of this .         easy to see why  sir     said jocasta  in the voice of one who knows that their only hope of escaping from their present predicament is reliant on the goodwill of another person  who has no pressing reason to have any .      and so you   d be amazed at the booby traps there are around the place     vimes went on .     some of them are pretty cunning  even if i say so myself .         i certainly never expected the tiles on the shed to shift like that  sir .         they   re on greased rails     said vimes .      well done  sir .         and quite a few of the traps drop you into something deadly     said vimes .      lucky for me that i fell into this one  eh  sir .         oh  that one   s deadly too     said vimes .     eventually deadly .     he sighed .  he really wanted to discourage this sort of thing but   they   d put him off the register .  it wasn   t that he   d liked being shot at by hooded figures in the temporary employ of his many and varied enemies  but he   d always looked at it as some kind of vote of confidence .  it showed that he was annoying the rich and arrogant people who ought to be annoyed .   besides  the assassins    guild was easy to outwit .  they had strict rules  which they followed quite honorably  and this was fine by vimes  who  in certain practical areas  had no rules whatsoever .   off the register  eh .  the only other person not on it anymore  it was rumored  was lord vetinari  the patrician .  the assassins understood the political game in the city better than anyone  and if they took you off the register it was because they felt your departure would not only spoil the game but also smash the board        i   d be jolly grateful if you could pull me out  sir     said jocasta .      what .  oh  yes .  sorry  got clean clothes on     said vimes .     but when i get back to the house i   ll tell the butler to come down here with a ladder .  how about that .         thank you very much  sir .  nice to have met you  sir .      vimes strolled back to the house .  off the register .  was he allowed to appeal .  perhaps they thought     the scent rolled over him .   he looked up .   overhead  a lilac tree was in bloom .   he stared .   damn .  damn .  damn .  every year he forgot .  well  no .  he never forgot .  he just put the memories away  like old silverware that you didn   t want to tarnish .  and every year they came back  sharp and sparkling  and stabbed him in the heart .  and today  of all days     he reached up  and his hand trembled as he grasped a bloom and gently broke the stem .  he sniffed at it .  he stood for a moment  staring at nothing .  and then he carried the sprig of lilac carefully back up to his dressing room .   willikins had prepared the official uniform for today .  sam vimes stared at it blankly  and then remembered .  watch committee .  right .  the battered old breastplate wouldn   t do  would it   not for his grace the duke of ankh  commander of the city watch  sir samuel vimes .  lord vetinari had been very definite about that  blast it .   blast it all the more because  unfortunately  sam vimes could see the point .  he hated the official uniform  but he represented a bit more than just himself these days .  sam vimes had been able to turn up for meetings with grubby armor  and even sir samuel vimes could generally contrive to find a way to stay in street uniform at all times  but a duke   well  a duke needed a bit of polish .  a duke couldn   t have the arse hanging out of his trousers when meeting foreign diplomats .  actually  even plain old sam vimes never had the arse hanging out of his trousers  either  but no one would have actually started a war if he had .   the plain old sam vimes had fought back .  he got rid of most of the plumes and the stupid tights  and ended up with a dress uniform that at least looked as though its owner was male .  but the helmet had gold decoration  and the bespoke armorers had made a new  gleaming breastplate with useless gold ornamentation on it .  sam vimes felt like a class traitor every time he wore it .  he hated being thought of as one of those people that wore stupid ornamental armor .  it was gilt by association .   he twirled the sprig of lilac in his fingers  and smelled again the heady smell .  yes   it hadn   t always been like this     someone had just spoken to him .  he looked up .      what .     he barked .      i enquired if her ladyship is well  your grace .     said the butler  looking startled .     are you feeling all right  your grace .         what .  oh  yes .  no .  i   m fine .  so is her ladyship  yes  thank you .  i popped in before i went outside .  mrs .  content is with her .  she says it won   t be for a while .         i have advised the kitchen to have plenty of hot water ready  your grace  nevertheless     said willikins  helping vimes on with the gilty breastplate .      yes .  why do they need all that water  do you think .         i couldn   t say  your grace     said willikins .     probably best not to inquire .      vimes nodded .  sybil had already made it quite clear  with gentle tact  that his services were not required on this particular case .  it had been  he had to admit  a bit of a relief .   he handed willikins the sprig of lilac .  the butler took it without comment  inserted it into a little silver tube of water that would keep it fresh for hours  and fixed it onto one of the breastplate straps .      time moves on  doesn   t it  your grace     he said  dusting vimes down with a small brush .   vimes took out his watch .     it certainly does .  look  i   ll drop in at the yard on my way to the palace  sign what needs signing  and i   ll be back as soon as possible  all right .      willikins gave him a look of almost unbutlerly concern .      i   m sure her ladyship will be fine  your grace     he said .     of course she is not  not              young     said vimes .      i would say she is richer in years than many other primagravida     said willikins smoothly .     but she is a well built lady  if you don   t mind me saying so  and her family have traditionally had very little trouble in the childbirth department           prima what .         new mothers  your grace .  i   m sure her ladyship would much rather know that you were running after miscreants than wearing a hole in the library carpet .         i expect you   re right  willikins .  er   oh  yes  there   s a young lady dogpaddling in the old cesspit  willikins .         very good  your grace .  i shall send the kitchen boy down there with a ladder directly .  and a message to the assassins    guild .         good idea .  she   ll need clean clothes and a bath .         i think  perhaps  the hose in the old scullery might be more appropriate  your grace .  to start with  at least .         good point .  see to it .  and now i must be off .          in the crowded main office of the pseudopolis yard watch house  sergeant colon absentmindedly adjusted the sprig of lilac that he   d stuck into his helmet like a plume .      they go very strange  nobby     he said  leafing listlessly through the morning   s paperwork .     it   s a copper thing .  happened to me when i had kids .  you get tough .         what do you mean  tough .     said corporal nobbs  possibly the best living demonstration that there was some smooth evolution between humans and animals .      we ell     said colon  leaning back in his chair .     it   s like   well  when you   re our age       he looked at nobby and hesitated .  nobby had been giving his age as    probably thirty four    for years  the nobbs family were not good at keeping count .      i mean  when a man reaches   a certain age     he tried again     he knows the world is never going to be perfect .  he   s got used to it being a bit  a bit           manky .     nobby suggested .  tucked behind his ear  in the place usually reserved for his cigarette  was another wilting lilac flower .      exactly     said colon .     like  it   s never going to be perfect  so you just do the best you can  right .  but when there   s a kid on the way  well  suddenly a man sees it different .  he thinks  my kid   s going to have to grow up in this mess .  time to clean it up .  time to make it a better world .  he gets a bit   keen .  full of ginger .  when he hears about stronginthearm it   s going to be very hot around here for   morning  mister vimes .         talking about me  eh .     said vimes  striding past them as they jerked to attention .  he had not  in fact  heard any of the conversation  but sergeant colon   s face could be read like a book and vimes had learned it by heart years ago .      just wondering if the happy event       colon began  trailing after vimes as he took the stairs two at a time .      it hasn   t     said vimes shortly .  he pushed open the door to his office .     morning  carrot .      captain carrot sprang to his feet and saluted .      morning  sir .  has lady           no  carrot .  she has not .  what   s been happening overnight .      carrot   s gaze went to the sprig of lilac and back to vimes   s face .      nothing good  sir     he said .     another officer killed .      vimes stopped .      who .     he demanded .      sergeant stronginthearm  sir .  killed in treacle mine road .  carcer again .      vimes glanced at his watch .  they had ten minutes to get to the palace .  but time suddenly wasn   t important anymore .   he sat down at his desk .      witnesses .         three this time  sir .         that many .         all dwarfs .  stronginthearm wasn   t even on duty  sir .  he   d signed off and was picking up a rat pie and chips from a shop and walked out straight into carcer .  the devil stabbed him in the neck and ran for it .  he must   ve thought we   d found him .         we   ve been looking for the man for weeks .  and he bumped into poor old stronginthearm when all the dwarf was thinking of was his breakfast .  is angua on the trail .         up to a point  sir     said carrot awkwardly .      why only up to a point .         he   well  we assume it was carcer   dropped an aniseed bomb in sator square .  almost pure oil .      vimes sighed .  it was amazing how people adapted .  the watch had a werewolf .  that news had got around  in an underground kind of way .  and so the criminals had mutated  to survive in a society where the law had a very sensitive nose .  scent bombs were the solution .  they didn   t have to be that dramatic .  you just poured pure peppermint or aniseed in the street where a lot of people would walk over it  and suddenly sergeant angua was facing a hundred  a thousand crisscrossing trails  and went to bed with a nasty headache .   he listened glumly as carrot reported on men brought off leave or put on double shift  on informers pumped  pigeons stooled  grasses rustled  fingers held to the wind  ears put on the street .  and he knew how little it all added up to .  they still had fewer than a hundred men in the watch  and that was including the canteen lady .  there were a million people in the city  and a billion places to hide .  ankh morpork was built of bolt holes .  besides  carcer was a nightmare .   vimes was used to the other kinds of nut jobs  the ones that acted quite normally right up to the point where they hauled off and smashed someone with a poker for blowing their nose noisily .  but carcer was different .  he was of two minds  but instead of being in conflict  they were in competition .  he had demons on both shoulders  urging one another on .   and yet   he smiled all the time  in a cheerful chirpy sort of way  and he acted like the kind of rascal who made a dodgy living selling gold watches that go green after a week .  and he appeared to be convinced  utterly convinced  that he never did anything really wrong .  he   d stand there amid the carnage  blood on his hands and stolen jewelry in his pocket  and  with an expression of injured innocence  declare     me .  what did i do .      and it was believable right up until you looked into those cheeky  smiling eyes  and saw  deep down  the demons looking back        but don   t spend too much time looking at those eyes  because that   d mean you   ve taken your eyes off his hands  and by now one of them would hold a knife .   it was hard for the average copper to deal with people like that .  they expected people  when heavily outnumbered  to give in  or try to deal  or at least just stop moving .  they didn   t expect people to kill for a five dollar watch  a hundred dollar watch  now  that   d be different .  this was ankh morpork  after all  .      was stronginthearm married .     vimes said .      no  sir .  lived in new cobblers with his parents .      parents  thought vimes .  that made it worse .      anyone been to tell them .     he asked .     and don   t say it was nobby .  we don   t want any repeat of that bet you a dollar you   re the widow jackson nonsense .         i went  sir .  as soon as we got the news .         thank you .  they took it badly .         they took it   solemnly  sir .      vimes groaned .  he could imagine the expressions .      i   ll write them the official letter     he said  pulling open his desk drawers .     get someone to take it round  will you .  and say i   ll be over later .  perhaps this isn   t the time to       no  hold on  they were dwarfs  dwarfs weren   t bashful about money       forget that   say we   ll have all the details of his pension and so on .  died on duty  too .  that   s extra .  it all adds up .  that   ll be theirs .     he rummaged in his desk .     where   s his file .         here  sir     said carrot  handing it over smoothly .     we are due at the palace at ten  sir .  watch committee .  but i   m sure they   ll understand     he added  seeing vimes   s face .     i   ll go and clean out stronginthearm   s locker  sir  and i expect the lads   ll have a whip round for flowers and everything        vimes pondered over a sheet of headed paper after the captain had gone .  a file  he had to refer to a damn file .  but there were so many coppers these days     a whip round for flowers .  and a coffin .  you look after your own .  sergeant dickins had said that  a long time ago     he wasn   t good with words  least of all ones written down  but after a few glances at the file to refresh his memory  he wrote down the best he could think of .   and they were all good words and  more or less  they were the right ones .  yet  in truth  stronginthearm was just a decent dwarf who was paid to be a copper .  he   d joined up because  these days  joining the watch was quite a good career choice .  the pay was good  there was a decent pension  there was a wonderful medical plan if you had the nerve to submit to igor   s ministrations in the cellar  and  after a year or so  an ankh morpork   trained copper could leave the city and get a job in the watches of the other cities on the plain with instant promotion .  that was happening all the time .  sammies  they were called  even in towns that had never heard of sam vimes .  he was just a little proud of that .     they    meant watchmen who could think without moving their lips  who didn   t take bribes   much  and then only at the level of beer and doughnuts  which even vimes recognized as the grease that helps the wheels run smoothly   and were  on the whole  trustworthy .  for a given value of    trust     at least .   the sound of running feet indicated that sergeant detritus was bringing some of the latest trainees back from their morning run .  he could hear the jody detritus had taught them .  somehow  you could tell it was made up by a troll          now we sing dis stupid song .       sing it as we run along .       why we sing dis we don   t know .       we can   t make der words rhyme prop   ly .             sound off .             one .  two .             sound off .             many .  lots .             sound off .             er   what .          it still irked vimes that the little training school in the old lemonade factory was turning out so many coppers who quit the city the moment their probation was up .  but it had its advantages .  there were sammies almost as far as uberwald now  all speeding up the local promotion ladder .  it helped  knowing names and knowing that those names had been taught to salute him .  the ebb and flow of politics often meant that the local rulers weren   t talking to one another  but  via the semaphore towers  the sammies talked all the time .   he realized he was humming a different song under his breath .  it was a tune he   d forgotten for years .  it went with the lilac  scent and song together .  he stopped  feeling guilty .   he was finishing the letter when there was a knock at the door .      nearly done .     he shouted .      it   th me  thur     said constable igor  pushing his head around the door  and then he added     igor  sir .         yes  igor .     said vimes  wondering not for the first time why anyone with stitches all around his head needed to tell anyone who he was .       i would just like to thay  sir  that i could have got young thronginthearm back on his feet  thur     said igor  a shade reproachfully .   vimes sighed .  igor   s face was full of concern tinged with disappointment .  he had been prevented from plying his   craft .  he was naturally disappointed .      we   ve been through this  igor .  it   s not like sewing a leg back on .  and dwarfs are dead set against that sort of thing .         there   s nothing thupernatural about it  thur .  i am a man of natural philothophy .  and he was still warm when they brought him in           those are the rules  igor .  thanks all the same .  we know your heart is in the right place           they are in the right places  sir     said igor reproachfully .      that   s what i meant     vimes said without missing a beat  just as igor never did .      oh  very well  sir     said igor  giving up .  he paused  and then said     how is her ladyship  sir .      vimes had been expecting this .  it was a terrible thing for a mind to do  but his had already presented him with the idea of igor and sybil in the same sentence .  not that he disliked igor .  quite the reverse .  there were watchmen walking around the streets right now who wouldn   t have legs if it wasn   t for igor   s genius with a needle .  but        fine .  she   s fine     he said abruptly .      only i heard that mrs .  content was a bit worr           igor  there are some areas where   look  do you know anything about   women and babies .         not in so many wordth  sir  but i find that once i   ve got someone on the slab and had a good  you know  rummage around  i can thort out most thingth        vimes   s imagination actually shut down at this point .      thank you  igor     he managed without his voice trembling     but mrs .  content is a very experienced midwife .         jutht as you say  sir     said igor  but doubt rode on the words .      and now i   ve got to go     said vimes .     it   s going to be a long day .      he ran down the stairs  tossed the letter to sergeant colon  nodded to carrot  and set off at a fast walk for the palace .   after the door had shut one of the watchmen looked up from the desk where he   d been wrestling with a report and the effort of writing down  as policemen do  what ought to have happened .      sarge .         yes  corporal ping .         why   re some of you wearing purple flowers  sarge .      there was a subtle change in the atmosphere  a suction of sound caused by many pairs of ears listening intently .  all the officers in the room had stopped writing .      i mean  i saw you and reg and nobby wearing    em this time last year  and i wondered if we were all supposed to       ping faltered .  sergeant colon   s normally amiable eyes had narrowed and the message they were sending was  you   re on thin ice  lad  and it   s starting to creak        i mean  my landlady   s got a garden and i could easily go and cut a       ping went on in an uncharacteristic attempt at suicide .      you   d wear the lilac today  would you .     said colon quietly .      i just meant that if you wanted me to i could go and           were you there .     said colon  getting to his feet so fast that his chair fell over .      steady  fred     murmured nobby .      i didn   t mean       ping began .     i mean   was i where  sarge .      colon leaned on the desk  bringing his round red face an inch away from ping   s nose .      if you don   t know where there was  you weren   t there     he said in the same quiet voice .   he stood up straight again .      now me an    nobby has got a job to do     he said .     at ease  ping .  we are going out .         er        this was not being a good day for corporal ping .      yes .     said colon .      er   standing orders  sarge   you   re the ranking officer  you see  and i   m orderly officer for the day  i wouldn   t ask otherwise but   if you   re going out  sarge  you   ve got to tell me where you   re going .  just in case anyone has to contact you  see .  i got to write it down in the book .  in pen and everything     he added .      you know what day it is  ping .     said colon .      er     th of may  sarge .         and you know what that means  ping .         er           it means     said nobby     that anyone important enough to ask where we   re going              knows where we   ve gone     said fred colon .   the door slammed behind them .       this cemetery of small gods was for the people who didn   t know what happened next .  they didn   t know what they believed in or if there was life after death and  often  they didn   t know what hit them .  they   d gone through life being amiably uncertain  until the ultimate certainty had claimed them at the last .  among the city   s bone orchards  the cemetery was the equivalent of the drawer marked misc  where people were interred in the glorious expectation of nothing very much .   most of the watch got buried there .  policemen  after a few years  found it hard enough to believe in people  let alone anyone they couldn   t see .   for once  it wasn   t raining .  the breeze shook the sooty poplars around the wall  making them rustle .      we ought to have brought some flowers     said colon  as they made their way through the long grass .      i could nick a few off some of the fresh graves  sarge     nobby volunteered .      not the kind of thing i want to hear you saying at this time  nobby     said colon severely .      sorry  sarge .         at a time like this a man ought to be thinking of his immortal soul viz ah viz the endless mighty river that is history .  i should do that if i was you  nobby .      up against one wall  lilac trees were growing .  that is  at some point in the past a lilac had been planted there  and had given rise  as lilac will  to hundreds of whippy suckers  so that what had once been one stem was now a thicket .  every branch was covered in pale mauve blooms .   the graves were still just visible in the tangled vegetation .  in front of them stood cut me own throat dibbler  ankh morpork   s least successful businessman  with a sprig of lilac in his hat .   he caught sight of the watchmen and nodded to them .  they nodded back .  all three stood looking down at the seven graves .  only one had been maintained .  the marble headstone on that one was shiny and moss free  the turf was clipped  the stone border was sparkling .   moss had grown over the wooden markers of the other six  but it had been scraped off the central one  revealing the name       john keel      and carved underneath  by someone who had taken some pains  was       how do they rise up      a huge wreath of lilac flowers  bound with purple ribbon  had been placed on the grave .  on top of it  tied around with another piece of purple ribbon  was an egg .      mrs .  palm and mrs .  battye and some of the girls were up here earlier     said dibbler .     and  of course  madam always makes sure there   s the egg .         it   s nice  the way they always remember     said sergeant colon .   the three stood in silence .  they were not  on the whole  men with a vocabulary designed for times like this .  after a while  though  nobby felt moved to speak .      he gave me a spoon once     he said to the air in general .      yeah  i know     said colon .      my dad pinched it off me when he come out of prison  but it was my spoon     said nobby persistently .     that means a lot to a kid  your own spoon .         come to that  he was the first person to make me a sergeant     said colon .     got busted again  of course  but i knew i could do it again then .  he was a good copper .         he bought a pie off me  first week i was starting out     said dibbler .     ate it all .  didn   t spit out anything .      there was more silence .   after a while sergeant colon cleared his throat  a general signal to indicate that some sort of appropriate moment was now over .  there was a relaxation of muscles all around .      y   know  we ought to come up here one day with a billhook and clear this lot up a bit     said the sergeant .      you always say that  sarge  every year     said nobby as they walked away .     and we never do .         if i had a dollar for every copper   s funeral i   ve attended up here     said colon     i   d have   nineteen dollars and fifty pence .         fifty pence .     said nobby .      that was when corporal hildebiddle woke up just in time and banged on the lid     said colon .     that was before your time  o   course .  everyone said it was an amazin    recovery .         mr .  sergeant .      the three men turned .  coming toward them in a high speed sidle was the black clad  skinny figure of legitimate first  the cemetery   s resident gravedigger .   colon sighed .     yes  leggie .     he said .      good morrow  sweet       the gravedigger began  but sergeant colon waved a finger at him .      stop that right now     he said .     you know you   ve been warned before .  none of that    comic gravedigger    stuff .  it   s not funny and it   s not clever .  just say what you   ve got to say .  no silly bits .      leggie looked crestfallen .      well  good sirs           leggie  i   ve known you for years     said colon wearily .     just try  will you .         the deacon wants them graves dug up  fred     said leggie  in a sulky voice .     it   s more   n been thirty years .  long past time they was in the crypts           no     said fred colon .      but i   ve got a nice shelf for    em down there  fred     leggie pleaded .     right up near the front .  we need the space  fred .  it   s standing room only in here  and that   s the truth .  even the worms have to go in single file .  right up near the front  fred  where i can chat to    em when i   m having my tea .  how about that .      the watchmen and dibbler shared a glance .  most people in the city had been into leggie   s crypts  if only for a dare .  and it had come as a shock to most of them to realize that solemn burial was not for eternity but only for a handful of years  so that  in leggie   s words     my little wriggly helpers    could do their work .  after that  the last last resting place was the crypts and an entry in the huge ledgers .   leggie lived down there in the crypts .  as he said  he was the only one who did  and he liked the company .   leggie was generally considered weird  but conscientiously so .      this isn   t your idea  right .     said fred colon .   leggie looked down at his feet .      the new deacon   s a bit  well  new     he said .     you know   keen .  making changes .         you told him why they   re not being dug up .     said nobby .      he said that   s just ancient history     said leggie .     he says we all have to put the past behind us .         an    did you tell him he should take it up with vetinari .     said nobby .      yes  and he said he was sure his lordship was a forward thinking man who wouldn   t cling to relics of the past     said leggie .      sounds like he is new     said dibbler .      yeah     said nobby .     an    not likely to get old .  it   s okay  leggie  you can say you   ve asked us .      the gravedigger looked relieved .      thanks  nobby     he said .     and i   d just like to say that when your time comes  gents  you   ll be on a good shelf with a view .  i   ve put your names down in my ledger for them as comes after me .         well  that   s  er  very kind of you  leggie     said colon  wondering if it was .  because of pressures of space  bones in the crypt were stored by size  not by owner .  there were rooms of ribs .  there were avenues of femurs .  and shelf after shelf of skulls up near the entrance  of course  because a crypt without a lot of skulls wasn   t a proper crypt at all .  if some of the religions were right and there really was bodily resurrection one day  fred mused  there was going to be an awful lot of confusion and general milling about .      i   ve got just the spot       leggie began  and then stopped .  he pointed angrily toward the entrance .     you know what i said about him coming up here .      they turned .  corporal reg shoe  a whole bouquet of lilac tied to his helmet  was walking solemnly up the gravel path .  he had a long handled shovel over his shoulder .      it   s only reg     said fred .     he   s got a right to be here  leggie .  you know that .         he   s a dead man .  i   m not havin    a dead man in my cemetery .         it   s full of    em  leggie     said dibbler  trying to calm the man down .      yeah  but the rest of    em don   t walk in and out .         come on  leggie  you act like this every year     said fred colon .     he can   t help the way he was killed .  just because you   re a zombie doesn   t mean you   re a bad person .  he   s a useful lad  reg .  plus it   d be a lot neater up here if everyone looked after their plots like he does .  morning  reg .      reg shoe  gray faced but smiling  nodded at the four of them and strolled on .      and bringing his own shovel  too     muttered leggie .     it   s disgustin    .         i   ve always thought it was rather  you know  nice of him to do what he does     said fred .     you let him alone  leggie .  if you start throwing stones at him like you did the year before last  commander vimes   ll get to hear about it and there   ll be trouble .  be told .  you   re a good man with a  a              cadaver     said nobby .         but   well  leggie  you weren   t there     said colon .     that   s the start and finish of it .  reg was .  that   s all there is to it  leggie .  if you weren   t there  you don   t understand .  now you just run along and count the skulls again  i know you like that .  cheerio  leggie .      legitimate first watched them go as they walked away .  sergeant colon felt he was being measured up .      i   ve always wondered about his name     said nobby  turning and waving .     i mean   legitimate .         can   t blame a mother for being proud  nobby     said colon .          what else should i know today .     said vimes  as he and carrot shouldered their way through the streets .      we   ve had a letter from the black ribboners   sir  suggesting that it would be a great step forward for species    harmony in the city if you   d see your way clear to           they want a vampire in the watch .         yes  sir .  i believe many members of the watch committee think that despite your stated reservations it would be a good           does it look to you as if my body is dead .         no  sir .         then the answer   s no .  what else .      carrot riffled through a stuffed clipboard as he half ran to keep up .      the times says borogravia has invaded mouldavia     he announced .      is that good .  i can   t remember where it is .         both formerly part of the dark empire  sir .  right next door to uberwald .         whose side are we on .         the times said we should be supporting little mouldavia against the aggressor  sir .         i like borogravia already     snapped vimes .  the times had printed a particularly unflattering  in his opinion  cartoon of him the previous week  and to make matters worse  sybil had requested the original and had it framed .     and what does this all mean to us .         probably more refugees  sir .         ye gods  we   ve got no more room .  why do they keep coming here .         in search of a better life  sir  i think .         a better life .     said vimes .     here .         i think things are worse where they come from  sir     said carrot .      what kind of refugees are we talking about here .         mostly human  sir .         do you mean that most of them will be human  or that each individual will be mostly human .     said vimes .  after a while in ankh morpork  you learned to phrase that kind of question .      er  apart from humans the only species i   d heard of there in any numbers are the kvetch  sir .  they live in the deep woods and are covered in hair .         really .  well  we   ll probably find out more about them when we   re asked to employ one in the watch     said vimes sourly .     what else .         rather hopeful news  sir     said carrot  smiling .     you know the hooms .  the street gang .         what about them .         they initiated their first troll member .         what .  i thought they went around beating up trolls .  i thought that was the whole point .         well  apparently young calcite likes beating up trolls  too .         and that   s good .         in a way  sir  i suppose it   s a step forward .         united in hatred  you mean .         i suppose so  sir     said carrot .  he flicked papers back and forth on his clipboard .     now  what else have i got .  oh  yes  the river patrol boat has sunk again        where did i go wrong .  thought vimes as the litany went on .  i was a copper once .  a real copper .  i chased people .  i was a hunter .  it was what i did best .  i knew where i was anywhere in the city by the feel of the street under my boots .  and now look at me .  a duke .  commander of the watch .  a political animal .  i have to know about who   s fighting who a thousand miles away  just in case that   s going to mean riots here .   when did i last go on patrol .  last week .  last month .  and it   s never a proper point patrol     cos the sergeants make damn sure everyone knows i   ve left the building and every damn constable reeks of armor polish and has had a shave by the time i get there  even if i nip down the back streets  and that thought  at least  was freighted with a little pride  because it showed he didn   t employ stupid sergeants  .  i never stand all night in the rain  or fight for my life rolling in the gutter with some thug  and i never move above a walk .  that   s all been taken away .  and for what .   comfort  power  money  and a wonderful wife      er      which was a good thing  of course  but   even so     damn .  but i   m not a copper anymore  i   m a  a manager .  i have to talk to the damn committee as if they   re children .  i go to receptions and wear damn stupid toy armor .  it   s all politics and paperwork .  it   s all got too big .   what had happened to the days when it was all so simple .   faded like the lilac  he thought .   they entered the palace and went up the main stairs to the oblong office .   the patrician of ankh morpork was standing looking out of the window when they entered .  the room was otherwise deserted .      ah  vimes     he said without turning around .     i thought you might be late .  in the circumstances  i dismissed the committee .  they were sorry  as indeed was i  sorry to hear about stronginthearm .  no doubt you have been writing the official letter .      vimes flashed a questioning expression at carrot  who rolled his eyes and shrugged .  vetinari found out things very quickly .      yes  that   s right     said vimes .      and on such a beautiful day as this  too     said vetinari .     although there   s a storm heading our way  i see .     he turned .  he had a sprig of lilac pinned to his robe .      lady sybil is doing well .     he said  sitting down .      you tell me     said vimes .      some things can   t be hurried  no doubt     said vetinari smoothly  shuffling the papers .     let me see now  let me see  there were just a few points that i should deal with   ah  the regular letter from our religious friends at the temple of small gods .     he carefully removed it from the pile and set it to one side .     i think i shall invite the new deacon to tea and explain matters to him .  now  where was i   ah  the political situation in   yes .      the door opened .  drumknot  the chief clerk  came in .      message for his grace     he said  although he handed it to lord vetinari .  the patrician passed it  very politely  across the desk .  vimes unfolded it .      it   s off the clacks .     he yelled .     we   ve got carcer cornered in new hall .  i   ve got to get down there now .         how exciting     said lord vetinari  standing up suddenly .     the call to the chase .  but is it necessary for you to attend personally  your grace .      vimes gave him a gray look .     yes     he said .     because if i don   t  y   see  some poor sod who   s been trained by me to do the right thing is going to try to arrest the bugger .     he turned to carrot .     captain  get on it right now .  clacks  pigeons  runners  whatever .  i want everyone answering this shout  okay .  but no one  i repeat  no one is to try to tackle him without a lot of backup .  understood .  and get swires airborne .  oh  damn           what   s wrong  sir .     said carrot .      this message is from littlebottom .  she sent it straight here .  what   s she doing there .  she   s forensic .  she   s not street .  she   ll do it by the book .         shouldn   t she .     said vetinari .      no .  carcer needs an arrow in his leg just to get his attention .  you shoot first              and ask questions later .     said vetinari .   vimes paused at the door and said     there   s nothing i want to ask him .          vimes had to slow down for breath in sator square  and that was disgusting .  a few years ago he   d only really be getting into his stride by now .  but the storm rolling over the plains was driving the heat before it  and it wouldn   t do for the commander to turn up wheezing .  as it was  even after pausing behind a street market stall for a few gulps of air  he doubted if he had enough wind left for a lengthy sentence .   to his tremendous relief  an entirely unwounded corporal cheery littlebottom was waiting by the university walls .  she saluted .      reporting  sir     she said .      mm     murmured vimes .      i spotted a couple of trolls on traffic duty  sir     said cheery     so i   ve sent them around to the water bridge .  then sergeant detritus turned up and i told   i advised him to go into the university via the main gate and get up high .  sergeant colon and nobby arrived and i sent them along to the bridge of size           why .     said vimes .      because i doubt if he   s really going to try going that way     said cheery  her face a picture of innocence .  vimes had to stop himself from nodding .     and then as more people come along i   m putting them around the perimeter .  but i think he   s gone up and he   s staying high .         why .         because how   s he going to fight his way out through a lot of wizards  sir .  his best chance is to sneak around on the roofs and drop down somewhere quiet .  there   s lots of hiding places and he can get all the way to peach pie street without coming down .      forensic  thought vimes .  hah .  and with any luck he doesn   t know about buggy .      well thought out     he said .      thank you  sir .  would you mind standing a bit closer to this wall  sir .         what for .      something shattered on the cobbles .  vimes was suddenly flat against the wall .      he   s got a crossbow  sir     said cheery .     we think he stole it from stronginthearm .  but he   s not very good with it .         well done  corporal     said vimes weakly .     good job .     he glanced around the square behind him .  the wind was whipping at the awnings of the market stalls and the traders  with occasional looks at the sky  were covering their wares .      but we can   t just let him hang around up there     he went on .     he   ll start taking potshots and he   s bound to hit someone .         why would he do that  sir .         carcer doesn   t need a reason     said vimes .     he just needs an excuse .     a movement far above caught his eye  and he grinned .   a large bird was gaining height over the city .       the heron  mumbling complaints  fought for altitude in big  sweeping circles .  the city whirled around corporal buggy swires as he gripped even harder with his knees  and he swung the bird downwind and it landed with a staggering run on the top of the tower of art  the highest building in the city .   with a practiced movement  the gnome sliced through the string holding the portable semaphore in place  and leaped down after it into the compost of ivy leaves and old ravens    nests that carpeted the top of the tower .   the heron watched him with round eyed stupidity .  buggy had tamed it in the usual gnome way  you painted yourself green like a frog and hung out in the marshes  croaking  and then  when a heron tried to eat you  you ran up its beak and beaned it .  by the time it came around you   d blown the special oil up its nostrils   that had taken all day to make  and the stink of it had emptied the watch house   and it took one look at you and thought you were its mum .   a heron was useful .  it could carry equipment .  but buggy preferred a sparrowhawk for traffic patrol .  it was better for hovering .   he slotted the portable semaphore arms onto the post he   d secretly installed weeks ago .  then he unshipped a tiny telescope from the heron   s saddlebags and strapped it onto the edge of the stone  looking almost straight down .  buggy liked moments like this .  it was the only time that everyone else was smaller than him .      now   let   s see what we can see     he muttered .   there were the university buildings .  there was the clock tower of old tom  and the unmistakable bulk of sergeant detritus climbing among the nearby chimneys .  the yellow light of the gathering storm glinted off the helmets of watchmen who were hurrying through the streets .  and there  creeping along behind the parapet        gotcha     he said quietly  and reached for the handles of the semaphore .          d   t   r   t   s space h   d   n   g space o   l space t   m     said cheery .   vimes nodded .  detritus was on the roof near the tower of old tom .  and detritus carried a siege crossbow that three men couldn   t lift  and had converted it to fire a thick sheaf of arrows all at once .  mostly they shattered in the air because of the forces involved  and the target was hit by an expanding cloud of burning splinters .  vimes had banned him from using it on people  but it was a damn good way of getting into buildings .  it could open the front door and the back door at the same time .      tell him to fire a warning shot     he said .     if he hits carcer with that thing we won   t even find a corpse .     though i   d quite like to find a corpse  he added to himself .      yes  sir .     cheery pulled a couple of white painted paddles out of her belt  sighted on the top of the tower  and sent a brief signal .  there was an answering signal from the distant buggy .      d   t   r   t   s space w   r   n   g space s   h   t     cheery muttered to herself as she waved the rest of the message .   there was another answering dip from above .  a moment later a red flare shot up from the top of the tower and exploded .  it was an efficient way of getting everyone to pay attention .  then vimes saw the message relayed .   around the university buildings  watchmen who   d also seen the order ducked into doorways .  they knew about the bow .   there were a few seconds for the troll to work out the spelling  a distant heavy thud  a sound like a swarm of hellish bees  and then a crash of tiles and masonry .  pieces of tile rained down into the square .  an entire chimney  still with a wisp of smoke coming from it  smashed down a few yards from where vimes was standing .   then there was the patter of dust and small bits of wood  and a gentle shower of pigeon feathers .   vimes shook some flakes of mortar off his helmet .      yes  well  i think he   s been warned     he said .   half a weathercock landed next to the chimney .   cheery blew some feathers off her telescope and sighted on the top of the tower again .      buggy says he   s stopped moving  sir     she reported .      really .  you surprise me .     vimes adjusted his belt .     and now you can give me your crossbow .  i   m going up .         sir  you said no one was to try to arrest him .  that   s why i sent the signal to you .         that   s right .  i   m going to arrest him .  right now .  while he   s counting all his bits to check that he   s still got    em .  tell detritus what i   m doing     cos i don   t want to end up as a hundred and sixty pounds of cocktail delicacies .  no  don   t keep opening your mouth like that .  by the time we   ve sorted out backup and armor and got everyone lined up he   ll have dug in somewhere else .      the last words were delivered at a run .   vimes reached a door and darted inside .  new hall was student accommodation  but it was still only half past ten  so most of them would be in bed .  a few faces looked around doors and vimes trotted along the corridor and reached the stairwell at the far end .  that took him   walking now  and rather less sure of his future   to the top floor .  let   s see  he   d been here before   yes  there was a door ajar  and a glimpse of mops and buckets suggested that this was a janitor   s closet .   with  at the far end  a ladder leading up to the roof .   vimes carefully cocked the crossbow .   so carcer had a watch crossbow  too .  they were good classic single shot models  but they took a while to reload .  if he fired at vimes and missed  then that was the only shot he   d get .  after that   you couldn   t plan .   vimes climbed the ladder  and an old song came back .      they rise feet up  feet up  feet up       he hissed under his breath .   he stopped just below the edge of the open trapdoor onto the leads .  carcer wouldn   t fall for the old helmet on stick trick  not with just one shot available .  he   d just have to risk it .   vimes thrust his head up  turned it quickly  ducked out of sight for a moment and then came through the opening in a rush .  he rolled clumsily when he hit the leads  and rose into a crouch .  there was no one else there .  he was still alive .  he breathed out .   a sloping  gabled roof rose up beside him .  vimes crept along  wedged himself against a chimney stack peppered with splinters of wood  and glanced up at the tower .   the sky above it was livid blue black .  storms picked up a lot of personality as they rolled across the plains  and this one looked like a record breaker .  but brilliant sunlight picked out the tower of art and  at the top  the tiny dots of buggy   s frantic signal     o   o   o     officer in trouble .  a brother is hurtin    .   vimes spun around .  there was no one creeping up on him .  he eased himself around the chimneys and there  tucked between another couple of stacks and out of sight of everyone except vimes and the celestial buggy  was carcer .   he was taking aim .   vimes turned his head to spot the target .   fifty yards away  carrot was picking his way across the top of the university   s high energy magic building .   the bloody fool was never any good at concealment .  oh  he ducked and crept  and  against all logic  that made him more noticeable .  he didn   t understand the art of thinking himself invisible .  and there he was  furtively shlepping through the debris on the roof and looking as inconspicuous as a big duck in a small bathtub .  and he   d come without backup .   the fool     carcer was aiming carefully .  the roof of the hemb was a maze of abandoned equipment and carrot was moving along behind the raised platform that held the huge bronze spheres known throughout the city as the wizards    balls  which discharged surplus magic if   or  more usually  when   experiments in the hall below fouled up .  carrot  screened by all that  was not making such a good target  after all .   vimes raised his crossbow .   thunder   rolled .  it was the roll of a giant iron cube down the stairways of the gods  a crackling  thudding crash that tore the sky in half and shook the building .   carcer glanced up and saw vimes .          wotcha doin     mifter .      buggy didn   t budge from the telescope .  a crowbar wouldn   t have separated him at this point .      shut up  ye daft corbies .     he muttered .   both men below had fired  and both men had missed because they were trying to fire and dodge at the same time .   something hard prodded buggy   s shoulder .      wot   s happ   nin     mifter .     said the insistent voice .   he turned .  there were a dozen bedraggled ravens behind him  looking like little old men in ill fitting black cloaks .  they were tower of art birds .  hundreds of generations of living in a highly charged magical environment had raised the intelligence level of what had been bright creatures to begin with .  but  although the ravens were intelligent  these weren   t hugely clever .  they just had a more persistent kind of stupidity  as befitted birds for whom the exciting panorama of the city below was a kind of daytime tv .      push off .     shouted buggy and turned back to the telescope .  there was carcer  running  and vimes running after him  and here came the hail     it turned the world white .  it thudded around him and made his helmet ring .  hailstones as big as his head bounced on the stone and hit buggy from underneath .  cursing and shielding his face with his arms  hammered all the time by shattering crystal balls  each one predicting a future of pain  he skidded and slid across the rolling ice .  he reached an ivy hung arch between two lesser turrets  where the heron had already taken refuge  and fell inside .  frozen shrapnel still ricocheted in and stung him  but at least he could see and breathe .   a beak prodded him sharply in the back .      wot   s happ   nin    now  mifter .          carcer landed heavily on the arch between the student hall and the main buildings  almost lost his footing on the tiles  and hesitated .  an arrow from a watchman below grazed his leg .   vimes dropped down behind him  just as the hail hit .   cursing and slipping  one man followed the other across the arch .  carcer reached a mass of ivy that led up onto the roof of the library and scrambled up it  scattering ice below .   vimes grabbed the ivy just as carcer disappeared onto the flat roof .  he looked around at a crash behind him  and saw carrot trying to make his way along the wall from the high energy magic building .  the hail was forming a halo of ice fragments around him .      stay there .     vimes bellowed .   carrot   s reply was lost in the noise .   vimes waved his arms and then grabbed at the ivy as his foot slipped .      bloody stay there .     he yelled .     that is an order .  you   ll go over .      he turned and started up the wet  cold vines .   the wind dropped  and the last few hailstones bounced off the roof .   vimes stopped a few feet from the top of the ivy  worked his feet into firm footholds in the ancient  knotted stems  and reached up for a decent hold .   then he thrust himself up  left hand ready  caught the boot that swung toward him  and carried on rising  pushing carcer off balance .  the man sprawled backward on the slippery hail  tried to get on his feet  and slipped again .  vimes tugged himself onto the roof  stepped forward  and found his legs skidding away beneath him .  both he and carcer got up  tried to move  and fell over again .   from a prone position the man landed a kick on vimes   s shoulder  sending both of them sliding away in opposite directions  and then turned over and scuttled on all fours around the library   s big glass and metal dome .  he grabbed the rusty frame  hauled himself upright  and pulled out a knife .      come and get me  then     he said .  there was another roll of thunder .      i don   t have to     said vimes .     i just have to wait .     at least until i get my breath back  he thought .      why   re you picking on me .  what   m i supposed to have done .         couple of murders ring a bell .     said vimes .   if injured innocence was money  carcer   s face was his fortune .      i don   t know anything about           i   m not up here to play games  carcer .  knock it off .         you going to take me alive  your grace .         you know  i don   t want to .  but people think it   s neater all round if i do .      there was a clattering of tiles away on the left  and a thud as a huge siege bow was rested on the ridge of a nearby roof .  the head of detritus arose behind it .      sorry about dat  mister vimes  hard to climb up in dat hail .  jus    stand back .         you   re going to let it shoot me .     said carcer .  he tossed the knife away .     an unarmed man .         trying to escape     said vimes .  but this was starting to go bad .  he could feel it .      me .  i   m just standing here  haha .      and there it was .  that bloody laugh  on top of that damn grin .  it was never far away .     haha    didn   t come close to doing it the injustice it deserved .  it was more a sort of modulation to the voice  an irritatingly patronizing chortle that suggested that all this was somehow funny and you hadn   t got the joke .   trouble was  you couldn   t shoot someone for having an annoying laugh .  and he was just standing there .  if he ran  you could shoot him .  admittedly  it would be detritus doing the shooting  and while with that bow it was technically possible to shoot to wound  the people you were wounding would probably be in the building next door .   but carcer was just waiting there  insulting the world by his existence .   in fact he wasn   t merely standing there now .  in one movement  he   d swung himself onto the lower slopes of the library   s dome .  the glass panes   at least  the glass panes that had survived the freak hail   creaked in the iron framework .      stop right there .     vimes bellowed .     and come down .         now where could i go .     said carcer  grinning at him .     i   m just waiting for you to arrest me  right .  hey  i can see your house from up here .      what   s under the dome .  thought vimes .  how high are the bookcases .  there   s other floors in the library  aren   t there .  like galleries .  but you can definitely look up at the dome from the ground floor  right .  if you were careful  could you swing onto a gallery from the edge of the dome .  it   d be risky  but if a man knew he was going to swing anyway     picking his way with care  he reached the edge of the dome .  carcer climbed up a little further .      i warn you  carcer           only high spirits  mister grace  haha .  can   t blame a man for trying to enjoy his last few minutes of freedom  can you .      i can see your house from up here     vimes hauled himself onto the dome .  carcer cheered .      well done  your vimes .     he said  easing himself toward the top .      don   t mess me about  carcer .  it   ll go badly for you .         badder than it   s going to go anyway .     carcer glanced down through a smashed pane .      long way down  mister vimes .  i reckon a man   d die instantly falling all that way  wouldn   t he .      vimes glanced down  and carcer leaped .   it didn   t go the way he   d planned .  vimes had been tensed for something like this .  after a complicated moment  carcer was lying on the iron latticework  one arm under him  the other outflung and being banged heavily on the metal by vimes .  the knife it had held skidded away down the dome .      gods  you must think i   m stupid     vimes growled .     you wouldn   t throw away a knife  carcer  if you didn   t have another one .      vimes   s face was close to the man   s now  close enough to look into the eyes above that chirpy grin and watch the demons waving .      you   re hurting me  and that   s not allowed .         oh  i wouldn   t want anything to happen to you  carcer     said vimes .     i want to see you in front of his lordship .  i just want to hear you admit something for once .  i just want to see that bloody cheeky grin wiped off your face .  sergeant detritus .         sah .     shouted the troll from his distant ridge .      make a signal .  i want people up here now .  me and carcer are just going to stay nice and quiet here  so   s he doesn   t try any tricks .         right  sir .     with another distant clatter of doomed tiles  the troll disappeared from view .      you shouldn   t have sent captain carrot away     muttered carcer .     he doesn   t like watchmen bullying innocent civilians           it is true that he has yet to master some of the finer details of de facto street policing     said vimes  maintaining his grip .     anyway  i   m not hurting you  i   m protecting you .  wouldn   t like you to fall all that way .      thunder rumbled again .  the sky wasn   t just storm black now .  there were pinks and purples in the clouds  as though the sky was bruised .  vimes could see the clouds moving like snakes in a sack  to an endless sullen rumbling .  he wondered if the wizards had been messing about with the weather .   something was happening to the air .  it tasted of burned metal and flints .  a weathercock on top of the dome began to spin round and round .      i didn   t think you was stupid  mister vimes           what .     said vimes  looking down suddenly .  carcer was smiling cheerfully .      i said i didn   t think you was stupid  mister vimes .  i know a clever copper like you   d think i   d got two knives .         yeah  right     said vimes .  he could feel his hair trying to stand on end .  little blue caterpillars of light were crackling over the ironwork of the dome  and even over his armor .      mister vimes .         what .     vimes snapped .  smoke was rising from the weathercock   s bearings .      i got three knives  mister vimes     said carcer  bringing his arm up .   the lightning struck .       windows blew out and iron gutters melted .  roofs lifted into the air and settled again .  buildings shook .   but this storm had been blowing in from far across the plains  pushing the natural background magic ahead of it .  it dumped it now  all in one go .   they said afterward that the bolt of lightning hit a clockmaker   s shop in the street of cunning artificers  stopping all the clocks at that instant .  but that was nothing .  in baker street  a couple who had never met before became electrically attracted to one another and were forced to get married after two days for the sake of public decency .  in the assassins    guild  the chief armorer became hugely  and  since he was in the armory at the time  tragically  attractive to metal .  eggs fried in their baskets  apples roasted on the greengrocers    shelves .  candles lit themselves .  cartwheels exploded .  and the ornate tin bath of the archchancellor of unseen university was lifted neatly off the floor  sizzled across his study  and then flew off the balcony and onto the lawn in the octangle several stories below  without spilling more than a cupful of suds .   archchancellor mustrum ridcully paused with his long handled scrubbing brush hovering halfway down his back  and stared .   tiles smashed to the ground .  water boiled in the ornamental fountain nearby .   ridcully ducked  as a stuffed badger  the origin of which was never ascertained  flew across the lawn and smashed through a window .   he winced  as he was hit by a brief and inexplicable shower of small cogwheels  which pattered down all around him .   he stared  as half a dozen watchmen dashed into the octangle and headed up the steps to the library .   then  gripping the sides of the bath  the archchancellor stood up .  foaming water cascaded off him  as it would off some ancient leviathan erupting from the abyssal sea .      mister stibbons .     he bellowed  his voice bouncing off the imposing walls .     where the is my hat .      he sat down again and waited .   there was a few minutes of silence  and then ponder stibbons  head of inadvisably applied magic and pra elector of unseen university  came running out of the main door carrying ridcully   s pointy hat .   the archchancellor snatched at it and rammed it on his head .      very well     he said  standing up again .     now  will care to tell m at the is going on .  and why old toming repeatedly .         been a of magic  sir .  i someone up the mechanism .     ponder shouted above the sound destroying silences .    there was a dying metallic noise from the big clock tower .  ponder and ridcully waited a few moments  but the city stayed full of normal noise  like the collapse of masonry and distant screams .      right     said ridcully  as if grudgingly awarding the world a mark for trying .     what was all that about  stibbons .  and why are there policemen in the library .         big magical storm  sir .  several thousand gigathaums .  i believe the watch is chasing a criminal .         well  they can   t just run in here without askin        said ridcully  stepping out of the bath and striding forward .     what do we pay our taxes for  after all .         er  we don   t actually pay taxes  sir     said ponder  running after him .     the system is that we promise to pay taxes if the city ever asks us to  provided the city promises never to ask us  sir .  we make a voluntary           well  at least we have an arrangement  stibbons .         yes  sir .  may i point out that you           and that means they have to ask permission .  the essential decencies must be maintained     said ridcully firmly .     and i am the master of this college .         on the subject of  er  decencies  sir  you are not  in fact  wearing        ridcully strode through the open doors of the library .      what is going on here .     he demanded .   the watchmen turned and stared .  a large blob of foam  which up until that point had been performing sterling service in the cause of the essential decencies  slipped slowly to the floor .      well .     he snapped .     haven   t you lot seen a wizard before .      a watchman snapped to attention and saluted .     captain carrot  sir .  we   ve  er  never seen so much of a wizard  sir .      ridcully gave him the slow blank stare used by those with acute uptake grasping deficiency .      what   s he talkin    about  stibbons .     he said out of the corner of his mouth .      you   re  er  insufficiently dressed  sir .         what .  i   ve got my hat on  haven   t i .         yes  sir           hat   wizard  wizard   hat .  everything else is frippery .  anyway  i   m sure we   re all men of the world     ridcully added  looking around .  for the first time  he took in other details about the watchmen .     and dwarfs of the world   ah   trolls of the world  too  i see   and   women of the world  too  i note   er       the archchancellor lapsed into a moment   s silence  and then said     mr .  stibbons .         yes  sir .         would you be so kind as to run up to my rooms and fetch my robe .         of course  sir .         and  in the meantime  please be so good as to lend me your hat           but you do actually have your hat on  sir     said ponder .      quite so  quite so     said ridcully slowly and carefully through his fixed grin .     and now  mister stibbons  in addition  right now  i wish you  in fact  to lend  to me  your hat  please .         oh     said ponder .     er   yes        a few minutes later a thoroughly clean and decent and clothed archchancellor was standing in the very center of the library  staring up at the damaged dome  while beside him ponder stibbons   who  for some reason  had elected to continue to remain hatless even though his hat had been handed back to him   stared glumly at some magical instruments .      nothing at all .     said ridcully .      ook     said the librarian .       you   ve searched everywhere .         he can   t search everywhere in this library  sir     said ponder .     that would take more time than actually could possibly exist .  but all the mundane shelves  certainly .  um .      carrot turned to ponder .     what was the    um    for  please  sir .         you understand that this is a magical library .  and that means that even in normal circumstances there is an area of high magical potential above the bookshelves .         i have been in here before     said carrot .      then you know that time with libraries is   somewhat more flexible .     said ponder .     given the additional power of the storm  it might just be possible that           are you going to tell me he   s been moved in time .     said the watchman .   ponder was impressed .  he hadn   t been brought up to believe that watchmen were clever .  however  he took care not to show it .      would that it were that simple     he said .     however  um  the lightning appears to have added a random lateral component           a what .     said ridcully .      you mean in time and space .     said carrot .  ponder felt himself getting rattled .  nonwizards shouldn   t be that quick .      not   exactly     he said and gave up .     i   m really going to have to work on this  archchancellor .  some of the readings i   m getting can   t possibly be real .          vimes knew that he had woken up .  there had been darkness and rain and a terrible pain in his face .   then there had been another flowering of pain in the back of his neck  and a feeling of being pulled this way and that .   and now there was light .   he could see it through his eyelids .  his left eyelid  anyway .  nothing but pain was happening on the other side of his face .  he kept the eye shut  and strained his hearing instead .   someone was moving about .  there was a clink of metal .  a woman   s voice said     he   s awake .         are you sure .     said a man   s voice .     how can you tell .         because i   m good at telling if a man is asleep     said the woman .   vimes opened his eye .  he was lying on a bench or table of some sort .  a young woman was leaning against the wall next to him  and her dress and bearing and the way she leaned filed her immediately in vimes   s policemen brain as  seamstress  but one of the bright ones .  the man had a long black robe and a silly floppy hat  and got filed under  help  i   m in the hands of a doctor .   he sat bolt upright .      you lay one hand on me and i   ll thump you .     he yelled  trying to swing his legs off the table .  half his head burst into flame .      i should take it easy  if i was you     said the doctor  gently pushing him back .     that was a very nasty cut .  and don   t touch the eyepatch .         cut .     said vimes  his hand brushing the stiff cloth of an eyepatch .  memories interlocked .     carcer .  did anyone get him .         whoever attacked you got away     said the doctor .      after that fall .     said vimes .     he must   ve been limping  at least .  look  i   ve got to get        and then he noticed all the other things .  he   d been picking them up all the time  but only now did the subconscious present the list .   he wasn   t wearing his own clothes        what happened to my uniform .     he said  and he noticed the i told you so expression the woman gave the doctor .      whoever attacked you stripped you down to your drawers and left you lying in the street     she said .     i found you some spare clothes at my place .  it   s amazing what people leave behind .         who took my armor .         i never know names     said the woman .     i saw a bunch of men running off carrying stuff  though .         ordinary thieves .  didn   t they leave a receipt .         no .     she said  laughing .     why should they .         and are we allowed to ask questions .     said the doctor  tidying his tools .   none of this was right        well  i mean   thank you  yes     said vimes .      what   s your name .      vimes   s hand stopped halfway to his face again .      you mean you don   t know me .     he said .      should we .     said the doctor .   none of this was right        this is ankh morpork  isn   t it .     said vimes .      er  yes     said the doctor  and turned to the woman .     there was a blow to the head     he said     but i wouldn   t have thought it was that bad           look  i   m wasting time     said the woman .     who are you  mister .      everyone in the city knew vimes  surely .  the guild of seamstresses certainly did .  and the doctor didn   t look stupid .  perhaps this was not the right time to be totally truthful .  he might just be somewhere where being a copper wasn   t a good thing to be .  it might be dangerous to be vimes and  right now  he wasn   t well enough to deal with it .      keel     he said .  the name just dropped into his mind  it had been bubbling just under the surface of his thoughts all day  ever since the lilac .      yeah  right     said the woman  smiling .     want to make up a first name .         john     said vimes .      appropriate .  well   john  it   s like this .  men lying flat out and naked around here aren   t that uncommon .  and  it   s a funny thing  but they don   t usually want anyone to know their real name  or where they live .  you won   t be the first one dr .  lawn here has patched up .  my name   s rosie .  and now there   s a little fee  you understand .  for both of us .         all right  all right  i know how this goes     said vimes  holding up his hands .     this is the shades  right .     they both nodded .     okay  then .  thank you .  i haven   t got any money  obviously  but once i   ve got home           i   ll escort you  shall i .     said the woman  handing him a badly styled coat and a pair of antique boots .     i wouldn   t like you to be attacked by anything .  a sudden loss of memory  for example .      vimes snapped  but very gently .  his face hurt and there were plenty of other bruises everywhere  and he was dressed in a suit that smelled like a privy .  he   d go up to the watch house  get cleaned and changed and make a quick report  and head on home .  and this young lady could spend a night in the cells and then be handed over to the seamstresses    guild .  they came down heavily on extortion like this .  it was bad for the trade .      all right     he said .  and pulled the boots on .  the soles were paper thin  and they were too tight .   dr .  lawn waved his hands in a general gesture of dismissal .     he   s all yours  rosie .  you leave that patch on for a few days  mr .  keel  and with any luck you   ll have a working eye .  someone took a slash at you with a sharp knife .  i   ve done the best i can  and the stitching is good  but you   re going to have a nasty scar .      vimes raised his hand to his cheek yet again .      and don   t pick at it .     lawn snapped .      come on   john     said rosie .     let   s get you home where you belong .      they stepped out .  water was dripping from the eaves  but the rain had eased .      i live up past pseudopolis yard     said vimes .      lead on     said rosie .   they hadn   t reached the end of the street before vimes was aware that a couple of dark figures had fallen in behind them .  he was about to turn  but rosie clamped a hand on his arm .      don   t bother them and they won   t bother you     she said .     they   re just coming with us for protection .         whose .  yours or mine .      rosie laughed .     both     she said .      yes  you just keep on walking  kind sir  and we   ll be as quiet as little mice     said a shrill voice behind him .  a slightly deeper one said     that   s right  dearie .  just be a good boy and aunty dotsie won   t have to open her handbag .         that   s dotsie and sadie .     said vimes .     the agony aunts .  well  they bloody well know who i am .      he turned .   the dark figures  both wearing old fashioned black straw hoods  stepped back .  in the gloom there were a number of metallic noises  and vimes forced himself to relax a little .  even though they were  more or less  on the same side as the watch  you never quite knew where you were with the agony aunts .  of course  that   s what made them so useful .  any customer disturbing the peace in one of the local houses of good repute feared the threat of the aunts far more than he did the watch .  the watch had rules .  and the watch didn   t have dotsie   s handbag .  and sadie could do terrible things with a parrot headed umbrella .      come on     he said .     dotsie .  sadie .  let   s not mess about  eh .      something prodded him in the chest .  he looked down .  the thing had a carved parrot head on it .      you must keep walking  kind sir     said a voice .      while you   ve still got toes  dearie     said another voice .      probably a good idea     said rosie  tugging vimes   s arm .     but i can tell you   ve impressed them .         how .         you   re not bent double and making bubbling noises .  come along  mystery man .      vimes stared ahead  looking out for the blue light of pseudopolis yard .  somehow  it   d all make sense there .   but when he got there  there was no blue light over the archway .  there were just a few lights upstairs .   vimes hammered on the door until it opened a crack .      what the hell   s going on here .     he demanded of the nose and one eye that was the visible totality of the occupant .     and get out of the way .      he pushed the door back and strode in .   it wasn   t the watch house  not inside .  there were the familiar stairs  right enough  but there was a wall right across the charge room  and carpets on the floor  and tapestries on the wall   and a housemaid holding a tray  and staring  and dropping the tray  and screaming .      where are all my officers .     vimes yelled .      you leave this minute  d   you hear .  you can   t just come in like that .  you get out of here .      vimes turned and confronted the old man who   d opened the door .  he looked like a butler  and had picked up a cudgel .  perhaps because of nerves  or maybe just because of general elderly tremors  the tip of the cudgel waved and weaved under his nose .  vimes snatched it and threw it on the floor .      what is going on .     he demanded .  the old man looked as bewildered as he was .   vimes felt an odd  hollow terror welling up inside him .  he darted back through the open door and into the wet night .  rosie and the aunts had melted away in the darkness  as night people do when trouble looms  but vimes ran on and into kings way  pushing aside other pedestrians and dodging the occasional carriage .   he was getting a second wind when he reached scoone avenue and turned into the driveway of number one .  he wasn   t sure what he   d find  but the place looked normal and there were torches burning on either side of the door .  familiar gravel crunched under his feet .   he went to hammer on the door  but steeled himself not to  and rang the bell instead .   after a moment the door was opened by a butler .      thank goodness .     said vimes .     it   s me  man .  been in a fight .  nothing to worry about .  how is           what do you want .     said the butler coldly .  he took a step back  which brought him more fully into the light of the hall lamps .  vimes had never seen him before .      what   s happened to willikins .     said vimes .      the scullery boy .     now the butler   s tone was icy .     if you are a relative  i suggest you enquire around at the tradesmen   s entrance .  you ought to know better than to come to the front door .      vimes tried to think how to deal with this  but his fist didn   t bother to wait .  it laid the man out quite cleanly .      no time for this     said vimes  stepping over him .  he stood in the middle of the big hall and cupped his hands .      mrs .  content .  sybil .     he yelled  feeling the terror twist and knot inside him .      yes .     said a voice from what vimes had always called the ghastly pink drawing room  and sybil stepped out .   it was sybil .  the voice was right  and the eyes were right  and the way she stood was right .  but the age wasn   t right .  this was a girl  far too young to be sybil     she looked from him to the prone butler .      did you do that to forsythe .     she said .      i   er   i   it   s    .  there   s been a mistake       vimes murmured  backing away .  but sybil was already pulling a sword off the wall .  it wasn   t there for show .  vimes couldn   t remember if his wife had ever learned to fence  but several feet of edged weapon is quite threatening enough when wielded by an angry amateur .  amateurs sometimes get lucky .   he backed away hurriedly .      it   s been a mistake   wrong house   mistaken identity       he almost tripped over the fallen butler but managed to turn this into a staggering run through the doorway and down the steps .   wet leaves brushed against him as he blundered through the shrubbery to the gateway  where he leaned against the wall and gulped for air .   that bloody library .  hadn   t he heard something once  about how you could walk through time or something there .  all those magical books pressed together did something strange .   sybil had been so young .  she   d looked sixteen .  no wonder there wasn   t a watch house in pseudopolis yard .  they   d only moved in there a few years go .   the water was soaking through the cheap clothes .  back home   somewhere   was his huge leather greatcoat  heavy with oil  warm as toast     think  think  don   t let the terror take control     perhaps he could go and explain things to sybil .  after all  she was still sybil  wasn   t she .  kind to bedraggled creatures .  but even the softest heart would be inclined to harden when a rough  desperate man with a fresh scar and bad clothes barged into the house and said he was going to be your husband .  a young woman could get quite the wrong idea  and he wouldn   t want that  not while she was holding a sword .  besides  lord ramkin was probably still alive and he   d been a blood thirsty old devil  as far as vimes could recall .   he slumped against the wall and reached for a cigar  and the terror twisted him again .   there was nothing in his pocket .  nothing at all .  no pantweed   s slim panatellas and  more important  no cigar case     it had been made specially .  it had a slight curve .  it had always nestled in his pocket since the day sybil had given it to him .  it was as near part of him as any thing could be .      we are here  and this is now .     constable visit  a strict believer in the omnian religion  occasionally quoted from their holy book .  vimes understood it to mean  in less exalted copperspeak  that you have to do the job that is in front of you .   i am here  vimes thought  and this is then .  and less conscious parts of his brain added  you have no friends here .  no home here .  no purpose here .  you are alone here .   no   not alone  said a part that was much  much deeper even than the terror  and was always on watch .   someone was watching him .   a figure detached itself from the damp shadows of the street  and walked toward him .  vimes couldn   t make out the face  but that didn   t matter .  he knew it would be smiling that special smile of the predator who knows he has the prey under his paw  and knows that the prey knows this  too  and also knows that the prey is desperately going to act as if they   re having a perfectly friendly conversation  because the prey wants so much for this to be the case     you don   t want to die here  said the deep dark part of vimes   s soul .      got a light  mister .     said the predator .  he didn   t even bother to wave an unlit cigarette .      why  yes  of course     said vimes .  he went as if to pat his pocket but swung around  arm outstretched  and caught a man creeping up behind him right across the ear .  then he leaped for the light seeker in front of him and bore him to the ground with an arm across his throat .   it would have worked .  he knew  afterward  that it really would have worked .  if there hadn   t been two more men in the shadows  it would have worked .  as it was  he managed to kick one of them in the kneecap before he felt the garrote go round his neck .   he was pulled upright  the scar screaming in pain as he tried to clutch at the rope .      you hold him right there     said a voice .     look what he did to jez .  damn .  i   m gonna kick him in        the shadows moved .  vimes  struggling for breath  his one good eye watering  was only vaguely aware of what was happening .  but there were some grunts  and some soft  strange noises  and the pressure on his neck was abruptly released .   he fell forward  and then  reeling a little  struggled to his feet .  a couple of men were lying on the ground .  one was bent double  making little bubbling noises .  and  far off and getting further  there were running footsteps .      lucky we found you in time  kind sir     said a voice right behind him .      not lucky for some  dearie     said one right next to it .   rosie stepped forward  out of the gloom .      i think you ought to come back with us     she said .     you   re going to get hurt  running around like this .  come on .  obviously i   m not taking you back to my place              obviously     murmured vimes .         but mossy   ll find you somewhere to lay your head  i expect .  he   s got a spare room .         mossy lawn .     said vimes  suddenly light headed .     that   s him .  the pox doctor .  i remember .     he tried to focus one tired eye on the young woman .  yes  the bone structure was right .  that chin .  that was a no nonsense chin .  it was a chin that took people somewhere .     rosie   you   re mrs .  palm .         mrs .  .     she said coldly  while the agony aunts giggled their high pitched giggle .     i think not .         well  i mean       vimes floundered .  of course  only the senior members of the profession adopted    mrs .         and i   ve never seen you before     said rosie .     and neither have dotsie and sadie  and they have an amazing memory for faces .  but you act as if you own the place  john keel .         do i .         you do .  it   s the way you stand .  officers stand like that .  you eat well .  maybe a bit too well .  you could lose a few pounds .  and then there   s the scars all over you .  i saw    em in mossy   s place .  your legs are tanned from the knees down  and that says    watchman    to me  because they go bare legged .  but i know every watchman in the city and you   re not one of them  so maybe you   re a military man .  you fight by instinct  and dirty  too .  that means you   re used to fighting for your life in a melee  and that   s odd  because that says to me    foot soldier     not officer .  the word is that the lads took some fine armor off you .  that   s officer .  but you don   t wear rings .  that   s foot soldier   rings catch in things  can pull your finger off if you   re not careful .  and you   re married .         how can you tell that .         any woman could tell that     said rosie palm smoothly .     now  step sharp .  we   re out after curfew as it is .  the watch won   t bother much about us  but they will about you .      curfew  thought vimes .  that was a long time ago .  vetinari never ordered curfews .  they interfered with business .      i think perhaps i lost my memory when i was attacked     he said .  that sounded good  he thought .  what he really needed now was somewhere quiet  to think .      really .  i think perhaps i   m the queen of hersheba     said rosie .     just remember  kind sir .  i   m not doing this because i   m interested in you  although i   d admit to a macabre fascination about how long you   re going to survive .  if it hadn   t been a cold wet night i   d have left you in the road .  i   m a working girl  and i don   t need trouble .  but you look like a man who can lay his hands on a few dollars  and there will be a bill .         i   ll leave the money on the dressing table     said vimes .   the slap in the face knocked him against the wall .      consider that a sign of my complete lack of a sense of humor  will you .     said rosie  shaking some life back into her hand .      i   m   sorry     said vimes .     i didn   t mean to   i mean   look  thank you for everything .  i mean it .  but this is not being a good night .         yes  i can see that .         it   s worse than you think .  believe me .         we all have our troubles .  believe me     said rosie .   vimes was glad of the agony aunts behind them as they walked back to the shades .  this was the old shades  and lawn lived a street   s width away from it .  the watch never set foot here .  in truth  the new shades wasn   t a lot better  but people had at least learned what happened if anyone attacked a watchman .  the aunts were a different matter .  no one attacked the aunts .   a night   s sleep  thought vimes .  maybe  in the morning  this won   t have happened .      she wasn   t there  was she     said rosie after a while .     your wife .  that was lord ramkin   s house .  are you in trouble with him .         never met the man     said vimes absently .      you were lucky someone told us where you   d gone .  those men were probably in the pay of someone up there .  they   re a law unto themselves  over in ankh .  some rough man walking around with no tradesman   s tools   well  he   s to be turned off the patch  and if they rob you blind while they   re doing it who   s going to care .      yes  thought vimes .  that   s the way it was .  privilege  which just means    private law .     two types of people laugh at the law  those that break it and those that make it .  well  it   s not like that now        but i   m not in    now    now .  damn those wizards     the wizards .  right .  in the morning i   ll go and explain .  easy .  they   ll understand .  i   ll bet they can send me right back to when i left .  there   s a whole university full of people to deal with this .  it   s not my problem anymore .   relief filled his body like warm pink mist .  all he had to do was get through the night     but why wait .  they were open all night  weren   t they .  magic didn   t shut .  vimes remembered late night patrols when he could practically see by the glow coming from some of the windows .  he could simply     hold on  hold on .  a policeman   s thought had been stirring in his mind .  the aunts didn   t run .  they famously didn   t run .  they caught up with you slowly .  anyone who   d been  as they called it     a very naughty boy    would sleep extremely badly knowing that the aunts on his tail were slowly getting nearer  pausing only for a cream tea somewhere or to visit an interesting jumble sale .  but vimes had run  run all the way up to scoone avenue  in the dark  through coach traffic and crowds of people swarming home before curfew .  no one had paid him any attention  would surely not have seen his face if they did .  and he certainly didn   t know anyone here .  he amended the thought  no one who knew him .      so     he said casually     who told you where i   d gone .         oh  one of those old monks     said rosie .      which old monks .         who knows .  a little bald man with a robe and a broom .  there   s always monks begging and chanting somewhere .  he was in phedre road .         and you asked him where i   d gone .         what .  no .  he just looked around and said    mr .  keel ran up to scoone avenue     and then he went on sweeping .         sweeping .         oh  it   s the kind of holy thing they do .  so they don   t tread on ants  i think .  or they sweep sins away .  or maybe they just like the place clean .  who cares what monks do .         and nothing about that struck you as odd .         why .  i thought perhaps you were naturally kind to beggars .     snapped rosie .     it doesn   t bother me .  dotsie said she put something in his begging bowl  though .         what .         would you ask .      the majority of vimes thought  who does care about what monks do .  they   re monks .  that   s why they   re weird .  maybe one had a moment of revelation or something  they like that kind of thing .  so what .  find the wizards  explain what   s happened  and leave it to them .   but the policeman part thought  how do little monks know i   m called keel .  i smell a rat .   the majority said  it   s a thirty year old rat  then .   and the policeman said  yes  that   s why it smells .      look  i   m going to have to go and check something     he said .     i   ll   probably be back .         well  i can   t chain you up     said rosie .  she smiled a grim little smile and went on     that costs extra .  but if you don   t come back yet have any intention of staying in this city  then the aunts           i promise you  the last thing i want to do is leave ankh morpork     said vimes .      that actually sounded convincing     said rosie .     off you go  then .  we   re past curfew now .  but why don   t i think you   ll be bothered by that .      as he disappeared in the gloom  dotsie sidled up to rosie .      you want we should follow him  dearie .         don   t bother .         you should have let sadie give him a little prod  dear .  that slows them down .         i think it takes quite a lot to slow that man down .  and we don   t want trouble .  not at a time like this .  we   re too close .             you don   t want to be out at a time like this  mister .      vimes turned .  he   d been hammering on the closed gates of the university .   there were three watchmen behind him .  one of them was holding a torch .  another was holding a bow .  a third had clearly decided that activities for tonight would not include heavy lifting .   vimes raised his hands slowly .      i expect he wants to be in a nice cold cell for the night     said the one with the torch .   oh dear  thought vimes .  it   s the comedian of the year contest .  coppers really oughtn   t to try this  but they still did .      i was just visiting the university     he said .      oh  yes .     said the one without either torch or bow .  he was portly  and vimes could make out the tarnished gleam of a sergeant   s stripes .     where d   you live .         nowhere     said vimes .     i   ve just arrived .  and shall we move right along .  i don   t have a job and i don   t have any money .  and neither of those is a crime .         out after curfew .  no visible means of support .     said the sergeant .      i got my legs     said vimes .      at the moment  hur  hur     said one of the men .  he stopped when vimes looked at him .      i want to make a complaint  sergeant     said vimes .      what about .         you     said vimes .     and the brothers grin here .  you   re not doing it right .  if you   re going to arrest someone  you take charge right away .  you   ve got a badge and a weapon  yes .  and he   s got his hands up  and a guilty conscience .  everyone   s got a guilty conscience .  so he   s wondering what you know and what you   re going to do  and what you do is fire off the questions  sharply .  you don   t make silly jokes     cos that makes you too human  and you keep him off balance so he can   t quite think a clear sentence  and  above all  you don   t let him move like this and grab your arm and pull it up so it almost breaks like this and grab your sword and hold it to your throat like this .  tell your man to lower that sword  will you .  the way he   s waving it around  he could hurt someone .      the sergeant gurgled .      right     said vimes .     oh  sergeant   this is a sword .  ever sharpen it .  what do you use it for  bludgeoning people to death .  now  what you   re going to do is  you   re all going to put your weapons on the ground over there  and then i   m going to let the sarge go and i   ll leg it up that alley  okay .  and by the time you   ve got your weapons  and believe me i   d advise you to get hold of weapons before coming after me  i   ll be well away .  end of problem all round .  any questions .      all three watchmen were silent .  then vimes heard a very faint  very close noise .  it was the sound of the hairs in his ears rustling as  with great care  the tip of a crossbow bolt gently entered his ear .      yes  sir  i have a question     said a voice behind him .     do you ever listen to your own advice .      vimes felt the pressure of the crossbow against his skull  and wondered how far the arrow would go if the trigger was pulled .  an inch would be far too far .   sometimes you just had to take the lumps .  he dropped the sword with great and exaggerated care  released his grip on the sergeant  and stepped away meekly while the fourth watchman maintained his aim .      i   ll just stand with my legs apart  shall i .     he said .      yeah     growled the sergeant  turning around     yeah  that   ll save us a bit of time .  although for you  mister  we   ve got all night .  well done  lance constable .  we   ll make a watchman of you yet .         yeah  well done     said vimes  staring at the young man with the bow .  but the sergeant was already taking his run up .       it was later .  pain had happened .   vimes lay on the hard cell bed and tried to make it go away .  it hadn   t been as bad as it might be .  that mob hadn   t even been able to organize a good seeing to .  they didn   t understand how a man could roll with the punches  and half the time they were getting in their own way .   was he enjoying this .  not the pain .  he   d pass on the pain .  in fact he   d passed out on the pain .  but there was that small part of him he   d heard sometimes during strenuous arrests after long chases  the part that wanted to punch and punch long after punching had already achieved its effect .  there was a joy to it .  he called it the beast .  it stayed hidden until you needed it and then  when you needed it  out it came .  pain brought it out  and fear .  he   d killed werewolves with his bare hands  mad with anger and terror and tasting  deep inside  the blood of the beast   and it was sniffing the air .         ullo  mister vimes  haha .  i was wondering when you   d wake up .      he sat up sharply .  the cells were barred on the corridor side  but also between cells as well  on the basis that those caged ought to know they were in a cage .  and in the next cell  lying with his hands behind his head  was carcer .      go on     said carcer cheerfully .     make a grab for me through the bars  eh .  want to see how long it takes before the guards arrive .         at least they got you  too     said vimes .      not for long  not for long .  i smell of roses  me  haha .  visitor to the city  got lost  very helpful to the watch  so sorry to have bothered them  here   s a little something for their trouble   you shouldn   t of stopped the watch taking bribes  mister vimes .  it means an easier life all round  haha .         then i   ll nail you some other way  carcer .      carcer inserted a finger in his nose  wiggled it around  withdrew it  inspected its contents critically  and flicked them toward the ceiling .      well  that   s where it all goes runny  mister vimes .  you see  i wasn   t dragged in by four coppers .  i didn   t go around assaulting watchmen or trying to break into the university           i was knocking on the door .         i believe you  mister vimes .  but you know what coppers are like .  you look at    em in a funny way  and the buggers   ll fit you up for every crime in the book .  terrible  what they can pin on an honest man  haha .      vimes knew it .      so you got some money     he said .      o   course  mister vimes .  i   m a crook .  and the best part is  it   s even easier to be a crook when no one knows you   re a crook  haha .  but coppering depends on people believing you   re a copper .  a turn up for the books  eh .  you know we   re back in the good old days  haha .         it seems that way     vimes admitted .  he didn   t like talking to carcer  but right now he seemed to be the only real person around .      where did you land  if i may ask .         in the shades .         me too .  couple of blokes tried to mug me where i lay .  me .  i ask you  mister vimes .  still  they had some money on them  so that worked out all right .  yes  i think i   m going to be very happy here .  ah  here comes one of our brave lads        a watchman walked along the passage  swinging his keys .  he was elderly  the kind of copper who gets given the jobs where swinging keys is more likely than swinging a truncheon  and his most distinguishing feature was a nose twice the width and half the length of the average nose .  he stared at vimes for a moment  and then passed on to carcer   s cell .  he unlocked the door .      you .  hop it     he said .      yessir .  thank you  sir     said carcer  hurrying out .  he pointed to vimes .     you wanna watch that one  sir .  he   s a animal .  decent people shouldn   t be locked up in the same cells  sir .         hop it  i said .         hopping it  sir .  thank you  sir .     and carcer  with a leery wink at vimes  hopped it .   the jailer turned to vimes .      and what   s your name  hnah  mister .         john keel     said vimes .      yeah .         yeah  and i   ve had my kicking .  fair   s fair .  i   d like to go now .         oh  you   d like to go  would you .  hnah .  you   d like me to hand over these keys  hnah  and give you five pence from the poor box for your  hnah  trouble  eh .      the man was standing very close to the bars  with the grin of one who mistakenly thinks he   s a wit when he   s only half a one .  and if vimes   s reflexes were quicker  and he   d bet they were  even now  it   d be the work of a second to pull the old fool forcibly into the bars and spread his nose even further across his face .  no doubt about it  the psychopaths had it the easy way .      just freedom would do     he said  resisting temptation .      you ain   t going anywhere  hnah     cept to see the captain     said the jailer .      that   d be captain tilden .     said vimes .     have i got that right .  smokes like a bonfire .  got a brass ear and a wooden leg .         yeah  an    he can have you shot  hnah  how d   you like them bananas .      the cluttered desk of vimes   s memory finally unearthed the inadvertent saucer of recollection from under the teacup of forgetfulness .      you   re snouty     he said .     right .  some bloke broke your nose and it never got set properly .  and your eyes water all the time  which is why they gave you permanent jail duty           do i know you  mister .     said snouty  peering at vimes through suspicious  running eyes .      me .  no .  no .     said vimes hastily .     but i   ve heard people talk about you .  practically runs the watch house  they said .  very fair man  they said .  firm but fair .  never spits in the gruel  never widdles in the tea .  and never confuses his fruit  either .      the visible parts of snouty   s face contorted into the resentful scowl of someone who can   t quite keep up with the script .      oh yeah .     he managed .     well  hnah  i   ve always kept a clean cell  that   s very true .     he looked a little nonplussed at the development  but managed another scowl .     you stay there  mister  and i   ll go an    tell the captain you woke up .      vimes went back and lay on the bunk  staring at the badly spelled and anatomically incorrect graffiti on the ceiling .  for a while there was a raised voice from upstairs  with an occasional intrusive    hnah .     from snouty .   then he heard the jailer   s footsteps on the stairs again .      well  well  well     he said in the tone of someone looking forward to seeing a third party get what was coming to them .     turns out the captain wants to see you right away .  now  are you gonna let me shackle you  hnah  or do i call the lads down .      gods protect you  vimes thought .  maybe it was true that the blow that had spread snouty   s nose across his face had scrambled his brain .  you had to be a special kind of idiot to try to handcuff a dangerous prisoner all by yourself .  if he   d tried it with carcer  for example  he   d have been a dead idiot five minutes ago .   the jailer opened the door .  vimes stood up and presented his wrists .  after a second   s hesitation  snouty handcuffed him .  it always paid to be nice to a jailer  you might not get handcuffed behind your back .  but a man with both hands in front of him had quite a lot of freedom .      you go up the stairs first     said snouty and reached down and picked up a rather more efficient looking crossbow than vimes had seen last night .     and if you even try to walk fast  mister  i   ll shoot you  hnah  where you die slow .         very fair     said vimes .     very fair .      he walked up the steps very carefully  hearing snouty   s heavy breathing right behind him .  like many people of limited intellectual scope  snouty did take what he could do very seriously .  he   d shown a refreshing lack of compunction about pulling that trigger  for one thing .   vimes reached the top of the stairs and remembered to hesitate .      hnah  turn left  you     said snouty behind him .  vimes nodded to himself .  and then first on the right .  it was all coming back to him  in a great wave .  this was treacle mine road .  this was his first watch house .  this was where it all began .   the captain   s door was open .  the tired looking old man behind the desk glanced up .      be seated     said tilden coldly .     thank you  snouty .      vimes had mixed memories of captain tilden .  he had been a military man before being given this job as a kind of pension  and that was a bad thing in a senior copper .  it meant he looked to authority for orders  and obeyed them  whereas vimes found it better to look to authority for orders and then filter those orders through a fine mesh of common sense  adding a generous scoop of creative misunderstanding and maybe even incipient deafness if circumstances demanded  because authority rarely descended to street level .  tilden set too great a store by shiny breastplates and smartness on parade .  you had to have some of that stuff  that was true enough .  you couldn   t let people slob around .  but although he   d never voice the view in public  vimes liked to see a bit of battered armor around the place .  it showed that someone had been battering it .  besides  when you were lurking in the shadows you didn   t want to gleam     there was an ankh morpork flag pinned to one wall  the red faded to threadbare orange .  rumor had it that tilden saluted it every day .  there was also a very large silver inkstand with a gilt regimental crest on it  which occupied quite a lot of the desk  snouty polished it every morning and it shone .  tilden had never quite left the army behind .   still  vimes retained a soft spot for the old man .  he   d been a successful soldier  as these things went  he   d generally been on the winning side  and had killed more of the enemy by good if dull tactics than of his own men by bad but exciting ones .  he   d been  in his own way  kind and reasonably fair  the men of the watch had run rings around him  without him ever noticing .   now tilden was giving him the long stare with associated paperwork .  it was supposed to mean  we know all about you  so why don   t you tell us all about yourself .  but he really wasn   t any good at it .   vimes returned the stare blankly .      what is your name again .     said tilden  becoming aware that vimes was the better starer .      keel     said vimes .     john keel .     and   what the hell      look     he said     you   ve only got one piece of paper there that means anything  and that   s the report from that sergeant  assuming he can write .         as a matter of fact  i have two pieces of paper     said the captain .     the other one concerns the death of john keel  what .         what .  for a scrap with the watch .         in the current emergency  that would be quite sufficient for the death penalty     said tilden  leaning forward .     but  ha  perhaps it won   t be necessary in this case  because john keel died yesterday .  you beat him up and robbed him  what .  you took his money but you didn   t bother with the letters  because your sort can   t read  what .  so you wouldn   t have known that john keel was a policeman  what .         what .      vimes stared at the skinny face with its triumphantly bristling mustache and the small  faded  blue eyes .   and then there was the sound of someone industriously sweeping the floor in the corridor outside .  the captain looked past him  growled  and hurled a pen .      get him out of here .     he barked .     what   s the little devil doing here at this time of night  anyway .      vimes turned his head .  there was a skinny  wizened looking man standing in the doorway  bearded and as bald as a baby .  he was grinning stupidly and holding a broom .      he   s cheap  sir  hnah  and it   s best if he comes in when it   s  hnah  quiet     snouty murmured  grabbing the little man by a stick thin elbow .     c   mon  out you get  mister lousy        so now the crossbow wasn   t pointing at vimes .  and he had several pounds of metal on his wrists or  to put it another way  his arms were a hammer .  he went to stand up         vimes woke up and stared at the ceiling .  there was a deep rumbling somewhere nearby .  treadmill .  watermill .   it was going to be a corny line  but some things you had to know .      where am i .     he said .  and then he added     this time .         well done     said a voice somewhere behind him .     consciousness to sarcasm in five seconds .      the room was large  by the feel of the air  and the play of light on the walls suggested there were candles alight behind vimes .   the voice said     i   d like you to think of me as a friend .         a friend .  why .     said vimes .  there was a smell of cigarette smoke in the air .      everyone ought to have a friend     said the voice .     ah  i see you   ve noticed you   re still handcuffed        the voice said this because in one movement vimes had swung himself off the table and plunged forward     vimes woke up and stared at the ceiling .  there was a deep rumbling somewhere nearby .  treadmill .  watermill .   then his thoughts knotted themselves most unpleasantly .      what     he said     just happened .         i thought you might like to try that again  lad     said the invisible friend .     we have little tricks here  as you will learn .  just sit up .  i know you   ve been through a lot  but we don   t have time for messing about .  this is sooner than i   d like  but i thought i   d better get you out of there before it went really runny   mister vimes .      vimes froze .      who are you .     he said .      it   s lu tze officially  mister vimes .  but you can call me sweeper  since we   re friends .      vimes sat up carefully and looked around .   the shadowy walls were covered with   writing  it must be writing  he thought  but the hubland type of writing  which is only one step away from being little pictures .   the candle was standing on a saucer .  some way behind it  just visible in the shadows  were two cylinders  each as wide as a man and twice as long  set in massive horizontal bearings  one above the other .  both were turning slowly  and both gave the impression of being a lot bigger than their mere dimensions suggested .  their rumble filled the room .  there was a strange violet haze around them .   two yellow robed figures tended the cylinders  but vimes   s eye was drawn to the skinny little bald man sitting on an upturned crate by the candle .  he was smoking a foul roll up of the sort favored by nobby .  he looked like a foreign monk .  in fact  he looked exactly the kind vimes occasionally saw with begging bowls in the street .      you   re looking fit  mister vimes     said sweeper .      you were in the watch house  right .     said vimes .     snouty called you lousy .         yes  mister vimes .  lu tze .  i   ve been sweeping up there every night for the past ten days .  all for two pence and all the kicks i can   t dodge .  just waiting for you .         and you told rosie palm where i   d gone  too .  you were the monk on the bridge .         right again .  couldn   t be sure she   d catch up .         how do you know who i am .         don   t get excited  mister vimes     said sweeper calmly .     i   m here to help you   your grace .  and i   m your friend  because right now i   m the only person in the world who will probably believe anything you tell me about  oh  thunderstorms and falls  that sort of thing .  at least     he added     the only sane person .      he watched vimes as the man sat quite still for half a minute .      good  mister vimes     said sweeper .     thinking .  i like that in a man .         this is magic  right .     said vimes at last .      something like that  yes     said sweeper .     f   rinstance  just now we moved you back in time .  just a few seconds .  just so you wouldn   t do anything you   d regret .  can   t say i blame you for wanting to have a go at someone after all you   ve been through  but we don   t want any harm to come to you  do we           hah .  i almost had my hands round your throat .      sweeper smiled .  it was a disarmingly little smile .      smoke .     he said .  he fumbled in his robe and produced a ragged hand rolled cigarette .      thanks  but i   ve got my own       vimes began automatically .  his hand stopped halfway to his pocket .      oh  yes     said sweeper .     the silver cigar case .  sybil gave it to you as a wedding present  right .  shame about that .         i want to go home     said vimes .  it came out as whisper .  he hadn   t been sleeping in the past twelve hours  merely recovering .   this time it was sweeper who sat in silence  apart from the rumble of the cylinders .      you   re a policeman  mister vimes     he said eventually .     well  i   d like you to believe for a while that i   m a sort of policeman too  all right .  me and my colleagues  we see that   things happen .  or don   t happen .  don   t ask questions right now .  just nod .      vimes shrugged instead .      good .  and let   s say on our patrol we   ve found you  as it might be  in a metaphorical kind of way  lying in the gutter on a saturday night singing a rude song about wheelbarrows           i don   t know a rude song about wheelbarrows .      sweeper sighed .     hedgehogs .  custard .  one string fiddles .  it really doesn   t matter .  now  we   ve found you a long way from where you should be  and we   d like to get you home  but it   s not as easy as you might think .         i   ve gone back in time  haven   t i .  it was that bloody library .  everyone knows the magic in there makes strange things happen .         well  yes .  it was mainly that  yes .  it   s more true to say that you  er  got caught up in a major event .         can anyone get me back .  can you get me back .         we ll       said sweeper  looking awkward .      wizards can if you can   t     said vimes .     i   ll go and see them in the morning .         oh  you will  will you .  i   d like to be there when you do     said sweeper .     these ain   t the wizards under decent old ridcully  you know .  and you   re not his grace commander sir samuel vimes  neither .  you   re a rough looking devil who   ll be burbling a story about thunderstorms and flying through time  to a bunch of rather devious and unpleasant men .  you   ll be lucky if they only laugh at you .  anyway  even if they wanted to be helpful  they   d hit the same problem .         and what   s that .         it can   t be done .  not yet .     for the first time in the conversation  sweeper looked ill at ease .     the big problem i   m facing  mister vimes  is that i ought to tell you a few things that i   m not  in any circumstances  allowed to tell you .  but you   re a man who isn   t happy until he knows the facts .  i respect that .  unless you   re satisfied  you won   t help us .  i know i can   t expect you to believe me        the noise of the big cylinders changed for a moment  and vimes felt a very slight shock  a suggestion that his whole body had just gone plib .      so here   s someone you might believe           hold it     said vimes  still staring at him .     what happened to your cigarette .         hmm .         you were holding half a roll up and now it   s gone .         i finished it ten minutes ago     said the sweeper .     roll    em  boys .      the tone of the spinning cylinders changed slightly .   sam vimes saw himself standing in the middle of the room .      that   s me .         yeah  right     said sweeper .     now listen to the man .         hello  sam     said the other vimes  staring not quite at him .     i can   t see you but they say you can see me .  remember the smell of lilac .  you thought about those who died .  and then you told willikins to hose down that kid .  and  uh   you   ve got a pain in your chest you   re a bit worried about but you haven   t told anyone   that   s about enough  i think .  you know i   m you .  now  there   s some things i can   t tell you .  i can know    em because i   m in a       the speaker stopped and looked away  as if he was taking instruction from someone offstage       a closed loop .  er   you could say i   m twenty minutes of your life you don   t recall .  remember when you had               a sensation that his whole body had just gone plib .   sweeper stood up .     i hate to do this     he said     but we   re in the temple and we can pretty much dampen out the paradoxes .  on your feet  mister vimes .  i   m going to tell you everything .         you just said you couldn   t .      sweeper smiled .     need any help with those handcuffs .         what  these old capstick mk .  ones .  no  just give me a nail and a couple of minutes .  how come i   m in a temple .         i brought you here .         you carried me .         no .  you walked with me .  blindfolded  of course .  and then  when you were here  i gave you a little drink           i don   t remember that .         of course not .  that was the purpose of the drink .  not very mystical  but it does the job .  we don   t want you coming back here  now  do we .  this place is supposed to be a secret           you messed up my memory .  now you see here       vimes half stood  but sweeper held up his hands placatingly .      don   t worry  don   t worry  it just   made you forget a few minutes     he said .      how many minutes .         just a few  just a few .  and it had herbs in it .  good for you  herbs .  and then we let you sleep .  don   t worry  no one is after us .  they   ll never know you   ve gone .  see these things here .      sweeper picked up an open work box that lay beside his chair .  it had a strap like a knapsack  and vimes could just see a cylinder inside the box .      this is called a procrastinator     said the monk     and it   s a tiny version of the ones over there  the ones that look like your granny   s mangle .  i   m not going to get technical  but when it   s spinning it moves time around you .  did you understand what i just said .         no .         all right  it   s a magic box .  happier .         go on     said vimes grimly .      you wore one of these and i led you here from the watch house .  because you were wearing it  you were  shall we say  outside time .  and after we   ve had this little talk  i   ll take you back to the watch house and the old captain won   t know any difference .  no time is passing in the outside world while we   re in the temple .  the procrastinators take care of that .  like i said  they move time around .  actually  what   s really happening is that they are moving us back in time at the same time that time moves us forward .  we   ve got others around the place .  good for keeping food fresh .  what else can i tell you   oh  yeah .  it helps keep track if you just think of things happening one after another .  believe me .         this is like a dream     said vimes .  there was a clink as the handcuffs sprang open .      yes  it is  isn   t it     said sweeper calmly .      and can your magic box take me home .  move me in time all the way to where i ought to be .         this .  hah .  no  this is strictly for small scale stuff           look  mr .  sweeper  i   ve spent the last day fighting a right bastard on a roof and getting beaten up twice and sewn up once and hah  stitched up  too .  i   ve got the impression i should be thanking you for something but i   m damned if i know what it is .  what i want is straight answers  mister .  i   m the commander of the watch in this city .         don   t you mean will be .     said sweeper .      no .  you told me it helps if i think of things happening one after another .  well  yesterday  my yesterday  i was commander of the watch and i bloody well still am the commander of the watch .  i don   t care what anyone else thinks .  they are not in possession of all the facts .         hold on to that thought     said sweeper  standing up .     all right  commander .  you want some facts .  let   s take a walk in the garden  shall we .         can you get me home .         not yet .  it   s my professional opinion that you   re here for a reason .         a reason .  i fell through the bloody dome .         that helped  yes .  calm down  mister vimes .  it   s all been a great strain  i can see .      sweeper led the way out of the hall .  there was a big office outside  a hubbub of quiet but purposeful activity .  here and there  among the worn and scratched desks  there were more cylinders like the ones vimes had seen in the other chamber .  some of them were turning slowly .      very busy  our ankh morpork section     said sweeper .     we had to buy the shops on either side .     he picked up a scroll from a basket by one desk  glanced at the contents  and tossed it back with a sigh .     and everyone   s overworked     he added .     we   re here at all hours .  and when we say    all hours     we know what we   re talking about .         but what is it you do .     said vimes .      we see that things happen .         don   t things happen anyway .         depends what things you want .  we   re the monks of history  mister vimes .  we see that it happens .         i   ve never heard of you  and i know this city like the back of my hand .         right .  and how often do you really look at the back of your hand  mister vimes .  we   re in clay lane  to stop you wondering .         what .  those loony monks in the funny foreign building between the pawnbrokers and the shonky shop .  the ones who go dancing round the street banging drums and shouting .         well done  mister vimes .  it   s funny how secretly you can move when you   re a loony monk dancing through the streets banging a drum .         when i was a kid  most of my clothes came from the shonky shop in clay lane     said vimes .     everyone we knew got their clothes from the shonky shop .  used to be run by a foreign guy with a funny name           brother soon shine sun     said sweeper .     not a hugely enlightened operative  but a genius when it comes to pricing fourth hand schmutter .         shirts so worn you could see daylight through    em and trousers as shiny as glass     said vimes .     and by the end of the week half the stuff was in the pawn shop .         that   s right     said sweeper .     you   d pawn your clothes in the pawn shop  but you   d never buy clothes from the pawn shop     cos there were standards  right .      vimes nodded .  when you got right down to the bottom of the ladder  the rungs were very close together and  oh my  weren   t the women careful about them .  in their own way  they were as haughty as any duchess .  you might not have much  but you could have standards .  clothes might be cheap and old  but at least they could be scrubbed .  there might be nothing behind the front door worth stealing but at least the doorstep could be clean enough to eat your dinner off  if you could   ve afforded dinner .  and no one ever bought their clothes from the pawn shop .  you   d hit bottom when you did that .  no  you bought them from mr .  sun at the shonky shop  and you never asked where he got them from .      i went off to my first proper job in a suit from the shonky shop     he said .     seems like centuries ago now .         no     said sweeper .     it was only last week .      silence ballooned .  the only sound was the purr of the cylinders dotted around the room .   then sweeper added     it must have occurred to you .         why .  i   ve spent most of the time here being beaten up or unconscious or trying to get home .  you mean i   m out there somewhere .         oh  yes .  in fact  last night you saved the day for your squad by aiming a crossbow at a dangerous miscreant who was attacking your sergeant .      the silence ballooned larger this time .  it seemed to fill the universe .   eventually  vimes said     no .  that   s not right .  that never happened .  i would have remembered that .  and i can remember a lot about my first weeks in the job .         interesting  isn   t it     said sweeper .     but is it not written     there   s a lot goes on we don   t get told    .  mister vimes  you need a short spell in the garden of inner city tranquility .          it was indeed a garden  like a lot of other gardens you got in areas like clay lane .  the gray soil was nothing more than old brick dust  elderly cat mess  and generalized  semirotted dross .  at the far end was a three hole privy .  it was built handily by the gate to the back lane so the night soil men didn   t have far to go  but this one had a small stone cylinder turning gently beside it .   the garden didn   t get much proper light .  gardens like this never did .  you got secondhand light once the richer folk in the taller buildings had finished with it .  some people kept pigeons or rabbits or pigs on their plots  or planted  against all experience  a few vegetables .  but it   d take magic beans to reach the real sunlight in gardens like this .   nevertheless  someone had made an effort .  most of the spare ground had been covered with gravel of different sizes  and this had been carefully raked into swirls and curves .  here and there  some individual larger stones had been positioned  apparently with great thought .   vimes stared at the garden of rocks  desperate for anything to occupy his attention .   he could see what the designer had in mind  he thought  but the effect had been spoiled .  this was the big city  after all .  garbage got everywhere .  the main disposal method was throwing it over a wall .  sooner or later someone would sell it or  possibly  eat it .   a young monk was carefully raking the gravel .  he gave a respectful bow as sweeper approached .   the old man sat down on a stone bench .      push off and get us two cups of tea  lad  will you .     he said .     one green with yak butter  and mister vimes will have it boiled orange in a builder   s boot with two sugars and yesterday   s milk  right .         that   s how i like it     said vimes weakly  sitting down .   sweeper took a deep  long breath .     and i like building gardens     he said .     life should be a garden .      vimes stared blankly at what was in front of them .      okay     he said .     the gravel and rocks  yes  i can see that .  shame about all the rubbish .  it always turns up  doesn   t it           yes     said lu tze .     it   s part of the pattern .         what .  the old cigarette packet .         certainly .  that invokes the element of air     said sweeper .      and the cat doings .         to remind us that disharmony  like a cat  gets everywhere .         the cabbage stalks .  the used sonkie .          at our peril we forget the role of the organic in the total harmony .  what arrives seemingly by chance in the pattern is part of a higher organization that we can only dimly comprehend .  this is a very important fact  and has a bearing on your case .         and the beer bottle .      for the first time since vimes had met him  the monk frowned .      y   know  some bugger always tosses one over the wall on his way back from the pub on friday nights .  if it wasn   t forbidden to do that kind of thing  he   d feel the flat to my hand and no mistake .         it   s not part of the higher organization .         possibly .  who cares .  that sort of thing gets on my thungas  it really does     said sweeper .  he sat back with his hands on his knees .  serenity flowed once more .     well now  mister vimes   you know the universe is made up of very small items .         huh .         we   ve got to work up to things gradually  mister vimes .  you   re a bright man .  i can   t keep telling you everything is done by magic .         am i really here  too .  in the city .  i mean  a younger me .         of course .  why not .  where was i .  oh  yes .  made up of very small items  and           this is not a good time to be in the watch .  i remember .  there   s the curfew .  and that was only the start .         small items  mister vimes     said sweeper sharply .     you need to know this .         oh  all right .  how small .         very  very small .  so tiny that they have some very strange ways indeed .      vimes sighed .     and i ask you  what ways are these  yeah .         i   m glad you asked that question .  for one thing  they can be in many places at once .  try to think  mister vimes .      vimes tried to concentrate on what was probably the discarded fish and chip wrapper of infinity .  oddly enough  with so many horrible thoughts crowding his head  it was almost a relief to put them on one side in order to consider this .  the brain did things like that .  he remembered how once  when he   d been stabbed and would   ve bled to death if sergeant angua hadn   t caught up with him  as he lay there  he   d found himself taking a very intense interest in the pattern of the carpet .  the senses say  we   ve only got a few minutes  let   s record everything  in every detail        that can   t be right     he said .     if this seat is made up of lots of tiny things that can be in lots of places at once  why is it standing still .         give the man a small cigar .     said sweeper jubilantly .     that   s the big problem  mister vimes .  and the answer  our abbott tells us  is that it is in lots of places at once .  ah  here   s the tea .  and in order for it to be in lots of places at once  the multiverse is made up of a vast number of alternative universes .  an oodleplex of oodleplexes .  that   s like the biggest number anyone can think of  ever .  just so   s it can accommodate all the quantum .  am i going too fast for you .         oh  that     said vimes .     i know about that .  like  you make a decision in this universe and you made a different decision in another one .  i heard the wizards talking about that at a posh reception once .  they were   arguing about the glorious   th of may .         and what were they saying .         oh  all the old stuff   that it would have turned out different if the rebels had properly guarded the gates and the bridges  that you can   t break a siege by a frontal attack .  but they were saying that  in a way  everything happens somewhere           and you believed them .         it sounds like complete thungas .  but sometimes you can   t help wondering  what would have happened if i   d done something different           like when you killed your wife .      sweeper was impressed at vimes   s lack of reaction .      this is a test  right .         you   re a quick study  mister vimes .         but in some other universe  believe me  i hauled off and punched you one .      again  sweeper smiled the annoying little smile that suggested he didn   t believe him .      you haven   t killed your wife     he said .     anywhere .  there is nowhere  however huge the multiverse is  where sam vimes as he is now has murdered lady sybil .  but the theory is quite clear .  it says that if anything can happen without breaking any physical laws  it must happen .  but it hasn   t .  and yet the    multiverse    theory works .  without it  no one would ever be able to make a decision at all .         so .         so what people do matters .     said sweeper .     people invent other laws .  what they do is important .  the abbott   s very excited about this .  he nearly swallowed his biscuit .  it means the multiverse isn   t infinite  and people   s choices are far more vital than they think .  they can  by what they do  change the universe .      sweeper gave vimes a long look .      mister vimes  you   re thinking  i   m back in time  and damn me  i   m probably going to end up being the sergeant that teaches me all i know  right .         i   ve been wondering .  the watch would offer any gutter trash a job in those days  because of the curfew and all the spying     said vimes .     but look  i remember keel  and yes  he did have a scar and an eyepatch  but i   m sure as hell that he wasn   t me .         right .  the universe doesn   t work like that .  you were indeed taken under the wing of one john keel  a watchman from pseudopolis who came to ankh morpork because the pay was better .  he was a real person .  he was not you .  but do you remember if he ever mentioned to you that he was attacked by two men not long after he got off the coach .         hell  yes     said vimes .     the muggers .  he got this   he got his scar that way .  a good old ankh morpork welcome .  but he was a tough man .  took    em both down  no problem .         this time  there were three     said sweeper .      well  three   s trickier  of course  but           you   re the policeman .  you guess the name of the third man  mister vimes .      vimes hardly had to think .  the answer erupted from the depths of darkest suspicion .      carcer .         he soon settled in  yes .         the bastard was in the next cell .  he even told me he   d grabbed some money .         and you   re both stuck here  mister vimes .  this isn   t your past anymore .  not exactly .  it   s a past .  and up there is a future .  it might be your future .  but it might not be .  you want to go home now  leaving carcer here and the real john keel dead .  but there   ll be no home to go to  if you could do that .  because if you do  young sam vimes won   t get a swift course in basic policing from a decent man .  he   ll learn it from people like sergeant knock and corporal quirke and constable colon .  and that might not be the worst of it  by a long way .      vimes shut his eyes .  he remembered how wet behind the ears he   d been .  and fred   well  fred colon hadn   t been too bad under the halfhearted timorousness and lack of imagination  but quirke had been an evil little sod in his way  and as for knock  well  knock had been fred   s teacher and the pupil wasn   t a patch on the master .  what had sam vimes learned from keel .  to stay alert  to think for himself  to keep a place in his head free from the quirkes and knocks of the world  and not to hesitate about fighting dirty today if that was what it took to fight again tomorrow .   he   s often thought he   d have been dead long ago if it wasn   t for     he looked up sharply at the monk .      can   t tell you that  mister vimes     said lu tze .     nothing   s certain     cos of quantum .         but  look  i know my future happened  because i was there .         no .  what we   ve got here  friend  is quantum interference .  mean anything .  no .  well   let me put it this way .  there   s one past and one future .  but there are two presents .  one where you and your evil friend turned up  and one where you didn   t .  we can keep these two presents going side by side for a few days .  it takes a lot of run time  but we can do it .  and then they   ll snap back together .  the future that happens depends on you .  we want the future where vimes is a good copper .  not the other one .         but it must   ve happened .     snapped vimes .     i told you  i can remember it .  i was there yesterday .         nice try  but that doesn   t mean anything anymore     said the monk .     trust me .  yes  it   s happened to you  but even though it has  it might not .     cos of quantum .  right now  there isn   t a commander vimes   shaped hole in the future to drop you into .  it   s officially uncertain .  but might not be  if you do it right .  you owe it to yourself  commander .  right now  out there  sam vimes is learning to be a very bad copper indeed .  and he learns fast .      the little monk stood up .     i   ll let you think about that     he said .   vimes nodded  staring at the gravel garden .   sweeper crept away quietly and went back into the temple .  he walked to the other side of the office .  he removed a strange key from around his neck and inserted it into a small door .  the door opened .  brilliant sunlight burst ahead of him .   he walked on  his sandals leaving the cold flagstones and walking onto well trodden earth in broad  hot daylight .   the river had a different course this far back in the past  and present day residents of ankh morpork would have been surprised at how pleasant it looked seven hundred thousand years ago .  hippos sunbathed on a sandbank out in midstream and  according to qu  were getting troublesome lately   he   d had to set up a little temporal fence around the camp at night  so that any hippos trying to wander in among the tents found themselves back in the water with a headache .   qu himself  his straw hat protecting his head from the hot sun  was supervising his assistants in a vined off area .  lu tze sighed as he walked toward it .   there were going to be explosions  he knew it .   it wasn   t that he disliked qu  the order   s master of devices .  the man was a sort of engineering equivalent of the abbott .  the abbott had taken thousand year old ideas and put them through his mind in a new way  and  as a result  the multiverse had opened for him like a flower .  qu  on the other hand  had taken the ancient technology of the procrastinators  which could save and restore time  and had harnessed it to practical  everyday purposes  such as  yes  blowing people   s heads off .  it was something that lu tze tried to avoid .  there were better things to do with people   s heads .   as lu tze approached  a line of joyful  dancing monks wove their way along a bamboo replica of a street  letting off firecrackers and banging gongs .   as they reached a corner  the last monk turned and lightly tossed a little drum into the outstretched arms of a straw dummy .   the air shimmered  and the figure disappeared with a small thunderclap .      nice to see something not blowing anyone   s head off     said lu tze  leaning on the vine rope .      oh  hello  sweeper     said qu .     yes .  i wonder what went wrong .  you see  the body should have moved forward by a microsecond and left the head where it was .     he picked up a megaphone .     thank you  everyone .  places for another run .  soto  take over  please .      he turned to lu tze .     well .         he   s thinking about it     said sweeper .      oh  for heavens    sake  lu tze .  this is completely unauthorized  you know .  we   re supposed to prune out rogue history loops  not expend vast amounts of time keeping them going .         this one   s important .  we owe it to the man .  it wasn   t his fault we had the major temporal shattering just as he fell through the dome .         two timelines running side by side     moaned qu .     that   s quite unacceptable  you know .  i   m having to use techniques that are completely untried .         yes  but it   s only a few days .         what about vimes .  is he strong enough .  he   s got no training for this .         he defaults to being a copper .  a copper   s a copper  wherever he is .         i really don   t know why i listen to you  lu tze  i really don   t     said qu .  he glanced at the arena and hurriedly raised his megaphone to his lips .     don   t hold it that way up .  i said don   t hold        there was a thunderclap .  lu tze didn   t bother to turn around .   qu lifted the megaphone again and said wearily     all right  someone please go and fetch brother kai  will you .  start looking around  oh  two centuries ago .  you don   t even use these very useful devices i  er  devise     he added to lu tze .      don   t need to     said lu tze .     got a brain .  anyway  i use the temporal toilet  don   t i .         a privy that discharges ten million years into the past was not a good idea  sweeper .  i   m sorry i let you persuade me .         it   s saving us fourpence a week to harry king   s bucket boys  qu  and that   s not to be sneezed at .  is it not written     a penny saved is a penny earned .     besides  it all lands in a volcano anyway .  perfectly hygienic .      there was another explosion .  qu turned and raised his megaphone .      do not bang the tambourine more than twice .     he bellowed .     it   s tap tap throw duck .  please pay attention .      he turned to sweeper .      four more days at most  lu tze     he said .     i   m sorry  but after that i can   t hide it in the paperwork .  and i   ll be amazed if your man can stand it .  it   ll affect his mind sooner or later  however tough you think he is .  he   s not in his right time .         we   re learning a lot  though     lu tze insisted .     for a perfectly logical chain of reasons vimes ended up back in time even looking rather like keel .  eyepatch and scar .  is that narrative causality  or historical imperative  or just plain weird .  are we back to the old theory of the self correcting history .  is there no such thing as an accident  as the abbott says .  is every accident just a higher order design .  i   d love to find out .         four days     qu insisted .     any longer than that and this little exercise will show up  and the abbot will be very  very annoyed with us .         right you are  qu     said the sweeper meekly .   he   ll be annoyed if he has to find out  certainly  he thought as he walked back to the door in the air .  he   d been very specific .  the abbott of the history monks  the men in saffron  no such monastery   they had many names  couldn   t allow this sort of thing  and he   d taken pains to forbid lu tze from this course of action .  he had added     but when you do  i expect historical imperative will win .          sweeper went back to the garden and found vimes still staring at the empty baked bean tin of universal oneness .      well  commander .     he said .      are you really like   policemen  for time .     said vimes .      well  in a way     said sweeper .      so   you make sure the good stuff happens .         no  not the good stuff .  the right stuff     said sweeper .     but frankly  these days  we have our work cut out for us making sure anything happens .  we used to think time was like a river  you could row up and down and come back to the same place .  then we found it acted like a sea  so you could go from side to side as well .  then it turned out to be like a ball of water  you could go up and down  too .  currently we think it   s like   oh  lots of spaces  all rolled up .  and then there are time jumps  and time slips  and humans mess it up  too  wasting it and gaining it .  and then there   s quantum  of course .     the monk sighed .     there   s always bloody quantum .  so what with one thing and another  we think we   re doing well if yesterday happens before tomorrow  quite frankly .  you  mister vimes  got caught up in a bit of   an event .  we can   t put it right  not properly .  you can .      vimes sat back .     i   ve got no choice  have i .     he said .     as my old sergeant used to say   you do the job that   s in front of you .     he hesitated .     and that   s going to be me  isn   t it .  i taught me all i know           no .  i explained .         i didn   t understand it .  but perhaps i don   t have to .      sweeper sat down .      good .  and now  mister vimes  i   ll take you back inside and we   ll work out what you need to know from all this  and qu   ll set up the spinners and we   ll just   bounce you in time a little so that you give yourself the message .  you know you did it  because you saw it .  we can   t have you running around knowing all about us .         i   ll get suspicious .         you   ll have to make it convincing .         i   ll still be suspicious .         you won   t trust even yourself .         i   m a devious character .  i could be hiding something .  how are you going to get me back to the watch house .  don   t even think about giving me some kind of potion .         no .  we   ll blindfold you  twirl you round  take you the long way  and walk you back .  i promise .         any other advice .     said vimes  gloomily .      just be yourself     said sweeper .     see it through .  there   ll come a time when you   ll look back and see how it all made sense .         really .         i wouldn   t lie .  it   ll be a perfect moment .  believe me .         but       vimes hesitated .      yes .         you must know there   s another little problem if i   m going to be sergeant keel .  i   ve remembered what day this is .  and i know what   s going to happen .         yes     said sweeper .     i know  too .  shall we talk about that .          captain tilden blinked .      what happened there .     he said .      where .     said vimes  trying to fight down nausea .  time coming back had felt like being squeezed just for a moment in a giant vise .      you blurred  man .         perhaps i   m a bit tired of this     said vimes .     listen  captain  i am john keel .  i can prove it  okay .  ask me some questions .  you   ve got my papers there  haven   t you .      tilden hesitated for a moment .  he was a man whose mind was ponderous enough to have momentum  it was quite hard for his thoughts to change direction .      who is commander of the pseudopolis watch  then .     he said .      sheriff macklewheet     said vimes .      aha .  wrong .  fallen at the very first fence  what .  in fact  you fool  it   s sheriff pearlie           hnah  excuse me  sir       said snouty nervously .      yes .  what .         hnah  it is macklewheet  sir .  pearlie died last week .  heard it in the  hnah  pub .         fell into the river when drunk     said vimes helpfully .      that   s what i heard  hnah  sir     said snouty .   tilden looked furious .      you could   ve known that  what .     he said .     it doesn   t prove anything .         ask me something else  then     said vimes .     ask me what macklewheet said about me .     and i just hope i   ve got the answers right  he added to himself .      well .         said i was the best officer on his force and he was sorry to see me go     said vimes .     said i was of good character .  said he wished he could pay me the twenty five dollars a month i was going to get here           i never offered you           no  you offered me twenty dollars and now that i   ve seen the mess here i   m not taking it .     vimes rejoiced .  tilden hadn   t even learned how to control a conversation .     if you pay knock twenty dollars  he owes you nineteen dollars change .  the man couldn   t talk and chew gum at the same time .  and look at this  will you .      vimes dumped his handcuffs on the desk .  the gaze of snouty and tilden swung to them as if magnetic .   oh dear  thought vimes and stood up and lifted the crossbow out of snouty   s hands .  it was all in the movement .  if you moved with authority  you got a second or two extra .  authority was everything .   he fired the bow at the floor  then handed it back .      a kid could open those cuffs and while snouty here keeps a very clean jail he   s completely drawers at being a guard     said vimes .     this place needs shaking up .     he leaned forward  knuckles on the captain   s desk  with his face a few inches from the trembling mustache and the milky eyes .      twenty five dollars or i walk out that door     he said .  it was probably a phrase never ever said before by any prisoner anywhere on any world .      twenty five dollars     murmured tilden  hypnotized .      and the rank will be sergeant at arms     said vimes .     not sergeant .  i   m not going to be given orders by the likes of knock .         sergeant at arms     said tilden distantly  but vimes saw the hint of approval .  it was a good military sounding title  and it was still on the books .  in fact  it was a pretty ancient pre coppering term  back in the days when a court employed a big man with a stick to drag miscreants in front of it .  vimes had always admired the simplicity of that arrangement .      well  er  sheriff macklewheet  er  certainly gave you a most glowing reference     said the captain  shuffling the paper .     very glowing .  things have been a little difficult since we lost sergeant wi           and i   ll be paid my first month in advance  please .  i need clothes and a decent meal and somewhere to sleep .      tilden cleared his throat .     many of the unmarried men stay in the barracks in cheapside           not me     said vimes .     i   ll be lodging with doctor lawn in twinkle street .     well  rosie palm did suggest he had a spare room        the pox  hnah  doctor .     said snouty .      yeah  i   m particular about the company i keep     said vimes .     it   s also just around the corner .      he took his hands off the desk  stood back  and whipped off a salute of almost parodic efficiency  the sort that tilden had always loved .      i   ll report for duty at three o   clock tomo   this afternoon  sir     he said .     thank you  sir .      tilden sat mesmerized .      it was twenty five dollars  sir  i believe     said vimes  still maintaining the salute .   he watched the captain get up and go to the old green safe in the corner .  the man was careful not to let vimes see him turn the dial  but vimes was pretty certain he didn   t need to .  the safe had still been there when he made captain  and by then everyone knew the combination was          and no one seemed to know how to change it .  the only thing worth keeping in it had been the tea and sugar and anything you particularly wanted nobby to read .   tilden came back with a small leather bag and slowly counted out the money  and was so cowed that he didn   t ask vimes to sign anything .   vimes took it  saluted again  and held out his other hand .      badge  sir     he said .      ah .  oh  yes  of course        the captain  entirely unnerved  fumbled in the top drawer of the desk and pulled out a dull copper shield .  if he   d been more observant  he   d have noticed how hungrily vimes   s eyes watched it .   the new sergeant at arms picked up his badge with care and saluted yet again .      oath  sir     he said .      oh  er  that thing .  er  i believe i   ve got it written down somewh        vimes took a deep breath .  this probably wasn   t a good idea  but he was flying now .      i comma square bracket recruit   s name square bracket

shilling  sir     said vimes insistently  soaring on wings of audacity .      what .         i have to take the king   s shilling  sir .         er   do we have a           it   s  hnah  in the bottom drawer  sir     said snouty helpfully .     on the bit of string .         oh yes     said tilden  beaming .     it   s a long time since we used that  what .         is it .     said vimes .   after some rummaging  tilden produced the coin .  it was a genuine old shilling  probably worth half a dollar now just for its silver  and thus  coppers being coppers  it had always been dropped into the new copper   s hand and then tugged away before it was pinched .   vimes had taken the oath once .  he wondered if taking it twice canceled it out .  but it needed to be done and you had to at least touch the shilling .  he felt the weight in his palm and took a small shameful pleasure in closing his fingers on it before the captain had time to drag it back .  then  point made  he released the grip .   with a final salute  he turned and tapped snouty on the shoulder .      with the captain   s permission  i   d like a chat with you outside  please .      and vimes strode out .   snouty looked at tilden  who was still sitting as though hypnotized  the shilling dangling from his fist .  the captain managed to say     good man  that .  ver    good   got backbone           hnah  i   ll just go an    see what he wants  sir     said snouty and scuttled out .   he reached the end of the corridor when a hand came out of the shadows and pulled him close .      you   re a useful man to know  snouty     hissed vimes .     i can tell .         yessir     said snouty  held half on tiptoe .      you   ve got your ear to the ground  eh .         yessir .         there   s someone in every nick who knows all that   s going on and can lay his hands on just about anything  snouty  and i think you are that man .         hnah  yessir .         then listen here     said vimes .     size eight boots  size seven and a quarter helmet  a good leather cape .  the boots should be a good make but secondhand .  got that .         secondhand .         yes .  soles pretty nearly worn through .         soles pretty nearly worn through  hnah  check     said snouty .      breastplate not to have any rust on it but a few dents will be okay .  a good sword  snouty  and believe me i know a good sword when i hold one .  as for all the rest of the stuff  well  i know a man like you can get hold of the very best and have it delivered to dr .  lawn   s place on twinkle street by ten tomorrow .  and there   ll be something in it for you  snouty .         what   ll that be  sir .     said snouty  who was finding the grip uncomfortable .      my undying friendship  snouty     said vimes .     which is going to be an extremely rare coin in these parts  let me tell you .         right you are  sarge     said snouty .     and a bell  sir .         a bell .         for ringing and shouting  hnah     all   s well .     with  sarge .      vimes considered this .  a bell .  well  every copper still got a bell  it was down there in the regulations  but vimes had banned its use on anything but ceremonial occasions        no bell for me  snouty     said vimes .     do you think things are well .      snouty swallowed .      could go either way  sarge     he managed .      good man .  see you tomorrow .      there was a glow of dawn in the sky when vimes strode out  but the city was still a pattern of shadows .   in his pocket was the reassuring heaviness of the badge .  and in his mind the huge  huge freedom of the oath .  ruler after ruler had failed to notice what a devious oath it was     he walked as steadily as he could down to twinkle street .  a couple of watchmen tried to waylay him  but he showed them the badge and  more important  he had the voice now  it had come back to him .  it was night and he was walking the streets and he owned the damn streets and somehow that came out in the way he spoke .  they   ve hurried off .  he wasn   t sure they   d believed him  but at least they   d pretended to  the voice had told them he could be the kind of trouble they weren   t paid enough to deal with .   at one point he had to step aside as a very thin horse dragged a huge and familiar four wheeled wagon over the cobbles .  frightened faces looked out at him from between the wide metal strips that covered most of it  and then it disappeared into the gloom .  curfew was claiming its nightly harvest .   these were not good times .  everyone knew lord winder was insane .  and then some kid who was equally mad had tried to knock him off and would have done  too  if the man hadn   t moved at the wrong moment .  his lordship had taken the arrow in the arm  and they said   they being the nameless people of the kind that everyone meets in the pub   that the wound had poisoned him and made him worse .  he suspected everyone and everything  he saw dark assassins on every corner .  the rumor was that he woke up sweating every night because they even got into his dreams .   and he saw plots and spies everywhere throughout his waking hours  and had men root them out  and the thing about rooting out plots and spies everywhere is that  even if there are no real plots to begin with  there are plots and spies galore very soon .   at least the night watch didn   t have to do much of the actual rooting .  they just arrested the pieces .  it was the special office in cable street that was the long hand of his lordship   s paranoia .  the particulars  they were officially  but as far as vimes could remember they   d reveled in their nickname of the unmentionables .  they were the ones that listened in every shadow and watched at every window .  that was how it seemed  anyway .  they certainly were the ones who knocked on doors in the middle of the night .   vimes stopped in the dark .  the cheap clothes were soaked through  the boots were flooded  and rain was trickling off his chin  and he was a long  long way from home .  yet  in a treacherous kind of way  this was home .  he   d spent most of his days working nights .  walking through the wet streets of a sleeping city was his life .   the nature of the night changed  but the nature of the beast remained the same .   he reached into the ragged pocket and touched the badge again .   in the darkness where lamps were few and far between  vimes knocked on a door .  a light was burning in one of the lower windows  so lawn was presumably still awake .   after a while  a very small panel slid back  and he heard a voice say     oh   it   s you .      there was a pause  followed by the sound of bolts being released .   the doctor opened the door .  in one hand he held a very long syringe .  vimes found his gaze inexorably drawn to it .  a bead of something purple dripped off the end and splashed onto the floor .      what would you have done  inject me to death .     he said .      this .     lawn looked at the instrument as if unaware that he   d been holding it .     oh   just sorting out a little problem for someone .  patients turn up at all hours .         i   ll bet they do .  er   rosie said you had a spare room     said vimes .     i can pay     he added quickly .     i   ve got a job .  five dollars a month .  i won   t be needing it for long .         upstairs on the left     said lawn  nodding .     we can talk about it in the morning .         i   m not a criminal madman     said vimes .  he wondered why he said it  and then wondered who he was trying to reassure .      never mind  you   ll soon fit in     said lawn .  there was a whimper from the door leading to the surgery .      the bed   s not aired but i doubt that you   ll care     he said .     and now  if you   ll excuse me        it wasn   t aired  and vimes didn   t care .  he didn   t even remember getting into it .   he woke up once  in darkness and panic  and heard the sound of the big black wagon rattling down the street .  and then it just  quite seamlessly  became part of the nightmare .       at ten o   clock in the morning vimes found a cold cup of tea by his bed  and a pile of clothes and armor on the floor outside the door .  he drank the tea while he inspected the pile .   he   d read snouty right .  the man survived because he was a weathercock and kept an eye on which way the wind was blowing  and right now the wind was blowing due vimes .  he   d even included fresh socks and drawers  which hadn   t been in the specifications .  it was a thoughtful touch .  they probably hadn   t been paid for  of course .  they had been    obtained .     this was the old night watch .   but  glory be  the breathy little crawler had scrounged something else  too .  the three stripes for a sergeant had a little gold crown above them .  vimes instinctively disliked crowns  but this was one he was prepared to treasure .   he went downstairs  doing up his belt  and bumped into lawn coming out of his surgery  wiping his hands on a cloth .  the doctor smiled absently  then focused on the uniform .  the smile did not so much fade as drain .      shocked .     said vimes .      surprised     said the doctor .     rosie won   t be  i expect .  i don   t do anything illegal  you know .         then you   ve got nothing to fear     said vimes .      really .  that proves you   re not from round here     said lawn .     want some breakfast .  there   s kidneys .     this time it was vimes   s smile that drained .     lamb     the doctor added .   in the tiny kitchen he prized the lid off a tall stone jar and pulled out a can .  vapor poured off it .      ice     he said .     get it from over the road .  keeps food fresh .      vimes   s brow wrinkled .     over the road .  you mean the mortuary .         don   t worry  it   s not been used     said lawn  putting a pan on the stove .     mr .  garnish drops off a lump a few times a week  in payment for being cured of a rather similar medical condition .         but mostly you work for the ladies of  shall we say  negotiable affection .     said vimes .  lawn gave him a sharp look to see if he was joking  but vimes   s expression hadn   t changed .      not just them     he said .     there are others .         people who come in by the back door     said vimes  looking around the little room .     people who for one reason or another don   t want to go to the   better known doctors .         or can   t afford them     said lawn .     people who turn up with no identity .  and you had a point   john .         no  no  just asking     said vimes  cursing himself for walking right into it .     i just wondered where you trained .         why .         the kind of people who come in by the back door are the kind of people who want results  i imagine .         hah .  well  i trained in klatch .  they have some novel ideas about medicine over there .  they think it   s a good idea to get patients better  for one thing .     he turned the kidneys over with a fork .     frankly  sergeant  i   m pretty much like you .  we do what needs doing  we work in  er  unpopular areas  and i suspect we both draw the line somewhere .  i   m no butcher .  rosie says you aren   t .  but you do the job that   s in front of you  or people die .         i   ll remember that     said vimes .      and when all   s said and done     said lawn     there are worse things to do in the world than take the pulse of women .      after breakfast  sergeant at arms john keel stepped out into the first day of the rest of his life .   he stood still for a moment  shut his eyes  and swiveled both feet like a man trying to stub out two cigarettes at once .  a slow  broad smile spread across his face .  snouty had found just the right kind of boots .  willikins and sybil between them conspired to prevent him wearing old  well worn boots these da   those days  and stole them away in the night to have the soles repaired .  it was good to feel the streets with dry feet again .  and after a lifetime of walking them  he did feel the streets .  there were the cobblestones  catheads  trollheads  loaves  short and long setts  rounders  morpork sixes  and the eighty seven types of paving brick  and the fourteen types of stone slab  and the twelve types of stone never intended for street slabs but which had got used anyway and had their own patterns of wear  and the rubbles  and the gravels  and the repairs  and the thirteen different types of cellar covers  and twenty types of drain lids     he bounced a little  like a man testing the hardness of something .     elm street     he said .  he bounced again .     junction with twinkle .  yeah .      he was back .   it wasn   t many steps to treacle mine road  and as he turned toward the watch house  a flash of color caught his eye .   and there it was  overhanging a garden wall .  lilac was common in the city .  it was vigorous and hard to kill  and had to be .   the flower buds were noticeably swelling .   he stood and stared  as a man might stare at an old battlefield .      they rise hands up  hands up  hands up    .   how did it go  now .  think of things happening one after the other .  don   t assume that you know what   s going to happen  because it might not .  be yourself .   and  because he was himself  he made a few little purchases in little shops in dark alleys  and went to work .   the treacle mine road night watch house was generally deserted around midday  but vimes knew that snouty  at least  would be there .  he was a persistent floater  just like nobby and colon and carrot and  when you got down to it  vimes as well .  being on duty was their default state of being .  they hung around the watch house even when off duty  because that   s where their lives took place .  being a copper wasn   t something you left hanging by the door when you went home .   but i promise i   ll learn how  thought vimes .  when i get back  it   ll all be different .   he went around the back and let himself in by the stable entrance .  it wasn   t even locked .  black mark right there  lads .   the iron bulk of the hurry up wagon stood empty on the cobbles .   behind it was what they called  now  the stables .  in fact  the stables were only the bottom floor of what would have been part of ankh morpork   s industrial heritage  if anyone had ever thought of it like that .  in fact they thought of it as junk that was too heavy to cart away .  it was part of the winding gear from one of the original treacle mines  long since abandoned .  one of the original lifting buckets was still up there  glued to the floor by its last load of the heavy  sticky  unrefined treacle  which  once set  was tougher than cement and more waterproof than tar .  vimes remembered  as a kid  begging chippings of pig treacle off the miners  one lump of that  oozing the sweetness of prehistoric sugar cane  could keep a boy   s mouth happily shut for a week .    inside the treacle roofed stable level  chewing a bit of bad hay  was the horse .  vimes knew it was a horse because it checked out as one  four hooves  tail  head with mane  seedy brown coat .  considered from another angle  it was half a ton of bones held together with horsehair .   he patted it gingerly  as one of nature   s pedestrians  he   d never been at home around horses .  he unhooked a greasy clipboard from a nail nearby and flicked through its pages .  then he had another look around the yard .  tilden never did that .  he looked at the pigsty in the corner where knock kept his pig  and then at the chicken run  and the pigeon loft  and the badly made rabbit hutches  and he did a few calculations .   the old watch house .  it was all there  just like the day he first arrived .  it had been two houses once  and one of them had been the treacle mine office .  everywhere in the city had been something else once .  and so the place was a maze of blocked in doorways and ancient windows and poky rooms .   he wandered around like a man in a museum .  see the old helmet on a stick for archery practice .  see sergeant knock   s broken springed armchair  where he used to sit out on sunny afternoons .   and  inside  the smell  floor wax  stale sweat  armor polish  unwashed clothes  ink  a hint of fried fish  and always  here  a taint of treacle .   the night watch .  he was back .   when the first members of the night watch came in  they found a man perfectly at ease  leaning back in a chair with his feet on a desk and leafing through paperwork .  the man had sergeant   s stripes and an air of an unsprung trap .  he was also giving absolutely no attention to the newcomers .  he particularly paid no heed to one gangly lance constable who was still new enough to have tried to put a shine on his breastplate     they fanned out among the desks  with muttered conversations .   vimes knew them in his soul .  they were in the night watch because they were too scruffy  ugly  incompetent  awkwardly shaped  or bloody minded for the day watch .  they were honest  in that special policeman sense of the word .  that is  they didn   t steal things too heavy to carry .  and they had the morale of damp gingerbread .   he   d wondered last night about giving them some kind of pep talk by way of introduction  and decided against it .  they might be very bad at it but they were coppers  and coppers did not respond well to the happy families approach     hello  chaps  call me christopher  my door is always open  i   m sure if we all pull together we shall get along splendidly  like one big happy family .     they   d seen too many families to fall for that rubbish .   someone cleared his throat with malice aforethought .  vimes glanced up and into the face of sergeant    knocker    knock and  for a fraction of a second  had to suppress the urge to salute .  then he remembered what knock was .      well .     he said .      that   s my desk you   re sitting at  sergeant     said knock .   vimes sighed and pointed to the little crown on his sleeve .      see this  sergeant .     he said .     it   s what they used to call the hat of authority .      knock   s little weasely eyes focused on the crown .  and then they went back to vimes   s face and widened in the shock of recognition .      bloody hell     breathed knock .      that   s    bloody hell  sir        said vimes .     but    sarge    will do .  most of the time .  and this is your mob  is it .  oh dear .  well  let   s make a start .      he swung his feet off the desk and stood up .      i   ve been looking at the feed bills for marilyn     he said .     interesting reading  ladies .  according to my rough calculations  a horse eating that much ought to be approximately spherical .  instead  she   s so thin that with two sticks and some sheet music i could give you a tune .      vimes put the papers down .      don   t think i don   t know where the feed goes .  i bet i know who   s got the chickens and rabbits and pigeons     he said .     and the pig .  i bet the captain thinks they get fat on leftovers .         yeah  but       a voice began .   vimes   s hand slammed on the desk .      you even starve the damn horse .     he said .     that stops right now .  so will a lot of other things .  i know how it works  see .  mumping free beer and a doughnut  well  that   s part of being a copper .  and who knows  there might even be a few greasy spoons in this town so happy to see a copper that they will spontaneously offer him a free nosh .  stranger things have happened .  but nicking the oats from marilyn  that stops now .  and another thing .  says here that last night the hurry up wagon had eight passengers     he said .     two of them i know about     cos one of them must   ve been me  and i met the other man .  the cells are empty this morning .  what happened to the other six .  sergeant knock .      the sergeant licked his lips nervously .      dropped    em off in cable street for questioning  o   course     he said .     as per instructions .         did you get a receipt .         a what .         your men hauled in six people who were staying out late and you handed them over to the unmentionables     said vimes with the calm that comes before a storm .     did they sign for them .  do you even know their names .         orders is just to hand    em over     said knock  trying a little defiance .     hand    em over and come away .      vimes filed that for future reference and said     now  i didn   t get taken there    cos we had a bit of a   misunderstanding .  and  as you can see  it was a bigger misunderstanding than you thought  because i   m not down in the tanty counting cockroaches  knock .  no  indeed .     he took a few steps forward .     i am standing in front of you  knock .  isn   t that what i   m doing .         yes  sarge     knock muttered  pale with fear and fury .      yes  sarge     said vimes .     but there was another man in the cells  and he   s gone  too .  all i want to know is  how much  and who to .  i don   t want any looks of cherubic innocence  i don   t want any    don   t know what you   re talking about  sir     i just want to know  how much  and who to .      a cloud of red  resentful solidarity settled over the faces in front of him .  but he didn   t need telling .  he could remember .  corporal quirke always had a private income from bribes  he   d been like nobby nobbs without the latter   s amiable incompetence .  an efficient nobby  in fact  and you could throw into the mix bullying and brownnosing and a delight in small evils .   vimes   s gaze fell on quirke and stayed there .      i know you were on the wagon last night  corporal     he said .     you and lance constable  er  vimes  it says here .         not worth worrying anyone if they look a decent sort     quirke said .   and he   d said     how can we tell they   re a decent sort  corp .         well  see how much they can afford .         you mean we let    em go if they   re rich .         way of the world  lad  way of the world .  no reason why we shouldn   t get our share  eh .  did you see his moneybag .  five dollars should do it .  four for me and one for you     cos you   re learning .  that   s nearly three days    pay  it   ll cheer up your ol    mum no end  and where   s the loser .         but suppose he   s nicked the money  corp .         suppose the moon was made of cheese .  would you like a slice .         i think it was five dollars  corporal     said vimes and watched the man   s lizard eyes flash toward the young lance constable .      no  the man in the cell talked     lied vimes .     told me i was an idiot not to buy my way out .  so  mister quirke  it   s like this .  they   re crying out for good men in the day watch  but if you don   t stand too close to the light you might pass .  get along there right now .         everybody does it .     quirke burst out .     it   s perks .         everybody .     said vimes .  he looked around at the squad .     anyone else here take bribes .      his glare ran from face to face  causing most of the squad to do an immediate impression of the floorboard and ceiling inspectors synchronized observation team .  only three members met his gaze .  there was constable colon  who could be a little slow .  there was a certain lance constable  whose face was a mask of terror .  and there was a dark haired  round faced constable who seemed to be puzzled  as if he was trying to remember something  but who nevertheless stared back with the firm steady gaze of the true liar .      apparently not     said vimes .   quirke   s finger shot out and vibrated in the direction of the young sam vimes .      he shared it .  he shared it .     he said .     you ask him .      vimes felt the shock run round the squad .  quirke had just committed suicide .  you hung together against officers  fair enough  but when the jig was up you did not drop someone in the cacky .  they   d laugh at the idea of a watchman   s honor  but it did exist in a blackened  twisty way .  you did not drop your mates in the cacky .  and especially you did not do it to a wet behind the ears rookie who didn   t know any better .   vimes turned  for the first time  to the young man whose gaze he   d been avoiding .       gods  was i ever that skinny .  he thought .  did i ever have that much adam   s apple .  did i really try to polish rust .   the young man   s eyes were almost back in his head  only the whites showing .      lance constable vimes  isn   t it .     he said quietly .      yessir .     said sam hoarsely .      at ease  lance constable .  did you  in fact  take a share of the bribe .         yessir .  a dollar  sir .         at the instigation of corporal quirke .         er   sir .         did he offer it to you .     vimes translated .   vimes watched his own agony .  you did not drop someone in the cacky .      all right     he said .     i   ll talk to you later on .  oh  you still here  quirke .  if you want to complain to the captain  that   s fine by me .  but if you don   t get your stuff out of your locker in ten minutes  i   ll damn well charge you rent .      quirke looked around for immoral support  and found none .  he   d gone too far .  besides  the watch could see a storm of cacky when it was right overhead  and were in no mood to stick their necks out for something like quirke .      i will     he said .     i will complain to the captain .  you   ll see .  you   ll see .  i   ve got four years good conduct  i have           no  that was four years not found out     said vimes .     clear off .      when quirke   s footsteps had died away  vimes cast an eye over the squad .      good afternoon  lads  my name   s john keel     he said .     we bloody well better get along fine .  now shine up  captain   s inspection in two minutes  off you go   sergeant knock  a word  please .      the men dispersed hurriedly .  knock stepped forward  not quite managing to conceal his nervousness .  after all  his immediate superior now was a man who  last night  he had kicked in the nadgers .  people could hold a grudge about a thing like that .  and he   d had time to think .      i   d just like to say  sir  about last night       he began .      i   m not bothered about last night     said vimes .      you   re not .         would you recommend fred colon for corporal .  i   d value your judgment .         you would .         certainly .  he looks a solid lad .         he does .  i mean  yes  he is .  very thorough     said knock  relief rising off him like steam .     doesn   t rush into things .  wants to join one of the regiments .         well  we   ll give him a try while we   ve still got him .  that means we   ll need another lance corporal .  who was that lad next to colon .         coates  sir .  ned coates .  bright lad  sometimes thinks he knows better  but we were all like that  eh .      vimes nodded .  his expression completely failed to give away the fact that  as far as he was concerned  there were things clinging to the underside of high branches that knew better than sergeant knock .      a taste of responsibility might do him some good  then     he said .  knock nodded  because at that point he would have agreed to absolutely anything .  and his body language was saying  we   re all sergeants together  right .  we   re talking about sergeanty things  like sergeants do .  we   re not bothered about anyone being kicked in the nadgers  eh .  not us .     cos we   re sergeants .   his eyes widened  and he saluted as tilden entered the office .  there was some halfhearted saluting among the squad  too .  the captain acknowledged them stiffly and looked nervously at vimes .      ah  sergeant     he said .     settling in .         yessir .  no problems .         well done .  carry on .      when the man had disappeared up the creaking stairs  vimes turned back to knock .      sergeant  we don   t hand over prisoners without a receipt  understand .  never .  what happens to them afterward .  do you know .         they get questioned     said knock .     we takes    em up there for questioning .         what kind of questions .  how long it takes two men to dig half a hole .         what .         from now on  someone at cable street signs for prisoners or we bring them right back here     said vimes .     it   s bloody elementary  sergeant .  you hand    em over  you get a docket .  don   t you do that down at the tanty .         well  yeah  obviously  but   well  cable street   i mean  you don   t know what it   s like here  i can see that  but with the unmentionables    round at cable street it   s best not to           listen  i   m not telling you to kick the door down and shout    put down those thumbscrews .        said vimes .     i   m telling you we keep track of prisoners .  when you arrest a man  you sign him over to snouty  don   t you .  when he leaves  snouty or the orderly man signs him out  doesn   t he .  it   s basic custody discipline  man .  so if you hand a prisoner over to cable street  someone there gives you a signature .  understand .  no one just disappears .      knock   s face showed a man contemplating an immediate future that contained fewer opportunities for personal gain and a greatly raised risk of being shouted at .      and just to make sure everyone understands  i   ll ride the wagon tonight     said vimes .     but first i   ll take that lad vimes out for a stroll and shake him up a bit .         he could do with it     said knock .     can   t get his mind right .  good with his hands but you have to tell him everything twice .         maybe i   ll shout  then     said vimes .     vimes .      lance constable vimes shivered to attention .      we   re going to take a stroll  lad     said vimes .     time you knew what   s what .      he nodded to knock  took his younger self by the shoulder  and marched out .      what d   you think  sarge .     said coates  coming up behind knock as the sergeant glared at the departing back .      he likes you     said knock bitterly .     oh  yes .  apple of his eye  you are .  you   re his ol    pal .  you   re being bumped up to lance corporal .         think he   ll last .         i   ll give him a couple of weeks     said knock .     i   ve seen    em like that before .  big men in little towns  coming here  thinking they   re the bee   s nose .  we soon cut    em down to size .  what d   you think .         dunno  sarge     said coates .     still thinking .         knows his coppering  mind you     said knock .     bit too cocky  though .  he   ll learn .  he   ll learn .  there   s ways .  we   ll show him .  take him down a peg .  teach him how we do things around here            vimes always preferred to walk by himself .  and now there were two of him  walking by himself .  it was a strange sensation  and gave him the impression that he was looking through a mask .      no  not like that     he said .     i always have to teach people to walk .  you swing the foot  like this .  get it right and you can keep going all day .  you   re not in a hurry .  you don   t want to miss things .         yes  sarge     said young sam .   it was called proceeding .  vimes proceeded along treacle mine road  and felt   magnificent .  of course  there were lots of things to worry about  but right here and now all he had to do was patrol  and it felt fine .  not much paperwork in the old watch  in fact  come to think of it  he   d probably doubled it .  all he had to do right now was his duty  as he   d been taught it .  he had nothing to do but be himself .   young sam wasn   t saying much .  that was good sense .      i see you   ve got a bell there  lad     said vimes after a while .      yes  sarge .         regulation bell .         yes  sarge .  sergeant knock gave it to me .     i   ll bet he did  thought vimes .      when we get back  just you swap it for someone else   s .  doesn   t matter whose .  no one   ll say anything .         yes  sarge .     vimes waited .     why  sarge .  a bell   s a bell .         not that one     said vimes .     that   s three times the weight of the normal bell .  they give it to rookies to see what they do .  did you complain .         no  sarge .         that   s the way .  keep quiet  and pass it on to some other sucker when we get back .  that   s the copper   s way .  why did you come into the job  lad .         my mate iffy joined last year .  he said you got free food and a uniform and you could pick up the extra dollar here and there .         that   d be iffy scurrick stationed over in the dolly sisters    house  then     said vimes .     and you   ve been picking up the odd dollar  have you .      they walked in silence for a moment .  then sam said     have i got to give that dollar back  sarge .         are you worth a dollar .     said vimes .      i gave it our mum  sarge .         did you tell her how you got it .         i didn   t want it .     sam blurted out .     but corporal quirke said           was he worth listening to .         dunno  sarge .         you don   t know .  i bet your mum didn   t bring you up to think like that     said vimes .  no  she bloody well didn   t  he thought .  she   d tan your hide  copper or not  if she   d known it was a dodgy dollar .      no  sarge .  but they   re all at it  sarge .  i don   t mean the lads  sarge  but you only have to look round the city .  our rent   s going up  taxes go up  there   s these new taxes all the time  and it   s all just cruel  sarge  it   s cruel .  winder sold us all to his mates  and that   s a fact  sir .     young sam   s face was red with indignation .      hmm     said vimes .  oh  yes .  tax farming .  what a clever invention .  good old winder .  he   d flogged the right to collect taxes to the highest bidders .  what a great idea  nearly as good as banning people from carrying weapons after dark .  because a  you saved the cost of tax collectors and the whole revenue system  b  you got a wagonload of cash up front  and c  the business of tax gathering then became the business of groups of powerful yet curiously reticent people who kept out of the light .  however  they employed people who not only went out in the light but positively blocked it  and it was amazing what those people found to tax  up to and including looking at me  pal .  what was it vetinari had said once .     taxation is just a sophisticated way of demanding money with menaces    .  well  the tax farmers were very unsophisticated in the way they went about recouping their investment .   he remembered those da   these days .  the city had never seemed poorer but  by the gods  there was a lot of tax being paid .   hard to explain to a kid like sam why poncing a dollar when you got the chance was a bad thing to do .      put it like this  lance constable     he said as they turned the corner .     would you let a murderer off for a thousand dollars .         no  sir .         a thousand dollars   d set your mum up in a nice place in a good part of town  though .         knock it off  sarge  i   m not like that .         you were when you took that dollar .  everything else is just a haggling over the price .      they walked in sullen silence .  then     am i going to get the sack  sarge .     said the lance constable .      for a dollar .  no .         i   d just as soon be sacked  sarge  thanks all the same .  last friday we had to go and break up some meeting over near the university .  they were just talking .  and we had to take orders from some civilian  and the cable street lads were a bit rough and   it   s not like the people had weapons or anything .  you can   t tell me that   s right  sarge .  and then we loaded some of    em into the hurry up  just for talking .  mrs .  owlesly   s boy elson never came home the other night  too  and they say he was dragged off to the palace just for saying his lordship   s a loony .  now people down our street are looking at me in a funny way .      ye gods  i remember  thought vimes .  i thought it was all going to be chasing men who gave up after the length of a street and said    it   s a fair cop  guv   nor .     i thought i   d have a medal by the end of the week .      you want to be careful what you say  lad     he said .      yeah  but our mum says it   s fair enough if they take away the troublemakers and the weirdies but it   s not right them taking away ordinary people .      is this really me .  vimes thought .  did i really have the political awareness of a head louse .      anyway  he is a loony .  snapcase is the man we ought to have .         and the self preservation instincts of a lemming .      kid  here   s some advice .  in this town  right now  if you don   t know who you   re talking to   don   t talk .         yes  but snapcase says           listen .  a copper doesn   t keep flapping his lip .  he doesn   t let on what he knows .  he doesn   t say what he   s thinking .  no .  he watches and listens and he learns and he bides his time .  his mind works like mad but his face is a blank .  until he   s ready .  understand .         all right  sarge .         good .  can you use that sword you have there  lad .         i did the training  yes .         fine .  fine .  the training .  fine .  so if we   re attacked by a lot of sacks of straw hanging from a beam  i can rely on you .  and until then shut up  keep your ears open and your eyes peeled  and learn something .      snapcase is the man to save us  he thought glumly .  yeah  i used to believe that .  a lot of folk did .  just because he rode around in an open carriage occasionally and called people over and talked to them  the level of the conversation being on the lines of    so  you   re a carpenter  are you .  wonderful .  what does that job entail .     just because he said publicly that perhaps taxes were a bit on the high side .  just because he waved .      you been here before  sarge .     said sam as they turned a corner .      oh  everyone   s visited ankh morpork  lad     said vimes jovially .      only we   re doing the elm street beat perfectly  sarge  and i   ve been letting you lead the way .      damn .  that was the kind of trouble your feet could get you into .  a wizard once told vimes that there were monsters up near the hub that were so big they had to have extra brains in their legs     cos they were too far away for one brain to think fast enough .  and a beat copper grew brains in his feet  he really did .   elm street  left into the pitts  left again into the scours   it was the first beat he   d ever walked  and he could do it without thinking .  he had done it without thinking .      i do my homework     he said .      did you recognize ned .     said sam .   perhaps it was a good thing that he was leaving his feet to their own devices  because vimes   s brain suddenly filled with warning bells .      ned .     he said .      only before you came he said he thought he remembered you from pseudopolis     said sam  oblivious to the clamor .     he was in the day watch there before he came here    cos of better promotion prospects .  big man  he said .         can   t say i recall him     said vimes with care .      you   re not all that big  sarge .         well  ned was probably shorter in those days     said vimes while his thoughts shouted  shut up  kid .  but the kid was   well  him .  niggling at little details .  tugging at things that didn   t seem to fit right .  being a copper  in fact .  probably he ought to feel proud of his younger self  but he didn   t .   you   re not me  he thought .  i don   t think i was ever as young as you .  if you   re going to be me  it   s going to take a lot of work .  thirty damn years of being hammered on the anvil of life  you poor bastard .  you   ve got it all to come .       back at the watch house  vimes wandered idly over to the evidence and lost property cupboard .  it had a big lock on it  which was not  however  ever locked .  he soon found what he was looking for .  an unpopular copper needed to think ahead  and he intended to be unpopular .   then he had a bite of supper and a mug of the thick brown cocoa on which the night watch ran  and took sam out on the hurry up wagon .   he   d wondered how the watch was going to play it  and wasn   t surprised to find they were using  with gleeful malignancy  the old dodge of obeying orders to the letter .  at the first point he made  lance corporal coates and constable waddy were waiting with four sullen or protesting insomniacs .      four  sah     said coates  ripping off a textbook salute .     all we   ve apprehended sah .  all written down on this chitty what i am giving to you at this moment in time sah .         well done  lance corporal     said vimes drily  taking the paperwork  signing one copy  and handing it back .     you may have a half holiday at hogswatch  and give my regards to your granny .  help    em in with    em  sam .         we usually only get four or five on a round  sir .     sam whispered as they pulled away .     what   ll we do .         make several journeys     said vimes .      but the lads were taking the pi   the michael  sir .  they were laughing .         it   s past curfew     said vimes .     that   s the law .      corporal colon and constable wiglet were waiting at their post with three miscreants .   one of them was miss palm .   vimes gave sam the reins and jumped down to open the back of the wagon and fold down the steps .      sorry to see you here  miss     he said .      apparently some new sergeant   s been throwing his weight around     said rosie palm in a voice of solid ice .  she refused his hand haughtily and climbed up into the wagon .   vimes realized that one of the other detainees was a woman  too .  she was shorter than rosie  and was giving him a look of pure bantam defiance .  she was also holding a huge quilted workbasket .  out of reflex  vimes took it  to help her up the steps .      sorry about this  miss       he began .      get your hands off that .      she snatched the basket back and scrambled into the darkness .      pardon me     said vimes .      this is miss battye     said rosie from the bench inside the wagon .     she   s a seamstress .         well  i assumed she           a seamstress  i said     said miss palm .     with needles and thread .  also specializes in crochet .         er  is that a kind of extra       vimes began .      it   s a type of knitting     said miss battye from the darkness of the wagon .     fancy you not knowing that .         you mean she   s a real       said vimes  but rosie slammed the iron door .     you just drive us on     she said     and when i see you again  john keel  we are going to have words .      there was some sniggering from the shadows inside the wagon  and then a yelp .  it had been immediately preceded by the noise of a spiky heel being driven into an instep .   vimes signed the grubby form presented to him by fred colon and handed it back with a solid  fixed expression that made the man feel rather worried .      where to now  sarge .     said sam as they pulled away .      cable street     said vimes .  there was a murmur of dismay from the crated people behind them .      that   s not right     muttered sam .      we   re playing this by the rules     said vimes .     you   re going to have to learn why we have rules  lance constable .  and don   t you eyeball me .  i   ve been eyeballed by experts  and you look as if you   re desperate for the privy .         yeah  all right  but everyone knows they torture people     mumbled sam .      do they .     said vimes .     then why doesn   t anyone do anything about it .            cos they torture people .      ah  at least i was getting a grasp of basic social dynamics  thought vimes .   sullen silence reigned in the seat behind him as the wagon rumbled through the streets  but he was aware of whispering from the wagon behind him .  slightly louder than the background  he heard rosie palm   s voice hiss     he won   t .  i   ll bet anything .      a few seconds later  a male voice  slightly the worse for drink and very much the worse for bladder twisting dread  managed     er  sergeant  we   er   believe the fine is five  er  dollars .         i don   t think it is  sir     said vimes  keeping his eyes on the damp streets .   there was some more frantic whispering  and then the voice said     er   i have a very nice gold ring           glad to hear it  sir     said vimes .     everyone should have something nice .     he patted his pocket for his silver cigar case  and for a moment felt more anger than despair  and more sorrow than anger .  there was a future .  there had to be .  he remembered it .  but it only existed as that memory  and that was as fragile as the reflection on a soap bubble and  maybe  just as easily popped .      er   i could perhaps include           if you try to offer me a bribe one more time  sir     said vimes as the wagon turned into cable street     i shall personally give you a thumping .  be told .         perhaps there is some other       rosie palm began  as the lights of the cable street house came into view .      we   re not at home to a tuppenny upright  either     said vimes and heard the gasp .     shut up  the lot of you .      he reined marilyn to a halt  jumped down  and pulled his clipboard from under the seat .      seven for you     he said to the guard lounging against the door .      well .     said the guard .     open it up and let   s be having them  then .         right     said vimes  flicking through the paperwork .     no problem .     he thrust the clipboard forward .     just sign here .      the man recoiled as though vimes had tried to offer him a snake .      what d   ya mean  sign .     he said .     hand    em over .         you sign     said vimes woodenly .     them   s the rules .  prisoners moved from one custody to another  you have to sign .  more   n my job   s worth  not to get signature .         your job   s not worth spit     snarled the man  grabbing the board .  he looked at it blankly and vimes handed him a pencil .      if you need any help with the difficult letters  let me know     he said innocently .   growling  the guard scrawled something on the paper and thrust it back .      now open up  pl ease     he said .      certainly     said vimes  glancing at the paper .     but now i   d like to see some form of id  thank you .         what .         it   s not me  you understand     said vimes     but if i went back and showed my captain this piece of paper and he said to me  vi   keel  how d   you know he   s henry the hamster  well  i   d be a bit   flummoxed .  maybe even perplexed .         listen  we don   t sign for prisoners .         we do  henry     said vimes .     no signature  no prisoners .         and you   ll stop us taking    em  will you .     said henry the hamster  taking a few steps forward .      you lay a hand on that door     said vimes     and i   ll           chop it off  will you .            i   ll arrest you     said vimes .     obstruction would be a good start  but we can probably think of some more charges back at the station .         arrest me .  but i   m a copper  same as you .         wrong again     said vimes .      what is the trouble   here .     said a voice .   a small  thin figure appeared in the torchlight .  henry the hamster took a step back and adopted a certain deferential pose .      officer won   t hand over the curfew breakers  sir     he said .      and this is the officer .     said the figure  lurching toward vimes with a curiously erratic gait .      yessir .      vimes found himself under cool and not openly hostile inspection from a pale man with the screwed up eyes of a pet rat .      ah     said the man  opening a little tin and taking a green throat pastille .     would you be keel  by any chance .  i have been   hearing about you .     the man   s voice was as uncertain as his walk .  pauses turned up in the wrong places .      you hear about things quickly  sir .         a salute is generally in order  sergeant .         i don   t see anything to salute  sir     said vimes .      goodpoint .  goodpoint .  you are new  of course .  but  you see  we in the particulars   often find it necessary to wearplain   clothes .      like rubber aprons  if i recall correctly  thought vimes .  aloud  he said     yes  sir .     it was a good phrase .  it could mean any of a dozen things  or nothing at all .  it was just punctuation until the man said something else .      i   m captain swing     said the man .     findthee swing .  if you think the name is amusing  pleasesmirk   and get it over with .  you may now salute .      vimes saluted .  swing   s mouth turned up at the corners very briefly .      good .  your first night on our hurry up wagon  sergeant .         sir .         and you   re here so early .  with a full load  too .  shall we take alook   at your passengers .     he glanced in between the ironwork .     ah .  yes .  good evening  miss palm .  and an associate  i see           i do crochet .            and what appear to be some partygoers .  well  well .  what little scamps your street officers are  to be sure .  they really have scoured the streets .  how they love their   littlejokes  sergeant .     swing put his hand on the wagon door   s handle and there was a little noise  which was  nevertheless  a thunderclap in the silence  and it was the sound of a sword moving very slightly in its scabbard .   swing stood stock still for a moment and then delicately popped the pastille into his mouth .     aha .  i think that perhaps this little catch can be   thrownback  don   t you  sergeant .  we don   t want to make a mockery of   thelaw .  take them away  take them away .         yes  sir .         but just onemoment  please  sergeant .  indulge me   just a little hobby of mine           sir .      swing had reached into a pocket of his over long coat and pulled out a very large pair of steel calipers .  vimes flinched as they were opened up to measure the width of his head  the width of his nose  and the length of his eyebrows .  then a metal ruler was pressed against one ear .   while doing this  swing was mumbling under his breath .  then he closed the calipers with a snap  and slipped them back .      i must congratulateyou  sergeant     he said     on overcoming your considerable natural disadvantages .  do you know you have the eye of a mass murderer .  i am neverwrong   in these matters .         nosir .  didn   t know that  sir .  will try to keep it closed  sir     said vimes .  swing didn   t crack a smile .      however  i   m sure that when you have settled in  you and corporal  aha  hamster here will get along like a   houseonfire .         a house on fire .  yes  sir .         don   t let   me detain you  sergeant keel .      vimes saluted .  swing nodded  turned in one movement  as though he was on a swivel  and strode back into the watch house .  or jerked  vimes considered .  the man moved in the same way he talked  in a curious mixture of speeds .  it was as if he was powered by springs  when he moved a hand  the first few inches of movement were a blur  and then it gently coasted until it was brought into conjunction with whatever was the intended target .  sentences came out in spurts and pauses .  there was no rhythm to the man .   vimes ignored the fuming corporal and climbed back onto the wagon .     turn us round  lance constable     he said .     g   night  henry .      sam waited until the wheels were rumbling over the cobbles before he turned  wide eyed  to vimes .      you were going to draw on him  weren   t you .     he said .     you were  sarge  weren   t you .         you just keep your eyes on the road  lance constable .         but that was captain swing  that was .  and when you told that man to prove he was henry the hamster  i thought i   d widd   choke .  you knew they weren   t going to sign  right  sarge .     cos if there   s a bit of paper saying they   ve got someone  then if anyone wants to find out           just drive  lance constable .     but the boy was right .  for some reason  the unmentionables both loved and feared paperwork .  they certainly generated a lot of it .  they wrote everything down .  they didn   t like appearing on other people   s paperwork  though .  that worried them .      i can   t believe we got away with it  sarge .      we probably haven   t  vimes thought .  but swing has enough to worry him at the moment .  he doesn   t care very much about a big stupid sergeant .   he turned and banged on the ironwork .      sorry for the inconvenience  ladies and gentlemen  but it appears the unmentionables are not doing business tonight .  looks like we   ll have to do the interrogation ourselves .  we   re not very experienced at this  so i hope we don   t get it wrong .  now  listen carefully .  are any of you serious conspirators bent on the overthrow of the government .     there was a stunned silence from within the wagon .      come on  come on     said vimes .     i haven   t got all night .  does anyone want to overthrow lord winder by force .         well   no .     said the voice of miss palm .      or by crochet .         i heard that .     said another female voice sharply .      no one .  shame     said vimes .     well  that   s good enough for me .  lance constable  is it good enough for you .         er  yes  sarge     said young sam nervously .      in that case  we   ll drop you all off on our way home  and my charming assistant lance constable vimes will take  oh  half a dollar off each of you for traveling expenses for which you will get a receipt .  thank you for traveling with us  and we hope you will consider the hurry up wagon in all your future curfew breaking arrangements .      vimes could hear shocked whispering behind him .  this was not how things were supposed to go these days .      sarge     said lance constable vimes .      yep .         have you really got the eye of a mass murderer .         in the pocket of my other suit  yes .         hah .     sam was quiet for a while  and when he spoke again he seemed to have something new on his mind .      er  sarge .         yes  lad .         what   s a tuppenny upright  sarge .         it   s a kind of jam doughnut  lad .  did your mum ever make    em .         yes  sarge .  sarge .         yes  lad .         i think it probably means something else as well  sarge     said sam  sniggering .     something a bit   rude           the whole of life is a learning process  lance constable .      they got the wagon back to the yard ten minutes later  and by that time vimes knew that a new rumor was fanning out across the city .  young sam had already whispered things to the other officers as the curfew breakers were dropped off  and nobody gossips like a copper .  they didn   t like the unmentionables .  like petty criminals everywhere  the watchmen prided themselves on there being some depths to which they would not sink .  there had to be some things below you  even if it was only mudworms .       rosie palm bolted the door of her flat  leaned on it  and stared at sandra .      what is he .     said sandra  dumping her workbox on the table .  it clanked within .     is he on our side .         you heard the lads .     snapped rosie .     no bribes now .  and then he drags us off to swing   s bastards and then he won   t hand us over .  i could kill him .  i rescued him from the gutter  got mossy to patch him up  and suddenly he   s playing big silly games .         yes  what is a tuppenny upright .     said sandra brightly .   miss palm paused .  she quite enjoyed sandra   s company  and the extra rent certainly came in handy  but there were times she wondered whether a  she should have a talk with the girl  or b  she was being very gently wound up .  she suspected the latter  since sandra was taking more money than her most of the time .  it was getting embarrassing .      it   s a kind of jam doughnut     she said .     now  you   d better go and hide the        someone knocked on the door behind her .  she motioned sandra through the bead curtain  took a moment to pull herself together  and opened the door a fraction .   there was a very small old man standing in the hall .  everything about him sloped hopelessly downward .  his gray mustache could have been stolen from a walrus  or a bloodhound that had just been given some very bad news .  his shoulders sagged hopelessly .  even parts of his face seemed to be losing the battle with gravity .   he held his cap in his hands and was twisting it nervously .      yes .     said rosie .      er  it said    seamstress    on the sign     the old man mumbled .     an     well  since my ol    woman died  you know  what with one thing an    another  never bin any good at doing it for meself        he gave rosie a look of sheer  hopeless embarrassment .   she glanced down at the sack by his feet  and picked it up .  it was full of very clean  but very worn  socks .   every single one had holes in the heel and toe .      sandra     she said     i think this one   s for you            it was so very early in the morning that    late at night    wasn   t quite over .  white mist hung everywhere in the streets and deposited droplets like tiny pearls on vimes   s shirt as he prepared to break the law .   if you stood on the roof of the privy behind the watch house and steadied yourself on the drainpipe  one of the upstairs windows would bounce open if you hit it with the palm of your hand in exactly the right place .   it was a useful bit of information  and vimes wondered if he should pass it on to young sam .  every honest copper ought to know how to break into his own nick .   tilden had limped home long ago  but vimes did a quick sweep of his office and it was with great satisfaction that he did not see what he hadn   t expected to be there .  down below  a few of the more conscientious officers were signing off before heading home .  he waited in the shadows until the door had banged shut for the last time and there were no footsteps for several minutes .  then he made his way down the stairs and into the locker room .   he had been issued a key to his own locker  but still oiled the hinge from a small bottle before he opened it .  he had not  in fact  put anything in there yet but  behold  there was a rumpled sack on the floor .  he lifted it up     well done  lads .   inside was captain tilden   s silver inkwell .   vimes stood up and looked around at the lockers  with their ancient carved initials and occasional knife marks on the doors .  he pulled from his pocket the little black cloth roll he   d taken from the evidence locker earlier .  a selection of lock picks glinted in the gray light .  vimes wasn   t a genius with the hooks and rakes  but the cheap and worn door locks were hardly a major challenge .   really  it was just a matter of choosing .   and afterward he walked back through the mists .   he was horrified to find he was feeling good again .  it was a betrayal of sybil and the future watch  and even of his grace sir samuel vimes  who had to think about the politics of distant countries and manpower requirements and how to raise that damn boat that river division kept sinking .  and  yes  he wanted to go back  or forward  or across  or whatever .  he really did .  he wanted to go home so much he could taste it .  of course  he did .  but he couldn   t  not yet  and here he was  and as dr .  lawn said  you did the job .  and currently the job involved survival on the street in the great game of silly buggers  and vimes knew all about that game  oh yes .  and there was a thrill in it .  it was the nature of the beast .   and thus he was walking along  lost in thought  when the men jumped him out of the mouth of a shadowy alley .   the first one got a foot in the stomach  because the beast does not fight fair .  vimes stepped aside and grabbed the other one .  he felt the knife skitter along his breastplate as he lowered his head and tugged the man hard into the helmet .   the man folded up quite neatly on the cobbles .   vimes spun around to the first man  who was bent almost double  and wheezing  but had nevertheless kept hold of his knife  which he waved around in front of him like some kind of talisman .  the point made erratic figure eights in the air .      drop it     said vimes .     i won   t ask again .      he sighed and pulled a short object out of his back pocket .  it was black and tapered and made of leather filled with lead shot .  he   d banned them in the modern watch but he knew some officers had acquired them  and if he judged the man to be sensible then he didn   t know they   d got them .  sometimes an argument had to be ended quickly  and there were worse alternatives .   he brought the blackjack down on the man   s arm with a certain amount of care .  there was a whimper and the knife bounced off the cobbles .      we   ll leave your chum to sleep it off     he said .     but you are coming to see the doctor  henry .  are you coming quietly .      a few minutes later dr .  lawn opened his back door and vimes brushed past  the body over his shoulders .      you minister to all sorts  right .     said vimes .      within reason  but           this one   s an unmentionable     said vimes .     tried to kill me .  needs some medicine .         why   s he unconscious .     said the doctor .  he was wearing a huge rubber apron  and rubber boots .      didn   t want to take his medicine .      lawn sighed  and with a hand that held a mop he waved vimes toward an inner door .     bring him right into the surgery     he said .     i   m afraid i   m cleaning up after mr .  salciferous in the waiting room .         why  what did he do .         he burst .      vimes  his natural inquisitiveness suddenly curbed  carried the body into lawn   s inner sanctum .  it looked little different from when vimes had last seen it  but then he   d barely been capable of taking in details .  there was the table  and a workbench  and all along one wall were racks of bottles .  no two bottles were the same size .  in one or two of them  things floated .   on another wall were the instruments .      when i die     said lawn  inspecting the patient     i   m going to instruct them to put a bell on my tombstone  just so   s i can have the pleasure of not getting up when people ring .  put him down  please .  looks like concussion .         that was me hitting him     said vimes helpfully .      you broke his arm  too .         that   s right .         you made a very neat job of it .  easy to set it and plaster him up .  is there something wrong .      vimes was still staring at the instruments .      you use all these .     he said .      yes .  some of them are experimental  though     said lawn  busying himself at his worktable .      well  i   d hate for you to use this on me     said vimes  picking a strange instrument like a couple of paddles tied with string .  lawn sighed .      sergeant  there are no circumstances where the things you   re holding could possibly be used on you     he said  his hands working busily .     they are   of a feminine nature .         for the seamstresses .     said vimes  putting the pliers down in a hurry .      those things .  no  the ladies of the night take pride these days in never requiring that sort of thing .  my work with them is more of  shall we say  a preventative nature .         teaching them to use thimbles  that sort of thing .         yes  it   s amazing how far you can push a metaphor  isn   t it        vimes prodded the paddles again .  they were quite alarming .      you   re married  sergeant .     said lawn .     was rosie right .         er   yes .  my wife is  er  elsewhere  though .     he picked the things up and dropped them hastily again  with a clatter .      well  it   s just as well to be aware that giving birth isn   t like shelling peas     said the doctor .      i should bloody well hope not .         although i have to say the midwives seldom refer anything to me .  they say men shouldn   t fish around where they don   t belong .  really  we may as well be living in caves .      lawn looked down at his patient .     in the words of the philosopher sceptum  the founder of my profession  am i going to get paid for this .      vimes investigated the moneybag on the man   s belt .      will six dollars do it .     he said .      why would the unmentionables attack you  sergeant .  you   re a policeman .         i am  but they aren   t .  don   t you know about them .         i   ve patched up a few of their guests  yes     said lawn  and vimes noted the caution .  it didn   t pay to know too much in this town .     people with curious dislocations  hot wax burns   that sort of thing           well  i had a little brush with captain swing last night     vimes said     and he was polite as hell to me about it  but i   d bet my boots he knows this lad and his friend came after me .  that   s his style .  he probably wanted to see what i   d do .         he   s not the only one interested in you     said lawn .     i got a message that rosie palm wants to see you .  well  i assume she meant you .     that ungrateful bastard    was the actual term she used .         i think i owe her some money     said vimes     but i   ve no idea how much .         don   t ask me     said lawn  smoothing the plaster with his hand .     she generally names her price up front .         i mean the finder   s fee  or whatever it was .         yes  i know .  can   t help you there  i   m afraid     said lawn .   vimes watched him working for a while  and said     know anything about miss battye .         the seamstress .  she hasn   t been here long .         and she   s really a seamstress .         for the sake of precision     said dr .  lawn     let us say she   s a needlewoman .  apparently she heard there was a lot of work for seamstresses in the big city and had one or two amusing misunderstandings before someone told her exactly what was meant .  one of them involved me removing a crochet hook from a man   s ear last week .  now she just hangs out with the rest of the girls .         why .         because she   s making a fortune  that   s why .  hasn   t it ever occurred to you  sergeant  that sometimes people go to a massage parlor for a real massage  for example .  there   s ladies all over this city with discreet signs up that say things like    trousers repaired while you wait     and a small but significant number of men make the same mistake as sandra .  there   s lot of men work here in the city and leave their wives back home and sometimes  you know  a man feels these   urges .  like  for a sock without holes and a shirt with more than one button .  the ladies pass on the work .  apparently it   s quite hard to find a really good needlewoman in this city .  they don   t like being confused with  er  seamstresses .         i just wondered why she hangs around street corners after curfew with a big sewing basket        lawn shrugged .     can   t help you there .  right  i   ve finished with this gentleman .  it   d be helpful if he lies still for a while .     he indicated the racks of bottles behind him .     about how long will you want him to lie still for .         you can do that .         oh  yes .  it   s not accepted ankh morpork medical practice  but since ankh morpork medical practice would consist of hitting him on the head with a mallet he   s probably getting the best of the deal .         no  i meant that you doctors aren   t supposed to hurt people  are you .         only in the course of normal incompetence .  but i don   t mind sending him to sleepy land for another twenty minutes .  of course  if you want to wham him with the mallet i can   t stop you .  the last guest of swing i treated had several fingers pointing entirely the wrong way .  so if you   d like to give him a few wallops for good luck i could point out some quite sensitive areas           no thanks .  i   ll just haul him out the back way and drop him in an alley .         is that all .         no .  then   i   ll sign my name on his damn plaster cast .  so he sees it when he wakes up .  in bloody big letters  so it won   t rub off .         now that   s what i call a sensitive area     said lawn .     you   re an interesting man  sergeant .  you make enemies like a craftsman .         i   ve never been interested in needlework     said vimes  hoisting the man on his shoulder .     but what sort of things would a needlewoman have in her workbasket  do you think .         oh  i don   t know .  needles  thread  scissors  wool   that kind of thing     said mossy lawn .      not very heavy things  then .     said vimes .      not really .  why   d you ask .         oh  no reason     said vimes  making a small mental note .     just a thought .  i   ll go and drop off our friend here while i   ve still got some mist to lurk in .         fine .  i   ll have breakfast on when you get back .  it   s liver .  calf   s .          the beast remembers .  this time  vimes slept soundly .   he had always found it easier to sleep during the day .  twenty five years on nights had ground their nocturnal groove in his brain .  darkness was easier  somehow .  he knew how to stand still  a talent that few possess  and how to merge into the shadows .  how to guard  in fact  and see without being seen .   he remembered findthee swing .  a lot of it was history .  the revolt would have happened with swing or without him  but he was  as it were  the tip of the boil .   he   d been trained at the assassins    school and should never have been allowed to join the watch .  he had too much brain to be a copper .  at least  too much of the wrong kind of brain .  but swing had impressed winder with his theories  had been let in as a sergeant and then was promoted to captain immediately .  vimes had never known why  it was probably because the officers were offended at seeing such a fine genn   lman pounding the streets with the rest of the oiks .  besides  he had a weak chest or something .   vimes wasn   t against intellect .  anybody with enough savvy to let go of a doorknob could be a street monster in the old days  but to make it above sergeant you needed a grab bag of guile  cunning  and street wisdom that could pass for    intelligence    in a poor light .   swing  though  started in the wrong place .  he didn   t look around  and watch  and learn  and then say     this is how people are  how do we deal with it .     no  he sat and thought     this is how people ought to be  how do we change them .     and that was a good enough thought for a priest but not for a copper  because swing   s patient  pedantic way of operating had turned policing on its head .   there had been that weapons law  for a start .  weapons were involved in so many crimes that  swing reasoned  reducing the number of weapons had to reduce the crime rate .   vimes wondered if he   d sat up in bed in the middle of the night and hugged himself when he   d dreamed that one up .  confiscate all weapons  and crime would go down .  it made sense .  it would have worked  too  if only there had been enough coppers   say  three per citizen .   amazingly  quite a few weapons were handed in .  the flaw  though  was one that had somehow managed to escape swing  and it was this  criminals don   t obey the law .  it   s more or less a requirement for the job .  they had no particular interest in making the streets safer for anyone except themselves .  and they couldn   t believe what was happening .  it was like hogswatch every day .   some citizens took the not unreasonable view that something had gone a bit askew if only naughty people were carrying arms .  and they got arrested in large numbers .  the average copper  when he   s been kicked in the nadgers once too often and has reason to believe that his bosses don   t much care  has an understandable tendency to prefer to arrest those people who won   t instantly try to stab him  especially if they act a bit snotty and wear more expensive clothes than he personally can afford .  the rate of arrests shot right up  and swing had been very pleased about that .   admittedly  most of the arrests had been for possessing weaponry after dark  but quite a few had been for assaults on the watch by irate citizens .  that was assault on a city official  a very important and despicable crime  and  as such  far more important than all these thefts that were going on everywhere .   it wasn   t that the city was lawless .  it had plenty of laws .  it just didn   t offer many opportunities not to break them .  swing didn   t seem to have grasped the idea that the system was supposed to take criminals and  in some rough and ready fashion  force them into becoming honest men .  instead  he   d taken honest men and turned them into criminals .  and the watch  by and large  into just another gang .   and then  just when the whole wretched stew was thickening  he   d invented craniometrics .   bad coppers had always had their ways of finding out if someone was guilty .  back in the old days   hah  now   they included thumbscrews  hammers  small pointed bits of wood  and  of course  the common desk drawer  always a boon to the copper in a hurry .  swing didn   t need any of this .  he could tell if you were guilty by looking at your eyebrows .   he measured people .  he used calipers and a steel ruler .  and he quietly wrote down the measurements  and did some sums  such as dividing the length of the nose by the circumference of the head and multiplying it by the width of the space between the eyes .  and from such figures he could  infallibly  tell that you were devious  untrustworthy  and congenitally criminal .  after you spent the next twenty minutes in the company of his staff and their less sophisticated tools of inquiry  he would  amazingly  be proven right .   everyone was guilty of something .  vimes knew that .  every copper knew it .  that was how you maintained your authority   everyone  talking to a copper  was secretly afraid you could see their guilty secret written on their forehead .  you couldn   t  of course .  but neither were you supposed to drag someone off the street and smash their fingers with a hammer until they told you what it was .   swing would probably have ended up face down in some alley somewhere if it wasn   t for the fact that winder had found in him a useful tool .  no one could sniff out conspiracies like swing .  and so he   d ended up running the unmentionables  most of whom made sergeant knock look like good copper of the month .  vimes had always wondered how the man had kept control  but maybe it was because the thugs recognized  in some animal way  a mind that had arrived at thuggery by the long route and was capable of devising in the name of reason the kind of atrocities that unreason could only dream of .   it wasn   t easy  living in the past .  you couldn   t whack someone for what they were going to do  or for what the world was going to find out later .  you couldn   t warn people  either .  you didn   t know what could change the future  but if he understood things right  history tended to spring back into shape .  all you could change was the bits around the edges  the fine details .  there was nothing he could do about the big stuff .  the lilac was going to bloom .  the revolution was going to happen .   well   a kind of revolution .  that wasn   t really a word for what it was .  there was the people   s republic of treacle mine road  truth .  justice .  freedom .  reasonably priced love .  and a hard boiled egg .    which would live for all of a few hours  a strange candle that burned too briefly and died like a firework .  and there was the scouring of the house of pain  and the     anyway   you did the job that was in front of you  like unimaginative coppers always did .   he got up around one in the afternoon .  lawn was closeted in his surgery  doing something that involved some serious whimpering on the part of something else .  vimes knocked on the door .   after a moment it was opened a fraction .  doctor lawn was wearing a face mask and holding a pair of very long tweezers in his hand .      yes .         i   m going out     said vimes .     trouble .         not too bad .  slidey harris was unlucky at cards last night  that   s all .  played the ace of hearts .         that   s an unlucky card .         it is if big tony knows he didn   t deal it to you .  but i   ll soon have it removed .  if you   re going to injure anyone tonight  can you do it before i go to bed .  thank you .     lawn shut the door .   vimes nodded at the woodwork  and went out to stretch his legs and get some lunch .  it was waiting for him  on a tray  around the neck of a man .  quite a young man  now  but there was something about the expression  as of a rat who was expecting cheese right around the next corner  and had been expecting cheese around the last corner  too  and the corner before that  and  although the world had turned out so far to be full of corners yet completely innocent of any cheese at all  was nevertheless quite certain that  just around the corner  cheese awaited .   vimes stared .  but why should he be surprised .  as long ago as he could remember  there was always someone selling highly suspicious chemically reclaimed pork products in this town .  the seller was very familiar .  just   younger .   his expression lit up at the sight of an unfamiliar face .  the seller liked to meet people who hadn   t yet bought one of his pies .      ah  sergeant   hey  what   s the little crown mean .         sergeant at arms     said vimes .     that   s like    sergeant with all the trimmings .            well  sergeant  could i interest you in a very special sausage inna bun .  guaranteed no rat .  one hundred percent organic .  all pork shaved before mixing .      why not  thought vimes .  and his stomach  liver  kidneys  and lengths of intestine all supplied reasons  but he fumbled in his pocket for some change anyway .      how much  mr .    er     vimes remembered in time  and made a show of looking at the name on the front of the tray        dibbler .         four pence  sergeant .         and that   s cutting your own throat  eh .     said vimes jovially .      pardon .     said dibbler  looking puzzled .      i said  a price like that   s cutting your own throat  eh .         cutting my own    .         throat     said vimes desperately .      oh .     dibbler thought about this .     right .  yeah .  it is .  you never said a truer word .  so you   ll have one  then .         i notice it says on your tray     dibbler enterprises  est        said vimes .     shouldn   t it say when you were established .         should it .     dibble looked down at his tray .      how long have you been going .     said vimes  selecting a pie .      let   s see   what year is this .         er   dancing dog  i think .         since tuesday  then     said dibbler .  his face brightened .     but this is only the start  mister .  this is just to get a stake together .  in a year or two i   m going to be a big man in this town .         i believe you     said vimes .     i really do .      dibbler looked down at his tray again as vimes strolled off .     cutting my own throat  cutting my own throat     he mumbled to himself  and seemed to like the sound of it .  but then he focused more clearly on the tray and his face went pale .      sergeant .     he shouted .     don   t eat the pie .      vimes  a few yards away  stopped with the pie halfway to his mouth .      what   s wrong with it .     he said .     silly me .  i mean  what   s uniquely wrong with it .         nothing .  i mean   these are better .      vimes risked another look at the tray .  they all looked the same to him .  dibbler   s pies quite often looked appetizing .  therein lay their one and only charm .      i can   t see any difference     he said .      yeah  yeah  there is     said dibbler  sweat beading on his forehead .     see .  the one you got has that little pattern of pastry pigs on it .  and all the others have pastry sausages .  i   d hate for you to think that  you know  i thought you were a pig or anything  so if you   ll hand it over i   ll happily give you  er  another one  that one   s not the right one  er  not that it   s a wrong one  but  er  with the pig and everything        vimes looked into the man   s eyes .  dibbler had yet to learn that friendly blankness that thirty years of selling truly organic pies would call into being .   while the man stared in horror  he took a large bite out of the pie .   it was everything that he had expected and nothing that he could identify .      yum     he said  and  with some concentration  eyes fixed on the luckless pieman  finished it all .      i think it   s quite possible no one else makes pies like you do  mr .  dibbler     he said  licking his fingers in case he might want to shake hands with someone later on .      you ate it all .     said dibbler .      was that wrong .     said vimes .   and now relief rose off the man like smoke off a greenwood fire .      what .  no .  that   s fine .  jolly good .  want another one to help it down .  half price .         no  no  one is more than enough     said vimes  backing away .      you finished every bit .     said dibbler .      that was right  wasn   t it .     said vimes .      oh  yeah .  sure .  obviously .         got to be going     said vimes  moving on down the lane .     i   ll look forward to seeing you again when i   ve got less appetite .      he waited until he was well out of sight before taking a few random turns in the network of alleys .  then he stepped into the shadow of a deep doorway and felt in his mouth for the piece of pie that had seemed curiously unchewable even by pie standards .   usually  if you found something more than usually hard or crunchy in one of dibbler   s famous pork pies  the trick was either to swallow it and hope for the best or spit it out with your eyes closed .  but vimes felt around between gum and cheek and fished out a folded piece of paper  stained with unknowable juices .   he unfolded it .  in smudged pencil  but still readable  it read  morphic street    o   clock tonight .  password  swordfish .   swordfish .  every password was    swordfish    .  whenever anyone tried to think of a word that no one would ever guess  they always chose    swordfish .     it was just one of those strange quirks of the human mind .   that explained the guilt  anyway .  a plot .  another damn plot  in a city full of plots .  did he need to know about plots .  anyway  he knew about this one .  morphic street .  the famous morphic street conspiracy .  ha .   he pushed the greasy scrap into a pocket and then hesitated .   someone was being quiet .  overlaid on the distant street noises was a sort of hollow in the sounds  filled by careful breathing .  and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up .   quietly  he pulled the blackjack out of his rear pocket .   now  what were the options .  he was a copper  and someone was creeping up on him .  if they weren   t a copper  then they were in the wrong  because he was a copper  .  if they were a copper  too  then they were one of swing   s crew and therefore in the wrong  because he was a better copper than them  and so were things floating in gutters   and therefore delivering a swift bucketful of darkness had no obvious downside .   on the other hand  thieves  assassins  and swing   s men  by all accounts  did a lot of creeping up on people and were probably pretty good at it  whereas the person tracking him was keeping their back so close to the wall he could hear the scraping .  that meant they were probably just a member of the public with something on their mind  and he was not inclined to add several ounces of lead shot simply for that reason  because he   d like to believe he wasn   t that sort of copper  .   he settled for stepping out into the alley and saying    yeah .      a boy stared up at him .  it had to be a boy .  nature would not have been so cruel as to do that to a girl .  no single feature in itself was worse than passably ugly  but the combination was greater than the sum of the parts .  there was also the smell .  it wasn   t bad  as such .  it just wasn   t entirely human .  there was something feral about it .      er       said the pinched up face     look  tell you what  mister  you tell me where you   re going and i   ll stop following you  have we got a deal .  cost you no more   n a penny and that   s a special price .  some people pay me a lot more   n that to stop following    em .      vimes continued to stare .  the creature was wearing an oversized evening dress jacket  shiny with grease and greenish with age  and a top hat that must once have been trodden on by a horse .  but the bits that were visible between the two were regrettably familiar .      oh  no       he moaned .     no  no  no           you all right  mister .         no  no  no   oh  ye gods  it had to happen  didn   t it           you want i should go   n fetch mossy  mister .      vimes lowered the creature and pointed an accusing finger .      you   re nobby nobbs  right .      the urchin backed away .      might be .  so what .  is that a crime .     he turned to run but vimes   s hand fell heavily on his shoulder .      some people might say so .  you   re nobby nobbs  son of maise nobbs and sconner nobbs .         prob   ly  prob   ly .  but i ain   t done nothin     mister .      vimes bent down to look into eyes that peered out at the world through a mask of grime .      how about whizzing wipers  snitching tinklers  pulling wobblers  flogging tumblers  and running rumbles .      nobby   s brow creased in genuine puzzlement .      what   s    pulling wobblers    mean .     he said .   vimes gave him a similar look .  street parly had changed a lot in thirty years .      that   s stealing trifles   small items .  isn   t it .         nah  nah  mister .  that   s    tottering nevils        said nobby  relaxing .     but you ain   t doin    badly  for someone who   s new .  what   s    oil of angels    .      memory flicked a card .      a bribe     said vimes .      and a dimber .     said nobby  grinning .      easy .  could be a head beggar  could be just a handsome man .         well done .  bet you don   t know how to fleague a jade  though .      once again  from a dusty recess  a memory unrolled .  this one stuck in your mind .      dear me  do you know that .  what a shame in one so young     said vimes .     that   s when you want to sell a broken down horse and have to make it a bit frisky in front of the punters  and so you take some fresh  raw  hot ginger  lift up its tail  and push the ginger           cor     said nobby  suddenly impressed .     everyone says you   re a real quick learner  and that   s true enough .  you could   ve been born here .         why   re you following me  nobby nobbs .     said vimes .   the urchin held out a grubby hand .  some street language never changes .   vimes pulled out sixpence .  it shone in nobby   s palm like a diamond in a chimney sweep   s ear .      one of    em   s a lady     he said and grinned .  the hand stayed out .      that was a bloody sixpence i just gave you  kid     vimes growled .      yeah  but i got to think of        vimes grabbed the lapels of nobby   s greasy coat and lifted him up  and was mildly shocked to realize that there was practically no weight there .   street urchin  he thought .  urchin sounds about right   spiky  slimy  and smell slightly of rotting seaweed .  but there   s hundreds of them round here  clawing a living off the very margins  and  as i recall  nobby was one of the sharpest .  and as trustworthy as a chocolate hammer .  but that   s okay .  there   s ways to deal with that .      how much     he said     for you to work for me  all the time .         i got customers to think of       nobby began .      yeah  but i   m the one holding you up in one hand  right .     said vimes .   with his oversized boots dangling a foot above the ground  nobby considered his position .      all the time .         right .         er   for something like that i   ve got to be looking at a lordship every day           a dollar .  guess again .         er   half a dollar .         not a chance .  a dollar a week  and i won   t make your life utter misery  which  nobby  i assure you i can do in so many little ways .      still dangling  nobby tried to work all this out .      so   i   ll be kind of like a copper  right .     he said  grinning artfully .      kind of .         number one suspect says it   s a good life being a copper     cos you can pinch stuff without getting nicked .         he   s got that right     said vimes .      an    he says if anyone gives you lip  you can bop    em one and chuck them in the tanty     nobby went on .     i   d like to be a copper one day .         who   s number one suspect .         that   s what our mam calls sconner  our dad .  er   payment up front  yeah .     nobby added  hopefully .      what do you think .         ah .  right .  no  eh .         correct .  but i   ll tell you what       he lowered nobby to the ground .  light as a feather  he thought .     you come with me  kid .      ankh morpork was full of men living in lodgings .  anyone with a spare room rented it out .  and  in addition to the darning and stitching that was turning miss battye into one of the highest earning seamstresses in the city  they needed something else that women were best able to supply .  they needed feeding .   there were plenty of hot chair eating places like the one vimes headed for now .  it sold plain food for plain men .  there wasn   t a menu .  you ate what was put in front of you  you ate it quick  and you were glad to get it .  if you didn   t like it  there were plenty who did .  the dishes had names like slumgullet  boiled eels  lob scouse  wet nellies  slumpie  and treacle billy   good  solid stuff that stuck to the ribs and made it hard to get up out of the seat .  they generally had a lot of turnip in there too  even if they weren   t supposed to .   vimes elbowed his way to the counter  dragging nobby behind him .  a chalked sign said all you can eat in ten minutes for   p .   beneath it  a large woman was standing bare armed by a cauldron in which uncertain things bubbled in gray scum .  she gave him an appraising look and then glanced at his sleeve .      what can i do for you  sergeant .     she said .     what happened to sergeant knock .         comes in here a lot  does he .     said vimes .      dinner and supper .     her look said it all  second helpings  too  and never pays .   vimes held up nobby .      see this .     he said .      is it a monkey .     said the woman .      har har  very funny     moaned nobby as vimes lowered him again .      he   s going to come in here for one square meal every day     said vimes .     all he can eat for ten pence .         yes .  and who   s paying  may i ask .         me .     vimes plonked a half dollar on the table .     that   s five days in advance .  what   s the special today .  slumgullet .  it   ll put hairs on his chest  when he gets a chest .  give him a big bowl .  you might make a loss on this deal .      he shoved nobby onto a bench  placed the greasy bowl in front of him  and sat down opposite .      you said a lady     he said .     don   t mess me about  nobby .         have i got to share this  sarge .     said nobby  picking up a wooden spoon .      it   s all yours .  make sure you eat up every bit .  there may be a test later     said vimes .     a woman  you said .         lady meserole  sarge     said nobby indistinctly  through a mouthful of mixed vegetables and grease .     posh lady .  everyone calls her madam .  come from genua a few months ago .         when did she ask you .         this morning  sarge .         what .  she just stopped you in the street .         er   i   ve got a kind of gen   ral contract with her  sarge .      vimes glared .  it was better than speaking .  nobby wriggled uneasily .      fact is  sarge  she   er  caught me snickering her nolly last month .  hell   s bells  sarge  she   s got a punch on her like a mule .  when i come round  we got to talking  and she said a keen young lad like me could be useful as  like  an ear on the street .      vimes continued to glare  but he was impressed .  young nobby had been a gifted pickpocket .  anyone who caught him in the act was quick indeed .  he turned up the ferocity of the glare .      all right  sarge  she said she   d turn me over to the day watch if i didn   t     nobby confessed     and you go straight to the tanty if a nob lays a complaint against you .      that   s bloody true  thought vimes .  private law again .      i don   t want to go to the tanty  sarge .  sconner   s in there .      and he used to break your arms  vimes remembered .      so why   s a fine lady interested in me  nobby .     he said aloud .      didn   t ask .  i told    er about you an    the hurry up wagon and the unmentionables and everything .  she said you sounded fascinatin    .  an    rosie palm   s paying me a measly penny a day to keep an eye on you  too .  oh  an    corporal snubbs at cable street  he   s payin    me one half penny to watch you  but what is a half penny these days  say i  so i don   t watch you much on his account .  oh  and lance corporal coates  i   m getting a penny from him  too .         why .         dunno .  he asked me this morning  too .  a penny job .     nobby belched hugely .     better out than in  eh .  who   d you want me to watch for you  sarge .         me     said vimes .     if you can fit me into your busy schedule .         you want me to follow you .         no  just tell me what people are saying about me .  keep an eye on who else is following me .  watch my back  sort of thing .         right .         good .  just one more thing  nobby           yes  sarge .     said nobby  still spooning .      give me back my notebook  my handkerchief  and the four pennies you whizzed from my pockets  will you .      nobby opened his mouth to protest  dribbling slumgullet  but closed it when he saw the glint in vimes   s eye .  silently  he produced the items from various horrible pockets .      well done     said vimes  getting up .     i   m sure i don   t have to tell you what   ll happen to you if you try the old dippitydoodah on me again  do i  nobby .         no  sarge     said nobby  looking down .      want another bowl .  have fun .  i   ve got to go to work .         you can rely on me  sarge .      oddly enough  thought vimes as he walked back to the watch house  i probably can .  nobby would nick anything and dodge anything  but he wasn   t bad .  you could trust him with your life  although you   d be daft to trust him with a dollar .   he purchased a packet of pantweed   s slim panatellas from another street trader .  carrying them around in their cardboard packet didn   t feel right at all .   there was a buzz in the main office as he strolled in .  watchmen were standing around in little groups .  sergeant knock spotted vimes and trotted over .      bit of a do  sir .  had a break in last night     he reported with just a hint of smirk .      really .     said vimes .     what did they steal .         did i say they stole anything  sir .     said the sergeant innocently .      well  no  you didn   t     said vimes .     that was me jumping to what we call a conclusion .  did they steal anything  then  or did they break in to deliver a box of chocolates and a small complimentary basket of fruit .         they stole the captain   s silver inkstand     said knock  impervious to sarcasm .     and it was an inside job  if you want my opinion .  the door upstairs was forced but the main doors weren   t .  must   ve been a copper what done it .      vimes was amazed at the forensic expertise shown here .      my word  a copper stealing .     said vimes .      yes  a terrible thing     said knock earnestly .     especially since you showed us the way yesterday  about being honest and everything .     he glanced past vimes and shouted     attention .  officer present .      tilden was coming down the stairs .  the room fell silent  except for his hesitant steps .      no luck  sergeant .     he said .      not so far  sir     said knock .     i was just telling sergeant keel here what a terrible thing has happened .         it was engraved  you know     said tilden mournfully .     everyone in the regiment chipped in what they could afford .  this really is very   upsetting .         a man   d have to be a right bastard to steal something like that  eh  sergeant .     said knock .      absolutely     said vimes .     i see you   re pretty well organized on this one  sergeant .  have you looked everywhere .         everywhere except the lockers     said knock .     that   s not something we   d do lightly  rummaging through a man   s locker .  but we   re all here now  and captain tilden   s here to see fair play  so  although it   s very distasteful  i   ll ask you  captain  for permission to rummage .         yes  yes  if you must     said tilden .     i don   t like the idea .  it is really quite dishonorable  you know .         then i think  sir  to show that we   re doing this fairly     said knock     us sergeants ought to be searched first .  that way no one can say we don   t take it seriously .         come now  sergeant     said tilden with a little smile .     i hardly think you are suspected .         no  sir  fair   s fair     said knock .     we   ll set a good example  eh  sergeant keel .      vimes shrugged .  knock grinned at him  pulled out a bundle of keys  and beckoned to lance corporal coates .      you do the honors  ned     he said  beaming .     me first  o   course .      the door was unlocked .  the contents of knock   s locker were the usual unsavory mess of lockers everywhere  but there certainly was no silver inkstand .  if there was  it would have turned black after a single day .      well done .  now sergeant keel   s  please  ned .      knock   s friendly beam fixed on vimes  and the policeman fumbled with the lock .  vimes stared back  face blank as a slate  as the door creaked open .      oh dear  what have we here .     said knock without even bothering to look .      it   s a sack  sarge     said coates .     something heavy in it  too .         oh dear me     said knock  still staring at vimes .     open it up  lad .  gently .  we don   t want anything to get damaged  eh .      there was a rustle of hessian  and then      er   it   s half a brick     ned reported .      what .         a half brick  sir .         i   m saving up for a house     said vimes .  there were one or two sniggers from the assembled men  but some of the faster thinkers were suddenly looking worried .   they know  thought vimes .  well  lads  welcome to vimes   s roulette .  you spun the wheel and now you   ve got to guess where the ball is going to go        are you sure .     said knock  turning to the open locker .      it   s just a sack  sarge     said ned .     and half a brick .         is there a loose panel or something .     said knock desperately .      what  in a sack  sarge .         well  that seems to be our lockers     said vimes  rubbing his hands together .     who   s next  sergeant knock .     round and round the little ball goes  and where it stops  nobody knows        y   know  person   ly  i think the captain   s right  i don   t think any of the men would       knock began  and faltered .  vimes   s stare could have hammered rivets .      i believe  sergeant  that since we have begun this  it should be concluded     said tilden .     that is only fair .      vimes took a couple of steps toward coates and held out his hand .      keys     he said .   coates glared at him .      the keys  lance corporal     said vimes .   he snatched them from coates   s hand and turned to the line of lockers .      right     he said .     let   s start with the well known archcriminal  lance constable vimes        door after door was opened .  the lockers  while possibly of interest to anyone studying the smells of unwashed clothing and the things that could grow on neglected socks  failed to produce a single silver inkstand .   it did turn up the amorous adventurs of molly clapper in corporal colon   s locker  however .  vimes stared at the crude and grubby engravings like at a long lost friend .  he remembered that book  it had gone around the watch house for years  and  as a young man  he had learned a lot from some of the illustrations  although a good deal of what he   d learned had turned out to be wrong .   fortunately  captain tilden   s view was blocked  and vimes shoved the greasy book back on the shelf and said to the red eared colon     studying theory  eh  fred .  good man .  but practice makes perfect .      then he turned  at last  to coates   s locker .  the man was watching him like a hawk .   the scratched door creaked open .  every neck craned to see .  there was a stack of old notebooks  some civilian clothing  and a small sack of what  when it was tipped out onto the floor  turned out to be laundry .      surprised .     said the lance corporal .   not half as much as you  vimes thought .   he winked at coates  and turned away .      can i have a word with you in your office  captain .     he said .      yes  sergeant  i suppose so     said tilden  looking around .     oh  dear        vimes gave the man some time to climb the stairs  then followed him into his office and tactfully closed the door .      well  sergeant .     said tilden  collapsing into his chair .      have you looked everywhere  sir .     said vimes .      of course  man .         i mean  sir  perhaps you put it in a desk drawer .  or the safe  perhaps .         certainly not .  i sometimes put it in the safe on weekends  but i   m   sure i didn   t do that last night .      vimes noted the note of uncertainty .  he was doing a bad thing  he knew .  tilden was nearly seventy .  at a time like that  a man learned to treat his memory as only a rough guide to events .      i find  sir  that when a busy man has a lot on his plate  he can do things that subsequently slip his mind     he said .  i know i do  he added to himself .  i could put my house keys down in a bare room and not find them thirty seconds later .      we   ve all been under a lot of pressure lately     he added  knowing that tilden frequently fell asleep during the afternoon until snouty coughed very loudly outside the door before taking him his cocoa .      well  that   s true     said tilden  turning desperate eyes to him .     all this curfew business .  very   unsettling .  forget my own head if it wasn   t nailed on  what .      he turned and looked at the green safe .      only had it a couple of months     he muttered .     i suppose i   look the other way  will you  sergeant .  may as well sort this out        vimes obligingly turned his back .  there was some clicking  and a creak  and then an intake of breath .   tilden got to his feet  holding the silver inkstand .      i believe i   ve made a fool of myself  sergeant     he said .   no  i   ve made a fool of you  thought vimes  fervently wishing he hadn   t .  i   d intended to drop it in coates   s locker  but i couldn   t        not after what i found in there .      tell you what  sir     he volunteered     we could say it was a kind of test .         i don   t tell lies as a rule  keel .     said the captain  but added     i appreciate the suggestion  nevertheless .  anyway  i know i   m not as young as i was .  perhaps it   s time to retire .     he sighed .     i have to say  i   ve been considering it for some time .         oh  don   t talk like that  sir     said vimes far more jovially than he felt .     i can   t see you retiring .         yes  i suppose i should see things through     tilden mumbled  walking back to his desk .     do you know  sergeant  that some of the men think you are a spy .         who for .     said vimes  reflecting that snouty delivered more than cocoa .      lord winder  i assume     said tilden .      well  we all work for him  sir .  but i don   t report to anyone but you  if that   s any help .      tilden looked up at him and shook his head sadly .     spy or not  keel  i don   t mind telling you that some of the orders we   ve been getting lately have   not been thought out properly  in my opinion  what .      he gave vimes a glare as if defying him to produce the red hot thumbscrews there and then .   vimes could see how much the admission that abduction and torture and conspiracy to criminalize honest citizens might not be acceptable government policy was costing the old man .  tilden hadn   t been brought up to think like that .  he   d ridden off under the flag of ankh morpork to fight the cheese eaters of quirm  or johnny klatchian  or whatever enemies had been selected by those higher up the chain of command with never a second thought about the rightness of the cause  because that sort of thinking could slow a soldier down .   tilden had grown up knowing that the people at the top were right .  that was why they were at the top .  he didn   t have the mental vocabulary to think like a traitor  because only traitors thought like that .      haven   t been here long enough to comment  sir     said vimes .     don   t know how you do things here .         not like we used to     mumbled tilden .      just as you say  sir .         snouty says you know your way around remarkably well  sergeant .  for someone new to the city .      that was a comment with a hook on the end  but tilden was an inexperienced angler .      one nick is pretty much like any other  sir     said vimes .     and  of course  i   ve visited the city before .         of course .  of course .  well   thank you  sergeant .  if you could  er  explain things to the men .  i   d be grateful           yes  sir .  of course .      vimes shut the door carefully behind him and went down the steps two at a time .   the squad below had barely moved .  he clapped his hands like a schoolteacher .      c   mon  c   mon  you   ve got patrols to go to .  get moving .  not you  sergeant knock   a word in the yard  please .      vimes didn   t bother to wait to see if the man would follow him .  he went out into the late afternoon sunshine  leaned against the wall  and waited .   ten years ago  he   d have   correction  ten years ago  if he was sober  he   d have taught knock a few lessons about who   s boss with a few well aimed punches .  and that was certainly the custom these days .  scraps between watchmen hadn   t been uncommon when vimes was a constable .  but that wouldn   t do for sergeant keel .   knock stepped out  inflated with mad  terrified bravado .   when vimes raised his hand  the man actually flinched .      cigar .     said vimes .      er           i don   t drink     said vimes .     but you can   t beat a good cigar .         i   er   don   t smoke     mumbled knock .     look  about that inkstand           d   you know  he   d gone and put it in that safe of his .     said vimes  smiling .      he had .         and then forgot about it     said vimes .     happens to us all  winsborough .  a man   s mind starts to wander  he   s never quite certain of what he   s done .      vimes maintained the friendly grin .  it was as good as raining blows .  besides  he   d called knock by his correct name .  the man never used it in public  for fear of the panic it might cause .      just thought i   d put your mind at rest about it     said vimes .   sergeant winsborough knock shifted uneasily from one foot to the other .  he wasn   t certain whether he   d got away with something  or had just ended up getting deeper into something else .      tell me more about coates     said vimes .   knock   s face was for a moment an agony of calculation .  and then he adopted his usual policy  when you think there   s wolves on your trail  throw someone off the sleigh .      ned  sir .     he said .     hard worker  of course  does his job   but a bit tricky  between you and me .         how .  and you don   t have to call me sir  winsborough .  not out here .         he reckons jack   s as good as his master  if you know what i mean .  reckons he   s as good as anyone .  bit of a troublemaker in that respect .         barrack room lawyer .         that sort of thing  yes .         rebel sympathies .      knock turned his eyes up innocently .     could be  sir .  wouldn   t like to see the lad in trouble  o   course .      you think i   m a spy for the unmentionables  thought vimes .  and you   re throwing coates to me .  the other day you were pushing him for promotion .  you little worm .      worth keeping an eye on  then .     he said aloud .      yessir .         interesting     said vimes  always a worrying word to the uncertain .  it certainly worried knock  and vimes thought  my gods  perhaps vetinari feels like this all the time        some of us  er  go round to the broken drum after the shift   s over     said knock .     it   s open round the clock .  i don   t know if you           i don   t drink     said vimes .      oh .  yes .  you said     said knock .      and now i   d better pick up young sam and get out on patrol     said vimes .     nice to have this little talk with you  winsborough .      he strode past  taking care not to look back .  sam was still waiting in the main office but was sucked into his wake as he swept past .          i say  who   s the skirt up there with old folly .      the prefects looked up .  on the raised platform at the end of the noisy dining hall  doctor follett  master of assassins and ex officio headmaster of the assassins    guild school  was in animated conversation with  indeed  a lady .  the vivid purple of her dress made a splash of color in the vast room where black predominated  and the elegant whiteness of his hair shone like a beacon in the darkness .   it was a guild of assassins  after all .  black was what you wore .  the night was black and so were you .  and black had such style  and an assassin without style  everyone agreed  was just a highly paid arrogant thug .   the prefects were all over eighteen  and  therefore  allowed to visit parts of the city that the younger boys weren   t even supposed to know about .  their pimples no longer erupted at the sight of a woman .  now  their eyes narrowed .  most of them had already learned that the world was an oyster that could be opened with gold if a blade did not suffice .      probably a parent     said one of them .      i wonder who   s the lucky boy .         i know who she is     said    ludo    ludorum  head of viper house .     i heard some of the masters talking earlier .  she   s madam roberta meserole .  bought the old house in easy street .  they say she made a pile of money in genua and wants to settle down here .  looking for investment opportunities  apparently .         madam .     said downey .     an honorific or a job description .         in genua .  could be both     said someone  to general laughter .      folly   s certainly plying her with champagne     said downey .     they   re on their third bottle .  what have they got to talk about .         politics     said ludo .     everyone knows winder isn   t going to do the decent thing  so it   ll be down to us .  and folly   s annoyed because we   ve lost three chaps up there already .  winder   s pretty cunning .  there   s guards and soldiers everywhere you look .         winder   s a scag     said downey .      yes  downey .  you call everyone a scag     said ludo calmly .      well  everyone is .      downey turned back to the table  and a movement   or  rather  a lack of movement   caught his eye .  toward the far end of the table one young assassin was sitting reading  with a book stand positioned in front of his plate .  he was intent on it  an empty fork halfway to his mouth .   with a wink at the others  downey selected an apple from the bowl in front of him  stealthily drew his arm back  and let fly with malicious accuracy .   the fork moved like a snake   s tongue and skewered the apple out of the air .   the reader turned a page .  then  eyes never leaving the print  he delicately brought the fork up to his mouth and took a bite out of the apple .   the rest of the table looked back at downey  and there were one or two chuckles .  the young man   s brow furrowed .  assault having failed  he was forced to try scathing wit  which he did not have .      you really are a scag  dog botherer     he said .      yes  downey     said the reader levelly  his eyes still intent on the page .      when are you going to pass some decent exams  dog botherer .         i really couldn   t say  downey .         never killed anyone  right  dog botherer .         probably not  downey .     the reader turned another page .  that little sound infuriated downey even more .      what   s that you   re reading .     he snapped .     robertson  show me what the dog botherer is reading  will you .  come on  pass it up .      the boy next to the one currently known as dog botherer snatched the book off the stand and threw it along the length of the table  the reader sighed and sat back as downey gave the pages a cursory flick .      well  look here  you fellows     he said .     dog botherer is reading a picture book .     he held it open .     color it in yourself with your paints or crayons  did you  dog botherer .      the former reader stared up at the ceiling .     no  downey .  it was hand colored to his instructions by miss emelia jane  the sister of lord winstanleigh greville pipe  the author .  it says so on the frontispiece  you will note .         and here   s a lovely picture of a tiger     downey ploughed on .     why   re you looking at pictures  dog botherer .         because lord winstanleigh has some interesting theories on the art of concealment  downey     said the reader .      huh .  black and orange tiger in green trees .     said downey  turning the pages roughly .     big red ape in green forest .  black and white zebra in yellow grass .  what   s this  a manual on how not to do it .      again there was a round of chuckles  but they were forced .  downey had friends because he was big and rich  but sometimes he was embarrassing to have around .      as a matter of fact  lord winstanleigh also has an interesting point to make on the dangers of intuitive           this a guild book  dog botherer .     downey demanded .      no  downey .  it was privately engraved some years ago and i succeeded in tracking down a copy in        downey   s hand shot out .  the book whirled away  causing a tableful of younger boys to scatter  and landed at the back of the fireplace .  the diners at the top tables looked around  and then turned back in indifference .  flames licked up .  for a moment  the tiger burned brightly .      rare book  was it .     said downey  grinning .      i think it may now be said to be nonexistent     said the one known as dog botherer .     that was the only extant copy .  even the engraved plates have been melted down .         don   t you ever get upset  dog botherer .         oh yes  downey     said the reader .  he pushed his chair back and stood up .     and now  i believe  i will have an early night .     he nodded at the table .     good evening  downey  gentlemen           you   re a scag  vetinari .         just as you say  downey .          vimes thought better when his feet were moving  the mere activity calmed him down and shook his thoughts into order .   apart from the curfew and manning the gates  the night watch didn   t do a lot .  this was partly because they were incompetent  and partly because no one expected them to be anything else .  they walked the streets slowly  giving anyone dangerous enough time to saunter away or melt into the shadows  and then rang the bell to announce to a sleeping world  or at any rate a world that had been asleep  the fact that all was  despite appearances  well .  they also rounded up the quieter sort of drunk and the more docile kinds of stray cattle .   they think i   m a spy for winder .  thought vimes .  spying on the treacle mine road watch .  it   s like spying on dough .   vimes had flatly refused to carry a bell .  young sam had acquired a lighter one  but out of deference to vimes   s crisply expressed wishes  kept the clapper muffled with a duster .      is the wagon going out tonight  sarge .     said young sam  as the twilight faded toward night .      yes .  colon and waddy are on it .         taking people to cable street .         no     said vimes .     i told them to take everyone to the watch house  and snouty   ll fine    em half a dollar and take their name and address .  perhaps we   ll have a raffle .         we   ll get into trouble  sarge .         the curfew   s just to frighten people .  it doesn   t mean much .         our mum says there   s going to be trouble soon     said sam .     she heard it in the fish shop .  everyone says it   s going to be snapcase at the palace .  he listens to the people .         yeah  right     said vimes .  and i listen to the thunder .  but i don   t do anything about it .      our mum says everyone   ll have a voice in the city when snapcase is the patrician     sam went on .      keep the voice down  kid .         the day   ll come when the angry masses will rise up and throw off their shekels  the fishmonger says     said sam .   if i was a spy for swing  that fishmonger would be gutted  vimes thought .  quite the revolutionary  our mam .   he wondered if it was at all possible to give this idiot some lessons in basic politics .  that was always the dream  wasn   t it .     i wish i knew then what i know now    .  but when you got older  you found out that you now wasn   t you then .  you then was a twerp .  you then was what you had to be to start out on the rocky road of becoming you now  and one of the rocky patches on that road was being a twerp .   a much better dream  one that   d ensure sounder sleep  was not to know now what you didn   t know then .      what   s your dad do .     he said as if he didn   t know .      he passed away a long time ago  sarge     said sam .     when i was little .  run down by a cart when he was crossing the street  our mum said .      what a champion liar she was  too .      sorry to hear that     said vimes .      er  our mum says you   d be welcome round to tea one night  what with you being all by yourself in a strange city  sarge .         would you like me to give you another tip  lad .     said vimes .      yes  sarge  i   m learning a lot .         lance constables do not invite their sergeants around to tea .  don   t ask me why .  it   s one of those things that does not happen .         you don   t know our mum  sarge .      vimes coughed .     mums are mums  lance constable .  they don   t like to see men managing by themselves  in case that sort of thing catches on .      besides  i know she   s been up in small gods these past ten years .  i   d rather put one hand flat on the table and give swing the hammer than walk down cockbill street today .      well     said sam     she says she   s going to make you some distressed pudding  sarge .  she makes great distressed pudding  our mum .      the best  thought vimes  staring into the middle distance .  oh  gods .  the very best .  no one has ever done it better .      that   d be   very kind of her     he managed .      sarge     said sam after a while     why are we patroling morphic street .  it   s not our beat .         i switched beats .  i ought to see as much of the city as possible     said vimes .      not a lot to see in morphic street  sarge .      vimes looked at the shadows .      oh  i don   t know     he said .     it   s amazing what you see if you concentrate .      he pulled sam into a doorway .      just whisper  lad     he said .     now  look down there at the house opposite .  see that doorway with the deeper shadow .         yes  sarge     whispered sam .      why   s it such a deep shadow  d   you think .         dunno  sarge .            cos someone in black is standing in it  that   s why .  so we   re going to walk a little further and then we   ll just turn around and go back round the corner .  we   re heading back to the station like good boys because our cocoa   s getting cold  see .         right  sarge .      they ambled back around the corner  and vimes let them walk sufficiently far up the street that the footsteps died away naturally .      okay  this is far enough     he said .   give sam his due  vimes thought  he knew how to stand still .  he   d have to teach him  too  how to unfocus himself  so that he could very nearly fade out of sight on a cloudy day .  had keel taught him that .  after a certain age  memory was indeed an untrustworthy thing     the city   s clocks chimed the three quarter hour .      what time   s curfew .     vimes whispered .      nine o   clock  sarge .         must be nearly that now     said vimes .      no  it   s only just gone a quarter to nine  sarge .         well  it   s going to take me a few minutes to get back .  i want you to sneak back after me and wait at the corner .  when it starts  you come running and banging that bell of yours .         when what starts  sarge .  sarge .      but vimes was walking noiselessly down the road .  he made a mental note to tip snouty a dollar .  these boots were like foot gloves .   torches spluttered on the junction  destroying the night vision of anyone who looked in that direction .  vimes padded around its dark penumbra and sidled along the buildings on the far wall until he was level with the door .  then he swung around the frame and shouted .      you   re nicked  chum .                   .     said the shadow .      and that   s offensive language  sir  such as i would not wish my young lance constable to hear .      behind him he heard lance constable vimes advancing at a run  ringing his bell madly  and shouting     nine o   clock and all   s not well at all .     and there were other sounds  too  the ones vimes had been half listening for  of doors slamming and distant footsteps hurrying away .      you bloody fool .     said the struggling figure in black .     what the hell are you playing at .     he pushed at vimes  who nevertheless tightened his grip .      that  sir  is assault upon a watch officer     said vimes .      i   m a watch officer  too  you damn flatfoot .  from cable street .         where   s your uniform .         we don   t wear uniforms .         where   s your badge .         and we don   t carry badges .         hard to see why i shouldn   t think you is a common thief then  sir .  you was casing that joint over there     said vimes  happy in the role of big  thick  but horribly unshakeable copper .     we seen you .         there was going to be a meeting of dangerous anarchists .         what kind of a religion is that  sir .     vimes patted the man   s belt .     oh dear  what have we here .  a very nasty dagger .  see this  lance constable vimes .  a weapon  no doubt about it .  that   s against the law .  carried after dark  which is even more against the law .  and it   s a concealed weapon .         what do you mean  concealed .     screamed the twisting prisoner .     it was in a bloody sheath .         bloody  eh .  used it already  have you  sir .     said vimes .  he thrust a hand into a pocket of the man   s black coat .     and   what   s this .  a little black velvet roll with  i do believe  a complete set of lockpicks .  that   s going equipped for burglary  that is .         they   re not mine and you know it .     the man snarled .      are you sure  sir .     said vimes .      yes .  because i keep mine in my inside pocket  you bastard .         that   s using language liable to cause a breach of the peace     said vimes .      huh .  you idiots have scared everyone away .  who   s going to be offended .         well  i might be .  i   m sure you don   t want that  sir .         you   re that stupid sergeant we   ve been told about  aren   t you     growled the man .     too thick to see what   s going on  right .  well  this is where you find out  mister        he twisted out of vimes   s grip  and there were a couple of sliding  metallic noises in the gloom .  wrist knives  thought vimes .  even assassins think they   re an idiot   s weapon .   he took a couple of steps back as the man danced toward him  both knives waving .      can   t think of a dumb answer to this one  eh  brownjob .      to his horror vimes saw  behind the man  the shape of sam raising his bell very slowly .      don   t hit him .     he shouted  and then lashed out with his boot as the man   s head turned .      if you   re going to fight  fight     he said  as the man toppled forward .     if you   re going to talk  talk .  don   t try to talk and fight .  and right now  i caution you to do neither .         i could have got him easily  sarge     sam complained  as vimes fished out his handcuffs and knelt down .     i could have blown him out like a light .         head injuries can be fatal  lance constable .  we serve the public trust .         but you kicked him in the privates  sarge .      because i don   t want you to be a target  thought vimes  as he tightened the cuffs .  that means you don   t belt one of them over the head .  you stay as the dim sidekick  in the background .  that way you survive  and that way  maybe  i do  too .      you don   t have to fight the way the other bloke wants you to fight     he said  hefting the man onto his shoulders .     give me a hand here   up we go .  okay  i   ve got him .  you lead the way .         back to the watch house .     said sam .     you   re arresting an unmentionable .         yes .  i just hope we   ll meet some of our lads on the way .  let this be a lesson  lad .  there aren   t any rules .  not when there   s knives out .  you take him down  quietly if possible  without hurting him much  if possible  but you take him down .  he comes at you with a knife  your bring your stick down on his arm .  he comes at you with his hands  you use your knee or your boot or your helmet .  your job is to keep the peace .  you make it peaceful as quickly as you can .         yes  sir .  but there   s going to be trouble  sarge .         straightforward arrest .  even coppers have to obey the law  what there is of it           yes  sarge  but i mean there   s going to be trouble right now  sarge .      they   d reached the end of the road  and there was a group of figures there .  they looked like men with a purpose  there was something about the stance  the way they were standing in the road  and  of course  the occasional glint of light on a weapon also gave a hint .  there was a snapping of little doors as dark lanterns were opened .   of course  he wouldn   t have been alone  vimes scolded himself .  his job was just to watch until they   d all gone in .  and then he   d just schlep away to call in the heavy gang .   there must be a dozen of    em .  we   re going to get cheesed .       what   ll we do  sarge .     whispered sam .      ring your bell .         but they   ve spotted us .         ring the damn bell  will you .  and keep walking .  and don   t stop ringing .      the unmentionables spread out now  and as vimes trudged toward them  he saw several figures at each end of the line slip around behind him .  that   s how it   d go .  they   d be like the muggers up in scoone avenue  talking nice and friendly while their eyes said  hey  you know our mates are right behind you and we know you know  and it   s fun watching you trying to pretend that this is just a civilized conversation when you know that any minute you   re going to get it right in the kidneys .  we feel your pain .  and we like it     he stopped walking .  it was that or walk into someone .  and all along the street doors and windows were opening  as the clanging of the bell roused the neighborhood .      evenin        he said .      evenin     your grace     said a voice out of history .     nice to see an old friend  eh .      vimes groaned .  the worst that could happen had happened .      carcer .         that   s sergeant carcer  thank you .  funny how things work out  eh .  turns out i   m prime copper material  haha .  they gave me a new suit and a sword and twenty five dollars a month  just like that .  lads  this is the man i told you about .         why   d you call him    your grace     sarge .     said one of the shadowy men .   carcer   s eyes never left vimes   s face .      it   s a joke .  where we come from  everyone used to call him duke     said carcer .  vimes saw him slip a hand into a pocket .  it came out holding something that had a brassy glint .     it was a sort of nickname  eh   duke .  stop the kid ringing the damn bell  will you .         knock it off  lance constable     vimes muttered .  the noise had worked  anyway .  this little tableau had a silent audience now .  not that an audience would make any difference to carcer .  he   d cheerfully stab you to death in the center of a crowded arena and then look around and say     who  me .     but the men behind him were edgy  like cockroaches wondering when the light was going to go on .      don   t you worry  duke     carcer said  sliding his fingers into the brass knuckles     i   ve told the boys about you and me .  how we  haha  go back a long way and all that  haha .         yeah .     said vimes .  it wasn   t prizewinning repartee  but carcer obviously wanted to talk .     and how did you get made a sergeant  carcer .         i heard where they were looking for coppers with fresh ideas     said carcer .     and that nice captain swing hisself talked to me and said he was in no doubt i was an honest man who had been unlucky .  measured me up  he did  with his calipers and his rulers and jommetry and he said it proved i was not a criminal type .  it was all the fault of my environment  he said .         what  you mean all those dead bodies everywhere you went .     said vimes .      nice one  duke  haha .         and you had fresh ideas  did you .         well  he liked one of    em     said carcer  narrowing his eyes .     turned out he didn   t know the ginger beer trick .      the ginger beer trick .  well  that just about put the tin lid on it .  torturers down the ages hadn   t found the ginger beer trick  and carcer has handed it over to a patient maniac like captain swing .      the ginger beer trick     said vimes .     well done  carcer .  you   re just what swing   s been looking for .  the complete bastard .      carcer grinned as if he   d been awarded a small prize .     yeah  i already told    em how you got a down on me for stealing a loaf of bread .         come on  carcer     said vimes .     that   s not you .  you never pinched a loaf of bread in your life .  murdering the baker and stealing the bakery  that   d be your style .         he   s a card  eh .     said carcer  winking at his men and nodding toward vimes .  then  in one movement  he spun around and punched the man beside him in the stomach .      you don   t call me    sarge        he hissed .     it   s    sergeant     understand .      on the floor  the man groaned .      i   ll take that as a yes  then  haha     said carcer  slipping the brass knuckles back into this pocket .     now the thing is   duke   what you have there is one of my men  so how about you hand him over and we   ll say no more about it .         what   s happening  sarge .      the voice was coming from some way behind vimes .  he turned .  it was wiglet and scutts .  they looked like men who   d been running but now were trying to affect a nonchalant swagger .  it was getting less nonchalant and considerably less swaggy as they eyed up the unmentionables .   the frantically ringing bell .  that   s what they   d always used .  all the coppers who heard it would converge on it  because an officer was in trouble .   of course  they wouldn   t necessarily help him get out of trouble  not if the odds weren   t right .  this was the old night watch  after all .  but at least they could fish him out of the river or cut him down and see he got a decent burial .   there was a rumble from further up the street  and the rattling bulk of the hurry up turned the corner  with fred colon at the reins and constable waddy hanging on behind .  vimes heard the shouts .      what   s up  bill .         it   s keel and vimesy     wiglet called back .     hurry up .      vimes tried to avoid carcer   s eyes  tried to appear as if nothing had happened  tried to pretend that the world had not suddenly cracked open and let in the cold winds of infinity .  but carcer was smart .   he glanced at vimes  looked at sam .      vimesy .     he said .     your name sam vimes  mister .         i ain   t saying anything     said lance constable vimes staunchly .      well  well  well  well  well     said carcer happily .     now here   s a nice how d   yer do  eh .  something for a chap to think about  and no mistake  haha .      there was a creak as the hurry up wagon rolled to a stop .  carcer glanced up at the round  pale face of corporal colon .      you just go about your business  corporal     said carcer .     you just leave now .      colon swallowed .  vimes could see his adam   s apple bob as it tried to hide .      er   we heard the ringing     he said .      just a bit of high spirits     said carcer .     nothing that need worry you .  we   re all coppers here  right .  i wouldn   t like there to be any trouble .  there   s just been a bit of a misunderstanding  that   s all .  sergeant keel here was just going to hand over my friend there  right  sergeant .  no hard feelings  eh .  you just happened to blunder into a little operation of ours .  best not to talk about it .  just you hand him over and we   ll call it quits .      every head turned to vimes .   the sensible thing would be to hand the man over .  he knew it .  and then   probably   carcer would go away  and he didn   t want that man any closer to young sam than he could help .   but carcer would come back .  oh  yes .  things like carcer always came back  especially when they thought they   d found a weakness .   that wasn   t the worst part .  the worst part was that he   d changed things .   there had been the morphic street conspiracy .  the unmentionables had raided it .  a lot of people had died but some had got away  and then there had been a few days of horrible confusion and then it ended when     but sam vimes hadn   t been anywhere near morphic street that night .  keel had been teaching him to shake hands with doorknobs over on the other side of the shades .   but you wanted to be clever  duke .  you wanted to put a spoke in the wheel and smack a few heads  didn   t you .   and now carcer   s in it as well  and you   re out of the history books and traveling without a map     carcer was still grinning his cheerful grin .  here and now  more than anything else  vimes wanted to see the end of that grin .      well  i   d like to oblige  sarge     he said .     i really would .  but i   ve pinched him now  so i   ve got to take him back to my nick and do the paperwork .  he might well be able to help us with our inquiries into a number of unsolved crimes .         such as .     said carcer .      dunno     said vimes .     depends on what we   ve got .  we   ll take him down the cells  give him a cup of tea  chat to him about this and that   you know how it is .  a man can get quite chatty after a cup of tea .  or carbonated beverage of his choice  of course .      there was a snigger from among the members of the night watch  although vimes hoped none of them understood what the last sentence meant .   carcer   s smile dissolved .      i said he   s one of my men  on official business  and i am a sergeant     he said .      and i am sergeant at arms and i said we   ll hand him over to you at the nick  sergeant carcer .  officially .      carcer nodded toward the lance constable  so imperceptibly that only vimes saw it .  and he lowered his voice .      but suddenly i   ve got all the aces  duke     he said .      but suddenly i   m not playing cards  carcer .  now  we could have a barney right here and now and  y   know  i   m not sure which way it   d go .  but i   m sure as hell that you wouldn   t be a sergeant tomorrow .  and if you think you   ve got all the aces  you can afford to raise the stakes .      carcer stared at him for a moment .  then he winked and half turned away .      i told you he   s a caution  eh .     he said to the multitude .  he gave vimes a conspiratorial dig in the ribs .     always trying it on .  okay  sergeant   at arms  we   ll do it your way .  got to give you brownjobs something to do  haha  eh .  i   ll send a couple of the lads down for him in an hour or so .      that   s right  give me time to sweat on whether i   ll pop into nonexistence if you cut the lad   s throat  vimes thought .  trouble is  i am sweating .   he straightened up and beckoned to the hurry up wagon .      me and my lads will all take him back     he said .     time for our cocoa break  see .  give me a hand up with him  waddy .  got any other passengers  fred .         just a drunk  sarge .  been spewing everywhere .         okay .  we   ll put the prisoner in the back and we   ll all hang on the outside .     vimes nodded at carcer .     i   m sure we   ll meet again soon  sergeant .         yeah     said carcer  and there was that impish grin again .     and you be sure to look after yourself  d   you hear .      vimes leaped onto the side of the wagon as it rattled past  and didn   t even look back .  that was one thing about carcer  at least   he wouldn   t shoot you in the back if he thought there was a reasonable chance  pretty soon  of cutting your throat .   after a while  constable wiglet  hanging on beside him as the wagon rocked  said     what happened back there  sarge .  you know that bloke .         yes .  he   s killed two coppers .  one that tried to arrest him and one who was off duty and eating a pie .  killed other people  too .         but he   s a copper .         swing gave him a job  wiglet .      suddenly  the rattle of the wheels sounded much louder .  all the other watchmen were listening very intently .      you been in the watch long  constable .     said vimes .      two years  sarge     said wiglet .     used to be a fruit porter down the market  but i got a bad back and a bad chest what with all the cold mornings .         i never heard about coppers being killed     said lance constable vimes .      it wasn   t here  kid .  it was a long way away .         you were there .         they were coppers i knew  yes .      again  the mood on the cart changed .  there was no obvious sound from the watchmen but over the wagon hung the word    ah hah           so you came here to track him down    .     said wiglet .      something like that .         we heard you came from pseudopolis  sarge     said sam .      i   ve come from a lot of places .         wow .     said sam .      he killed a copper who was eating a pie .     said fred colon  from the box .      yep .         what a bastard .  what kind of pie was it .         witnesses didn   t say     vimes lied .  this was old ankh morpork .  the dwarfs here right now were a tiny minority who kept their heads down   well  further down than usual .  there certainly were no all night ratpie shops .   wiglet had something on his mind .      they   re going to come for that bloke you picked up     he said .      want the rest of the night off  constable .     said vimes .  there was some nervous laughter from the rest of the crew .  poor devils  thought vimes .  you joined up    cos the wages were good and there was no heavy lifting  and suddenly it   s going to be difficult .      what   re you going to charge our man with  sarge .     said sam .      attempted assault on a copper .  you saw the knives .         you did kick him  though .         right  i forgot .  we   ll do him for resisting arrest  too .      there was some more laughter .  we who think we are about to die will laugh at anything .   what a bunch .  i know you well  gentlemen .  you   re in it for the quiet life and the pension  you don   t hurry too much in case the danger is still around when you get there  and the most you ever expected to face was an obstreperous drunk or a particularly difficult cow .  most of you aren   t even coppers  not in your head .  in the sea of adventure  you   re bottom feeders .   and now  it   s war   and you   re in the middle .  not on either side .  you   re the stupid little band of brownjobs .  you   re beneath contempt .  but believe me  boys   you   ll rise .       for a minute of two after morphic street went quiet  nothing moved and nothing happened .   then a coach came around the corner .  it was a particularly fine one  drawn by two horses .  its lamps were torches  and as the coach bounced on the cobbles  the zigzagging flames seemed to trail for a moment in the air .   insofar as they revealed anything  they suggested that the coach had been done up in purple livery .  it also seemed to be rather heavy on its wheels .   it pulled to a halt at the next doorway down from the one where vimes had performed his arrest .  vimes  who thought he knew a lot about being a shadow  would have been surprised to see two dark figures step out of the doorway   s darkness into the light of the torch .   the coach door swung open .      strange news  kind lady     said one of the shadows .      very strange news  dearie     said the other shadow .   they climbed up into the coach  which sped off .       vimes was impressed at the way the men reacted back at the watch house  despite the lack of any command from him .  wiglet and scutts jumped down as soon as the wagon was in the yard and dragged the gates across .   inside  colon and waddy pulled the shutters across the windows .  waddy went into the armory and came out with an armful of crossbows .  it was all done with speed and  for the men concerned  precision .   vimes nudged his younger self .     make the cocoa  will you  kid .     he said .     i don   t want to miss the show .      he sat down at his desk and put his feet up as colon locked the door and waddy pulled the bar across .   this is happening  he thought  but it didn   t happen before .  not exactly like this .  this time  the morphic street mob did a runner .  they weren   t ambushed in their meeting .  there wasn   t a fight .  the sight of all those coppers must   ve scared them rigid .  they weren   t much anyway  just sloganeers and skivers and me too ists  the people who crowd behind the poor slob who   s the spokesman  shouting    yea  right     and leg it up an alley when the law gets rough .  but some had died in the ambush  and some fought back  and one thing led  as always  to another .  except  this time  there was no ambush  because some thick sergeant made too much noise     two different presents .  one past  one future     i don   t know what   s going to happen next .   however  i   ve got a damn good idea .      well done  lads     he said  standing up .     you finish trapping us inside and i   ll go and tell the old man what   s happening .      he heard the puzzled muttering behind him as he climbed the stairs .   captain tilden was sitting at his desk  staring at the wall .  vimes coughed loudly  and saluted .      had a bit of       he began  and tilden turned his ashen face to him .  he looked as though he had seen a ghost  and it had been in the mirror .      you   ve heard the news  too .         sir .         the riot up at dolly sisters     said tilden .     it was only a couple of hours ago .      i   m too close  vimes thought  as the words sank in .  all those things were just names  it all seemed to happen at once .  dolly sisters  yeah .  they were a right mob of hotheads up there        the lieutenant of the day watch called in one of the regiments     said tilden .     which he was duly authorized to do .  of course .         which one .     said vimes  for the look of the thing .  the name was in the history books  after all .      lord venturi   s medium dragoons  sergeant .  my old regiment .      that   s right  thought vimes .  and cavalry are highly trained at civilian crowd control .  everyone knows that .      and  er  there were some  er  accidental deaths        vimes felt sorry for the man .  in truth  it was never proven that anyone had given an order to ride people down  but did it matter .  horses pushing  and people unable to get away because of the press of people behind them   it was too easy for small children to lose grip of a hand        but  in fairness  missiles were thrown at the officers  and one soldier was badly injured     said tilden  as if reading the words off a card .   that   s all right  then .  vimes thought .      what kind of missiles  sir .         fruit  i gather .  although there may have been some stones as well .     vimes realized that tilden   s hand was shaking .     the riot was over the price of bread  i understand .      no .  the protest was over the price of bread  said vimes   s inner voice .  the riot was what happens when you have panicking people trapped between idiots on horseback and other idiots shouting    yeah  right .     and trying to push forward  and the whole thing in the charge of a fool advised by a maniac with a steel rule .      the feeling of the palace     said tilden slowly     is that revolutionary elements may attack the watch houses .         really  sir .  why .         it   s the sort of thing they do     said tilden .      as a matter of fact  sir  the men are putting up shutters and           do whatever you feel necessary  sergeant     said tilden  waving a hand with a scrawled letter in it .     we are told we must be mindful of the curfew regulations .  that has been underlined .      vimes paused before answering .  he   d bitten back the first answer .  he contented himself with    very well  sir     and left .   the man wasn   t a bad man  he knew  he must have been badly affected by the news to give such a stupid  dangerous order .     do whatever you feel necessary .     give an order like that to a man who   s liable to panic when he sees a bunch of people waving their fists and you got the dolly sisters massacre .   he walked back down the stairs .  the squad was standing around looking nervous .      prisoner in the cells .     said vimes .   corporal colon nodded .     yessir .  sarge  snouty says that up at dolly sisters           i know .  now here   s what i feel is necessary .  take the shutters down  unbar the door  leave it open  and light all the lamps .  why isn   t the blue lamp over the door lit .         dunno  sarge .  but what if           get it lit  corporal .  and then you and waddy go and stand guard outside  where you can be seen .  you   re friendly looking local lads .  take your bells  but  and i want to make this very clear  no swords  right .         no swords .     colon burst out .     but what if a bloody great mob comes round the corner and i   m not armed .      vimes reached him in two swift strides and stood nose to nose .      and if you have got a sword  what will you do  eh .  against a bloody great mob .  what do you want    em to see .  now what i want    em to see is fatty colon  decent lad  not too bright  i knew    is dad  an    there   s ol    waddy  he drinks in my pub .     cos if they just see a couple of men in uniform with swords you   ll be in trouble  and if you draw those swords you   ll be in real trouble  and if by any chance  corporal  you draw swords tonight without my order and survive  then you   ll wish you hadn   t done either  because you   ll have to face me  see .  and then you   ll know what trouble is     cos everything up until then will look like a bleedin    day at the soddin    seaside .  understand .      fred colon goggled at him .  there was no other word for it .      don   t let my sugary sweet tones lead you to believe that i   m not damn well giving you orders     said vimes  turning away .     vimes .         yes  sarge .     said young sam .      have we got a saw in this place .      snouty stepped forward .     i   ve got a toolbox  sarge .         nails  too .         yessir .         right .  rip the door off my locker and hammer a lot of nails right through it  will you .  then put it on the upstairs landing .  i   ll take the saw     cos i   m going to the privy .      after the silence that followed  corporal colon obviously felt he had to make a contribution .  he cleared his throat and said     if you   ve got a problem in that area  sarge  mrs .  colon   s got a wonderful medicine she           i won   t be long     said vimes .  in fact  he was four minutes .      all done     he said  returning to the sound of hammering from the locker room .     come with me  lance constable .  time for a lesson in interrogation .  oh   and bring the toolbox .         fred and waddy don   t like being outside     said sam  as they went down the stone steps .     they say what if that bunch of unmentionables turn up .         they needn   t worry .  our friends at cable street are not front door kind of people .      he pushed open the door to the cells .  the prisoner stood up and grabbed the bars .      okay  they   ve come  now you let me out     he said .     come on  and i   ll put in a good word for you .         no one   s come for you  sir     said vimes .  he locked the main door behind him  and then unlocked the cell .      it   s probably a busy time for them     he added .     been a bit of a riot over in dolly sisters .  a few deaths .  might be a while before they get around to you .      the man eyed the toolbox that the lance constable was holding .  it was only a flicker  but vimes saw the moment of uncertainty .      i get it     the prisoner said .     good cop  bad cop  eh .         if you like     said vimes .     but we   re a bit short staffed  so if i give you a cigarette  would you mind kicking yourself in the teeth .         look  this is a game  right .     said the prisoner .     you know i   m one of the particulars .  and you   re new in town and want to impress us .  well  you have .  big laugh all round  haha .  anyway  i was only on stakeout .         yes  but that   s not how it works  is it     said vimes .     now we   ve got you  we can decide what you   re guilty of .  you know how it   s done .  fancy a ginger beer .      the man   s face froze .      y   know     said vimes     it turns out that after the riot this evening we   ve been warned to expect revolutionary attacks on the watch houses .  now  personally  i wouldn   t expect that .  what i   d expect is a bunch of ordinary people turning up  you know  because they   ve heard what happened .  but   and you can call me mr .  suspicious if you like   i   ve got a feeling that there will be something a bit worse .  you see  apparently we   ve got to be mindful of the curfew regulations .  what that means  i suppose  is that if we get people coming to complain about unarmed citizens being attacked by soldiers  which  personally  i would consider to be assault with a deadly weapon  we   ve got to arrest them .  i find that rather        there was a commotion from above .  vimes nodded to young sam  who disappeared up the stairs .      now that my impressionable assistant has gone     said vimes quietly     i   ll add that if any of my men get hurt tonight then i   ll see to it that for the rest of your life you scream at the sight of a bottle .         i haven   t done anything to you .  you don   t even know me .         yes .  like i said  we   re doing it your way     said vimes .   sam reappeared  in a hurry .      someone   s fallen in the privy .     he announced .     they were climbing on the roof and it gave way .         it must be one of those revolutionary elements     said vimes  watching the prisoner   s face .     we   ve been warned about them .         he says he   s from cable street  sarge .         that   s just the kind of thing i   d say  if i was a revolutionary element     said vimes .     all right  let   s take a look at him .      upstairs  the front door was still open .  there were a few people outside  just visible in the lamplight .  there was also sergeant knock inside  and he was not happy .      who said we open up like this .     he was saying .     it looks nasty out on those streets .  very dangerous           i said we stay open     said vimes  coming up the stairs .     is there a problem  sergeant .         well   look  sarge  i heard on the way over  they   re throwing stones at the dimwell street house     said knock  deflating .     there   s people in the streets .  mobs .  i hate to think what   s happening downtown .         so .         we   re coppers .  we should be getting prepared .         to do what .  bar the doors and listen to the stones rattle off the roof .     said vimes .     or maybe we should go out and arrest everyone .  any volunteers .  no .  i   ll tell you what  sergeant  if you want to do some coppering  you can go and arrest the man in the privy .  do him for breaking and entering        there was a scream from upstairs .   vimes glanced up .      and i reckon if you go up onto the attic landing you   ll find there   s a man who dropped through the skylight right onto a doorful of nails that was accidentally left there     he went on .  he looked at knock   s puzzled face .     it   s the cable street boys  sergeant     he explained .     they thought they could come across the roofs and scare the dumb brownjobs .  chuck    em both in the cells .         you   re arresting unmentionables .         no uniform .  no badge .  carrying weapons .  let   s have a bit of law around here  shall we .     said vimes .     snouty  where   s that cocoa .         we   ll get into trouble .     knock shouted .   vimes let knock wait until he   d lit a cigar .     we   re in trouble anyway  winsborough     he said  shaking out the match .     it   s just a case of deciding what kind we want .  thanks  snouty .      he took the mug of cocoa from the jailer and nodded at sam .      let   s take a stroll outside     he said .   he was aware of the sudden silence in the room  except for the whimpering coming from upstairs and the distant yelling from the privy .      what   re you all standing around for  gentlemen .     he said .     want to ring your bells .  anyone fancy shouting out that all   s well .      with those words hanging in the room all big and pink  vimes stepped out into the evening air .   there were people hanging around out there  in little groups of three or four  talking among themselves and occasionally turning to look at the watch house .   vimes sat down on the steps and took a sip of his cocoa .   he might as well have dropped his breeches .  the groups opened up  became an audience .  no man drinking a nonalcoholic chocolate drink had ever been the center of so much attention .   he   d been right .  a closed door is an incitement to bravery .  a man drinking from a mug  under a light  and apparently enjoying the cool night air  is an incitement to pause .      we   re breaking curfew  you know     said a young man moving with a quick dart forward dart back movement .      is that right .     said vimes .      are you going to arrest us  then .         not me     said vimes cheerfully .     i   m on my break .         yeah .     said the man .  he pointed to colon and waddy .     they on their break too .         they are now .     vimes half turned .     brew   s up  lads .  off you go .  no  no need to run  there   s enough for everyone .  and come back out when you   ve got it        when the sound of pounding boots had died away  vimes turned back and smiled at the group again .      so when do you come off your break .     said the man .   vimes paid him some extra attention .  the stance was a giveaway .  he was ready to fight  even though he didn   t look like a fighter .  if this was a barroom  the bartender would be taking the more expensive bottles off the shelf  because amateurs like that tended to spread the glass around .  ah  yes   and now he could see why the word    barroom    had occurred to him .  there was a bottle sticking out of the man   s pocket .  he   d been drinking his defiance .      oh  around thursday  i reckon     said vimes  eyeing the bottle .  there was laughter from somewhere in the growing crowd .      why thursday .     said the drinker .      got my day off on thursday .      there were a few more laughs this time .  when the tension is drawing out  it doesn   t take much to snap it .      i demand you arrest me .     said the drinker .     come on  try it .         you   re not drunk enough     said vimes .     i should go home and sleep it off  if i was you .      the man   s hand grasped the neck of the bottle .  here it comes  thought vimes .  by the look of him  the man had one chance in five     fortunately  the crowd wasn   t too big yet .  what you didn   t need at a time like this was people at the back  craning to see and asking what was going on .  and the lit up house was fully illuminating the lit up man .      friend  if you take my advice you   ll not consider that     said vimes .  he took another sip of his cocoa .  it was only lukewarm now  but along with the cigar it meant that both his hands were occupied .  that was important .  he wasn   t holding a weapon .  no one could say afterward that he had a weapon .      i   m no friend to you people .     snapped the man and smashed the bottle on the wall by the steps .   the glass tinkled to the ground .  vimes watched the man   s face  watched the expression change from drink fueled anger to agonizing pain  watched the mouth open     the man swayed .  blood began to ooze from between his fingers  and a low  thin animal sound escaped from between his teeth .   that was the tableau  under the light   vimes sitting down with his hands full  the bleeding man several feet away .  no fight  no one had touched anyone   he knew the way rumor worked  and he wanted this picture to fix itself in people   s minds .  there was even ash still on the cigar .   he stayed very still for a few seconds  and then stood up  all concern .      come on  one of you help me  will you .     he said  tugging off his breastplate and the chain mail shirt underneath it .  he grabbed his shirt sleeve and tore off a long strip .   a couple of men  jerked into action by the voice of command  steadied the man who was dripping blood .  one of them reached for the hand .      leave it     vimes commanded  tightening the strip of sleeve around the man   s unresisting wrist .     he   s got a handful of broken glass .  lay him down as gently as you can before he falls over but don   t touch nothing until i   ve got this tourniquet on .  sam  go into the stable and pinch marilyn   s blanket for the boy .  anyone here know doctor lawn .  speak up .      someone among the awed bystanders volunteered that he did  and was sent running for him .   vimes was aware of the circle watching him  a lot of the watchmen were peering around the doorway now .      saw this happen once     he said aloud   and added mentally    in ten years time         it was in a bar fight .  man grabbed a bottle  didn   t know how to smash it  ended up with a hand full of shards  and the other guy reached down and squeezed .     there was a satisfying groan from the crowd .     anyone know who this man is .     he added .     come on  someone must        a voice in the crowd volunteered that the man could well be joss gappy  an apprentice shoemaker from new cobblers .      let   s hope we can save his hand  then     said vimes .     i need a new pair of boots .      it wasn   t funny at all  but it got another of those laughs  the ones people laugh out of sheer frightened nervousness .  then the crowd parted as lawn came through .      ah     he said  kneeling down by gappy .     you know  i don   t know why i own a bed .  trainee bottle fighter .         yes .         looks like you   ve done the right things but i need light and a table     said lawn .     can your men take him into the watch house .      vimes had hoped it wouldn   t come to that .  oh well  you had to make the best of it     he pointed randomly at figures in the crowd .     you and you and you and you and you  too  lady     he said .     you can help fred and waddy take this young man inside  okay .  and you   re to stop with him  and we   ll leave the doors open  right .  all you lot out here   ll know what   s going on .  we   ve got no secrets here .  everyone understand .         yeah  but you   re a copper       a voice began .   vimes darted forward and hauled a frightened young man out of the crowd by his shirt .      yeah  i am     he said .     and see that lad over there .  he   s a copper  too .  his name   s sam vimes .  he lives in cockbill street with his mum .  and that   s fred colon  just got married  got a couple of rooms in old cobblers .  and exhibit c there is waddy  everyone round here knows waddy .  billy wiglet there  he was born in this street .  have i asked you your name .         n no       the man mumbled .      that   s    cos i don   t care who you are     said vimes  letting the man go and looking round at the crowd .     listen to me  all of you .  my name   s john keel .  no one gets taken into this watch house without me knowing why .  you   re all here as witnesses .  those of you i pointed out  you come on inside to see fair play all round .  do the rest of you want to hang around to see what happens to gappy .  fine  i   ll get snouty to bring you out some cocoa .  or you can go home .  it   s a cold night .  you ought to be in your beds .  i know i   d like to be in mine .  and  yes  we know about dolly sisters and we don   t like it any more than you do .  and we   ve heard about dimwell street and we don   t like that  either .  and that   s all i   ve got to say tonight .  now   anyone who still wants to take a swing at a copper can step right up  if they want to .  i   ve got my uniform off .  we   ll have a go  here and now  fair and square  in front of everyone .  anyone .      something brushed his shoulder and clattered on the watch house steps .  then there was the sound of slipping tiles from a roof on the other side  and a man fell off the roof and into the pool of light .  there were gasps from the crowd  and one or two short screams .      looks like you got a volunteer     said someone .  there was the horrible nervous sniggering again .  the crowd parted to let vimes view the sudden arrival .   the man was dead .  if he hadn   t been when he fell off the roof  he was after he   d hit the ground  because no neck normally looked like that .  a crossbow had fallen down with him .   vimes remembered the draft across his shoulder  and went back to the watch house steps .  it didn   t take long to find the arrow  which had broken into several pieces .      anyone know this man .     he said .   the crowd  even those members of it who hadn   t been able to get a good look at the fallen bowman  indicated definite ignorance .   vimes went through the man   s pockets .  every single one was empty  which was all the evidence of identification he needed .      looks like it   s going to be a long night     he said  signaling colon to take this body inside  too .     i   ve got to get on with my work  ladies and gentlemen .  if anyone wants to stay  and frankly i   ll be obliged if you do  i   ll send some lads out to build a fire .  thank you for your patience .      he picked up his chain mail and breastplate and went back inside .      what   re they doing .     he said to sam  without turning around .      some of them are wandering off but most of    em are standing around  sarge     said sam  peering around the door .     sarge  one of them shot at you .         really .  who says the man on the roof was one of them .  that   s an expensive bow .  and he didn   t have anything in his pockets .  nothing .  not so much as a used hanky .         very odd  sarge     said sam loyally .      especially since i was expecting a piece of paper saying something like    i am definitely a member of a revolutionary cadre  trust me on this        said vimes  looking carefully at the corpse .      yes  that   d tell us he was a revolutionary all right     said sam .   vimes sighed and stared at the wall a moment .  then he said     anyone notice anything about his bow .         it   s the new bolsover a      said fred colon .     not a bad bow  sarge .  not an assassin   s weapon  though .         that   s true     said vimes and twisted the dead man   s head so they could see the tip of the little metal dart behind the ear .     but this is .  fred  you know everyone .  where can i get some ginger beer at this time of night .         ginger beer  sarge .         yes  fred .         why do       colon began .      don   t ask  fred .  just get half a dozen bottles  all right .      vimes turned to the desk on which  surrounded by a fascinated crowd  dr .  lawn was at work on the stricken gappy .      how   s it going .     said vimes  pushing though .      slower than it   d go if people got out of the damn light     said lawn  carefully moving his tweezers to a mug by gappy   s hand and dropping a bloody fragment of glass therein .     i   ve seen worse on a friday night .  he   ll keep the use of his fingers  if that   s what you want to know .  he just won   t be making any shoes for a while .  well done .      there was approval from the crowd .  vimes looked around at the people and the coppers .  there were one or two muted conversations going on  he heard phases like    bad business    and    they say that       above the general noise .   he   d played the cards well enough .  most of the lads here lived within a street or two .  it was one thing to have a go at faceless bastards in uniform  but quite another to throw stones at old fred colon or old waddy or old billy wiglet  who you   d known since you were two years old and played dead rat conkers with in the gutter .   lawn put the tweezers down and pinched the bridge of his nose .      that   s it     he said wearily .     a bit of stitching and he   ll be fine .         and there   s some others i need you to take a look at     said vimes .      you know  that comes as no surprise     said the doctor .      one   s got a lot of holes in his feet  one dropped through the privy roof and has got a twisted leg  and one   s dead .         i don   t think i can do much about the dead one     said the doctor .     how do you know he   s dead .  i realize that i may regret asking that question .         he   s got a broken neck from falling off a roof and i reckon he fell off because he got a steel crossbow dart in his brain .         ah .  that sounds like dead  if you want my medical opinion .  did you do it .         no .         well  you   re a busy man  sergeant .  you can   t be everywhere .     the doctor   s face cracked into a grin when he saw vimes go red  and he walked over to the corpse .      yes  i   d say that life is definitely extinct     he said .     and .         i want you to write that down  please .  on paper .  with official sounding words like    contusion    and    abrasions .     i want you to write that down  and i want you to write down what time you found he was dead .  and then  if you don   t mind  two lads   ll take you down to look at the other two  and after you   ve treated them  thank you  i   d like you to sign another piece of paper saying you did and i called you in .  two copies of everything  please .         all right .  dare i ask why .         i don   t want anyone to say i killed him .         why should anyone say that .  you told me he fell off a roof .         these are suspicious times  doctor .  ah  here   s fred .  any luck .      corporal colon was carrying a box .  he put it down on his desk with a grunt .      old mrs .  arbiter didn   t like being knocked up in the middle of the night     he announced .     i had to give her a dollar .      vimes didn   t dare look at lawn   s face .      really .     he said  as innocently as possible .     and you got the ginger beer .         six pints of her best stuff     said colon .     there   s three pence back on the bottles  by the way .  and   er       he shuffled uneasily .     er   i heard they set fire to the watch house at dolly sisters  sarge .  it   s very bad up at nap hill  too .  and  er   the chitterling street house got all its windows broke  and up at the leastgate house some of the lads went out to stop kids throwing stones and  er  one of them drew his sword  sarge           and .         he   ll probably live  sarge .      doctor lawn looked around at the crowded office  where people were still talking .  snouty was going around with a tray of cocoa .  out in the street  some of the watchmen were standing around a makeshift fire with the remnant of the crowd .      well  i must say i   m impressed     he said .     sounds like you   re the only watch house not under siege tonight .  i don   t want to know how you did it .         luck played a part     said vimes .     and i   ve got three men who carry no personal identification whatsoever in the cells  and another anonymous would be assassin who has been assassinated .         quite a problem     said lawn .     now me  i just have to deal with simple mysteries like what the rash means .         i intend to solve mine quite quickly     said vimes .       the assassin moved quietly from roof to roof until he was well away from the excitement around the watch house .   his movements could be called catlike  except that he did not stop to spray urine up against things .   eventually he reached one of the upper world   s many hidden places  where several thickets of chimneys made a little hidden space  invisible from the ground and from most of the surrounding roofscape .  he didn   t enter it immediately  but circled it for a while  moving with absolute silence from one vantage point to another .   what would have intrigued a watcher who knew the ways of ankh morpork   s guild of assassins was how invisible this one was .  when he moved  you saw movement  when he stopped  he wasn   t there .  magic would have been suspected and  in an oblique way  the watcher would have been right .  ninety percent of most magic merely consists of knowing one extra fact .   at last the man appeared satisfied  and dropped into the space .  he picked up a bag from its nesting place between the smoking pots  and there was some faint swishing and heavier breathing that suggested clothes were being changed .   after a minute of so  he emerged from the hidden niche and now  somehow  he was visible .  hard to see  yes  one shadow among others  but nevertheless there in a way that he   d not been before  when he   d been as visible as the breeze .   he dropped lightly onto a lean to roof and thence to the ground  where he stepped into a handy shadow .  then there was a further transformation .  it was done quite easily .  the evil little crossbow was disassembled and slipped into the pockets of a clink free velvet bag  the soft leather slippers were exchanged for a pair of heavier boots that had been stashed in the shadow  and the black hood was pushed back .   he walked lightly around the corner and waited a few minutes  wiping his face .   a coach came along  its torches trailing flame .  it slowed briefly  and its door opened and shut .   the assassin settled back in his seat as the coach picked up speed again .   there was a very faint lamp in the carriage .  its glow revealed a female figure relaxing in the shadows opposite .  as the coach passed a street torch  there was suggestion of lilac silk .      you   ve missed a bit     said the figure .  it produced a lilac colored handkerchief and held it in front of the young man   s face .     spit     came the command .   reluctantly  he did so .  a hand wiped his cheek  and then held the cloth up to the light .      dark green     said the woman .     how strange .  i understand  havelock  that you scored zero in your examination for stealthy movement .         may i ask how you found that out  madam .         oh  one hears things     madam said lightly .     one just has to hold money up to one   s ear .         well  it was true     said the assassin .      and why was this .         the examiner thought i   d used trickery  madam .         and did you .         of course .  i thought that was the idea .         and you never attended his lessons  he said .         oh  i did .  religiously .         he says he never saw you at any of them .      havelock smiled .     and your point  madam  is    .      madam laughed .     will you take some champagne .     there was the sound of a bottle moving in an ice bucket .      thank you  madam  but no .         as you wish .  i shall .  and now   report  please .         i can   t believe what i saw .  i thought he was a thug .  and he is a thug .  you can see his muscles thinking for him .  but he overrules them moment by moment .  i think i saw a genius at work  but           what .         he   s just a sergeant  madam .         don   t underestimate him on that account .  it is a very useful rank for the right man .  the optimum balance of power and responsibility .  incidentally  they say he can read the street through the soles of his boots and keeps them very thin for that purpose .         hmm .  there are plenty of different surfaces  that   s true  but           you   re always so solemn about these things  havelock .  not at all like your late father .  think   mythologically .  he can read the street .  he can hear its voice  take its temperature  read its mind  it talks to him through his boots .  policemen are just as superstitious as other people .  every other watch house was attacked tonight .  oh  swing   s people egged it on  but it was malice and stupidity that did the most damage .  but not in treacle mine road .  no .  keel opened the doors and let the street inside .  i wish i knew more about him .  i   m told that in pseudopolis he was considered to be slow  thoughtful  sensible .  he certainly seems to have bloomed here .         i inhumed a man who attempted to nip him in the bud .         really .  that doesn   t sound like swing .  how much do i owe you .      the young man called havelock gave a shrug .     call it a dollar     he said .      that   s very cheap .         he wasn   t worth more .  i should warn you  though .  soon you may want me to deal with keel .         surely someone like him wouldn   t side with people like winder and swing .         he   s a side all by himself .  he is a complication .  you may think it best if he   ceased to complicate .      the rattling of the coach underlined the silence this remark caused .  it was moving through a richer part of the city now  where there was more light and the curfew  being for poorer people  was less rigorously observed .  the figure opposite the assassin stroked the cat on her lap .      no .  he   ll serve some purpose     said madam .     everyone is telling me about keel .  in a world where we all move in curves he proceeds in a straight line .  and going straight in a world of curves makes things happen .      she stroked the cat .  it yowled softly .  it was ginger and had an expression of astonishing smugness  although periodically it scratched at its collar .      on a different subject     she said .     what was that business with the book .  i did not like to take too much notice .         oh  it was an extremely rare volume i was able to track down .  on the nature of concealment .         that stupid hulk of a boy burned it .         yes .  that was a piece of luck .  i was afraid he might try to read it  although     havelock smiled wanly     someone would have had to help him with the longer words .         was it valuable .         priceless .  especially now that it has been destroyed .         ah .  it contained information of value .  possibly involving the color dark green .  will you tell me .         i could tell you .     havelock smiled again .     but then i would have to find someone to pay me to kill you .         then don   t tell me .  but i do think dog botherer is an unpleasant nickname .         when your name is vetinari  madam  you   re happy enough if it   s merely dog botherer .  can you drop me off a little way from the guild  please .  i   ll go in via the roof .  i have a tiger to attend to before i go up to   you know .         a tiger .  how exciting .     she stroked the cat again .     you   ve found your way in yet .      vetinari shrugged .     i   ve known my way for years  madam .  but now he has half a regiment around the palace  with irregular patrols and spot checks .  i can   t get through them .  only let me get inside  please  and the men there are no problem .      the cat pawed at its collar .      is it possible that he is allergic to diamonds .     said madam .  she held up the cat .     is oo allergic to diamonds  den .      havelock sighed  but inwardly  because he respected his aunt .  he just wished she was a bit more sensible about cats .  he felt instinctively that if you were going to fondle a cat while discussing matters of intrigue  then it should be a long haired white one .  it shouldn   t be an elderly street tom with irregular bouts of flatulence .      what about the sergeant .     he said  shifting along the seat as politely as possible .   the lady all in lilac lowered the cat gently onto the seat .  there was a distressing smell .      i think i should meet mr .  keel as soon as possible     she said .     perhaps he can be harnessed .  the party is tomorrow night .  uh   do you mind opening the window .          a little later that night  downey was walking unsteadily back to his study after a convivial time in the prefects    common room  when he noticed that a torch had gone out .   with a swiftness that might have surprised someone who saw no further than his flushed face and unsteady walk  he pulled out a dagger and scanned the corridor .  he glanced up at the ceiling  too .  there were gray shadows everywhere  but nothing more than that .  sometimes  torches did go out all by themselves .   he stepped forward .   when he woke up in his bed next morning  he put the headache down to some bad brandy .  and some scag had painted orange and black stripes on his face .       it started to rain again .  vimes liked the rain .  street crime went down when it rained .  people stayed indoors .  some of the best nights of his career had been rainy  when he   d stood in the shadows in the lee of some building  head tucked in so that there was barely anything showing between his helmet and his collar  and listened to the silvery rustle of the rain .   once he   d been standing so quietly  so withdrawn  so not there that a fleeing robber  who   d evaded his pursuers  had leaned against him to catch his breath .  and  when vimes put his arms around him and whispered    gotcha .     into his ear  the man apparently did in his trousers what his dear mother  some forty years before  had very patiently taught him not to do .   the people had gone home .  the sewn up gappy had been escorted to old cobblers  where fred colon patiently explained events to the man   s parents  with his round red face radiating honesty .  lawn was possibly getting some use out of his bed .   and the rain gurgled in the downpipes and gushed from the gargoyles and swirled in the gutters and deadened all sound .   useful stuff  rain .   vimes picked up a bottle of mrs .  arbiter   s best ginger beer .  he remembered it .  it was gassy as hell and therefore hugely popular .  a young boy could  with encouragement and training  eventually manage to belch the whole first verse of the national anthem after just one swig .  this is an important social skill when you   re eight years old .   he   d chosen colon and waddy for this task .  he wasn   t going to involve young sam .  it wasn   t that what he was planning was illegal  as such  it was just that it had the same color and smell as something illegal  and vimes didn   t want to have to explain .   the cells were old  much older than the building above them .  the iron cages were fairly new  and didn   t take up all the space .  there were other cellars beyond an arch  containing nothing more than rats and rubbish but   and that was important   they couldn   t be seen from the cages .   vimes got the men to carry the dead bowman through .  nothing wrong with that .  it was the middle of the night  filthy weather  no sense in waking up the people at the mortuary when there was a nice cold cellar .   he watched through the spy hole in the door as the body was taken past the cells .  it caused a certain stir  especially in the first man he   d brought in .  the other two had the look of men who   d seen a lot of bad stuff in the name of making money  if they were hired to steal or murder or be a copper it was all the same to them  and they   d learned not to react too readily to deaths that were not their own .   the first man  though  was getting nervous .   vimes had nicknamed him ferret .  he was the best dressed of the three  all in black  the dagger had been expensive  and  vimes had noticed  he had a silver death   s head ring on one finger .  the other two had dressed nondescript and their weapons had been workmanlike  nothing much to look at but well used .   no real assassin would wear jewelry at work .  it was dangerous and it shone .  but ferret wanted to be a big man .  he probably checked himself in the mirror before he went out  to make sure he looked cool .  he was the sort of little twerp that got a kick out of showing his dagger to women in bars .   ferret  in short  had big dreams .  ferret had an imagination .   well  that was fine .   the watchmen returned and picked up the packages vimes had prepared .      remember  we do it fast     he said .     they   re worried  they   re tired  no one   s come for them  and they   ve just seen a very dead colleague .  we don   t want to give the first two time to think .  understand .      they nodded .      and we leave the little one until last .  i want him to have lots of time            ferret was considering his prospects .  regrettably  this didn   t take long .   he   d already had a row with the other two .  some rescue team they   d been .  they weren   t even dressed right .  but the brownjobs hadn   t done things as per spec .  everyone knew they backed away .  they weren   t supposed to fight back or show any kind of intelligence .  they     the main cell door was flung back .      it   s ginger beer time .     roared someone .   and a watchman ran through with a box of bottles  and disappeared into the rooms beyond .   there wasn   t much light in here .  ferret cowered against the wall and saw two watchmen unlock the cell next door  drag the shackled occupant upright and out into the corridor and then hustle him around the corner .   the voices had a slight echo .      hold him down .  mind his legs .         right .  let   s have the bottle .  give it a proper shake  otherwise it won   t work .         okay  friend .  anything you want to tell us .  your name .  no .  well  it   s like this .  right now  we don   t care a whole lot if you talk or not        there was a loud pop  a hiss  and then   a scream  an explosion of agony .   after it had died away  the trembling ferret heard someone say     quick  get the next one  before the captain catches us .      he cringed back as two watchmen rushed into the next cell  dragged out the struggling prisoner  and hustled him into the darkness .      all right .  one chance .  are you going to talk .  yes .  no .  too late .      once again the pop  once again the hiss  once again the scream .  it was louder and longer this time  and ended in a kind of bubbling sound .   ferret crouched against the wall  fingers in his mouth .   around the corner  sitting in the light of one lantern  colon nudged vimes  wrinkled his nose  and pointed down .   there was a gully that ran between all the cells  as a primitive sop to hygiene .  now a thin trickle was inching its way along it .  ferret was nervous .   gotcha  thought vimes .  but a good imagination needs a little more time .  he leaned forward  and the other two moved closer expectantly .      so     he said in a low whisper     have you boys had your holidays yet .      after a few minutes of very small talk he stood up  strode around to the last occupied cell  unlocked the door  and grabbed ferret  who was trying to squeeze into a corner .      no .  please .  i   ll tell you whatever you want to know .     the man yelled .      really .     said vimes .     what   s the orbital velocity of the moon .         what .         oh  you   d like something simpler .     said vimes  dragging the man out of the cell .     fred .  waddy .  he wants to talk .  bring a notebook .      it took half an hour .  fred colon wasn   t a fast writer .  and when the painful sound of his efforts concluded with the stab of his last full stop  vimes said     okay  sir .  and now you write down at the end  i  gerald leastways  currently staying at the young men   s pagan association  am making this statement of my own free will and not under duress .  and then you sign it .  or else .  got it .         yes  sir .      the initials gl had been inscribed on the dagger .  vimes believed them .  he met plenty of leastwayses in his career  and they tended to spill their guts at the mere thought of spilling their guts .  and when they did  you got everything .  anyone who had seen the ginger beer trick used on someone else would confess to anything .      well  now     he said cheerfully  standing up .     thank you for your cooperation .  want a lift to cable street .      ferret   s expression  if not his mouth  said    huh .         we   ve got to drop off your friends     vimes went on  raising his voice slightly .     todzy and muffer .  we   ll drop the dead one off at the mortuary .  just a bit of paperwork for you .     he nodded at colon .     one copy of your helpful statement .  one certificate of death from the pox doctor for the late mystery man  and rest assured we   ll try to track down his murderer .  a chitty from mossy about the ointment he put on muffer   s feet .  oh   and a receipt for six bottles of ginger beer .      he put a hand on ferret   s shoulder and gently walked him around into the next cellar  where todzy and muffer were sitting gagged  bound and livid with rage .  on a table nearby was a box containing six bottles of ginger beer .  the corks were heavily wired down .   ferret stared at vimes  who inserted a finger in his mouth  blew up his cheeks and flicked out the finger with a loud pop .   waddy hissed between his teeth .   fred colon opened his mouth but vimes clamped his hand over it .      no  don   t     he said .     funny thing  gerald  but fred here just screams out loud at times for no reason at all .         you tricked me .     ferret wailed .   vimes patted him on the shoulder .      trick .     he growled .     how so  gerald .         you made me think you were doing the ginger beer trick .         ginger beer trick .     said vimes  his brow wrinkling .     what   s that .         you know .  you brought the stuff down here .         we don   t drink alcohol on duty  gerald .  what   s wrong with a little ginger beer .  we don   t know any tricks with the stuff  gerald .  what tricks do you know .  seen any good tricks lately  gerald .  do tell .      at last it dawned on the ferret that he should stop talking .  it was about half an hour too late .  the expressions on what could be seen of the faces of todzy and muffer suggested that they wanted a very personal word with him .      i demand protective custody     he managed .          just when i   m letting you go  gerald .     said vimes .     as you said in your statement   what was it  fred .  something about just obeying orders .  all that stuff about mixing with the mobs and throwing things at coppers and soldiers  you didn   t want to do that  i know .  you didn   t like being round in cable street watching people being beaten up and being told what to confess to     cos it   s plain to me that you   re not that sort .  you   re small fry  i understand that .  i say we   ll call it quits  how about you .         please .  i   ll tell you all i know .     ferret squeaked .      you mean you haven   t .     vimes roared .  he spun around and grabbed a bottle .      yes .  no .  i mean  if i sit quiet i   m sure i   ll remember some more .      vimes held his gaze for a moment  and then dropped the bottle back in the crate .      all right     he said .     it   ll be a dollar a day  meals extra .         right you are  sir .      vimes watched ferret scuttle back into his cell and shut the door behind him .  vimes turned to fred and waddy .      go and wake up marilyn     he said .     let   s deliver the other three .          the rain was falling steadily and a thin mist filled cable street .   the wagon came out of nowhere .  fred had urged marilyn into something approaching a canter down the street  and when the horse came around the corner she was trying to keep ahead of the heavy  rumbling cart behind .   as the hurry up wagon passed the station  the rear door was flung open and two bodies tumbled out onto the wet cobbles .   the guards rushed forward .  one or two of them fired after the retreating cart  and the arrows clattered harmlessly off the black iron strips .   the other men approached the tied up bodies with some care .  there were groans  punctuated by swearwords .  and  pinned to one man  some paperwork .   they read the note .  they did not laugh .       vimes unharnessed the old horse  rubbed her down  and checked on her feed .  perhaps it was his imagination  but the feed bins seemed to be filling up in the last day or two .  guilty consciences were at work  maybe .   then he walked out into the cool night air .  the lights were on in the watch house .  it was a beacon  now that the street lamps had been doused .  beyond the walls of the yard the real night had closed in  the old night with its tendrils of fog and crawling shadows .  he relaxed and wore it like an overcoat .   a shadow near the gate was deeper than it ought to be .   he felt for his cigar case again  cursed  and pulled a cigar out of his shirtsleeve .  he cupped his hands when he lit it  but kept his eyes tight shut to hold the night vision .   then he looked up and blew a smoke ring .  yes .  everyone thought black didn   t show up at night .  they were wrong .   he walked over to shut the gate and then pulled out his sword in one fluid movement .   sadie raised her head  revealing a pale oval of a face in the depths of her bonnet .      good morning  kind sir     she said .      good morning  sadie     said vimes wearily .     to what do i owe this pleasure .         madam wants to see you  kind sir .         if you mean rosie  i   ve been a bit busy        dotsie   s handbag hit him on the back of the head .      madam doesn   t like waiting  dearie    were the last words he heard before night closed in all the way .       the aunts were experts .  probably not even mossy lawn could turn someone off with such precision .   vimes drifted awake .  he was in an armchair .  it was extremely comfortable .  and someone was shaking him .   it was sandra the real seamstress .  she stared at him and then said     he looks okay       then she stepped back  sat down in another chair  and aimed a crossbow at vimes .      you know     said vimes   it really was a comfortable chair  and reminded him of the softness that had gone from his life in the past few days  it hadn   t been all bad      if someone wants to talk to me  they only have to bloody well ask .         sadie said you   d only be out for ten minutes  but then you started to snore  so we thought we   d let you sleep for a while     said rosie palm  stepping into view .  she was wearing a red  off the shoulder evening dress  an impressively large wig  and quite a lot of jewelry .      yes  it costs a lot of money to look as cheap as this  sergeant     she said  catching his expression .     i can   t stop  i must go and talk to people .  now  if you           snapcase has promised you ladies that you   ll be allowed to form a guild  right .     said vimes .  it was another cheating move  but he was fed up with waking up in odd places .     yes  i thought so .  and you believe him .  it   s not going to happen .  when he   s the patrician  he   ll look right through you .      he   ll end up looking through everyone  he added to himself .  mad lord snapcase .  just another winder  but with fancier waistcoats and more chins .  same cronyism  same piggy ways  same stupid arrogance  one more leech in a line of leeches that   d make vetinari seem like a breath of clean air .  ha   vetinari .  yes  he   d be around here somewhere too  no doubt  learning that little expression he had  which never  ever gave you a clue what he was thinking   but he   ll give you the guild you want so much .      don   t expect anything from snapcase     he said aloud .     remember  there were people who thought winder was the future  too .      he derived some minor pleasure from seeing the look on rosie palm   s face .  at last she said     give him a drink  sandra .  if he moves  shoot an eye out .  i   ll let madam know .         do you expect me to believe that she   ll fire that .     said vimes .      sandra has a very useful streak of belligerence     said rosie .     a gentleman was being   impolite yesterday  and she came running in and   you   d be surprised at what she did with her mushroom .      vimes eyed the crossbow .  the girl had a very steady hand .      i don   t think i quite under       he began .      it   s a wooden thing to make it easier to darn socks     said sandra .     i hit him behind the ear with it .      vimes gave her a blank look for a while and then said     fine .  fine .  i   m sitting very still  believe me .         good     said rosie .   she swept out  and it was a real sweep  the dress brushing the ground .  there were big  expensive double doors .  when she opened them  the noise of a meeting filled the room .  there was conversation  the smell of cigar smoke and alcohol  and a voice said       to change the dominant episteme       before the doors breathed shut .   vimes stayed seated .  he was getting attached to the chair  and on current showing someone was likely to hit him again soon .   sandra  still holding the bow  placed a very large glass of whiskey beside him .      you know     he said     in times to come people will wonder how all those weapons got smuggled around the city .         i   m sure i don   t know what you   re talking about .         and it   s because the lads in the watch never bother about the seamstresses  curfew or no curfew     said vimes  staring at the whiskey .     or posh coaches     he added .     a watchman can get into real trouble if he tries that .     he could smell the stuff from here .  it was the good stuff from the mountains  not the local rubbish .      you didn   t tell anyone about the basket     said sandra .     or hand us over to the unmentionables .  are you one of us .         i doubt it .         but you don   t know who we are .         i still doubt it .      and then he was aware of the doors opening and shutting  and the rustle of a long dress .      sergeant keel .  i   ve heard so much about you .  please leave us  sandra .  i   m sure the good sergeant can be trusted with a lady .      madam was only a little shorter than vimes .  could be from genua  he thought  or spent a lot of time there .  trace of it in the accent .  brown eyes  brown hair   but a woman   s hair could be any color tomorrow   and a purple dress that looked more expensive than most .  and an expression that said quite clearly that the owner knew what was going to happen and was going along with things just to make sure        don   t forget the intricately painted fingernails     she said .     but if you   re trying to guess my weight  don   t expect to get any help from me .  you can call me madam .      she sat down in a chair opposite him  put her hands together and stared at him over the top of them .      who are you working for .     she said .      i   m an officer of the city watch     said vimes .     brought here under duress   madam .      the woman waved a hand .     you   re free to go whenever you wish .         it   s a comfy chair     said vimes .  he   d be damned if he   d be dismissed .     are you really from genua .         are you really from pseudopolis .     madam smiled at him .     i find  personally  that it never pays to be from somewhere close at hand .  it makes life so much easier .  but i have spent a lot of time in genua  where i have   business interests .     she smiled at him .     and now you   re thinking    old seamstress     no doubt .         actually  i was thinking    bespoke tailoring        said vimes  and she burst out laughing .     but mostly     he added     i was thinking    revolutionary .            continue  sergeant .     madam stood up .     do you mind if i have some champagne .  i   d offer you some  but i understand that you don   t drink .      vimes glanced at the brimming whiskey glass beside him .      we were just checking     said madam  hauling a large bottle out of an industrial capacity ice bucket .      you   re not a sergeant .  rosie was right .  you   ve been an officer .  more than just any old officer  too .  you   re so composed  sergeant keel .  here you are  in a big house  in a lady   s boudoir  with a woman of uneasy virtue     madam upended the bottle into what appeared to be a blue mug with a teddy bear on it     and you appear unfussed .  where are you from .  you may smoke  by the way .         somewhere a long way off     said vimes .      uberwald .         no .         i have   business interests in uberwald     said madam .     alas  the situation there is becoming quite unstable .         right .  i see     said vimes .     and you   d like to have the significant pause type of business interests in ankh morpork  i expect .  if it can be stabilized .         very good .  let us say that i think this city has a wonderful future and that i would like to be part of it  and that you are remarkably perspicacious .         no     said vimes .     i   m very simple .  i just know how things work .  i just follow the money .  winder is a madman  and that   s not good for business .  his cronies are criminals  and that   s not good for business .  a new patrician will need new friends  farsighted people who want to be part of a wonderful future .  one that   s good for business .  that   s how it goes .  meetings in rooms .  a little diplomacy  a little give and take  a promise here  an understanding there .  that   s how real revolutions happen .  all that stuff in the streets is just froth       vimes nodded to the doors .     guests for a late supper .  that was doctor follett   s voice .  a clever man  they used to   they call him .  he   ll pick the right side .  if you   ve got the big guilds with you  winder is a dead man walking .  but snapcase won   t do you much good .         many people have great hopes of him .         what do you think .         i think he   s a scheming  self serving fool .  but he   s the best there is  at the moment .  and where do you come in  sergeant .         me .  i   m staying outside .  you   ve got nothing that i want .         you don   t want anything .         i want lots of things  my lady .  but you can   t give them to me .         how would you like to be back in command .      the question hit him like a hammer .  this was history .  she couldn   t know .  how could she know .      ah     said madam  who had watched his expression .     rosemary did say thieves took some very expensive armor off you .  fit for a general  i hear .      she glanced at vimes as she opened another bottle .  properly  too  vimes noticed through the shock .  none of that amateur business with rocketing corks and wasted bubbles .      wouldn   t that be strange if it was true     madam mused .     a street fighting man with the manner of a commander and the breastplate of a leader .      vimes stared straight ahead .      and who needs to know how he got here .     said madam to the air in general .     we could take the view that here at last is a man who could truly take command of the city watch .      the first thought that fizzed in vimes   s head like champagne was  bloody hell  i could do it .  chuck swing out on his arse  promote some decent sergeants     the second thought was  in this city .  under snapcase .  now .  we   d just be another gang .  the third thought was  this is insane .  it can   t happen .  it never did happen .  you want to go home to sybil .   thoughts one and two shuffled out of the way  feeling ashamed of themselves and mumbling yeah  right   sybil   yeah  obviously   right   sorry    until they faded into silence .      i   ve always had a talent for seeing promise     said madam while he still stared at nothing .   the fourth thought rose in the darkness like some ugly creature from the abyss .   you didn   t think about sybil until thought three  it whispered .   he blinked .      you know the city needs       madam began .      i want to go home     said vimes .     i   m going to finish the job that   s in front of me  and then i   m going home .  that   s what i   m going to do .         there are those that would say that if you are not for us  you   re against us     said madam .      for you .  for what .  for anything .  no .  but i   m not for winder  either .  i   m not supposed to be    for    people .  and i don   t take bribes .  not even if sandra threatens me with a toadstool .         i believe it was a mushroom .  oh dear .     the lady gave him a smile .     you are incorruptible .      oh dear  here were go again  thought vimes .  why did i wait until i was married to become strangely attractive to powerful women .  why didn   t it happen to me when i was sixteen .  i could have done with it then .   he tried to glare  but that probably only made it worse .      i   ve met a few incorruptible men     said madam meserole .     they tend to die horrible deaths .  the world balances out  you see .  a corrupt man in a good world  or a good man in a corrupt one   the equation comes out the same way .  the world does not deal well with those who don   t pick a side .         i like the middle     said vimes .      that gives you two enemies .  i   m amazed that you can afford so many  on a sergeant   s pay .  please think of what you could be giving up .         i am .  and i   m not going to help people to die just to replace one fool with another .         then there is your door behind you  sergeant .  i am very sorry we could not              do business .     said vimes .      i was going to say    reach a mutually beneficial agreement .     we are not very far from your watch house .  i wish you   luck .      she nodded toward the door .      such a shame     she said and sighed .       vimes stepped out into the rainy night and shifted his weight from foot to foot  and then took a few experimental steps .   corner of easy and treacle mine .  a mix of flat top cobbles and old bricks .  yeah .   he went home .       madam stared at the closed door for a while  and then turned as the candles flickered slightly .      you really are very good     she said .     how long have you been here .      havelock vetinari stepped out of the shadow in the corner .  he wasn   t wearing official assassin   s black but loose clothes that were   not real color at all  just nondescript shades of gray .      i   d been here quite long enough     he said  sprawling in the chair that vimes had vacated .      not even the aunts noticed you .         people look but don   t see .  the trick is to help them see nothing .  but i think keel would have seen me if i hadn   t been over here .  he stares into shadows .  interesting .         he is a very angry man     said madam .      you just made him angrier .         i believe you   ll get your diversion     said madam .      yes .  i believe so  too .      madam leaned over and patted him on the knee .      there     she said     your auntie thinks of everything       she stood up .     i   d better go and entertain my guests .  i am a very entertaining person .  by tomorrow night  lord winder will not have many friends .     she drained her mug of champagne .     doctor follett is such a charming man  don   t you think .  is that his own hair  do you know .         i have not sought the opportunity to find out     said havelock .     is he trying to get you drunk .         yes     said madam .     you have to admire him .         they say he can play a mean lute     said havelock .      fascinating     said madam .   she set her face into a genuine smile of pleasure and opened the big double doors at the other end of the room .      ah  doctor     she said  stepping into the haze of smoke .     a little more champagne .          vimes slept in a corner  standing up .  it was an old trick  shared by night watchmen and horses .  it wasn   t exactly sleep  you   d die if you tried to keep it up for more than a few nights  but it took some of the tiredness away .   a few of the other men had already mastered the trick .  others made use of tables or benches .  no one seemed inclined to go home  even when a sort of dawn suffused the rain and snouty came in with a cauldron of fearsome porridge .   vimes opened his eyes .      mug of tea  sarge .     said snouty .     stewed for a hour and two sugars .         you   re a lifesaver  snouty     said vimes  clasping it like the elixir of life .      an    there some kid outside says he   s got to speak to you  hnah  specially     snouty went on .     shall i give him a clip alongside the head .         what does he smell like .     said vimes  sipping the scalding  corrosive tea .      bottom of a baboon   s cage  sarge .         ah  nobby nobbs .  i   ll go out and see him .  bring him a big bowl of porridge  will you .      snouty looked uncomfortable about this .     if you   ll  hnah  take my advice  sarge  it don   t pay to encourage kids like           see these stripes  snouty .  well done .  a big bowl .      vimes took his tea out into the damp yard  where nobby was lurking against a wall .   there were hints that it was going to be a sunny day .  that should bring things on  after the overnight rain .  the lilacs  for example        what   s happening  nobby .      nobby waited a moment to see if a coin was forthcoming .      pretty bad everywhere  sarge     he said  giving up for now but remaining hopeful .     a constable got killed in lobbin clout .  hit by a stone  people say .  someone got their ear cut off    cos of the fighting in nap hill .  cavalry charge  sarge .  running fights everywhere .  all the watch houses got hit bad        vimes listened gloomily to the list .  it was the usual bloody business .  angry  frightened people on both sides  all crushed up together .  it could only get worse .  nap hill and dolly sisters sounded like war zones already     see the little angels rise up high        anything happen in cable street .     he said .      just a few people     said nobby .     a bit of shouting and running away  that sort of thing .         right     said vimes .  even a mob wasn   t that stupid .  it was still only the kids and the hotheads and the drunks now .  it   d get worse .  you   d have to be really mad to attack the unmentionables .      there   s bad stuff happening everywhere     said nobby .     except here  o   course .  we   re well out of it .      no  thought vimes .  it   ll pivot on us in the end .   snouty emerged from the watch house   s rear door  carrying a big bowl of porridge with a spoon stuck in it .  vimes nodded toward nobby  and the bowl was handed over with extreme reluctance .      sarge .     said snouty  keeping his eye on the spoon as the boy ate  or  more correctly  gobbled the stuff .      yes  snouty .         have we got any orders .         i don   t know .  is the captain here .         that   s it  sarge     said snouty .     a runner come last night with a envelope for the captain  and i took it up and there was the captain waiting  so i thought  this is funny  hnah  i thought  he   s not normally in this early           faster please  snouty     said vimes  as the man started to watch the oscillating spoon again .      well  when i took him up his cocoa later on he was jus    sittin    there  hnah  starin    right at nothing .  he said thank you  snouty    when i give him his cocoa  hnah  though .  always very polite in that  hnah  respect .  but when i went up just now he was gone .         he   s an old man  snouty  you can   t expect him to be here all           so   s his inkwell  sarge .  he never took it home before .     and vimes saw that snouty   s eyes were more redrimmed than usual .   he sighed .     any sign of the envelope .         no  sarge     said snouty  glancing again at the spoon in nobby   s hand .  it was a very cheap one  vimes noted  made of some pot metal .      in that case we just keep the peace  snouty     he said .      not a lot of that about  sarge .         we   ll have to see what we can find .  come with me .      snouty looked reluctant .     just want to keep an eye on the spoon  sarge  we   ve only got five left and kids like that one   ll pinch the           he can keep the damn spoon .     said vimes .     spoons are not important at this point .      nobby downed the last scalding mouthful  stuck the spoon in his pocket  stuck out a porridge laden tongue at snouty  dropped the bowl on the ground  and took to his heels .   vimes strode back into the office  picked up the porridge ladle  and rattled it on the sides of the empty cauldron .  heads looked up .      all right  my sons .  this is what we   re going to do .  all married men   ve got permission to nip home for an hour to stop your wives fretting .  the rest of you  you   re on unpaid overtime .  anyone surprised .      wiglet raised a hand .      we   ve all got family  sarge     he said .      and the best thing you can do for them is make sure there   s a bit of law around the place     said vimes .     we don   t know what   s been happening in the other divisions  except that it sounds bad .  so this house is staying open  understand .  day and night .  yes  lance constable .         but our mum will be worrying  sarge     said young sam .   vimes hesitated  but only for a moment .     snouty   ll nip out with any messages you have  lad .  the same goes for everyone else     he said .     we   re going out on patrol soon .  yeah  i know we   re night watch .  so what .  it   s looking pretty black to me at the moment .  lance constable  come on out in the yard  will you .      vimes walked back out into the morning .   in theory  one of the uses of the yard was for training .  it was seldom used for that .  the night watch eschewed violence  as a rule .  when threats or superior numbers had no effect  they preferred to run .   there were some mouldering targets in a shed  along with some straw men for stabbing practice .  vimes tugged them out onto the cobbles as the lance constable appeared behind him .      i thought you said these things were useless  sarge .         they are     said vimes .     i   ve put them here for you to land on .  you   re walking around  sam  with a weapon you don   t know how to use .  that   s worse than walking around knowing how to use a weapon and not having one .  a man with a weapon he doesn   t know how to use is likely to have it shoved where the sun does not shine .      he took off his breastplate and helmet  and tossed his sword belt into a corner .      all right  attack me     he said .  out of the corner of his eye he saw that some of the men had wandered into the yard and were watching .      i can   t just stab you  sarge .     sam wailed .      no  but i   d like you to try .      sam hesitated again .  i wasn   t entirely stupid  vimes thought .      you   re grinning  sarge .         well .         you   re just grinning and standing there  sarge     said sam .     i know i   m going to get a hiding     cos you haven   t got a sword and you   re grinning .         worried about getting blood on your nice sword  lad .  all right  throw it away .  feel better .  you were in a gang  right .  of course you were .  everyone was .  you   re still alive .  so you must   ve learned how to fight .         yeah  sarge  but that was  you know  dirty fighting           we   re dirty people .  do your worst .         i don   t want to hurt you  sarge .         that   s your first mistake        sam spun and lashed out .   vimes stepped back  caught the foot  and helped it on its journey upward .   i was quick  too  he thought  as sam landed flat on his back .  and not too bad at cunning .  but i   ve learned artful since then .      it showed in your eyes     he said .     but you   ve got hold of the basic idea .  there   s no rules .      he sensed the change behind him .  it included the very muffled sound of a chuckle .  he glanced back at the fallen sam  who was looking past him .   the blow was a neat one  to the back of where the head would have been if vimes hadn   t stepped smartly sideways .  as it was  he turned and grabbed the arm and looked into the face of ned coates .      nice day off  ned .     he said .      yes  sarge  thank you .  just wanted to see how good you were .      he elbowed vimes in the stomach and twisted away .  there was some murmuring from the watchers but vimes  bent double and with tears running from his eyes  raised a hand .      no  it was fair enough  fair enough     he panted .     we   ve all got something to learn .     he put his hands on his knees  wheezing a little more theatrically than he needed to .   he was impressed that ned wasn   t falling for it .  the man kept his distance  circling slowly .  he was holding his truncheon .  a less experienced fighter would have come to check that ol    sarge was all right  and would have suffered for it .      that   s right  sarge     said ned .     i want to see what you can teach me .  sam   s too trusting .      vimes   s mind riffled desperately through options .      so  sarge     said ned  still moving     what would you do  sarge  if you were unarmed and a man came at you with a truncheon .      get armed quick  thought vimes  if i thought he was as good as you .   he ducked and rolled .  ned missed that .  when vimes started to move right he   d concentrated on the left  on the basis that from someone like vimes the first move had to be a feint .  by the time he caught on and turned  vimes had grabbed his scabbard and was rising  sword sliding out .      ah  raising the stakes .  good lesson  sarge     said ned .  he drew his own sword .  it gleamed  most of the watch swords would have had difficulty cutting butter .     now we   re level again .  what next  sarge .      they circled .  blimey  thought vimes  who taught him .  and he   s grinning  and no wonder .  this isn   t a contest .  he knows i can   t cut him  not like this  not in front of everyone .  he can accidentally get me and get away with it  but a sergeant   s supposed to know better .  and we can   t raise the stakes any higher .   hold on     he hurled the sword at the wall .  it stuck in  by sheer luck .  that impressed the watchers .      got to give you a chance  ned     he said  moving away .   you can always learn  vimes thought .  he remembered gussie two grins .  sam wouldn   t run into him for five years or so .  it would be a real education .  two grins was the dirtiest fighter vimes had ever met .  anything was a weapon  anything was a target .  two grins was a kind of genius in that limited area .  he could see the weapon in anything   a wall  a cloth  a piece of fruit     he wasn   t even a big man .  he was small and wiry .  but he liked fighting big men  on the basis that there was more of them to bite .  after a few drinks  though  it was hard to know what two grins was fighting .  he   d fight the man next to him simply as a substitute for kneeing the whole universe in the groin .   he   d been called two grins ever since someone glassed him in the face  gussie had been so marinated in adrenaline at that point that he regarded this a mere detail .  the scar had left a happy smiley face .  sam had learned a lot from gussie two grins .      what   s this about .     he murmured  just loud enough for ned to hear .      just want to find out what you know  sarge     said ned  still circling .     seems to me you know too much .      he lunged .  vimes darted back  flailed with the scabbard like a man with no hope  and  as ned laughed and leaned out of his way  shifted his grip on the stiff leather .      i   ve got the helmet on  as per regulations     said ned .     and the armor .  hard to punch me out  sarge .      even with detritus yelling at them  not one watchman in seven really used a sword properly .  ned did .  there weren   t many openings .   oh  well   time for artful .   vimes took a step back  stopped  and saw what was happening behind coates .  he tried to hide it  but he couldn   t stop the momentary flash of relief in his eyes .   coates couldn   t stop the momentary flicker of attention .   vimes punched up  the scabbard an extension of his arm .  the stiff leather caught the man under the chin  thrusting his head back .  then the leather was brought down on the sword hand  and  as an afterthought  vimes kicked ned on the shin just enough to make him collapse .  he always had an allergy to edged weapons too near his face .      well done  nice try     he said and turned his back and faced the crowd .  to the sound of gurgling behind him  he said     anything   s a weapon  used right .  your bell is a club .  anything that pokes the other man hard enough to give you more time is a good thing .  never  ever threaten anyone with your sword unless you really mean it  because if he calls your bluff you suddenly don   t have many choices and they   re all the wrong ones .  don   t be frightened to use what you learned when you were kids .  we don   t get marks for playing fair .  and for close up fighting  as your senior sergeant i explicitly forbid you to investigate the range of coshes  blackjacks  and brass knuckles sold by mrs .  goodbody at no .    easy street at a range of prices to suit all pockets  and should any of you approach me privately i absolutely will not demonstrate a variety of specialist blows suitable for these useful yet tricky instruments .  right  let   s limber up .  i want you all out here with your truncheons in two minutes .  you think it   s just a silly club .  i will show you otherwise .  jump to it .      he turned to the stricken ned  who   d raised himself to a sitting position .      nice moves  mr .  coates .  you didn   t learn them in the watch  i know that .  anything we need to discuss .  care to tell me where you were last night .  morphic street  maybe .         day off     muttered ned  rubbing his jaw .      right  right .  none of my business .  seems to me we   ve failed to hit it off  ned .         s   right .         you think i   m some kind of spy .         i know you   re not john keel .      vimes kept his face perfectly impassive   which was  he realized  a complete giveaway in itself .      why d   you say that .     he said .      i don   t have to tell you .  you ain   t a watch sergeant  either .  and you were lucky just now  and that   s all i   m saying .     ned got to his feet as the other watchmen filed out into the yard again .   vimes let him go and turned his attention to the men .   none of them had ever been taught anything .  they   d learned  to a greater or  usually  lesser extent  from one another .  and vimes knew where that road went .  on that road coppers rolled drunks for their small change and assured one another that bribes were just perks  and it got worse .   he was all for getting recruits out on the street  but you had to train them first .  you needed someone like detritus bellowing at them for six weeks  and lectures about duty and prisoners    rights and the    service to the public .     and then you could hand them over to the street monsters who told them all the other stuff  like how to hit someone where it wouldn   t leave a mark  and when it was a good idea to do so .   and if you were lucky and they were sensible  they found somewhere between impossible perfection and the pit  where they could be real coppers   slightly tarnished  because the job did that to you  but not rotten .   he formed them into twos and set them attacking and defending .  it was dreadful to watch .  he let it go on for five minutes .      all right  all right     he said  clapping his hands .     very good indeed .  when the circus comes to town i   ll definitely recommend you .     the men sagged  and grinned sheepishly as he went on     don   t you know any of the moves .  the throat slam  the red hot poker  the rib rattler .  say i   m coming at you with a big  big club   what do you do .         run away  sarge     said wiglet .  there was laughter .      how far can you run .     said vimes .     got to fight sometime .  lance corporal coates .      ned coates had not been taking part .  he   d been leaning against the wall in a sort of stationary swagger  watching the sad show with disdain .      sarge .     he said  propelling himself up with the minimum of effort .      show wiglet how it   s done .      coates pulled out his truncheon .  it was  vimes saw  custom made  slightly longer than the general issue .  coates took up station in front of the constable  with his back very expressively toward vimes .      what do you want me to do  sarge .     he said over his shoulder .      show him a few decent moves .  take him by surprise .         right you are  sarge .      vimes watched the desultory clatter of sticks .  one  two  three        and around ned came  truncheon whistling through the air .   but vimes ducked under the blow and caught the man   s arm in both hands  twisting it up behind his back and bringing his ear into immediate conjunction with vimes   s mouth .      not quite unexpected  sunshine     he whispered .     now  we   ll both keep grinning because the lads are laughing at our ned  isn   t he a card  who keeps having another go at the ol    sarge  and we don   t want to spoil their fun .  i   m letting you go now  but you try it on one more time and you   ll have to use both hands to pick up a spoon and you   ll need to pick up a spoon  ned     cos of living off soup by reason of having no damn teeth .     he relaxed his grip .     who taught you all this stuff  anyway .         sergeant keel  sarge     said ned .      you   re doing a good job  sergeant keel .      vimes turned to see captain swing advancing across the yard  while some unmentionables lurked at the back gates .   swing was smaller and slimmer in daylight  and he looked like a clerk  and a clerk who was only erratically careful about his appearance  his hair was lank  and the thick black strands plastered across a central bald spot suggested that the man had either no mirror or completely lacked a sense of humor .   his coat  in the light  was old fashioned but well cared for  but his buckled shoes were scuffed and generally downtrodden .  vimes   s mother would have had something to say about that .  a man ought to look after his boots  she always said .  you could tell a man by the shine of his shoes .   swing also carried a walking stick  or  rather  an opera cane .  it was just possible that he thought it made him look sophisticated rather than  say  like a man carrying an unnecessary length of wood .  it was certainly a swordstick  because it rattled when it hit the pavement  and it did so now as he primly picked his way through the old targets and straw debris .      keeping the menup to scratch  i see     he said .     very well done .  is your captain here .         i believe not     said vimes  letting coates go     sir .         ah .  well  perhaps you will give him this  sergeant keel .     swing gave him a faint smile .     you had a successfulnight   i am given to understand .         we had a few visitors     said vimes     sir .         ah  yes .  misplaced zeal .  it does not payto   underestimate you  sergeant .  you are a man of resource .  alas  the other houses were not so              resourceful .         ah .  yes .  i am afraid  sergeant  that some of my keener men feel you are anobstacle   to our very needful work .  i  onthecontrary   believe that you are a man of iron adherence to the law and  while this hasledto   elements of friction because of your lack of full understanding of the exigencies of the situation  i know that you are a man after my own heart .      vimes considered the anatomical choices .      that would be broadly correct  sir     he said     although i would not aspire that high .         capital .  i lookforwardto   our future cooperation  sergeant .  your new captain willundoubtedly   inform you of other matters as he sees fit .  good day .      swing swiveled and walked his jerky walk back to the gate .  his men turned to follow him but one of them  who was wearing a plaster cast on one arm  made a gesture .      morning  henry     said vimes .   he examined the letter .  it was quite thick  and had a big embossed seal .  but vimes had spent too much time in the company of bad men  and knew exactly what to do with a sealed envelope .   he also knew how to listen .  new captain .  so   it was starting .   the men were watching him .      they calling in more  hnah  soldiers  sarge .     said snouty .      i expect so     said vimes .      they gave captain tilden the push  didn   t they           yes .         he was a good captain .         yes     said vimes .  no  he thought .  he wasn   t .  he was a decent man and he did his best  that   s all .  he   s well out of it now .      what   re we gonna do now  sarge .     said lance constable vimes .      we   ll patrol     said vimes .     close in .  just these few streets .         what good   ll that do .         more good than if we didn   t  lad .  didn   t you take the oath when you joined up .         what oath  sarge .      he didn   t  vimes remembered .  a lot of them hadn   t .  you just got your uniform and your bell and you were a member of the night watch .   a few years ago vimes wouldn   t have bothered about the oath either .  the words were out of date  and the shilling on a string was a joke .  but you needed something more than the wages  even in the night watch .  you needed something else to tell you that it wasn   t just a job .      snouty  nip up to the captain   s office and get the shilling  will you .     said vimes .     let   s get this lot sworn in .  and where   s sergeant knock .         pushed off  sarge     said wiglet .     dunno if it helps  but he said    to hell with him    when he went out the door .      vimes counted heads .   it would be said later on that all the watch houses stayed on .  they hadn   t  of course .  some had slipped away  some hadn   t come back on duty at all .  but it was true about keel and the line .      okay  lads     he said     it   s like this .  we know what   s been going on .  i don   t know about you  but i don   t like it .  once you get troops on the streets  it   s only a matter of time before it goes bad .  some kid throws a stone  next minute there   s houses on fire and people getting killed .  what we   re going to do is keep the peace .  that   s our job .  we   re not going to be heroes  we   re just going to be   normal .  now     he shifted position     it might just be that someone will say we   re doing something wrong .  so i   m not going to order you .      he drew his sword and scratched a line across the mud and stones .      if you step over the line  then you   re in     he said .     if you don   t  then that   s fine .  you didn   t sign up for this and i doubt that there   ll be any medals  whatever happens .  i   ll just ask you to go  and the best of luck to you .      it was almost depressing how quickly lance constable vimes crossed the line .  fred colon came next  and waddy  and billy wiglet .  and spatchcock  cul weather  and moist  and leggy gaskin  and horace nancyball  and   curry  wasn   t it .    and evans  and pounce     a dozen crossed the line  the last few with the reluctance caused by a battle between peer pressure and a healthy regard for their skin .  a few others  more than vimes had hoped  evaporated at the back .   that left ned coates .  he crossed his arms .      you   re all bloody mad     he said .      we could use you  ned     said vimes .      i don   t want to die     said ned     and i don   t intend to .  this is stupid .  there   s not a dozen of you .  what can you do .  all that stuff about    keeping the peace      it   s rubbish  lads .  coppers do what they   re told by the men in charge .  it   s always like that .  what   ll you do when the new captain comes in  eh .  and who   re you doing this for .  the people .  they attacked the other houses  and what   s the night watch ever done to hurt them .         nothing     said vimes .      there you are  then .         i mean the watch did nothing  and that   s what hurt them     said vimes .      what could you do  then .  arrest winder .      vimes felt he was building a bridge of matchsticks over a yawning abyss  and now he could feel the chilly winds below him .   he   d arrested vetinari  back in the future .  admittedly the man had walked free  after what passed for the due process of law  but the city watch had bee   was going to be big enough and strong enough and well connected enough to actually arrest the ruler of the city .  how had they ever got to that stage .  how had he even dreamed that a bunch of coppers could slam the cell door on the boss .   well  perhaps it had started here .  lance constable vimes was watching him intently .      of course we can   t     he said     but we ought to be able to .  maybe one day we will .  if we can   t then the law isn   t the law  it   s just a way of keeping people down .         looks like you   ve woken up and smelled the cacky     said coates     because that   s exactly what you   re in .  sorry  lads  but you   re going to die .  that   s what   ll happen if you tangle with real soldiers .  remember dolly sisters the other night .  three dead and they weren   t even trying .         come on  ned  no one   s going to have a go at us if we   re just patroling     mumbled colon .      patroling for what .     said coates .     to keep the peace .  what   ll you do when there   s no peace left to keep .  well  i   m not going to stand around and watch you get killed .  i   m off .      he turned and strode out of the yard and into the watch house .  you bloody fool  you   re right  vimes thought .  i just wish you weren   t so right .      still with us  lads .     he said to the group caught behind the line .      that   s right  sarge .     said lance constable vimes .  the rest of the volunteers seemed slightly less certain .      are we gonna get killed .     said wiglet .      who said it   s going to come to a fight .     said vimes  watching coates   s retreating back .      wait a moment  i want a word with ned           got the shilling  sarge     snouty announced  advancing across the yard .     and the captain wants a word with you .         tell him i   ll be up in just a few           it   s the new captain     said snouty quickly .     he   s here already  hnah .  keen .  milit   ry .  not the patient type  sarge .      i used to have carrot and detritus and angua and cheery for this  vimes thought bitterly .  i   d say you do this  and you do that  and all i had to do was fret and deal with the soddin    politics        get fred to swear the men in     he said .     and tell the officer i   ll be with him shortly .      he ran through the watch house and out of the front door .  there were a lot of people in the street  more than usual .  it wasn   t a mob as such  but it was ankh morpork   s famous ur mob  the state you got just before a real mob happened .  it spread across the city like web and spider  and  when some triggering event happened  twanged its urgent message through the streets and thickened and tightened around the spot .  the dolly sisters massacre had got around and the numbers had grown in the telling .  vimes could sense the tension in the web .  it was just waiting for some idiot to do the wrong thing  and nature is bountiful where idiots are concerned .      coates .     he yelled .   to his surprise  the man stopped and turned .      yeah .         i know you   re with the revolutionaries .         you   re just guessing .         no  you had the password in your notebook .  the same one dibbler was passing out in pies .  you must know i was able to get into the lockers .  look  do you think you and dibbler   d still be walking around if i was a spy for swing .         sure .  you   re not after us  we can be mopped up later .  swing wants the leaders .      vimes stood back .     okay .  why haven   t you told the lads .         things are moving  that   s why .  it   s all starting     said ned .     who you are doesn   t matter anymore .  but you   re going to get the lads killed .  they   d have been on our side  if it wasn   t for you .  i was working on    em .  you know spatchcock always drops his sword on his foot and nancyball wets himself when he   s threatened and vimesy is simple  and now you   re going to stick    em all right in the middle and they   re gonna die .  and all for no reason .         why haven   t you told them .     vimes repeated .      maybe you   ve got friends in high places     ned snarled .   vimes glanced up at the rooftops .      have we finished .     said ned .      give me your badge     said vimes .      my what .         you   re quitting .  fair enough .  give me your badge .      coates recoiled as if he   d been stung .      blow that .         then leave the city     said vimes .     it   d be for your own good .         is that a threat .         not from me .  but here   s some advice  boy .  don   t put your trust in revolutions .  they always come around again .  that   s why they   re called revolutions .  people die  and nothing changes .  i   ll see you later .      he turned his back and hurried away  so that the man wouldn   t see his face .   okay .  now it was time .  it had to be now  or he   d burst like mr .  salciferous .  he had wanted to do this  hadn   t dared try it  because those monks could probably do a man a lot of no good if he crossed them  but it had all gone too far now     a sense of duty told him there was an officer waiting to see him .  he overruled it .  it was not in possession of all the facts .   vimes reached the entrance to the watch house and stopped .  he shut his eyes .  if anyone had bothered to look at him  they   d have seen a man apparently trying to grind two cigarette stubs into the road  one with each foot .   he thought with the brains in his feet .  as young sam had noticed  the feet had a memory of their own     rounded cathead cobbles  the usual kind .  they hadn   t been well set in this part of the city and moved very slightly underfoot   then twice before getting to the watch house his feet had felt larger cobbles  narrow bands of them  where the road surface had been replaced after drains had been laid .  and before that  there   d been a similar band but of soft brick rubble  so crushed by cartwheels that it was practically a gully .   a few dozen steps before that they   d twirled him round a few times  but the last surface before that had been   mud .   vimes  who had been walking with his eyes shut  bumped into a cart .   mud  he thought  getting up and ignoring the strange looks of passersby .  that meant an alley .  let   s see   ah  yes  over there     it took twenty minutes .   people turned as he walked through the streets  closing his eyes when he dared  so that his feet could see better .  sometimes he did look around  thought  and there it was again  the thunderstorm sensation of tensions building up  waiting for the first little thing .  people were uneasy   the herd was restless   and they didn   t quite know why .  everyone he looked at returned his gaze blankly .   he stepped onward .  rough flagstones between two stretches of the ancient cobbles they called trollheads   the only place where you got that in this part of the city was here  where pewter street crossed elm  and before that it had been   yeah  big stones  some of the most ancient in the city  rutted by hundreds and hundreds of years of iron bound cartwheels  that was a road that had been right behind a city wall   yes  he crossed the pitts  still on elm  and then lost his thread .  a metal grating on the pavement gave it back to him .  cellar grating .  cool cellar .  coat of arms on it  worn down .  buttermarket .  yeah .  go  feet .   the monks had turned him again here but   long bricks  hard fired in the kiln  and a stretch of quite modern flagstones  well dressed and fitted .  it could trick you if you didn   t know you were in   yeah  masons    road  and there were masons here and they looked after the surface .  now find an alley  mud but with a lot of gravel in it  because the stonemasons dumped their waste here but this one had occasional hummocks across it  where pipes had been laid .  yeah .  now find square head cobbles     he opened his eyes .   yeah .   away on his left was a block of three buildings .  a temple sandwiched between two cheapjack corner shops .  it was   just a temple  slightly foreign looking  but weren   t they all .  it looked high hublandish  where everyone lived on yaks or something .   the temple doors were locked .  he rattled the handle impotently  and then hammered on the woodwork with his sword .  it had no effect .  he didn   t even leave a mark on the wood .   but the door of the shonky shop next door was open .  it was a familiar place .  once upon a time  it was his tailor and bootmaker .  and  like a pawnshop  a shonky shop was always open .  vimes stepped inside and was immediately enveloped in dusty darkness .   it was a cave of cloth .  racks of old suits hung from the ceiling .  ancient shelves bent under piles of shirts and vests and socks .  here and there old boxes loomed in the gloom and caught his knees .  piles of derelict boots slipped and slid under his feet .  and there was the smell .  if poverty had a smell  this was it .  if humbled pride had a smell  this was it .  and there was a touch of disinfectant as well .   within a few feet of the door  vimes was already lost .  he turned and shoved his way through gray aisle after gray aisle of suffocating cloth and wondered if anyone had ever died in here and how anyone could ever find out .  he pulled aside a hanger containing a greasy  threadbare suit        you want .      he turned .   there was no one there  until his gaze fell slightly and met that of a small  glossy little man  totally bald  very small and thin  and wearing some vague clothing that presumably even a shonky shop hadn   t been able to unload on a customer .  who was he  who was he   surprisingly  the name seemed quite fresh in the memory        ah  er  yeah   mr .  shine           soon shine sun     said mr .  sun .  he grabbed the suit vimes was still holding .     good eye  good eye  lovely cloth  lovely cloth  owned by priest  very good  fifty pence to you  shame to sell it  times are hard .      vimes hastily put the suit back on the rack and pulled out his badge .  sun glared at it .      i pay already other copper     he said .     one dollar  one month  no trouble .  already i pay other copper .         pay .     said vimes .      two stripe copper already i pay .  one dollar  one month  no trouble .         corporal quirke     muttered vimes .     you don   t have to pay coppers  mr .  sun .  we   re here for your protection .      despite his barely basic grasp of the language  mr .  sun   s expression suggested very clearly that the three stripe  one crown copper in front of him had dropped in from the planet idiot .      look  i haven   t got time for this     said vimes .     where   s the back door .  this is watch business .         i pay .  i pay protection .  one month  no trouble .      vimes grunted and set off along another narrow  cloth lined tunnel .   a glint of glass caught his eye  and he sidled crabwise up a choked aisle until he found a counter .  it was piled with more hopeless merchandise  but there was a bead curtained doorway behind it .  he half clambered  half swam over the piles and scrambled into the tiny room beyond .   mr .  sun pushed his way to an ancient tailor   s dummy  it was so scratched  chipped  and battered it looked like something dug up from the volcanic ash of an ancient city .   he pulled on an arm  and the eyes lit up .      number three here     he said into its ear .     he   s just gone through .  and boy  is he angry        the back door was locked but yielded under the weight of vimes   s body .  he staggered into the yard  looked up at the wall separating this greasy space from the temple   s garden  jumped  scrabbled his boots on the brickwork  and dragged himself onto the wall  feeling a couple of bricks crumble away underneath him .   he landed on his back  and looked up at a thin robed figure sitting on a stone seat .      cup of tea  commander .     said sweeper cheerfully .      i don   t want any damn tea .     growled vimes  struggling to his feet .   sweeper dropped a lump of rancid yak butter in the tea bowl beside him .      what do you want  then  mister vimes with the very helpful feet .         i can   t deal with this .  you know what i mean .         you know  some tea really would calm you down     said sweeper .      don   t tell me to be calm .  when are you going to get me home .      a figure appeared next to vimes .  it was a taller  heavier man than sweeper  white haired and with a look of a good natured bank manager about him .  he held out a cup .   vimes hesitated a moment  and then took the cup and poured the tea out onto the ground .      i don   t trust you     he said .     there could be anything in this .         i can   t imagine what we could put in tea that would make it any worse than the way you normally drink it     said sweeper calmly .     sit down  your grace .  please .      vimes sagged onto the seat .  the rage that had been driving him sank a little  too  but he could feel it bubbling .  automatically  he pulled out a half smoked cigar and put it in his mouth .      sweeper said you   d find us  some way or other     said the other monk .     so much for secrecy .         why should you worry .     said vimes bitterly .     you can just play around with time and it won   t have happened  right .         we don   t intend to do that     said sweeper .      what could i do  anyway .  go around telling everyone that those loony monks you see in the streets are some kind of time shifters .  i   d get locked up .         this is qu     said sweeper  nodding at the other monk .     when the time comes  he   ll get you back .  but not yet .      vimes sighed .  the anger had drained  leaving only a hopeless  leaden feeling .  he stared blankly at the strange rockery that occupied most of the garden .  it looked oddly familiar .  he blinked .      i   ve been talking to people today who are going to die     he said .     how do you think that makes me feel .  do you know what that feels like .      the monks gave him a puzzled look .      er   yes     said qu .      we do     said sweeper .     everyone we talk to is going to die .  everyone you talk to is going to die .  everyone dies .         i   ve been changing things     said vimes .     why shouldn   t i .  carcer is .  i have no idea how things are going to turn out .  i mean  doesn   t it change history even if you just tread on an ant .         for the ant  certainly     said qu .   sweeper waved a hand .     i told you  mister vimes .  history finds a way .  it   s like a shipwreck .  you   re swimming to the shore .  the waves will break whatever you do .  is it not written     the big sea does not care which way the little fishes swim    .  people die in their due time           keel didn   t .  carcer mugged the poor devil .         his due time in this present  commander     said qu .     but he will play his part in the other  mister vimes .  eventually .  you   ll reach the shore .  you must .  otherwise              there   s no shore     said sweeper .      no     said vimes .     there   s got to be more .  i   m not swimming  i   m drowning .  it was fun  d   you know .  at first .  like a boys    night out .  feeling the street under my boots again .  but now   what about sybil .  are my memories real .  what i know is she   s a girl living with her dad .  is there somewhere where she is my wife  having my child .  i mean  really .  is it all in my mind .  can you prove it .  is it happening .  will it happen .  what is real .      the monks were silent .  sweeper glanced at qu  who shrugged .  he glanced rather more meaningfully  and  this time  qu made that dismissive little wave of the hand  which is someone meaning    all right  all right  against my better judgment        then sweeper said     ye es     very slowly .     yes  i think we can help  commander .  you want to know there   s a future waiting .  you want to hold it in your hand .  you want to feel the weight of it .  you want one point to navigate by  one point to steer for .  yes .  i think we can help you there   but           yes .         but you climb back over that wall and sergeant keel plays his part .  he sees it through to the end .  he gives the orders he feels are right  and they will be the right orders .  he holds the line .  he does the job .         he   s not the only one     said vimes .      yes  commander vimes has a job in hand  too .         don   t worry  i   m not leaving carcer behind     growled vimes .      good .  we   ll be in touch .      vimes tossed the stump of his cigar aside  and looked up at the wall .      all right     he said .     i   ll see it through .  but when the time comes           we will be ready     said sweeper .     just so long as you        he stopped .  there was another subtle sound  scaly in its way  a sort of silicon slither .      my goodness     said qu .   vimes looked down .   the cigar butt still smoldered .  but around it  the garden of inner city tranquility was moving  pebble sliding over tiny pebble .  a large  water rounded rock floated gently around  spinning .  and then vimes became aware that the whole garden was spinning  turning on the little wisp of smoke .  a spent match sailed past  rolling from stone to stone like a scrap of food passed from ant to ant .      is it meant to do that .     he said .      in theory  yes     said sweeper .     i should leave right now  mister vimes .      vimes took one last look at the moving garden  shrugged  and then heaved himself over the wall .   the two monks stared .  the tide of little stones was gently pushing the stub into the center .      astonishing     said qu .     i don   t know how you manage it .         i   m not doing it     said sweeper .     qu  can we           no more time shifting     said qu .     it   s caused enough trouble .         fair enough     said sweeper .     then i   ll need to send out search parties .  the fences  the bent jewelers  the pawnshops   we   ll find it .  i understand our friend .  the job   s not enough .  he needs one real thing .  and i know what it is .      they looked again at the turning  shifting garden  and felt the fingers of history spreading out and into the world .       vimes tried not to run back to the watch house  because too many people were standing around in groups and even a running uniform could be risky .   besides  you didn   t run for officers .  he was a sergeant .  sergeants walked with a measured tread .   to his mild surprise  the men were still out in the yard .  someone had even hung up the swordsmanship targets  which would certainly be helpful if the watchmen were faced with an enemy who was armless and tied to a pole .   he climbed the stairs .  the captain   s door was open  and he saw that the new man had repositioned his desk so that he could see out onto the landing and down the stairs .  not a good sign  not a good sign at all .  an officer shouldn   t see what was going on  he should rely on his sergeants to tell him what was going on .  that way things ran smoothly .   this man was keen .  oh  dear     the new captain looked up .  oh  good grief  vimes thought .  it   s bloody rust this time round .  and it was indeed the hon .  ronald rust  the gods    gift to the enemy  any enemy  and a walking encouragement to desertion .   the rust family had produced great soldiers  by the undemanding standards of    deduct your own casualties from those of the enemy  and if the answer is a positive sum  it was a glorious victory    school of applied warfare .  but rust   s lack of any kind of military grasp was matched only by his high opinion of the talent he  in fact  possessed only in negative amounts .   it hadn   t been rust last time .  he vaguely remembered some other dim captain .  all these little changes   what would they add up to .   i bet he   s only just been made a captain  thought vimes .  just think of the lives i could save by accidentally cutting his head off now .  look at those blue eyes .  look at that stupid curly mustache .  and he   s only going to get worse .      are you keel .     the voice was a bark .      yessir .         i sent an order for you to come up here an hour ago  man .         yessir .  but i   ve been on duty all night and morning and there   s been rather a lot to attend to           i expect orders to be obeyed promptly  sergeant .         yessir .  so do i  sir .  that   s why           discipline starts at the top  sergeant .  the men obey you  you obey me  i obey my superiors .         glad to hear it  sir .     rust had the same firm grip of common politeness  too .      what is all that going on in the yard .      vimes steered according to the prevailing wind        a bit of morale building  sir .  instilling a bit of esprit de corps .         and hit a reef .  rust raised his eyebrows .      why .     he said .     the men   s job is to do what they are told  as is yours .  a group hug is not part of the arrangement  is it .         a bit of camaraderie helps the job along  sir .  in my experience .         are you eyeballing me  keel .         no  sir .  i am wearing an expression of honest doubt  sir .     eyeballing    is four steps up  right after    looking at you in a funny way     sir .  by standard military custom and practice  sir  sergeants are allowed to go all the way up to an expression of acute           what   s that pip over your stripes  man .         means sergeant at arms  sir .  they were a special kind of copper .      the captain grunted and glanced at the papers in front of him .      lord winder has received an extraordinary request that you be promoted to lieutenant  sergeant .  it has come from captain swing of the particulars .  and his lordship listens to captain swing .  oh  and he wants you to be transferred to the particulars .  personally  i think the man is mad .         i   m one hundred percent behind you there  sir .         you do not wish to be a lieutenant .         no  sir .  too long for dick and too short for richard  sir     said vimes  focusing on a point a few inches above rust   s head .      what .         neither one thing nor t   other  sir .         oh  so you   d like to be a captain  eh .     said rust  grinning evilly .      nosir .  don   t want to be an officer  sir .  get confused when i see more   n one knife and fork on the table  sir .         you certainly don   t look like officer material to me  sergeant .         nosir .  thank you  sir .     good old rust .  good young rust .  the same unthinking rudeness masquerading as blunt speaking  the same stiff neckedness  the same petty malice .   any sergeant worth his salt could see how to make use of that .      wouldn   t mind transferring to the particulars though  sir     he volunteered .  it was a bit of a gamble  but not much .  rust   s mind was reliable .      i expect you would like that  keel     said rust .     no doubt you ran rings round that old fool tilden and don   t fancy the idea of a captain with his finger on the pulse  eh .  no  you can damn well stay here  understand .      wonderful  thought vimes .  sometimes it   s like watching a wasp land on a stinging nettle  someone   s going to get stung and you don   t care .      yessir     he said  eyes still staring straight ahead .      have you shaved today  man .         excuse shaving  sir     vimes lied .     doctor   s orders .  been sewn up onna face  sir .  could shave one half  sir .      he remained at eyes front while rust grudgingly stared at him .  the cut was still pretty livid  and vimes hadn   t dared look under the patch yet .      hit yourself in the face with your own bell  did you .     grunted the captain .   vimes   s fingers twitched .     very funny  sir     he said .      now go and get the men fell in  keel .  look sharp .  i shall inspect them in a moment .  and tell that idiot with the flat nose to clear the stable .         sir .         my horse will be arriving shortly .  i don   t want to see that disgusting screw in there .         what  turn out marilyn  sir .     said vimes  genuinely shocked .      that was an order .  tell him to jump to it .         what do you want us to do with her  sir .         i don   t care .  you are a sergeant  you   ve had an order .  presumably there are knackermen .  people around here must eat something  no doubt .      vimes hesitated for a moment .  then he saluted .      right you are  sir     he said .      do you know what i saw on the way here  sergeant .         couldn   t say  sir     said vimes  staring straight ahead .      people were building barricades  sergeant .         sir .         i know you heard me  man .         well  it   s to be expected  sir .  it   s happened before .  people get jumpy .  they hear rumors of mobs and out of control soldiers .  they try to protect their street           it is a flagrant challenge to government authority .  people can   t take the law into their own hands .         well  yes .  but these things generally run their course           my gods  man  how did you manage to get promoted .      vimes knew he should leave it at that .  rust was a fool .  but at the moment he was a young fool  which is more easily excused .  maybe it was just possible  if caught early enough  that he could be upgraded to idiot .      sometimes it pays to       he began .      last night every watch house in the city was mobbed     said rust  ignoring him .     except this one .  how do you account for that .     his mustache bristled .  not being attacked was definite proof of vimes   s lack of moral fiber .      it was just a case of           apparently a man attempted an assault on you .  where is he now .         i don   t know  sir .  we bandaged him up and took him home .         you let him go .         yessir .  he was       but rust was always a man to interrupt an answer with a demand for the answer he was in fact interrupting .      why .         sir  because at that time i thought it prudent to           three watchmen were killed last night  did you know that .  there were gangs roaming the streets .  well  martial law has been declared .  today we   re going to show them a firm hand .  get your men together .  now .      vimes saluted  turned about  and walked slowly down the stairs .  he wouldn   t have run for a big clock .   a firm hand .  right .  gangs roaming the streets .  well  we sure as hell never did anything when they were criminal gangs .  and when you   ve got madmen and idiots on either side  and everything hangs in the balance   well  trouble is always easy to find when you have enough people looking for it .   one of the hardest lessons of young sam   s life had been finding out that the people in charge weren   t in charge .  it had been finding out that governments were not  on the whole  staffed by people who had a grip  and that plans were what people made instead of thinking .   most of the watchmen were clustered around the stairs .  snouty was quite good at internal communications of the worrying kind .      tidy yourselves  lads     said vimes .     captain   ll be down in a few minutes .  apparently it   s time for a show of strength .         what strength .     said billy wiglet .      ah  billy  what happens is  the vicious revolutionaries take one look at us and scuttle off back to their holes     said vimes .  he was immediately sorry he   d said that .  billy hadn   t learned irony .      i mean we just give the uniforms an airing     he translated .      we   ll get cheesed     said fred colon .      not if we stick together     said sam .      right     said vimes .     after all  we   re heavily armed men going on patrol among civilians who are  by law  unarmed .  if we   re careful  we shouldn   t get too badly hurt .      another bad move .  dark sarcasm ought to be taught in schools  he thought .  besides  armed men could get into trouble if the unarmed civilians were angry enough  especially if there were cobblestones on the streets .   he heard the distant clocks strike three .  tonight  the streets would explode .   according to the history books  it would be one shot that did it  around about sunset .  one of the foot regiments would be assembled in hen and chickens field  awaiting orders .  and there would be people watching them .  troops always drew an audience   impressionable kids  the inevitable ankh morpork floating street crowd  and  of course  the ladies whose affection was extremely negotiable .   the crowd shouldn   t have been there  people said afterward .  but where should it have been .  the field was a popular spot .  it was the only vaguely green space in that part of the city .  people played games there  and  of course  there was always the progress of the corpse on the gibbet to inspect .  besides  they were troops  ordinary foot soldiers  people   s sons and husbands  taking a bit of a rest and having a drink .   oh  that was right   afterward  it was said that the troops were drunk .  and that they shouldn   t have been there .  yep  that was the reason  vimes reflected .  no one should have been there .   but they were  and when that captain got an arrow in his stomach and was groaning on the ground  some of the crossbowmen fired in the direction of the shot .  that   s what the history books said .  they fired at the house windows  where people had been watching .  perhaps the shot had come from one of them .   some arrows fell short  some did not .  and there were people who fired back .   and then  one after another  horrible things would happen .  by then it was too late for them not to .  the tension would unwind like a spring  scything through the city .   there were plotters  there was no doubt about it .  some had been ordinary people who   d had enough .  some were young people with no money who objected to the fact that the world was run by old people who were rich .  some were in it to get girls .  and some had been idiots as mad as swing  with a view of the world just as rigid and unreal  who were on the side of what they called    the people .     vimes had spent his life on the streets and had met decent men  and fools  and people who   d steal a penny from a blind beggar  and people who performed silent miracles or desperate crimes every day behind the grubby windows of little houses  but he   d never met the people .   people on the side of the people always ended up disappointed  in any case .  they found that the people tended not to be grateful or appreciative or forward thinking or obedient .  the people tended to be small minded and conservative and not very clever and were even distrustful of cleverness .  and so  the children of the revolution were faced with the age old problem  it wasn   t that you had the wrong kind of government  which was obvious  but that you had the wrong kind of people .   as soon as you saw people as things to be measured  they didn   t measure up .   what would run through the streets soon enough wouldn   t be a revolution or a riot .  it   d be people who were frightened and panicking .  it was what happened when all the machinery of a city faltered  the wheels stopped turning  and all the little rules broke down .  and when that happened  humans were worse than sheep .  sheep just ran  they didn   t try to bite the sheep next to them .   by sunset  a uniform would automatically be a target .  then it wouldn   t matter where a watchman   s sympathies lay .  he   d be just another man in armor        what .     he said  snapping back to the present .      you all right  sarge .     said corporal colon .      hmm .     said vimes  as the real world returned .      you were well away     said fred .     staring at nothing .  you ought to have had a proper sleep last night  sarge .         there   s plenty of time to sleep in the grave     said vimes  looking at the ranks of the watch .      yeah  i heard that  sarge  but no one wakes you up with a cup of tea .  i got    em lined up  sarge .      fred had made an effort  vimes could see .  so had the men themselves .  he   d never seen them looking quite so   formal .  usually they had a helmet and a breastplate apiece .  beyond that  equipment was varied and optional .  but today  at least  they looked neat .   shame about the heights .  no man could easily inspect a row that included wiglet at one end and nancyball at the other .  wiglet was so short that he   d once been accused of naveling a sergeant  being far too short to eyeball anyone  while nancyball was always the first man on duty to know when it was raining .  you had to stand well back to get both of them into vision without eyestrain .      well done  lads     he managed  and heard rust coming down the stairs .   it must have been the first time the man had seen his new command in full .  in the circumstances  he bore up quite well .  he merely sighed .   he turned to vimes and said     i require something to stand on .      vimes looked blank .     sir .         i wish to address the men in order to inspire them and stiffen their resolve .  they must understand the political background to the current crisis .         oh  we know all about lord winder being a loony  sir     said wiglet cheerfully .   frost nearly formed on rust   s forehead .   vimes drew himself up .      squad diiiiismiss .     he shouted  and then leaned toward rust as the men scuttled away .     a quiet word  sir .         did that man really say       rust began .      yes  sir .  these are simple men  sir     said vimes  thinking quickly .     best not to disturb them  if you take my meaning .      rust inserted this into his range of options .  vimes could see him thinking .  it was a way out  and it suited his opinion of the watch in general .  it meant that he hadn   t been cheeked by a constable  he   d merely dealt with a simpleton .      they know their duty  sir     vimes added for reinforcement .      their duty  sergeant  is to do what they are told .         exactly  sir .      rust stroked his mustache .      there is something in what you say  sergeant .  and you trust them .         as a matter of fact  sir  yes .         hmm .  we will make a circuit of the surrounding streets in ten minutes .  this is a time for action .  reports are disturbing .  we must hold the line  sergeant .      and he believes it  thought vimes .  he really does .       the watchmen marched out into the afternoon sunshine  and did so badly .  they were not used to marching .  their normal method of progress was the stroll  which is not a recognized military maneuver  or the frantic withdrawal  which is .   in addition  the convection currents of prudent cowardice were operating in the ranks .  there was a definite sideways component to each man   s progress as he sought to be in the middle .  the watchmen had shields  but they were light wickerwork things intended to turn blows and deflect stones  they wouldn   t stand up to anything with an edge .  the advance  therefore  was by means of a slowly elongating huddle .   rust didn   t notice .  he had a gift for not seeing things he did not want to see and not hearing things he did not want to hear .  and what he saw was a barricade .   ankh morpork these days wasn   t really a city  not when the chips were down .  places like dolly sisters and nap hill and seven sleepers had been villages once  before they were absorbed by the urban sprawl .  on some level  they still held themselves separate .  as for the rest   well  once you got off the main streets it was all down to neighborhoods .  people didn   t move around much .  when tension was high  you relied on your mates and your family .  whatever was going down  you tried to make sure wasn   t going down your street .  it wasn   t revolution .  it was quite the reverse .  it was defending your doorstep .   they were building a barricade in whalebone lane .  it wasn   t a particularly good one  made up mostly of overturned market stalls  a small cart  and quite a lot of household furniture  but it was a symbol .   rust   s mustache bristled .      right in our faces     he snapped .     absolute defiance of constituted authority  sergeant .  do your duty .         and what would that be at this point  sir .     said vimes .      arrest the ringleaders .  and your men will pull the barricade down .      vimes sighed .      very well  sir .  if you will stand back        he walked up to the domestic clutter  aware of eyes watching him before and behind .   when he was a few feet away  he cupped his hands .      all right  all right  what   s going on here .     he shouted .   he was aware of whispering .  and he was ready for what happened next .  when the stone flew over the top of the furniture he caught it in both hands .      i asked a civil question     he said .     come on .      there was more whispering .  he distinctly heard       that   s the sergeant from last night       and some sort of sotto voce argument .  then a voice shouted     death to the fascist oppressors .      this time the argument was more frantic .  he heard someone say     oh  all right     and then     death to the fascist oppressors  present company excepted .  there  is everyone happy now .      he knew that voice .      mr .  reginald shoe  is it .     he said .      i regret that i have only one life to lay down for whalebone lane .     the voice shouted from somewhere behind a wardrobe .   if only you knew  vimes thought .      i don   t think that will be necessary     he said .     come on  ladies and gentlemen .  is this any way to behave .  you can   t take   the law   into your own   hands        his voice faltered .   sometimes it takes the brain a little while to catch up with the mouth .   vimes turned and looked at the squad  who   d needed no prompting at all to hang back .  and then he turned to look at the barricade .   where  exactly  was the law .  right now .   what did he think he was doing .   the job  of course .  the one that   s in front of you .  he   d always done it .  and the law had always been   out there  but somewhere close .  he   d always been pretty sure where it was  and it definitely had something to do with the badge .   the badge was important .  yes .  it was shield shaped .  for protection .  he   d thought about that  in the long nights in the darkness .  it protected him from the beast  because the beast was waiting in the darkness of his head .   he   d killed werewolves with his bare hands .  he   d been mad with terror at the time  but the beast had been there inside  giving him strength     who knew what evil lurked in the hearts of men .  a copper  that   s who .  after ten years  you thought you   d seen it all  but the shadows always dished up more .  you saw how close men lived to the beast .  you found that people like carcer were not mad .  they were incredibly sane .  they were simply men without a shield .  they   d looked at the world and realized that all the rules didn   t have to apply to them  not if they didn   t want them to .  they weren   t fooled by all the little stories .  they shook hands with the beast .   but he  sam vimes  had stuck by the badge  except for that time when even that hadn   t been enough and he   d stuck by the bottle instead     he felt as if he   d stuck by the bottle now .  the world was spinning .  where was the law .  there was the barricade .  who was it protecting from what .  the city was run by a madman and his shadowy chums  so where was the law .   coppers liked to say that people shouldn   t take the law into their own hands  and they thought they knew what they meant .  but they were thinking about peaceful times  and men who went around to sort out a neighbor with a club because his dog had crapped once too often on their doorstep .  but at times like these  who did the law belong to .  if it shouldn   t be in the hands of the people  where the hell should it be .  people who knew better .  then you got winder and his pals  and how good was that .   what was supposed to happen next .  oh yes  he had a badge  but it wasn   t his  not really   and he   d got orders  and they were the wrong ones   and he   d got enemies  for all the wrong reasons   and maybe there was no future .  it didn   t exist anymore .  there was nothing real  no solid point on which to stand  just sam vimes where he had no right to be     it was as if his body  trying to devote as many resources as possible to untangling the spinning thoughts  was drawing those resources from the rest of vimes .  his vision darkened .  his knees felt weak .   there was nothing but bewildered despair .   and a lot of explosions .       havelock vetinari knocked politely on the window of the little office just inside the assassins    guild main gate .   the duty porter raised the hatch .      signing out  mr .  maroon     said the assassin .      yessir     said maroon  pushing a big ledger toward him .     and where are we off to today  sir .         general reconnoitering  mr .  maroon .  just generally looking around .         ah  i said to mrs .  maroon  sir  that you are a great one for looking around     said maroon .      we look and learn  mr .  maroon  we look and learn     said vetinari  signing his name in the book and putting the pen back in its holder .     and how is your little boy .         thank you for asking  sir  he   s a lot better     said the porter .      glad to hear it .  oh  i see the hon .  john bleedwell is out on a commission .  to the palace .         now  now  sir     said maroon  grinning and waving a finger .     you know i couldn   t tell you that  sir  even if i knew .         of course not .     vetinari glanced at the back wall of the office where  in an old brass rack  was a number of envelopes .  the word    active    was inscribed at the top of the rack .      good afternoon  mr .  maroon .            afternoon  sir .  good  er  looking .      he watched the young man walk out into the street .  then maroon went into the cubbyhole next to the office to put the kettle on .   he rather liked young vetinari  who was quiet and studious and  it had to be said  a generous young man on appropriate occasions .  but a bit weird  all the same .  once maroon had watched him in the foyer  standing still .  that was all he was doing .  he wasn   t making any attempt at concealing himself .  after half an hour  maroon had wandered over and said     can i help you  sir .      and vetinari had said     thank you  no  mr .  maroon .  i   m just learning to stand still .      to which there wasn   t really any sensible comment that could be made .  and the young man must have left after a while  because maroon didn   t remember seeing him again that day .   he heard a creak from the office  and poked his head around the door .  there was no one there .   as he made the tea  he thought he heard a rustle from the office  and went to check .  it was completely empty .  remarkably so  he thought later on .  it was almost as if it was even more empty than it would be if there was just  well  no one in it .   he went back to his comfy armchair in the cubbyhole  and relaxed .   in the brass rack  the envelope marked    bleedwell  j .     slid back slightly .       there were a lot of explosions .  the firecrackers bounced all over the street .  tambourines thudded  a horn blared a chord unknown in nature  and a line of monks danced and danced and twirled around the corner  all chanting at the tops of their voices .   vimes  sagging to his knees  was aware of dozens of sandaled feet gyrating past  and grubby robes flying .  rust was yelling something at the dancers who grinned and waved their hands in the air .   something square and silvery landed in the dirt .   and the monks were gone  dancing into an alleyway  yelling and spinning and banging their gongs        wretched heathens .     said rust  striding forward .     have you been hit  sergeant .      vimes reached down and picked up the silver rectangle .   a stone clanged off rust   s breastplate .  as he raised his megaphone  a cabbage hit him on the knee .   vimes stared at the thing in his hand .  it was a cigar case  slim and slightly curved .   he fumbled it open and read  to sam with love from your sybil .   the world moved .  vimes still felt like a drifting ship .  but at the end of the tether there was now the tug of the anchor  pulling the ship around so that it faced the current .   a barrage of missiles was coming over the barricade .  throwing things was an old ankh morpork custom  and there was something about rust that made him a natural target .  with what dignity he could muster  he raised the megaphone again and got as far as    i hereby warn you       before a stone spun it out of his hand .      very well  then     he said and marched stiffly back to the squad .     sergeant keel  order the men to fire .  one round of arrows  over the top of the barricade .         no     said vimes  standing up .      i can only assume you   ve been stunned  sergeant     said rust .     men  prepare to execute that order .         first man that fires  i will personally cut that man down     said vimes .  he didn   t shout .  it was a simple  confident statement of precisely what the future would hold .   rust   s expression did not change .  he looked vimes up and down .      is this mutiny  then  sergeant .     said the captain .      no .  i   m not a soldier  sir .  i can   t mutiny .         martial law  sergeant .     snapped rust .     it is official .         really .     said vimes  as another rain of rocks and old vegetables came down .     shields up  lads .      rust turned to fred colon .     corporal  you will put this man under arrest .      colon swallowed .      me .         you  corporal .  now .      colon   s pink face mottled with white as the blood drained from it .      but he       he began .      you won   t .  then it seems i must     said the captain .  he drew his sword .   at that vimes heard the click of a crossbow   s safety catch going off  and groaned .  he didn   t remember this happening .      you just put that sword away  sir  please     said the voice of lance constable vimes .      you will not shoot me  you young idiot .  that would be murder     said the captain calmly .      not where i   m aiming  sir .      bloody hell  thought vimes .  maybe the lad was simple .  because one thing rust wasn   t  was a coward .  he thought idiot stubbornness was bravery .  he wouldn   t back down in the face of a dozen armed men .      ah  i think i can see the problem  captain     vimes said brightly .     as you were  lance constable .  there   s been a slight misunderstanding  sir  but this should sort it out        it was a blow he   d remember for a long time .  it was sweet .  it was textbook .  rust went down like a log .   by the light of all his burning bridges  vimes slipped his hand back into his hip pocket .  thank you  mrs .  goodbody  and your range of little equalizers .   he turned to the watchmen  who were a tableau of silent horror .      let the record show sergeant at arms john keel did that     he said .     vimes  what did i tell you about waving weapons around when you   re not going to use them .         you laid him out  sarge .     sam squeaked  still staring at the sleeping captain .   vimes shook some life back into his hand .      let the record show that i took command after the captain   s sudden attack of obvious insanity     he said .     waddy  wiglet   drag him back to the house and lock him up  will you .         what we gonna do  sarge .     wailed colon .   ah     keep the peace .  that was the thing .  people often failed to understand what that meant .  you   d go to some life threatening disturbance  like a couple of neighbors scrapping in the street over who owned the hedge between their properties  and they   d both be bursting with aggrieved self righteousness  both yelling  their wives would either be having a private scrap on the side or would have adjourned to a kitchen for a shared pot of tea and a chat  and they all expected you to sort it out .   and they could never understand that it wasn   t your job .  sorting it out was a job for a good surveyor and a couple of lawyers  maybe .  your job was to quell the impulse to bang their stupid fat heads together  to ignore the affronted speeches of dodgy self justification  to get them to stop shouting  and to get them off the street .  once that had been achieved  you job was over .  you weren   t some walking god  dispensing finely tuned natural justice .  your job was simply to bring back peace .   of course  if your few strict words didn   t work  and mr .  smith subsequently clambered over the disputed fence and stabbed mr .  jones to death with a pair of gardening shears  then you had a different job  sorting out the notorious hedge argument murder .  but at least it was one you were trained to do .   people expected all kinds of things from coppers  but there was one thing that sooner or later they all wanted  make this not be happening .   make this not be happening        what .     he said  suddenly noticing a voice that had  in fact  been on the edge of awareness for some time .      i said  was he insane  sarge .      but when you   re falling off the cliff  it   s too late to wonder if there might have been a better way up the mountain        he asked you to shoot at people who weren   t shooting back     growled vimes  striding forward .     that makes him insane  wouldn   t you say .         they are throwing stones  sarge     said colon .      so .  stay out of range .  they   ll get tired before we do .      in fact  the barrage of missiles from the barricade had ceased  even in a time of crisis  the people of ankh morpork would stop for a decent piece of street theater .  vimes walked back toward them  stopping on the way to retrieve rust   s bent megaphone .   as he approached  he cast his eye over faces just visible through the chair legs and junk .  there would be unmentionables somewhere  he knew  helping matters along .  with luck  they wouldn   t have bothered with whalebone lane .   there was muttering from the defenders .  most of them had a look vimes recognized  because it was the one he was trying to keep off his own face .  it was the look of people whose world had suddenly been swept from under them  and now they were trying to tap dance on quicksand .   he tossed away the stupid pompous megaphone .  he cupped his hands .      some of you know me .     he shouted .     i   m sergeant keel  currently in command of the treacle mine road watch house .  and i order you to dismantle this barricade        there was a chorus of jeers and one or two badly thrown missiles .  vimes waited  stock still  until they   d died away .  then he raised his hands again .      i repeat  i order you to dismantle this barricade .     he took a breath  and went on     and rebuild it on the other side  oh the corner with cable street .  and put up another one at the top of sheer street .  properly built .  good grief  you don   t just pile stuff up  for gods    sake .  a barricade is something you construct .  who   s in charge here .      there were sounds of consternation behind the overturned furniture  but a voice called out     you .     there was nervous laughter .      very funny .  now laugh this one off .  no one   s interested in us yet .  this is a quiet part of town .  but when things really go bad  you   re going to have cavalry on your backs .  with sabers .  how long would you last .  if you shut off this end of treacle mine and the end of sheer  then they   re left with alleyways  and they don   t like that .  it   s up to you  of course .  we   d like to protect you  but me and my men   ll be behind the barricades over here        he turned on his heel and marched back to the waiting watchmen .      right  lads     he said .     you heard .  pounce and gaskin  you take the hurry up wagon up to the bridge and turn it over .  waddy and nancyball and you  too  fred   go and nick some carts .  you grew up round here  so don   t tell me you   ve never done that before .  i want a couple blocking the streets down here  and the rest  i want you to run them into the alleymouths until they wedge .  you men know the area .  block up all little back ways .      colon rubbed his nose .     we could do that on the river side  sarge  but it   s all alleys on the shades    side .  can   t block    em all .         i wouldn   t worry about those     said vimes .     cavalry can   t come through there .  you know what they call a horse in the shades .      colon grinned .     yeah  sarge .  lunch .         right .  the rest of you  get all the benches and tables out of the watch house        it dawned on him that none of the men had moved .  there was a certain   problem in the air .      well .      billy wiglet removed his helmet and wiped his forehead .      er   how far is this going to go  sarge .         all the way  billy .         but we took the oath  sarge  and now we   re disobeying orders and helping rebels .  doesn   t seem right  sarge     said wiglet wretchedly .      you took an oath to uphold the law and defend the citizens without fear or favor     said vimes .     and to protect the innocent .  that   s all they put in .  maybe they thought those were the important things .  nothing in there about orders  even from me .  you   re an officer of the law  not a soldier of the government .      one or two of the men looked longingly at the other end of the street  empty and inviting .      but i won   t stop anyone who wants to walk     said vimes .  they stopped looking .         ullo  mister keel     said a sticky voice behind him .      yes  nobby .     he said without turning around .         ere  how did you detect it was me  sergeant .         it   s an amazing talent  kid     said vimes  turning  against all wisdom  to look at the urchin .     what   s been happening .         big riot in sator square  sarge .  and they say people   ve broke into the dolly sisters watch house and thrown the lieutenant out the window .  an    there   s lootin    all over the place  they say  an    the day watch are out chasin    people  only most of    em are hidin    now    cos           yeah  i get the picture     sighed vimes .  carcer had been right .  coppers were always outnumbered  so being a copper only worked when people let it work .  if they refocused and realized you were just another standard idiot with a pennyworth of metal for a badge  you could end up as a smear on the pavement .   he could hear shouting now  a long way off .   he looked around at the hesitant watchmen .      on the other hand  gentlemen     he said     if you are going to leave  where are you going to go to .      the same thought had clearly occurred to colon and the others .      we   ll get the carts     he said  hurrying off .      an    i wants a penny     said nobby  holding out a grubby hand .  to the boy   s amazement  vimes gave him a dollar  saying     and just keep telling me everything  will you .      tables and benches were already being dragged out of the watch house  and after only a couple of minutes  waddy arrived with a cartload of empty barrels .  barricades were easy in these streets  it was keeping them clear that had always been the problem .   the watchmen set to work .  this was something they understood .  they   d done it when they were kids .  and  perhaps  they thought  hey  this time we   re wearing uniforms .  we can   t be in the wrong .   while vimes was struggling to wedge a bench into the growing wall  he was aware of people behind him .  he worked steadily  however  until someone gave a delicate cough .  then he turned .      yes .  can i help you .      there was a small group of people  and it was clear to vimes that it was a group pushed together out of shared terror  because  by the look of them  they   d have nothing to do with one another if they could possibly avoid it .   the spokesman  or at least the one in front  looked almost exactly like the kind of person vimes had pictured when thinking about the hedge argument murder .      erm  officer           yes  sir .     said vimes cheerfully .      what  er  are you doing  exactly .         keeping the peace  sir .  this piece  to be exact .         you said that there   s  er  rioting and soldiers on the way           very likely  sir .         you don   t have to ask him  rutherford  it   s his duty to protect us     snapped the woman who was standing  with an air of proprietorship  beside the man .  vimes changed his mind about the man .  yes  he had that furtive look of a timid domestic poisoner about him  the kind of man who   d be appalled at the idea of divorce but would plot womanslaughter every day .  and you could see why .   he gave the lady a nice  warm smile .  she was holding a blue vase .      how can i help you  ma   am .     he said .      what are you intending to do about us being murdered in our beds .     she demanded .      well  it   s not four o   clock yet  ma   am  but if you   ll let me know when you want to retire        vimes was impressed at the way the woman drew herself up .  even sybil  in full duchess mode  with the blood of twenty generations of arrogant ancestors behind her  could not have matched her .      rutherford  are you going to do something about this man .     she said .   rutherford looked up at vimes .  vimes was aware that he was villainously unshaven  disheveled  dirty  and probably starting to smell .  he decided not to load more troubles on the man   s back .      would you and your lady care to share our barricade .     he said .      oh  yes  thank you very       rutherford began  but was outgunned again .      some of that furniture looks very dirty     said mrs .  rutherford .     and aren   t those beer barrels .         yes  ma   am  but they   re empty ones     said vimes .      are you sure .  i refuse to cower behind alcohol .  i have never approved of alcohol  and neither has rutherford .         i can promise you  ma   am  that any beer barrel in the presence of my men for any length of time will be empty     said vimes .     you may rest assured on that score .         and are your men sober and clean living .     the woman demanded .      whenever no alternative presents itself  ma   am     said vimes .  this seemed acceptable .  mrs .  rutherford was like rust in that respect .  she listened to the tone of voice  not the words .      i think perhaps it would be a good idea  dear  if we made haste to       rutherford began .      not without father .     said his wife .      no problem  ma   am     said vimes .     where is he .         on our barricade  of course .  which was  let me tell you  a rather better barricade altogether .         jolly good  ma   am     said vimes .     if he   d like to come over here  we   ll           erm  you don   t quite understand  sir     murmured rutherford .     he is  erm  on the barricade        vimes looked at the other barricade  and then looked harder .  it was just possible to see  near the top of the piled up furniture  an overstuffed armchair .  further examination suggested that it was occupied by a sleeping figure in carpet slippers .      he   s very attached to his armchair     sighed rutherford .      it   s going to be an heirloom     said his wife .     be so kind as to send your young men to collect our furniture  will you .  and be careful with it .  put it at the back somewhere  where it won   t get shot at .      vimes nodded at sam and a couple of the other men as mrs .  rutherford picked her way over the debris and headed for the watch house .      is there going to be any fighting .     said mr .  rutherford anxiously .      possibly  sir .         i   m not very good at that sort of thing  i   m afraid .         don   t worry about that  sir .     vimes propelled the man over the barricade and turned to the rest of the little group .  he   d been aware of eyes boring into him  and now he traced the rays back to their source  a young man in black trousers  a frilly shirt  and long curly hair .      this is a ruse  isn   t it     said the man .     you   ll get us in your power and we   ll never be seen again  eh .         stay out then  reg     said vimes .  he cupped his hands and turned back to the whalebone lane barricade .      anyone else wants to join us had better get a move on .     he shouted .      you don   t know that   s my name .     said reg shoe .   vimes stared into the big  protruding eyes .  the only difference between reg now and the reg he   d left back in the future was that corporal shoe was rather grayer and was held together in places by stitches .  zombiehood would come naturally to reg .  he was born to be dead .  he believed so strongly in things that some kind of inner spring kept him going .  he   d make a good copper .  he didn   t make a very good revolutionary .  people as meticulously fervent as reg got real revolutionaries worried .  it was the way he stared .      you   re reg shoe     he said .     you live here  in whalebone lane .         aha  you   ve got secret files on me  eh .     said reg with terrifying happiness .      not really  no .  now if you   d be so good           i bet you   ve got a big file on me a mile long     said reg .      not a whole mile  reg  no     said vimes .     listen  reg  we           i demand to see it .      vimes sighed .     mr .  shoe  we don   t have a file on you .  we don   t have a file on anyone  understand .  half of us can   t read without using a finger .  reg  we are not interested in you .      reg shoe   s slightly worrying eyes remained fixed on vimes   s face for a moment  and then his brain rejected the information as contrary to whatever total fantasy was going on inside .      well  it   s no good you torturing me because i won   t reveal any details about my comrades in the other revolutionary cells .     said reg .      okay .  i won   t  then .  now perhaps           that   s how we work  see .  none of the cadres knows about the other ones .         really .  do they know about you .     said vimes .   for a moment  reg   s face clouded .      pardon .         well  you said you don   t know about them     said vimes .     so   do they know about you .     he wanted to add  you   re a cell of one  reg .  the real revolutionaries are silent men with poker player eyes and probably don   t know or care if you exist .  you   ve got the shirt and the haircut and the sash and you know all the songs  but you   re no urban guerrilla .  you   re an urban dreamer .  you turn over rubbish bins and scrawl on walls in the name of the people  who   d clip you round the ear if they found you doing it .  but you believe .      ah  so you   re a secret operative     he said  to get the poor man off the hook .   reg brightened .     that   s right .     he said .     the people are the sea in which the revolutionary swims .         like swordfishes .     vimes tried .      pardon .     said reg  without a hint of recognition .   and you   re a flounder  thought vimes .  ned   s a revolutionary .  he knows how to fight and he can think  even if it is on the skew .  but  reg  you really ought to be indoors        well  i can see you   re a dangerous individual     he said .     we   d better put you where we can keep an eye on you .  hey  that   s right .  you can undermine the enemy from within .      the relieved reg raised a fist in salute and clambered over the new barricade with revolutionary speed .  there was some hurried conversation behind the old makeshift barricade  already being denuded of mrs .  rutherford   s furniture .  this was interrupted by the clatter of hoof beats from treacle mine road and a sudden burst of instant decisiveness on the part of the remainder of the crowd .   they poured toward the new official barricade  with lance constable vimes bringing up the rear  fairly well hampered by a dining room chair .      mind out for that .     shouted a female voice from somewhere behind him .     it   s one of a set .      vimes put his hand on the young man   s shoulder .      just give me your crossbow  will you .     he said .       the horsemen came closer .   sam vimes was not good at horses .  and something in him resented being addressed by anyone eight feet above the ground .  he didn   t like the sensation of being looked at by nostrils .  he didn   t like being talked down to .   by the time they reached the barricade  he   d clambered around to the front of it and was standing in the middle of the street .   they slowed down .  it was probably the way he was moving but held the crossbow in the nonchalant way of someone who knows how to use it but has decided not to  for the moment .      you  there .     said a trooper .      yes .     said vimes .      are you in charge .         yes .  can i help you .         where are your men .      vimes jerked a thumb toward the growing barricade .  on the top of the heap  mrs .  rutherford   s father was snoring peacefully .      but that   s a barricade .     said the trooper .      well done .         there   s a man waving a flag .      vimes turned .  surprisingly  it was reg .  some of the men had brought out the old flag from tilden   s office and stuck it on the barricade  and reg was the sort to wave any flag going .      probably high spirits  sir     said vimes .     don   t worry .  we   re all fine .         it   s a damn barricade  man .  a rebel barricade .     said the second trooper .  oh boy  thought vimes .  they have shiny  shiny breastplates .  and wonderfully fresh  pink faces .      not exactly .  in fact  it   s           are you stupid  fellow .  don   t you know that all barricades are to be torn down by order of the patrician .      the third horseman  who had been staring at vimes  urged his horse a little closer .      what   s that pip on your shoulder  officer .     he said .      means i   m sergeant at arms .  special rank .  and who   re you .         he doesn   t have to tell you that .     said the first trooper .      really .     said vimes .  the man was getting on his nerves .     well  you   re just a trooper and i   m a bleedin    sergeant  and if you dare speak to me like that again  i   ll have you down off that horse and thump you across the ear  understand .      even the horse took a step backward .  the trooper opened his mouth to speak  but the third horseman raised a white gloved hand .   oh dear  thought vimes  focusing on the sleeve of the red jacket .  the man was a captain .  not only that  he was an intelligent one  by the look of him .  he hadn   t mouthed off until he   d had a chance to assess the situation .  you got them sometimes .  they could be dangerously bright .      i note  sergeant at arms     said the captain  enunciating the rank with care and without apparent sarcasm     that the flag over the barricade is the flag of ankh morpork .         it   s the one out of our watch house     said vimes  and added     sir .         you know that the patrician has declared that the building of barricades is an act of rebellion .         yessir .         and .     said the captain patiently .      well  he would say that  sir  wouldn   t he        the faintest hint of a smile skimmed across the captain   s face .      we can   t allow lawlessness  sergeant at arms .  if we all disobeyed the law  where would we be .         there   s more coppers per person behind that barricade than anywhere else in the city  sir     said vimes .     you could say it   s the most law abiding place around .      now there was the sound of raised voices from behind the barricade .         we own all your helmets  we own all your shoes  we own all your generals  touch us and you   ll loooose   morporkia  morporkia  morpooroorooorooooorrroorrr           rebel songs  sir .     said trooper number one .  the captain sighed .      if you listen  hepplewhite  you might note that it is the national anthem sung very badly     he said .      we can   t allow rebels to sing that  sir .      vimes saw the captain   s expression .  it had a lot to say about idiots .      raising the flag and singing the anthem  hepplewhite  are  while somewhat suspicious  not in themselves acts of treason     said the captain .     and we are urgently required elsewhere .     he saluted vimes  who found himself returning the salute .     we shall leave you  sergeant at arms .  i trust your day will be full of interest .  in fact  i know it .         but it   s a barricade  sir     the trooper insisted  glaring at vimes .      it   s just a pile of furniture  man .  people have been spring cleaning  i expect .  you   ll never be an officer if you can   t see straight .  follow me  if you please .      with a last nod to vimes  the captain led his men away at a trot .   vimes leaned against the barricade  put the crossbow on the ground  and fished out the cigar case .  he fumbled in his pocket  pulled out the battered carton of little cigars  and  with some delicacy  slotted them into place .   hmm .  to the left was cable street .  in front  treacle mine road stretched all the way to easy street .   now  if a man could get barricades all the way up to easy street  there   d be quite a slice of the lower hub side behind it  which   d be a lot easier to protect     we   ll do it .  after all  we did it .   of course  that   d mean having the unmentionables    headquarters in here with us .  that   s like pitching your tent over a nest of vipers .   we   ll handle that .  we handled it .   a couple of elderly people pushing carts full of miscellaneous belongings approached the barricade .  they gave vimes a look of mute pleading .  he nodded toward  and they scuttled through .   all we need now is        sarge .     fred colon was leaning over the top of the heap .  he looked more out of breath than usual .      yes  fred .         there   s lots of people coming across the pons bridge .  there   s things happening everywhere  they say .  shall we let    em in .         any soldiers .         i don   t reckon so  sarge .  it   s mostly old people and kids .  and my granny .         trustworthy .         not when she   s had a few pints .         let them in  then .         er       said colon .      yes  fred .         some of    em is watchmen .  a few of the lads from dimwell and a lot from kingsway .  i know most of    em  and those i don   t are known to the ones i do  if you catch my meanin    .         how many .         about twenty .  one of    em   s dai dickins  sergeant at dimwell .  he says they were told they   d got to shoot people and most of    em deserted on the spot .         quit  fred     said vimes .     we don   t desert .  we   re civilians .  now  i want young vimes and you and waddy and maybe half a dozen others out here  fully kitted up  in two minutes  understand .  and tell wiglet to organize squads ready to move the barricades forward at my signal .         move them  sarge .  i thought barricades stood still .         and tell snouty he   s got two minutes to find me a bottle of brandy     said vimes  ignoring this .     a big one .         are we taking the law into our own hands again  sarge .      vimes stared at the entrance to cable street  and was aware of the weight of the cigar case in his pocket .      yes  fred     he said .     only this time we   re going to squeeze .          the two guards at the unmentionables    headquarters watched with interest as the small contingent of watchmen marched up the street and came to a halt in front of them .      oo  look  it   s the army     said one of them .     what do you want .         nothing  sir     said corporal colon .      then you can push off .         can   t do that  sir .  i   m under orders .      the guards stepped forward .  fred colon was sweating  and they liked to see things like that .  it was a dull job  and most of the unmentionables were out  on more interesting assignments .  they entirely failed to hear the soft tread behind them .      orders to do what  mister     said one of them  looming over colon .   there was a sigh and a soft thud behind him .      be a decoy .     quavered colon .   the remaining guard turned and met a mrs .  goodbody no .       negotiator    coming the other way .   as the man slipped to the ground  vimes winced and massaged his knuckles .      important lesson  ladies     he said .     it hurts  no matter what you do .  you two  drag these into the shadows to sleep it off .  vimes and nancyball  you come with me .      the key to winning  as always  was looking as if you had every right  nay  duty to be where you were .  it helped if you could also suggest in every line of your body that no one else had any rights to be doing anything  anywhere  whatsoever .  it came easily to an old copper .   vimes led the way into the building .  there were a couple of guards inside  heavily armed  behind a stone barrier that made them ideally placed to ambush any unwise intruders .  they put their hands on the hilts of their swords when they saw vimes .      what   s happening out there .     said one .      oh  people are getting restless     said vimes .     getting very bad across the river  they say .  that   s why we   ve come for the prisoners in the cells .         yeah .  on whose authority .      vimes swung his crossbow up .      mr .  burleigh and mr .  stronginthearm     he said and grinned .   the two guards exchanged glances .     who the hell are they .     said one .   there was a moment of silence followed by vimes   s saying  out of the corner of his mouth     lance constable vimes .         yessir .         what make are these crossbows .         er   hines brothers  sir .  they   re mark threes .         not burleigh and stronginthearm .         never heard of them  sir .      damn .  five years too early  thought vimes .  and it was such a good line  too .      let me put it another way     he said to the guards .     give me any trouble and i will shoot you in the head .     it wasn   t a good line  but it did have a certain urgency and the bonus that it was simple enough even for an unmentionable to understand .      you   ve only got one arrow     said a guard .   there was a click from beside vimes .  sam had raised his bow  too .      there   s two now  and since my lad here is in training  he might hit you anywhere     said vimes .     drop your swords on the floor .  get out of the door .  run away .  do it now .  don   t come back .      there was a moment of hesitation  just a moment  and then the men ran for it .      fred will watch our backs     said vimes .     come on        all the watch houses were pretty much the same .  stone steps led down to the cellars .  vimes hurried down them  swung open a heavy door     and stopped .   cells never smelled all that good at the best of times .  at the best of times  even at treacle mine road  hygiene consisted of a bucket per cell and as much slopping out as snouty felt inclined to do .  but  at the worst of times  the cells below treacle mine road never smelled of blood .   the beast stirred .   in this room  there was a big wooden chair .  in this room  there was  by the chair  a rack .  the chair was bolted to the floor .  it had wide leather straps .  the rack held clubs and hammers .  in this room  that was all the furnishings .   the floor was dark and sticky .  down the length of it  a gully ran to a drain .   boards had been nailed over the tiny window at street level .  this wasn   t a place where light was welcomed .  and all the walls  and even the ceiling  were padded heavily with sacks stuffed with straw .  sacks had even been nailed to the door .  this was a very thorough cell .  not even sound was meant to escape .   a couple of torches did nothing at all for the darkness except make it dirty .   behind him  vimes heard nancyball throw up .   in a strange kind of dream  he walked across the floor and bent down to pick up something that gleamed in the torchlight .  it was a tooth .   he stood up again .   a closed wooden door led off on one side of the cellar  on the other  a wider tunnel almost certainly led to the cells .  vimes took a torch out of its holder  handed it to sam  and pointed along the tunnel     there were footsteps accompanied by a jingle of keys  heading toward the door  and a light growing brighter underneath it .   the beast tensed     vimes dragged the largest club out of the rack and stepped swiftly to the wall beside the door .  someone was coming  someone who knew about this room  someone who called themselves a copper     getting a firm two handed grip  vimes raised the club     and looked across the stinking room and saw young sam watching him  young sam with his bright shiny badge and face full of   strangeness .   vimes lowered the club  leaned it delicately against the wall  and pulled the leather cosh from his pocket .   shackled  not quite understanding  the beast was dragged back into the night     a man stepped through the door  whistling under his breath  took a few steps into the room  saw young sam  opened his mouth  and then fell fast asleep .  he was a big man  and hit the cobbles heavily .  he had a leather hood over his head  and was naked to the waist .  a big ring of keys hung from his belt .   vimes darted into the corridor behind the door  around a corner  burst into a small  brightly lit room  and grabbed a man he found in there .   this one was a lot smaller  and suppressed a scream as vimes dragged him up out of his chair .      and what does daddy do at work all day  mister .     he roared .   the little man was bright .  one look at vimes   s eye told him how short his future might be .      i   m just a clerk .  a clerk .  i just write things down .     he protested .  he held up a pen by way of desperate demonstration .   vimes looked at the desk .  there were compasses there  and other geometer   s tools  symbols of swing   s insane sanity .  there were books  and folders stuffed with paperwork .  and there was a yard long steel ruler .  he grabbed it in his spare hand and slammed it on the desktop .  the heavy steel made a satisfying noise .      and .     he said  his face a few inches from the struggling man .      and i measure people .  it   s all in the captain   s book .  i just measure people .  i don   t do anything wrong .  i   m not a bad man .      again the ruler slammed into the desk .  but this time vimes had twisted it  and the steel edge chopped into the wood .      want me to cut you down to size  mister .     the little man   s eyes rolled .      please .         is there another way out of here .     vimes slapped the rule down on the desk .   the flickers of eyes was enough .  vimes saw a doorway in the wall  almost lost in the wooden paneling .      good .  where does it come out .         er        now vimes was nose to nose with the man who  in police parlance  was helping him with his inquiries .      you   re all alone here     he said .     you have no friends here .  you sat and took notes for a torturer  a bloody torturer .  and i see a desk  and it   s got a desk drawer  and if you ever  ever want to hold a pen again  you   ll tell me everything i want to know           warehouse .     the man gasped .     next door .         right  sir .  thank you  sir .  you   ve been very helpful     said vimes  lowering the limp body to the floor .     now  sir  i   m just handcuffing you to this desk for a moment  sir  for your protection .         who   who from .         me .  i   ll kill you if you try to run away  sir .      vimes hurried back to the main chamber .  the torturer was still out cold .  vimes hauled him up into the chair  with great effort  and pulled off his hood  and recognized the face .  the face  yes  but not the person .  that is  it was the kind of face you saw a lot of in ankh morpork  big  bruised  and belonging to someone who   d never quite learned that hitting people long after they   d lost consciousness was a wicked thing to do .  he wondered if the man actually liked beating people to death .  they often didn   t think about it .  it was just a job .   well  he wasn   t about to ask him .  he buckled him in with every strap  even the one that went across the forehead  pulling the last one tight just as the man came round .  the mouth opened  and vimes stuffed the hood into it .   then he took the key ring and locked the main door .  that should ensure a little extra privacy .   he met young sam coming the other way as he headed for the cells .  the boy   s face was white in the gloom .      found any .     said vimes .      oh  sarge           yes .         oh  sarge   sarge       tears were running down the lance constable   s face .   vimes reached out and steadied himself .  sam felt as though there were no bones left in his body .  he was trembling .      there   s a woman in the last cell  and she    .  sarge   oh  sarge           try taking deep breaths     said vimes .     not that this air is fit to breathe .         and there   s a room right at the end  sarge    .  oh  sarge   nancyball fainted again  sarge           you didn   t     said vimes  patting him gently on the back .      but there   s           let   s rescue who we can  shall we  lad .         but we were on the hurry up wagon  sarge .         what .     said vimes  and then it dawned .  oh  yes        but we didn   t hand anyone over  lad     he said .     remember .         but i   ve been on it before  sarge .  all the lads have .  we just handed people over and went back to the watch house for cocoa  sarge .         well  you   d had orders       said vimes  for what good that did .      we didn   t know .      not exactly  thought vimes .  we didn   t ask .  we just shut our minds to it .  people went in through that front door and some of the poor devils came out through the secret door  not always in one box .   they hadn   t measured up .   nor did we .   he heard a low  visceral sound from the boy .  sam had spotted the torturer in the chair .  he shook himself away from vimes  ran over to the rack  and snatched up a club .   vimes was ready .  he grabbed the boy  swung him round  and twisted the thing out of his hand before murder was done .      no .  that   s not the way .  this is not the time .  hold it back .  tame it .  don   t waste it .  send it back .  it   ll come when you call .         you know he did those things .     shouted sam  kicking at vimes   s legs .     you said we had to take the law into our own hands .      ah  thought vimes .  this is just the time for a long debate about the theory and practice of justice .  here comes the shortened version .      you don   t bash a man   s brains out when he   s tied to a chair .         he did .         and you don   t .  that   s because you   re not him .         but they           stand to attention  lance constable .     shouted vimes  and the straw covered ceiling drank and deadened the sound .  sam blinked through reddened eyes .      okay  sarge  but           are you going to snivel all day .  forget about this one .  let   s get the living out  right .         hard to tell with      sam began  wiping his nose .      do it .  follow me .      he knew what was going to be in the dark arches of the cell tunnels  but that didn   t make it any better .  some people could walk  or maybe hop .  one or two had just been beaten up  but not so badly that they couldn   t hear what was going on just out of sight  and dwell on it .  they cringed when the gates were opened  and whimpered as he touched them .  no wonder swing got his confessions .   and some were dead .  others were   probably dead as far as vimes could tell .  if they weren   t  if they   d just gone somewhere in their heads  it was as sure as hell that there was nothing for them to come back to .  the chair had broken them again and again .  they were beyond the help of any man .   just in case  and without any feeling of guilt  vimes removed his knife  and   gave what help he could .  there was not a twitch  not a sigh .   he stood up  black and red storm clouds in his head .   you could almost understand a thug  simple as a fist  being paid decent money for doing something he didn   t mind doing .  but swing had brains     who really knew what evil lurked in the hearts of men .   me .   who knew what sane men were capable of .   still me  i   m afraid .   vimes glanced at the door of the last room .  no  he wasn   t going in there again .  no wonder it stank here .   you can   t hear me  can you .  oh .  i thought you might  said death  and went back to waiting .   vimes helped young sam bring nancyball around .  then they half carried  half walked the prisoners out along the passage up into the warehouse .  they laid them down  and went back and dragged out the clerk  whose name was trebilcock .  vimes explained to him the advantages of turning king   s evidence  as it was still known .  they were not major advantages  except when they were compared with the huge disadvantages that would follow swiftly if he refused to do so .  at that point  trebilcock  entirely of his own free will  volunteered .   and vimes stepped out into the early evening .  colon and the squad were still waiting  the whole business had taken only twenty minutes or so .   the corporal saluted  and then his nose wrinkled .      yes  we stink     said vimes .  he unbuckled his belt and pulled off his breastplate and chain mail undershirt .  the filth of the place had crawled everywhere .     okay     he said when he felt he was no longer standing in a sewer .     i want a couple of men at the entrance over there in the warehouse  a couple round the back with truncheons  and the rest ready out here .  just like we talked about  okay .  wallop them first  arrest them later .         right  sir     colon nodded .  men set off .      and now give me that brandy     vimes added .   he unwrapped his neckerchief  soaked it in the spirit  and tied it around the neck of the bottle .  he heard the angry murmur from the squad .  they   d just seen sam and nancyball bringing out some of the prisoners .      there was worse     said vimes     believe me .  top middle window  fred .         right  sarge     said fred colon  dragging his eyes away from the walking wounded .  he raised his crossbow and neatly took out two windowpanes and a glazing bar .   vimes located his silver cigar case  removed a cigar  lit it  applied the match to the brandy soaked rag  waited for it to catch  and hurled the bottle through the window .   there was a tinkle  a whoomph of exploding spirit  and a flame that rapidly grew .      nice one  sarge     said fred .     er  i don   t know if this is the right time  sarge  but we brought an extra bottle while we were about it           really  fred .  and what d   you say .      fred colon glanced at the prisoners again .      i say we use it     he said .   it went through one of the ground floor windows .  smoke was already curling out from under the eaves .      we haven   t seen anyone go in or out apart from those guards     said fred as they watched it .     i don   t reckon there   s many left in there .         just so long as we destroy the nest     said vimes .   the front door opened slightly  increasing the draft to the fires .  someone was checking .      they   ll wait until the last minute and come out fighting  fred     vimes warned .      good  sarge .  it   s getting darker     said colon grimly .  he pulled out his truncheon .   vimes walked around to the back of the building  nodded at the watchmen waiting there  and locked the door with his stolen key ring .  it was a narrow door  anyway .  anyone inside would surely go for the big doors at the front  where they could spread out quickly and an ambush wasn   t so easy .   he checked on the warehouse .  but that was an unlikely exit for the same reason .  besides  he   d locked the door to the cellar  hadn   t he .   young sam grinned at him .      that   s why you left the torturer tied up  eh  sarge .     he said .   damn .  that hadn   t occurred to him .  he   d been so angry with the clerk he   d forgotten all about the brute in the chair .   vimes hesitated .  but burning was a horrible death .  he reached for his knife  and remembered it was back in its sheath on his sword belt .  smoke was already drifting up the passage in the warehouse .      give me your knife  sam     he said .     i   ll just go and   check on him .      the lance constable handed over the knife with some reluctance .      what   re you going to do  sarge .         you just get on with your job  lance constable  and i   ll do mine        vimes slipped down into the passage .  i   ll cut one strap  he thought .  they   re fiddly to undo .  and then   well  he   ll have a chance  even in the smoke .  that   s more than anyone else got .   he crept through the office and into the chamber .   one torch was still alight  but the flame was just a nimbus in the yellow haze .  the man was trying to rock the heavy chair  but it had been secured firmly to the floor .   some thought had gone into that chair .  the straps on the buckles were hard to reach .  even if a prisoner got one hand free  and that hand had not yet felt the professionalism of the torturer  they   d have a job to get out of the chair in a hurry .   he reached down to cut a strap  and heard a key in the lock .   vimes stepped swiftly into the darker shadows .   the door opened  letting in the noise of distant shouting and the crackle of burning timber .  it sounded as though the unmentionables were making a run for the clear air of the street .   findthee swing stepped delicately into the room  and locked the door behind him .  he stopped when he saw the seated figure  and examined it carefully .  he walked to the office doorway and looked inside .  he peered into the cells  but by then vimes had moved soundlessly around a wall .   he heard findthee sigh .  there was the familiar sound of moving steel  followed by a small  organic sort of noise  and a cough .   vimes reached down for his sword .  but it was up on the road  too  wasn   t it     down here  the song in his head came back louder  with the background clink of metal that was always part of it   see how they rise up  rise up  rise up     he shook his head  as if that   d dislodge the memory .  he had to concentrate .   vimes ran into the room and made a leap .   it seemed to him that he stayed in the air a long time .  there was the torturer  blood on his shirt .  there was swing  just sliding the blade back into the stick .  and vimes  airborne  armed with only a knife .   i   m going to get out of this  he thought .  i know  because i remember this .  i remember keel coming out and saying it was all over .   but that was the real keel .  this is me .  it doesn   t have to happen the same way .   swing jerked aside with surprising speed  trying to tug the blade out again .  vimes hit the sacks on the wall  and had the sense to roll away immediately .  the blade slashed down beside him  spilling straw onto the floor .   he   d expected swing to be a bad swordsman .  that ridiculous stick suggested it .  but he turned out to be a street swordsman   no finesse  no fancy moves  just some talent at moving the blade quickly and sticking it where you hoped it wasn   t going to go .   fire crackled in the corner of the ceiling .  dripping spirit or sheer heat had worked itself through the heavy floorboards .  a couple of the sacks began to blossom thick white smoke  which rolled above the men in a spreading cloud .   he circled the chair  watching swing intently .      i believe you are making a gravemistake     said swing .   vimes concentrated on avoiding the sword .      hard times demand hardmeasures .  everyleader knows that        vimes dodged but continued circling  knife at the ready .      history needs its butchers as well as its shepherds  sergeant .      swing jabbed  but vimes had been watching his eyes  and swayed away in time .   the man wasn   t pleading .  he didn   t understand what had been done to require it .  but he could see vimes   s face .  there was no emotion in it at all .      you must understand that in times of nationalemergency we cannot be too concerned with the so called rights of        vimes darted sideways and along the haze filled corridor to the office .  swing lurched after him .  the blade sliced vimes on the back of the leg .  he sprawled onto the clerk   s desk  knife sliding into the shadows .   swing circled to find a stabbing point .  he drew back the sword     vimes   s hand came holding the steel ruler .  the smack of its flat steel against the blade knocked it right out of the captain   s grasp .   vimes pulled himself upright  following on the curve of the stroke .   send it back into the dark until you need it     he turned the ruler as the backstroke began and it whispered through the air edge first  leaving the hazy smoke rolling and coiling behind it .  the tip caught swing across the neck .   behind vimes  the white smoke tumbled out of the corridor .  the ceiling of the bloody chamber was falling in .   but he stayed  watching swing with the same blank  intent expression .  the man had raised his hands to his throat  blood spurting from between his fingers .  he rocked  gasping for a breath that couldn   t come  and fell backward .   vimes tossed the ruler on top of him  and limped away .   outside  there was the thunder of moving barricades .       swing opened his eyes .  the world around him was gray  except for the black clad figure in front of him .   he sought  as he always did  to learn more about the new person by carefully examining their features .      um  your eyes are   er   your nose is   your chin       he gave up .   yes  said death  i   m a bit of a tricky one .  this way  mr .  swing .       lord winder was  thought vetinari  impressively paranoid .  he   d even put a guard on the top of the whiskey distillery that overlooked the palace grounds .  two guards  in fact .   one of them was clearly visible as you rose over the parapet  but the other was lurking in the shadows by the chimneys .   the late hon .  john bleedwell had spotted only the first one .   vetinari watched impassively as the young man was dragged away .  if you were an assassin  being killed in the pursuit of your craft was all part of the job  albeit the last part .  you couldn   t complain .  and it meant there was only one guard now  the other one taking bleedwell  who had lived up to his name  downstairs .   bleedwell had worn black .  assassins always did .  black was cool  and  besides  it was the rules .  but only in a dark cellar at midnight was black a sensible color .  elsewhere  vetinari preferred dark green  or shades of dark gray .  with the right coloring  and the right stance  you vanished .  people   s eyes would help you vanish .  they erased you from their vision  they fitted you into the background .   of course  he   d be expelled from the guild if caught wearing such clothing .  he   d reasoned that this was much better than being expelled from the land of the upright and breathing .  he   d rather not be cool than be cold .   the guard  three feet away  lit a cigarette with no consideration for other people .   what a genius lord winstanleigh greville pipe had been .  what an observer .  havelock would have loved to have met him  or even to have visited his grave  but apparently that was somewhere inside a tiger which  to greville pipe   s gratified astonishment  he hadn   t spotted until it was too late .   he had done him a private honor  though .  he had hunted down and melted the engraver   s plates of some observations on the art of invisibility .   he tracked down the other four extant copies  too  but had felt unable to burn them .  instead  he   s had the slim volumes bound together inside the cover of anecdotes of the great accountants  vol .    .  he felt that lord winstanleigh greville pipe would rather appreciate that .   vetinari lay comfortably on the lead of the roof  patient as a cat  and watched the palace grounds below .       vimes lay face down on a table in the watch house  wincing occasionally .      please hold still     said doctor lawn .     i   ve nearly finished .  i suppose you   d laugh if i told you to take it easy .         ha .  ha .  uh .         it   s only a flesh wound  but you ought to get some rest .         ha .  ha .         you   ve got a busy night ahead of you .  so have i  i suspect .         we should be okay if we   ve got the barricades all the way to easy street     said vimes  and was aware of a telling silence .   he turned over and sat up on the table that lawn was using as a bench .      we have got them to easy street  haven   t we .     he demanded .      the last i heard  yes     said the doctor .      the last you heard .         well  technically no     said lawn .     it   s all getting   bigger  john .  the actual last i heard was someone saying     why stop at easy street .            oh  good grief           yes .  i thought so  too .      vimes dragged his breeches up  fastened his belt  and limped out into the road and an argument .   there was rosie palm  and sandra  and reg shoe  and half a dozen others sitting around another table  in the middle of the street .  as vimes stepped out into the evening  a plaintive voice said     you cannot fight for    reasonably priced love .            you can if you want me and the rest of the girls on board     said rosie .        free    is not a word we wish to see used in these circumstances .         oh  very well     said reg  making a note on a clipboard .     we   re all happy with truth  justice  and freedom  are we .         and better sewers .     this was the voice of mrs .  rutherford .     and something done about the rats .         i think we should be thinking about higher things  comrade mrs .  rutherford     said reg .      i am not a comrade  mr .  shoe  and nor is mr .  rutherford     said mrs .  rutherford .     we   ve always kept ourselves to ourselves  haven   t we  sidney .         i   ve got a question     said someone in the crowd of onlookers .     harry supple   s my name .  got a shoe shop in new cobblers        reg seized on this as an opportunity to avoid talking to mrs .  rutherford .  revolutionaries should not have to meet someone like mrs .  rutherford on their first day .      yes  comrade supple .     he said .      nor are we boyjoys     said mrs .  rutherford  not willing to let things go .      er  bourgeoisie     said reg .     our manifesto refers to bourgeoisie .  that   s like bore  er  zhwah  er  zee .         bourgeoisie  bourgeoisie     said mrs .  rutherford  turning the word over on her tongue .     that   doesn   t sound too bad .  what  er  sort of thing do they do .         anyway  it says here in article seven of this here list       mr .  supple ploughed on .         people   s declaration of the glorious   th of may     said reg .      yeah  yeah  right   well  it says we   ll seize hold of the means of production  sort of thing  so what i want to know is  how does that work out regarding my shoe shop .  i mean  i   m in it anyway  right .  it   s not like there   s room for more   n me and my lad garbut and maybe one customer .      in the dark  vimes smiled .  but reg could never see stuff coming .      ah  but after the revolution all property will be held in common by the people   er   that is  it   ll belong to you but also to everyone else  you see .      comrade supple looked puzzled .      but i   ll be the one making the shoes .         of course .  but everything will belong to the people .         so   who   s going to pay for the shoes .     said mr supple .      everyone will pay a reasonable price for their shoes  and you won   t be guilty of living off the sweat of the common worker     said reg shortly .     now  if we           you mean the cows .     said supple .      what .         well  there   s only the cows  and the lads at the tannery  and  frankly  all they do is stand in a field all day  well  not the tannery boys  obviously  but           look     said reg .     everything will belong to the people and everyone will be better off .  do you understand .      the shoemaker   s frown grew deeper .  he wasn   t certain if he was part of the people .      i thought we just didn   t want soldiers down our street  and mobs  and all that lot     he said .   reg had a hunted look .  he made a dive for safety .     well  at least we can agree on truth  freedom  and justice  yes .      there was a chorus of nods .  everyone wanted those .  they didn   t cost anything .   a match flared in the dark  and they turned to see vimes light a cigar .      you   d like freedom  truth  and justice  wouldn   t you  comrade sergeant .     said reg encouragingly .      i   d like a hard boiled egg     said vimes  shaking the match out .   there was some nervous laughter  but reg looked offended .      in the circumstances  sergeant  i think we should set our sights a little higher           well  yes  we could     said vimes  coming down the steps .  he glanced at the sheets of paper in front of reg .  the man cared .  he really did .  and he was serious .  he really was .     but   well  reg  tomorrow the sun will come up again  and i   m pretty sure that whatever happens we won   t have found freedom  and there won   t be a whole lot of justice  and i   m damn sure we won   t have found truth .  but it   s just possible that i might get a hard boiled egg .  what   s this all about  reg .         the people   s republic of treacle mine road .     said reg proudly .     we are forming a government .         oh  good     said vimes .     another one .  just what we need .  now  does any one of you know where my damn barricades have gone .            ullo  mr .  keel     said a glutinous voice .   he looked down beside him .  there  still wearing his hugely oversized coat but now with the addition of a helmet much too large for him  was nobby nobbs .      how did you get there  nobby .         my mum says i   m insidious     said nobby  grinning .  a concertina sleeve rose to the vicinity of nobby   s head  and vimes realized that somewhere in there was a salute .      she   s right     said vimes .     so  where              m an acting constable now  sarge     said nobby .     mr .  colon said so .  gave me a spare helmet .     m carvin    meself a badge out of  of   what   s that  like  waxy  kind of like candles but you can   t eat it .         soap  nobby .  remember the word .         right  sarge .  then i   m gonna carve a           where have the barricades gone  nobby .         that   ll cost           i am your sergeant  nobby .  we are not in a financial relationship .  tell me where the bloody barricades are .         um   prob   ly nearly to short street  sarge .  it   s all got a bit   metaphysical  sarge .          major clive mountjoy standfast stared blankly at the map in front of him  trying to find some comfort .  he was  tonight  the senior officer in the field .  the commanders had gone to the palace for some party or other .  and he was in charge .   vimes had conceded that the city   s regiments had quite a few officers who weren   t fools .  admittedly  they got fewer the higher you went  but by accident or design every army needs  in key if unglamorous posts  men who can reason and make lists and arrange for provisions and baggage wagons and  in general  have an attention span greater than that of a duck .  it   s their job to actually run things  leaving the commanding officer free to concentrate on higher matters .   and the major was  indeed  not a fool  even though he looked like one .  he was idealistic  and thought of his men as    jolly good chaps    despite the occasional evidence to the contrary  and on the whole did the best he could with the moderate intelligence at his disposal .  when he was a boy  he   d read books about great military campaigns  and visited the museums and had looked with patriotic pride at the paintings of famous cavalry charges  last stands  and glorious victories .  it had come as rather a shock  when he later began to participate in some of these  to find that the painters had unaccountably left out the intestines .  perhaps they just weren   t very good at them .   the major hated the map .  it was the map of a city .  a city wasn   t a place for cavalry  for heaven   s sake .  of course  there had been casualties among the men .  three of them had been deaths .  even a cavalry helmet is not a lot of use against a ballistic cobblestone .  and a trooper had been pulled off his horse in dolly sisters and  bluntly  mobbed to death .  and that was tragic and terrible and  unfortunately  inevitable  once fools had decided to use cavalry in a city with as many alleys as ankh morpork .   the major didn   t think of his superiors as fools  of course  since that would follow that everyone who obeyed them were fools .  he used the term    unwise     and felt worried when he used it .   as for the rest of the casualties  three of them had been men knocked senseless by riding into hanging shop signs while pursuing   well  people  when it came down to it  because with the smoke and darkness who could tell who the real enemy was .  the idiots had apparently assumed that anyone running away was the enemy .  and they   d been the luckier idiots  because men who rode their horses into dark alleys  which twisted this way and that and got narrower and narrower  and then realized that it had all gone quiet and their horse couldn   t turn around  well  they were men who learned how fast a man could run in cavalry boots .   he totted up the reports .  broken bones  bruises  one man suffering from    friendly stab    by a comrade   s saber     he looked across the makeshift table at captain tom wrangle of lord selachii   s light infantry  who glanced up from his own paperwork and gave him a weak smile .  they   d been at school together  and wrangle  the major knew  was a lot brighter than him .      what   s it look like to you  tom .     said the major .      we   ve lost nearly eighty men     said the captain .      what .  that   s terrible .         oh  about sixty of them are deserters  as far as i can see .  you tend to get that in this sort of mess .  some have probably just popped home to see dear ol    mum .         oh  deserters .  we   ve had some of those  too .  in the cavalry .  what would you call a man who leaves his horse behind .         an infantryman .  as for the rest  well  as far as i can see only six or seven of them went down to definite enemy action .  three men got stabbed in alleyways  for example .         sounds like enemy action to me .         yes  clive .  but you were born in quirm .         only because my mother was visiting her aunt and the coach was late .     said the major  going red .     if you cut me in half  you   d find ankh morpork written on my heart .         really .  well  let   s hope it doesn   t come to that     said tom .     anyway  getting murdered in alleyways is just part of life in the big city .         but they were armed men .  swords  helmets           valuable loot  clive .         but i thought the city watch took care of the gangs        tom looked at his friend over the top of his paperwork .      are you suggesting that we ask for police protection .  anyway  there isn   t any  not anymore .  some of the watchmen are with us  for what good they are  and the rest either got beaten up or ran away           more deserters .         frankly  clive  everyone   s drifting away so fast that by tomorrow we   ll be feeling pretty lonely .      the men paused as a corporal brought in some more messages .  they thumbed through them gloomily .      well  it   s gone quiet  anyway     said the major .      suppertime     said the captain .   the major threw up his hands .     this isn   t war .  a man throws a rock  walks around the corner  and he   s an upstanding citizen again .  there   s no rules .      the captain nodded .  their training hadn   t covered this sort of thing .  they   d studied maps of campaigns  with broad sweeping plains and the occasional patch of high ground that had to be taken .  cities were to be laid siege to  or defended .  they weren   t for fighting in .  you couldn   t see  you couldn   t group  you couldn   t maneuver and you were always going to be up against people who knew the place like their own kitchen .  and you definitely didn   t want to fight an enemy that had no uniform .      where   s your lordship .     said the captain .      gone to the ball  the same as yours .         and what were your orders  may i ask .         he told me to do whatever i considered necessary to carry out our original objectives .         did he write that down .         no     said the major .      pity .  neither did mine .      they looked at one another .  and then wrangle said     well   there   s no actual unrest at the moment .  as such .  my father said all this happened in his time .  he said it   s best just to keep the lid on it .  there   s only a limited number of cobblestones  he said .         it   s almost ten     said the major .     people will be going to bed soon  surely .      their joint expression radiated the fervent hope that it had all calmed down .  no one in their right mind wanted to be in a position where he was expected to do what he thought best .      well  clive  provided there   s no       the captain began .   there was a commotion outside the tent  and then a man stepped inside .  he was bloodstained and smoke blackened  his face lined with pink where sweat had trickled through the dreadful grime .  a crossbow was slung across his back  and he   d acquired a bandolier of knives .   and he was mad .  the major recognized the look .  the eyes were too bright  the grin too fixed .      ah  right     he said and removed a large brass knuckle duster from his right hand .     sorry about your sentry  gen   elmen  but he didn   t want to let me in even though i gave him the password .  are you in charge .         who the hell are you .     said the major  standing up .   the man seemed unimpressed .      carcer .  sergeant carcer     he said .      a sergeant .  in that case  you can           from cable street     carcer added .   now the major hesitated .  both the soldiers knew about the unmentionables  although  if asked  they probably wouldn   t have been able to articulate exactly what it was that they knew .  unmentionables worked in secret  behind the scenes .  they were a lot more than just watchmen .  they reported directly to the patrician  they had a lot of pull .  you didn   t mess with them .  they were not people to cross .  it didn   t matter that this man was only a sergeant .  he was an unmentionable .   and  what was worse  the major realized that the creature could see what he was thinking and was enjoying the view .      yeah     said carcer .     that   s right .  and it   s lucky for you that i   m here  soldier boy .      soldier boy  thought the major .  and there were men listening  who   d remember that .  soldier boy .      how so .     he said .      while you and your shiny soldiers have been prancing around chasing washerwomen     said carcer  pulling up the tent   s only vacant chair and sitting down     the real trouble   s been happening down in treacle mine road .  you know it .         what are you talking about .  we haven   t had any reports about any disturbances down there  man .         yeah  right .  don   t you think that   s strange .      the major hesitated .  a vague memory bobbed at the back of his mind   and there was a grunt from the captain  who pushed a piece of paper across to him .  he glanced at it  and recalled .      one of my captains was down there this afternoon and said everything was under control     he said .      really .  whose control .     said carcer .  he leaned back in his chair and put his boots on the desk .   the major stared at them  but the boots showed no sign of embarrassment .      remove your feet from my desk     he said coldly .   carcer   s eyes narrowed .      you an    whose army .     he said .      mine  as a matter of fact        the major looked into carcer   s eyes  and wished he hadn   t .  mad .  he   d seen eyes like that on the battlefield .   very slowly  with exaggerated care  carcer swung his feet off the table .  then he pulled out a handkerchief made grimy with unguessable humors  huffed theatrically on the wood  and polished it industriously .      i do beg your pardon so very much     he said .     however  while you gentlemen have been keeping your desk nice and clean  a canker  as they say  haha  is eating at the very heart of the city .  has anyone told you that the cable street watch house has been burned to the ground .  with  we believe  the loss of the lives of poor captain swing and at least one of our   technical people .         swing  bigods     said captain wrangle .      that is what i said .  all the scum your lads have been driving out of dolly sisters and all the other nests  well  they   ve ended up down there .      the major looked at the report .     but our patrol said that everything seemed to be in hand  the watch were very visible on the streets  and people were showing the flag and singing the national anthem     he said .      there you are  then     said carcer .     do you ever sing the national anthem in the street  major .         well  no           who did his lordship send down there .     said wrangle .   major mountjoy standfast thumbed through his papers .  his face fell .      rust     he said .      oh dear .  that   s a blow .         i daresay the man is dead     said carcer  and the major tried not to look slightly more cheerful .     the person in charge down there now calls himself sergeant keel .  but he is an impostor .  the real keel is in the mortuary .         how do you know all this .     said the major .      we in the particulars have ways of finding things out     said carcer .      i   ve heard     murmured the captain .      martial law  gentlemen  means that the military comes to the aid of the civil power     said carcer .     and that   s me  right now .  o   course  you could send a couple of runners up to the ball  but i don   t reckon that would be a good career move .  so what i   m asking is for your men to assist us with a little   surgical strike .      the major stared at him .  there was now no limit to the distaste he had for carcer .  but he hadn   t been a major for very long  and when you   ve just been promoted you hope to stay that way long enough for the braid to get a tarnish .   he forced himself to smile .      you and your men have had a long day  sergeant     he said .     why don   t you go along to the mess tent while i consult with my fellow officers .      carcer moved with a suddenness that made the major flinch .  the sergeant stood up  and then leaned forward with his knuckles on the desk .      you do that  sunny jim     he said with a grin like the edge of a rusty saw .  then he turned and strode out into the night .   in the silence that followed  the captain said     his name is on the list of officers that swing sent us yesterday  i   m afraid .  and  er  he   s technically correct about the law .         you mean we have to take orders from him .         no .  but he   s entitled to request assistance from you .         am i entitled to refuse .         oh  yes .  of course .  but              i   d have to tell his lordship why .     said the major .      exactly .         but that man   s an evil bastard .  you know the sort .  the kind that joins up for the pillaging .  the kind you have to end up hanging as an example to the men .         um       said captain wrangle .      what now .         well  he   s right about one thing .  i   ve been looking at the reports and  well  it   s odd .  it   s all been very quiet down toward treacle mine road .         that   s good  isn   t it .         it   s unbelievable  clive  when you put it all together .  even the watch house didn   t get attacked  it says here .  er   and your captain burns says he met this keel chap  or someone who said he was keel  and he says that if the man   s a watch sergeant then he  burns  is a monkey   s uncle .  he said the man is used to serious command .  i think he rather took to him  to tell you the truth .         ye gods  tom  i need some help here .     said the major .      then send out some gallopers right away .  a little informal patrolling  perhaps .  get some proper intelligence .  you can afford to wait half an hour .         right .  right .  good idea .     said the major  steaming with relief .     see to it  could you .      after the flurry of orders  he sat back and stared at the map .  some things at least made sense .  all these barricades looked inward .  people were barricading themselves against the palace and the center of the city .  no one would be bothered much about the outside world .  if you had to take an outlying part of the city in those circumstances  then the thing to do would be to go in via a gatehouse in the city wall .  they might not be quite so guarded as they ought to be .      tom .         yes  clive .         have you ever sung the national anthem .         oh  lots of times  sir .         i don   t mean officially .         you mean just to show i   m patriotic .  good gods  no .  that would be a rather odd thing to do     said the captain .      and how about the flag .         well  obviously i salute it every day  sir .         but you don   t wave it  at all .     the major enquired .      i think i waved a paper one a few times when i was a little boy .  patrician   s birthday or something .  we stood in the streets as he rode by and we shouted    hurrah .            never since then .         well  no  clive     said the captain  looking embarrassed .     i   d be very worried if i saw a man singing the national anthem and waving the flag  sir .  it   s really a thing foreigners do .         really .  why .         we don   t need to show we   re patriotic  sir .  i mean  this is ankh morpork .  we don   t have to make a big fuss about being the best  sir .  we just know .          it was a beguiling theory that had arisen in the minds of wiglet  and waddy  and  yes  even in the not overly exercised mind of fred colon  and as far as vimes could understand it  it went like this .       supposing the area behind the barricades was bigger than the area in front of the barricades  right .   like  sort of  it had more people in it and more of the city  if you follow me .   then  correct me if i   m wrong  sarge  but that   d mean in a manner of speaking we are now in front of the barricades  am i right .   then  as it were  it   s not like we   re rebellin     is it .     cos there   s more of us  so the majority can   t rebel  it stands to reason .   so that makes us the good guys .  obviously we   ve been the good guys all along  but now it   d be kind of official  right .  like  mathematical .   so  we thought we   d push on to short street and then we could nip down into dimwell and up the other side of the river     are we going to get into trouble for this  sarge .   you   re looking at me in a funny way  sarge .   sorry  sarge .       vimes  with an increasingly worried fred colon in front of him  and some of the other barricadeers standing around as if caught in an illicit game of knocking on doors and running away  thought about this .  the men watched him carefully  in case of explosion .  and it actually had a weird kind of logic  if you didn   t factor in considerations like    real life    and    common sense .      they   d worked hard .  it was easy enough to block a city street  heavens knew .  you just nailed planks around a couple of wagons and piled it high with furniture and junk .  that took care of the main streets  and with enough pushing you could move it forward .   as for the rest  it really hadn   t been that hard .  there had been lots of small barricades in any case .  the lads had simply joined them up .  without anyone really noticing  the people   s republic of treacle mine road now occupied almost a quarter of the city .   vimes took a few deep breaths .      fred .     he said .      yes  sarge .         did i tell you to do this .         no  sarge .         there   s too many alleys .  there   s too many people  fred .      colon brightened .     ah  well  there   s more coppers too  sarge .  a lot of the lads found their way here .  good lads  too .  and sergeant dickins  he knows about this stuff  he remembers the last time this happened  sarge  so he asked every able bodied man who knew how to use a weapon to muster up  sarge .  there   s a lot of    em  sarge .  we got a army  sarge .      this is how the world collapses  thought vimes .  i was just a young fool  i didn   t see it like this .  i thought keel was leading the revolution .  i wonder if that   s what he thought  too .   but i just wanted to keep a few streets safe .  i just wanted to keep a handful of decent  silly people away from the dumb mobs and the mindless rebels and the idiot soldiery .  i really  really hoped we could get away with it .   maybe the monks were right .  changing history is like damming a river .  it   ll find its way around .   he saw sam beaming among the men .  hero worship  he thought .  that sort of thing can turn you blind .      any trouble .     he said .      don   t think anyone   s worked out what   s happening here  sarge .  there   s been a lot happening around dolly sisters and over that way .  cavalry charges and what have you   hold on  here come some more .      a watchman had signaled from the top of the barricade .  vimes heard the commotion on the other side of the pile .      more people runnin    away from dolly sisters  by the look of it     said colon .     what d   you want us to do  sarge .      keep them out  thought vimes .  we don   t know who they are .  we can   t let everyone in .  some of them will be trouble .   the trouble is  i know what   s going on out there .  the city is a little slice of hell  and there   s no real safety anywhere .   and i know what i   m going to decide  because i watch me decide it .   i don   t believe this .  i   m standing over there now  a kid who   s still clean and pink and full of ideals  looking at me as if i   m some kind of hero .  i don   t dare not to be .  i   m going to make the stupid decision because i don   t want to look bad in front of myself .  try explaining that to anyone who hasn   t had a couple of drinks .      all right  let them through     he said .     but no weapons .  pass the word around .         take weapons off people .     said colon .      think about it  fred .  we don   t want unmentionables in here  do we  or soldiers in disguise .  a man   s got to be vouched for before he can carry arms .  i ain   t going to be stabbed in the back and the front at the same time .  oh  and fred   i don   t know if i can do this  and probably it won   t last  but as far as i   m concerned  you   re promoted to sergeant .  anyone who wants to argue about the extra stripe  tell    em to argue with me .      fred colon   s chest  already running to fat  swelled visibly .      right  sarge .  er   does that mean i still take orders from you .  right .  right .  right .  i still take orders from you .  right .         don   t move any more barricades .  fill up the alleys .  hold this line .  vimes  you come with me  i   ll need a runner .         i   m pretty runny  sarge     nobby volunteered from somewhere behind him .      then what i want you to do  nobby  is get out there and find out what   s happening now .      sergeant dickins turned out to be younger than vimes remembered .  but he was still close to retirement .  he   d maintained a flourishing sergeant   s mustache  waxed to points and clearly dyed  and the proper sergeant shape  occasioned by means of undisclosed corsetry .  he   d spent a lot of time in the regiments  vimes recalled  although he came from llamedos originally .  the men found that out because he belonged to some druid religion so strict that they didn   t even use standing stones .  and they were strongly against swearing  which is a real handicap in a sergeant .  or would be  if sergeants weren   t so good at improvising .   he was currently in welcome soap  a continuation of cable street .  and he had the army .   it wasn   t much of one .  no two weapons were exactly alike  and most of them were not  strictly speaking  weapons .  vimes shuddered when he saw the crowd  and had a flashback  which was probably a flash forward  to all the domestic disputes he   d attended over the years .  you knew where you were with strictly speaking weapons when they came at you .  it was the not strictly speaking ones that scared the cacky out of a new recruit .  it was the meat cleavers tied to poles .  it was the long spikes and the meathooks .   this was  after all  the area of small traders  porters  butchers  and longshoremen .  and so  standing in raggedy lines in front of vimes  were men who  every day  peacefully and legally  handled things with blades and spikes that made a mere sword look like a girl   s hatpin .   there were classic weapons  too .  men had come back from wars with their sword or their halberd .  weapons .  gods bless you  sir  no .  them   s mementoes .  and the sword had probably been used to poke the fire  and the halberd had done duty as a support for one end of the washing line  and their original use had been forgotten        until now .   vimes stared at all that metalwork .  all this lot would have to do to win a battle would be to stand still .  if the enemy charged them hard enough  he   d come out the other side as mince .      some of    em are retired watchmen  sah     dickins whispered .     a lot of them have been in the regiments at one time or another  see .  there   s a few kids wanting to see some action  you know how it is .  what d   you think .         i   d certainly hate to fight them     said vimes .  at least a quarter of the men had white hair  and more than a few were using their weapons as a means of support .     come to that  i   d hate to be responsible for giving them an order .  if i said    about turn .     to this lot  it   d be raining limbs .         they   re resolute  sah .         fair enough .  but i don   t want a war .         oh  it won   t come to that  sah     said dickins .     i   ve seen a few barricades in my time .  it generally ends peaceful .  the new man takes over  people get bored  everyone goes home  see .         but winder is a nutter     said vimes .      tell me one that wasn   t  sah     said dickins .   sir  thought vimes .  or    sah     at least .  and he   s older than me .  oh well  i might as well be good at it .      sergeant     he said     i want you to pick twenty of the best .  men that have seen action .  men you can trust .  and i want them down at the shambling gate  and alert .      dickins looked puzzled .      but that   s barred  sah .  and it   s right down behind us  it is .  i thought maybe           down at the gate  sergeant     vimes insisted .     they   re to watch for anyone sneaking up to unbar it .  and i want the guard on the bridges to be strengthened .  put down caltrops on the bridge  string wires   i want anyone who tries to come at us over the bridge to have a really bad time  understand .         do you know something  sah .     said dickins  with his head on one side .      let   s just say i   m thinking like the enemy  shall we .     said vimes .  he took a step closer and lowered his voice .     you know some history  dai .  no one with an ounce of sense goes up against a barricade .  you find the weakness .         there   s other gates down there  sah     said dickins doubtfully .      yes  but if they take shambling they get right into elm street and have a nice long gallop  right into where we   re not expecting them     said vimes .      but   you are expecting them  sah .      vimes just gave him a blank look  which sergeants are quite good at deciphering .      as good as done  sah .     said dickins happily .      but i want a decent presence at all the barricades     said vimes .     and a couple of patrols that can go wherever there   s trouble .  sergeant  you know how to do it .         right  sah .     dickins saluted smartly and grinned .   he turned to the assembled citizenry .      all right  you shower .     he yelled .     some of you has been in a regiment  i know it .  how many of you knows    all the little angels    .      a few of the more serious class of mementoes rose in the air .      very good .  already we has a choir .  now  this is a soldier   s song  see .  you don   t look like soldiers but by the gods i   ll see you sounds like    em .  you   ll pick it up as we goes along .  right turn .  march .     all the little angels rise up  rise up  all the little angels rise up high .     sing it  you sons of mothers .      the marchers picked up the response from those who knew it .      how do they rise up  rise up  rise up  how do they rise up  rise up high .  they rise heads up  heads up  heads up       sang out dickins as they turned the corner .   vimes listened as the refrain died away .      that   s a nice song     said young sam  and vimes realized that he was hearing it for the first time .      it   s an old soldiers    song     he said .      really  sarge .  but it   s about angels .      yes  thought vimes  and it   s amazing what bits those angels cause to rise up as the song progresses .  it   s a real soldiers    song  sentimental  with dirty bits .      as i recall  they used to sing it after battles     he said .     i   ve seen old men cry when they sing it     he added .      why .  it sounds cheerful .      they were remembering who they were not singing it with  thought vimes .  you   ll learn .  i know you will .       after a while  the patrols came back .  major mountjoy standfast was bright enough not to ask for written reports .  they took too long and weren   t very well spelled .  one by one  the men told the story .  sometimes captain wrangle  who was plotting things on the map  would whistle under his breath .      it   s huge  sir .  it really is .  nearly a quarter of the city   s behind barricades down there .      major rubbed his forehead and turned to trooper gabitass  the last man in and the one who seemed to have taken pains to get the most information .      they   re all on a sort of line  sir .  so i rode up to the one in heroes street  with me helmet off and looking off duty  sort of thing  and i asked what was it all about .  a man shouted down that everything was all right  thank you very much  and they   d finished all the barricades for now .  i said what about law and order  and they said we   ve got plenty  thank you .         no one fired at you .         no  sir .  wish i could say the same round here  people were throwing stones at me and an old lady empty a pissp   a utensil all over me from her window .  er   there   s something else  sir .  er           out with it  man .         i  er  think i recognized a few people .  up on the barricades .  er   they were some of ours  sir            vimes shut his eyes in the hope that the world might become a better place .  but when he opened them  it was still full of the pink face of only just sergeant colon .      fred     he said     i wonder if you fully understand the basic idea here .  the soldiers   that   s the other people  fred   they stay on the outside of the barricade .  if they are in the inside  fred  we don   t  in any real sense  have a bloody barricade .  do you understand .         yes  sir .  but           you want to do a spell in a regiment  fred  and one of the things i think you   ll find they   re very hot on indeed is knowing who   s on your side and who is not  fred .         but  sir  they are           i mean  how long have i known you  fred .         two or three days  sir .         er   right .  yeah .  of course .  seems longer .  so why  fred  do i arrive here and find you   ve let in what seems like a platoon .  you haven   t been thinking metaphysically again  have you .         it started with billy wiglet   s brother  sir     said colon nervously .     a few of his mates came with him .  all local lads .  and there   s a lad nancyball grew up with and a bloke who   s the son of waddy   s next door neighbor who he used to go out drinking with  and then there   s           how many  fred .     said vimes wearily .      sixty  sir .  might be a few more by now .         and it doesn   t occur to you that they might be part of some clever plan .         no  sarge  it never did .     cos i can   t see wally wiglet being part of a clever plan  sarge  on account of him not being much of a thinker  sir  they only allowed him to be in the regiment after he got someone to paint l and r on his boots .  see  we know    em all  sarge .  most of the lads join up for a bit  just to get out of the city and maybe show johnny foreigner who   s boss .  they never expected to have old grannies spitting on them in their own city  sarge .  that can get a lad down  that sort of thing .  and getting cobblestones chucked up them too  of course .      vimes gave in .  it was all true .      all right     he said .     but if this goes on  everyone is going to be inside the barricade  fred .      and there could be worse ways of ending it  he thought .   people had lit fires in the streets .  some cooking pots had been brought out .  but most of the people were engaging in ankh morpork   s traditional pastime  which was hanging around to see what   d happen next .      what   s going to happen next  sarge .     said sam .      i think they   ll attack in two places     said vimes .     the cavalry will go right outside the city and try and come in through the shambling gate because that   ll look easy .  and the soldiers and   the rest of the watch who aren   t on our side will probably creep across mis begot bridge under cover .         are you sure  sir .         positive     said vimes .  after all  it had already happened   or something     he pinched the bridge of his nose .  he couldn   t quite remember when he   d slept last .  slept  not dozed or been unconscious .  he knew his thinking was a little fuzzy around the edges .  but he did know how the treacle mine road barricade had been broken .  it had only been one sentence in the history book  but he remembered it .  sieges that weren   t broken via treachery were breached via some small door around the back .  it was a fact of history .      but it won   t be for an hour or two     he said aloud .     we   re not important enough .  it   s all been quiet down here .  it   s when they start to wonder why that the midden will hit the windmill .         lots of people are getting through  sarge .  some of the men said they could hear screaming in the distance .  people are just piling in .  there   s robberies and everything going on out there           lance constable .         yes  sarge .         you know when you wanted to swing a club at that torturing bastard and i stopped you .         yes  sarge .         that   s why  lad .  once we break down  it all breaks down .         yes  sarge  but you do bop people over the head .         interesting point  lance constable .  logical and well made  too  in a clear tone of voice bordering on the bloody cheeky .  but there   s a big difference .         and what   s that  sarge .         you   ll find out     said vimes .  and privately thought  the answer is  it   s me doing it .  i   ll grant that it is not a good answer  because people like carcer use it  too  but that   s what it boils down to .  of course  it   s also to stop me knifing them and  let   s be frank  them knifing me .  that   s quite important  too .   their walk had brought them to a big fire in the center of the street .  a cauldron was bubbling on it  and people were queuing up  holding bowls .      smells good     he said to the figure gently stirring the cauldron   s contents with a ladle .     oh  it   s you  er  mr .  dibbler           it   s called victory stew  sergeant     said dibbler .     tuppence a bowl or i   ll cut my throat  eh .         close enough     said vimes  and looked at the strange  and  what was worse  occasionally hauntingly familiar  lumps seething in the scum .     what   s in it .         it   s stew     explained dibbler .     strong enough to put hairs on your chest .         yes  i can see that some of those bits of meat have got bristles on them already     said vimes .      right .  that   s how good it is .         it looks   very nice     said sam weakly .      you   ll have to excuse the lance constable  mr .  dibbler     said vimes .     the poor lad was brought up not to eat stew that winks at him .      he sat down with his bowl  and his back against the wall  and looked up at the barricade .  people had been busy .  in truth  there wasn   t much else to do .  the one here  from side to side of heroes street  was fourteen feet high and even had a crude walkway .  it looked businesslike .   he leaned back and shut his eyes .   there was a hesitant slurping sound beside him as young sam tried the stew  and then     is it going to come down to fighting  sarge .         yes     said vimes without opening his eyes .      like  really fighting .         yep .         but won   t there be some talking first .         nope     said vimes  trying to make himself comfortable .     maybe some talking afterward .         seems the wrong way round .         yes  lad  but it   s a tried and tested method .      there was no further comment .  slowly  with the sounds of the street in his ears  vimes slid into sleep .       major mountjoy standfast knew what would happen if he sent a message to the palace .     what do i do now  sir .     was not something his lordship wanted to hear .  it was not the sort of question a major was supposed to ask  given that the original orders had been very clear .  barricades were to be torn down  rebels were to be repelled .  grasp the nettle firmly and all that .  he had  as a child  grasped nettles firmly  and had sometimes had a hand the size of a small pig .   there were deserters behind the barricade .  deserters .  how did that happen .   it was a huge barricade  it was lined with armed men  there were deserters on it  and he had his orders .  it was all clear .   if only they   d  well  rebel .  he   d sent trooper gabitass down there again  and by his account it seemed very peaceful .  normal city life appeared to be going on behind the barricade  which was more than you could say for the chaos outside it .  if they   d fired on gabitass  or thrown things  that would have made it so much easier .  instead they were acting   well   decently .  that was no way for enemies of the state to behave .   an enemy of the state was in front of the major now .  gabitass had not come back empty handed .      caught it sneakin    after me     he said .  to the captive  he said     been behind the barricade  haven   t we  my lad .         can it speak .     said the major  staring at the thing .      there   s no need to be like that     said nobby nobbs .      it   s a street urchin  sir     said the trooper .   the major stared at all he could see of the prisoner  which was an oversized helmet and a nose .      get it something to stand on  will you  captain .     he said  and waited while a stool was found .  it did not  all things considered  improve matters .  it just gave rise to questions .      it   s got a watch badge  trooper .  is it some kind of mascot .         carved it meself out of soap     said nobby .     so i can be a copper .         why .     said the major .  there was something about the apparition that  despite the urgency  called for a kind of horrified yet fascinated study .      but i   m thinking of going for a soldier if i grow up     nobby went on  giving the major a happy grin .     much better pickin   s  the way things are going .         i   m afraid you   ll never be tall enough     said the major quickly .      don   t see why not  the enemy reaches all the way to the ground     said nobby .     anyway  people   re lying    down when you get their boots off .  ol    sconner  he says the money   s in teeth and earrings  but i say every man   s bound to have a pair of boots  right .  whereas there   s a lot of bad teeth around these days and the false teeth makers always demand a decent set           do you mean to tell me that you want to join the army just to loot the battlefields .     said the major  completely shocked .     a little   lad like you .         once when ol    sconner was sober for two days together he made me a little set of soldiers     said nobby .     an    they had these little boots that you could           shut up     said the major .         take off  and tiny tiny little wooden teeth that you could           will you shut up .     said the major .     have you no interest in honor .  glory .  love of city .         dunno .  can you get much for    em .     said nobby .      they are priceless .         oh  well  in that case i   ll stick with the boots  if it   s all the same to you     said nobby .     you can sell them for ten pence a pair if you know the right shop           look at trooper gabitass there .     said the major  now quite upset .     twenty years service  a fine figure of a soldier .  he wouldn   t stoop to stealing the boots of a fallen enemy  would you  trooper .         no  sir .  mug   s game  sir .     said trooper gabitass .       er   yes .  right .     said the major .     you could learn a lot from men like trooper gabitass  master nobbs .  by the sound of it  your time with the rebels has filled your head with very wrong ideas indeed .         i ain   t a rebel .     nobby shouted .     don   t you go calling me a rebel  i ain   t a rebel  i   m an ankh morpork lad  i am  and proud of it .  hah  you are wrong  i   ve never been a rebel and you   re cruel to say so .  i   m an honest lad  i am .      big tears began to run down his cheeks  washing aside the grime to reveal the lower strata of grime beneath .   the major had no experience of this sort of thing .  every available orifice on the little lad   s face seemed to be gushing .  he looked for help to gabitass .      you   re a married man  aren   t you  trooper .  what am we supposed to do now .         i could give him a clout alongside the ear  sir     said trooper gabitass .      that   s very unfeeling  trooper .  look here  i had a handkerchief on me somewhere           huh  i have my own wiper  thank you very much  i don   t have to be condescended at     sniffed nobby and pulled one out of his pocket .  in fact  he pulled several dozen  including one with the initials c and m s on it .  they were tangled together like a conjuror   s flags of all nations  and dragged with them several purses and half a dozen spoons .   nobby wiped his face with the first one  and thrust the entire collection back into his pocket .  at this point  he realized that all the men were staring at him .      what .  what .     he said defiantly .      tell us about this man keel     said the major .      i don   t know nuffin        said nobby automatically .      aha  that means you do know something     said the major  who was indeed the kind of person who liked this kind of little triumph .   nobby looked blank .  the captain leaned forward to whisper to his superior officer .      er  only under the rules of mathematics  sir     he said .     under the rules of common grammar  he is merely being emphat           tell us about keel .     the major shouted .      tell you what  major  why not leave that sort of thing to the experts .     said a voice .   the major looked up .  carcer and his men had entered the tent .  the sergeant was grinning again .      got yourself a little prisoner  have you .     he said  stepping forward to examine nobby .     reckon you   ve got a ringleader here  yeah .  told you anything  has he .  i shouldn   t think so .  you need special training to get the best out of lads like this  haha .      he slipped his hand into his pocket .  when it came out  the knuckles were ringed with brass .      now then  lad     he said  as the soldiers watched in horror .     you know who i am  do you .  i   m in the particulars  me .  and i can see two of you .  one of them   s a lively lad who   s going to help the proper authorities with their business  and the other is a lippy little bugger who   s going to try to be clever .  one of these lads has a future and all his teeth .  now the funny thing about me  it   s a little habit of mine  is that i never ask a question twice .  so   you   re not a criminal  are you .      nobby  his eyes huge and fixed on the brass knuckles  shook his head .      you just do what you have to  to survive  right .      nobby nodded .      in fact  you were probably a decent lad before you fell in with the rebels  i expect .  sang hymns and all that .      nobby nodded .      this man who calls himself sergeant keel is the ringleader of the rebels  yes .      there was a moment of hesitation  and then nobby raised a hand .      um   everyone does what he tells them  is that the same thing .     he said .      yep .  is he charismatic .      nobby kept staring at the brass knuckles .      um  um  um  i don   t know .  i haven   t heard him cough much     he managed .      and what do they talk about beyond the barricade  my little lad .         um   well  justice an    truth an    freedom and stuff     said nobby .      aha .  rebel talk .     said carcer  straightening up .      is it .     said the major .      take it from me  major     said carcer .     when you get a bunch of people using words like that  they   re up to no good .     he looked down at nobby .     now  i wonder what i   ve got in my pocket for a good boy  eh .  oh  yes   someone   s ear .  still warm .  here you go  kid .         cor  thanks  mister .         now run a long way away or i   ll gut yer .      nobby fled .   carcer glanced at the map spread on the desk .     oh  you   re planning a little sortie .  that   s nice .  don   t want to upset the rebels  do we .  why aren   t you bloody well attacking  major .         well  they   re not           you   re losing your troops to    em .  they hold a quarter of the city .  and you   re gonna sneak round the back .  across the bridge  i see  and up elm street .  quiet like .  like you are frightened .     carcer   s hand smashed down onto the table  making the major jump .      i   m frightened of no man .     he lied .      you   re the city right now .     said carcer  a little speck of white foam appearing at the corner of his mouth .     they sneak .  you don   t .  you ride right up to them and damn them to hell  that   s what you do .  they   re stealing the streets from you .  you take    em back .  they   ve put    emselves beyond the law .  you take the law to    em .      he stepped back  and the manic rage subsided as quickly as it had arrived .      that   s my advice     he said     of course  you know your own business best .  me and what   s left of my poor lads  we   re going to go out and fight .  i   m sure their lordships will appreciate anything you feel you can do .      he strode out  the particulars falling in behind him .      er   you all right  clive .     said the captain .  only the whites of the major   s eyes were showing .      what a horrible man     said the major quietly .      er   yes  of course .  on the other hand           yes  yes  yes .  i know .  we have no choice .  we have orders .  that   weasel is right .  if the damn thing is there in the morning  i   ve got no career and nor have you .  show of strength  frontal attack  take no prisoners   that   s what our orders are .  stupid  stupid orders .     he sighed .      i suppose we could disobey       said the captain .      are you mad .  and then what would we be .  don   t be a fool  tom .  muster the men  get the ox teams hitched up  let   s make a bit of a show for the sake of it .  let   s just get it over with .          vimes was shaken awake .  he looked up into his own face  younger  less lined  more terrified .      wha    .         they   re bringing up siege weapons  sarge .  they   re coming down the street  sarge .         what .  that   s stupid .  the barricade is highest here .  a couple of men could defend it .      vimes leaped to his feet .  it must be a feint .  a stupid feint  too .  just here waddy and his mates had wedged two big carts across the road  and they   d become the nucleus of a solid wall of wood and rubble .  but there was a narrow  low entrance for people to come through  which let them into the republic with their head at just the right height for a gentle tap if they turned out to be soldiers .  people were scrambling through now  like rats .   vimes climbed up the barricade and looked over the top .  at the far end of the street a big metal wall was advancing  surrounded by flaming torches .  that was all there was to see in a city without lights .  but he knew what it was .   it was called big mary  and it was mounted on a heavy cart .  vimes had seen it before .  there would be a couple of oxen behind the cart  pushing it .  the walls weren   t solid metal  but merely a skin to stop defenders throwing fire at the wooden planks underneath .  and the whole thing was simply to defend the men who  behind that cozy shelter  had the big  big hooks on the end of the long chains     they   d fix them in the barricade  and the oxen would be turned around in the traces  and maybe another four beasts would be added  and then there was nothing you could build of wood that wouldn   t be pulled apart .   between the cart and the barricade  struggling to escape from the crush  was a mass of frightened people .      you get any orders  sarge .     said fred colon  pulling himself up alongside vimes .  he looked up the street .     oh dear     he said .      yeah  this is when you need a couple of trolls on the force     said vimes .     i reckon detr           trolls .  huh  wouldn   t work with any trolls     said colon .     too fick to take orders .      you   ll find out one day  thought vimes  and said aloud     okay .  anyone that can   t or shouldn   t have a weapon  they get back as far as possible  right .  get a message to dickins  tell him we   ll need anyone he can spare  but   blast it .      what   d happened before .  there   d been a lot of activity against the barricades  but it had been a feint while the cavalry were sneaking around outside .  he didn   t remember this .   he glanced at the oncoming wagon .  at the top of the wobbling wall  on the other side  there was generally a narrow ledge for bowmen to stand and fire down at anyone trying to interfere with the demolition men .   in the treacherous light of the torches  vimes thought he saw the features of carcer .  even at this distance  there was something horribly recognizable about that expression .   swing was dead .  and when everyone   s running around in confusion  a man who is firm of purpose can push his way up by sheer nerve .  after all  vimes thought  i did .   he clambered down the barricade and looked at the men .      i want a volunteer no  not you  sam .  wiglet  you   ll do .  your dad   s a carpenter  right .  well  there   s a carpenter   s shop round the corner .  run and get me a couple of mallets and some wooden wedges  or long nails   something spiky .  go  go  go .      wiglet nodded and ran off .      and   let   s see  yeah  i need twopennyworth of fresh ginger .  nancyball  nip around the corner to the apothecary  will you .         what   s that any good for  sarge .     said sam .      gingering things up .      vimes removed his helmet and armor  and nodded to the gap through which people were streaming .      fred  we   ll be going out that way .  think you can push us a path .         i   ll give it a go  sarge .     fred squared his shoulders .      we   re going to stop that thing .  they can   t move it fast  and with all this noise and confusion no one will notice a thing   that was quick  billy           i just grabbed everything  sarge     panted wiglet  running up with a small sack .     i know what you want to do  sarge  i did it sometimes out of mischief when i was a kid           me too     said vimes .     and here   s my ginger .  ah  lovely .  it brings tears to my eyes .  okay  billy .  ready  fred .      it took all of colon   s bulk  with vimes pushing behind him  to thrust a way through the desperate mob into the world beyond the barricade .  in the darkness  vimes forced his way between the bodies  up to the side of the siege engine .  it was like a huge slow ram forcing its way down the street  but jerking forward slower than a walking pace because of the press of people .  vimes fancied that carcer probably enjoyed this ride .   he ducked under a cart  unseen in the mob  and grabbed a mallet and a wedge from wiglet   s bag .      you do the left rear wheel and then make a run for it  billy     he said .      but sarge           that was an order .  get out  get back  get people off the street as fast as possible .  do it .      vimes crawled up to one of the front wheels and held the wedge ready between wheel and axle .  the cart stopped for a moment  and he thrust the wedge into the gap and thumped it with the hammer .  he had time for another blow before the cart gave a creak that suggested the oxen were pushing again .  the he crawled back quickly and took the sack from billy before the little man  with a reluctant glance  scuttled out into the forest of legs .   vimes got a third wedge in before loud voices somewhere behind him indicated that the lack of progress had been noticed .  the wheels rocked  and bound even further on the wedges .  the wheels would have to come off before they could be got out .   even so  oxen were powerful beasts .  enough of them would have no problem at all in dragging the cart as well as the barricade .  and the nice thing  the nice thing  was that people thought of a barricade as something people tried to get into  not out of     vimes slipped out into the noisy  confusing night .  there were soldiers  and watchmen  and refugees  all cursing at cross purposes .  in the flickering shadows  vimes was just another shape .  he pushed his way confidently around to the straining oxen and their driver  who was prodding them with a stick .  he was heartened by the fact that the man looked the kind of man who   d get six out of ten when answering the question     what is your name .      vimes didn   t even stop .  the important thing was not to let the other person have a chance to say    but        let alone    who the hell do you think you are .     he pushed the man aside and glared at the sweating beasts .      ah  right  i can see your problem right here     he said in the voice of one who knows everything there is to know about oxen .     they   ve got the glaggies .  but we can fix that .  hold up that one   s tail .  hurry up  man .      the ox poker responded to the voice of authority .  vimes palmed a lump of ginger .  here goes  he thought .  at least it   s somewhere warm on a cold night        okay .  now the other one   right .  okay .  now  i   ll just go around and  er   just go round       said vimes  hurrying back into the shadows .   he shouldered his way through the throng and dived through the tiny hole .      it   s all right  sarge  i spied you coming through mrs .  rutherford   s dining room chairs     said fred colon  hauling him upright .     well  you stopped it  sarge  and no mistake .  you really   urrrhg           yes  don   t shake hands with me until i   ve had a wash     said vimes  heading for the pump .   he kept an ear cocked for any strange noises on the other side of the barricade .  there were none for several seconds .  and then he heard it     nothing much had happened for some while after his visit to the oxen except that  very slowly  their eyes had begun to cross and then  also quite slowly  turn red .  it takes a long time for anything to happen inside the head of an ox  but  when it does  it happens extensively .   the moo started off low and rose slowly .  it was a visceral sound that had rolled across the ancient tundra and told early man that here came dinner or death  and either way it was pissed .  it was the sound of a big beast that was still too small to restrain all the emotions that were welling up inside it .  and it was a duet .   vimes  hauling himself up the barricade  saw people running .  then the whole of big mary shuddered .  that didn   t look too impressive unless you knew that a couple of tons of wood had just jumped sideways .  then there was the sound of splintering  two of big mary   s locked wheels collapsed  and she toppled sideways in a mass of flame  splinters  smoke  and dust .   vimes counted under his breath  and had only reached two when a cartwheel rolled out of the smoke and away down the road .  this always happens .   it wasn   t over  though .  the oxen  tangled in the remains of the shafts and harness  and now an enraged joint creature that could only get six legs out of eight on the ground  headed erratically but with surprising speed in the opposite direction .   the other oxen  which had been waiting for the big pull  watched it approach .  they were already spooked by the crash  and now they caught the stink of terror and fury  and began a slow stampede away from it and toward  as it turned out  the waiting bowmen behind them who  in turn  tried to run into the cavalry .  the horses were not inclined to be well behaved toward armed men in any case  and were also in a state of some apprehension .  they relieved this by kicking the hell out of anyone close .   it was hard for the watchers along the barricade to see much of what happened after that  but the noises were very interesting for quite some time .   sergeant colon   s mouth shut .      bloody hell  sarge     he said admiringly .  in the distance  glass shattered .      they   ll be back     said vimes .      yeah  but not all of    em     said wiglet .     well done  sarge .      vimes turned and saw sam staring at him in wide eyed hero worship .      i was lucky  lad     he said .     but it helps to remember little details and not mind getting your hands dirty .         but we could win now  sarge     said sam .      no  we can   t .  but we can put off losing until it doesn   t hurt too much .     vimes turned to the others .     right  lads  back to work .  we   ve had some fun  but dawn   s a long way off .      but the news got around even before he   d climbed down from the barricade .  there was a cheer from the crowd  and a general struttiness about the armed men .  we   d shown them  eh .  they don   t like the taste of cold steel  those   er   other people from ankh morpork .  we   ll show    em  eh .   and it had taken a few wedges  some raw ginger  and a lot of luck .  that wouldn   t happen twice .   maybe it wouldn   t need to .  he remembered hearing about the assassination .  it was all very mysterious .  winder had been killed in a room full of people  and no one saw a thing .  magic had been suggested  and hotly denied by the wizards .  some historians had said that it happened because troops around the palace had been sent to attack the barricades  but that didn   t answer the question .  anyone who could stab a man to death in a brightly lit room full of people surely wouldn   t find some guards in the darkness any kind of obstacle     of course  with snapcase as the new patrician  no one had tried very hard to establish the facts in any case .  people said things like    quite possibly we shall never know the truth    which meant  in vimes   s personal lexicon     i know  or think i know what the truth is  and hope like hell it doesn   t come out  because things are all smoothed over now .      supposing we don   t lose .   keel hadn   t killed big mary .  she hadn   t been used in the other present .  the soldiers hadn   t been stupid enough to try it .  that sort of thing was okay to deal with little local affairs manned by civilians  but they were a joke if you put them up against stout defenses manned by professionals .  now she was a wreck  the attackers would have to think up a new plan in a hurry  and time was moving on     supposing we don   t lose .   all they had to do was hold out .  the people at the top had very short memories .  winder is mysteriously dead  long live lord snapcase .  and suddenly all the rebels become glorious freedom fighters .  and there   s seven unfilled graves in the cemetery     would he be able to go back then .  supposing madam was right  and he got offered the post of commander not as a bribe but because he   d earned it .  that   d change history .   he took out the cigar case and stared hard at the inscription .   let   s see  he thought   if i   d never met sybil  we wouldn   t get married and she wouldn   t buy me this  and so i couldn   t be looking at it     he stared hard at the curly engraving  almost daring it to disappear .  it didn   t .   on the other hand  that old monk had said that whatever happens  stays happened .  and now vimes had a mental picture of sybil and carrot and detritus and all the rest of them  frozen in a moment that   d never have a next moment .   he wanted to go home .  he wanted it so much that he trembled at the thought .  but if the price of that was selling good men to the night  if the price was filling those graves  if the price was not fighting with every trick he knew   then it was too high .   it wasn   t a decision he was making  he knew that .  it happened far below the levels of the brain where decisions were made .  it was something built in .  there was no universe  anywhere  where a sam vimes would give in on this  because if he did then he wouldn   t be sam vimes anymore .   the writing stayed on the silver but it was blurred now because of the tears welling up .  they were tears of anger  mostly at himself .  there was not a thing that he could do .  he hadn   t bought a ticket and he hadn   t wanted to come  but now he was on the ride and couldn   t get off until the end .   what else had the old monk said .  history finds a way .  well  it was going to have to come up with something good  because it was up against sam vimes now .   he glanced up and saw young sam watching him .      you okay  sarge .         fine  fine .         only you   ve been sitting there for twenty minutes  looking at your cigars .      vimes coughed  tucked the case away  and pulled himself together .      half the pleasure   s in the anticipation     he said .   the night wore on .  news came through  from barricades at bridges and gates .  there were forays  more to test the defenders    strength of will than make a serious dent in the defenses .  and there were even more deserters .   one reason for the desertion rate was that those people of a practical turn of mind were working out the subtle economics .  the people   s republic of treacle mine road lacked all the big  important buildings in the city  the ones that traditional rebels were supposed to take .  it had no government offices  no banks  and very few temples .  it was almost completely bereft of important civic architecture .   all it had was the unimportant stuff .  it had the entire slaughterhouse district  and the butter market  and the cheese market .  it had the tobacco factors  and the candlemakers  and most of the fruit and vegetable warehouses  and the grain and flour stores .  this meant that while the republicans were being starved of important things like government  banking services  and salvation  they were self sufficient in terms of humdrum  everyday things like food and drink .   people are content to wait a long time for salvation  but prefer dinner to turn up inside an hour .      a present from the lads down at the shambles  sarge     said dickins  arriving with a wagon .     they said it   d only spoil otherwise .  is it okay to dish    em out to the field kitchens .         what   ve you got .     said vimes .      steaks  mostly     said the old sergeant  grinning .     but i liberated a sack of onions in the name of the revolution .     he saw vimes   s expression change .     no  sarge  the man gave them to me  see .  they need eating  he said .         what did i tell you .  every meal will be a feast in the people   s republic .     said reg shoe  striding up .  he still hung on to his clipboard  people like reg tend to .     if you could just take it along to the official warehouse  sergeant .         what warehouse .      reg sighed .     all food must go into the common warehouse and be distributed by my officials according to           mr .  shoe     said dickins .     there   s a cart with five hundred chickens coming up behind me  and there   s another full of eggs .  there   s nowhere to send    em  see .  the butchers have filled up the icehouses and smoke rooms  and the only place we can store this grub is in our guts .  i ain   t particularly bothered about officials .         on behalf of the republic  i order you       reg began  and vimes put his hand on his shoulder .      off you go  sergeant     he said  nodding to dickins .     a word in your ear  reg .         is this a military coop .     said reg uncertainly  holding his clipboard .      no  it   s just that we   re under siege here  reg .  this is not the time .  let sergeant dickins sort it out .  he   s a fair man  he just doesn   t like clipboards .         but supposing people get left out .     said reg .      there   s enough for everyone to eat themselves sick  reg .      reg shoe looked uncertain and disappointed  as though this prospect was less pleasing than carefully rationed scarcity .      but i   ll tell you what     said vimes     if this goes on  the city will make sure the deliveries come in by other gates .  we   ll be hungry then .  that   s when we   ll need your organizational skills .         you mean we   ll be in a famine situation .     said reg  the light of hope in his eyes .      if we aren   t  reg  i   m sure you could organize one     said vimes and realized he   d gone just a bit too far .  reg was only stupid in certain areas  and now he looked as though he was going to cry .      i just think it   s important to be fair       the man began .      yeah  reg .  i understand .  but there   s a time and a place  you know .  maybe the best way to build a bright new world is to peel some spuds in this one .  now  off you go .  and you  lance constable vimes  you go and help him        vimes climbed back up the barricade .  the city beyond was dark again  with only the occasional chink of light from a shuttered window .  by comparison  the streets of the republic were ablaze .   in a few hours  the shops out there were expecting deliveries  and they weren   t going to arrive .  the government couldn   t sit this one out .  a city like ankh morpork was only two meals away from chaos at the best of times .   every day maybe a hundred cows died for ankh morpork .  so did a flock of sheep and a herd of pigs  and the gods alone knew how many ducks  chickens  and geese .  flour .  he   d heard it was eighty tons  and about the same amount of potatoes  and maybe twenty tons of herring .  he didn   t particularly want to know this kind of thing  but once you started having to sort out the everlasting traffic problem  these were the kind of facts that got handed to you .   every day  forty thousand eggs were laid for the city .  every day  hundreds  thousands of carts and boats and barges converged on the city with fish and honey and oysters and olives and eels and lobsters .  and then think of the horses dragging this stuff  and the windmills   and the wool coming in  too  every day  the cloth  the tobacco  the spices  the ore  the timber  the cheese  the coal  the fat  the tallow  the hay every damn day     and that was now .  back home  the city was twice as big     against the dark screen of night  vimes had a vision of ankh morpork .  it wasn   t a city  it was a process  a weight on the world that distorted the land for hundreds of miles around .  people who   d never see it in their whole life nevertheless spent that life working for it .  thousands and thousands of green acres were part of it  forests were part of it .  it drew in and consumed        and gave back the dung from its pens  and the soot from its chimneys  and steel  and saucepans  and all the tools by which its food was made .  and also clothes  and fashions  and ideas  and interesting vices  songs  and knowledge  and something which  if looked at in the right light  was called civilization .  that was what civilization meant .  it meant the city .   was anyone else out there thinking about this .   a lot of the stuff came in through the onion gate and the shambling gate  both now republican and solidly locked .  there   d be a military picket on them  surely .  right now  there were carts on the way that   d find those gates closed to them .  yet  no matter what the politics  eggs hatch  and milk sours  and herds of driven animals need penning and watering  and where was that going to happen .  would the military sort it out .  well  would they .  while the carts rumbled up  and then were hemmed in by the carts behind  and the pigs escaped  and the cattle herds wandered off .   was anyone important thinking about this .  suddenly the machine was wobbling  but winder and his cronies didn   t think about the machine  they thought about money .  meat and drink came from servants .  they happened .   vetinari  vimes realized  thought about this sort of thing all the time .  the ankh morpork back home was twice as big and four times as vulnerable .  he wouldn   t have let something like this happen .  little wheels must spin so that the machine can turn  he   d say .   but now  in the dark  it all spun on vimes .  if the man breaks down  it all breaks down  he thought .  the whole machine breaks down .  and it goes on breaking down .  and it breaks down the people .   behind him  he heard a relief squad marching down heroes street .         how do they rise .  they rise knees up .  knees up .  knees up .  they rise knees up  knees up high .  all the little angels        for a moment  vimes wondered  looking out through a gap in the furniture  if there wasn   t something in fred   s idea about moving the barricades on and on  like a sort of sieve  street by street .  you could let through the decent people  and push the bastards  the rich bullies  the wheelers and dealers in people   s fates  the leeches  the hangers on  the brownnosers  and courtiers  and smarmy plump devils in expensive clothes  all those people who didn   t know or care about the machine but stole its grease  push them into a small and smaller compass and then leave them in there .  maybe you could toss some food in every couple of days  or maybe you could leave    em to do what they   d always done  which was live off other people     there wasn   t much noise from the dark streets .  vimes wondered what was going on .  he wondered if anyone out there was taking care of business .       major mountjoy standfast stared empty eyed at the damn  damn map .      how many  then .     he said .      thirty two men injured  sir .  and another twenty probably desertions     said captain wrangle .     and big mary is firewood  of course .         oh gods           do you want to hear the rest  sir .         there   s more .         i   m afraid there is  sir .  before the remains of big mary left heroes street  sir  she smashed twenty shop windows and various carts  doing damage estimated at           fortunes of war  captain .  we can   t help that .         no  sir .     the captain coughed .     do you want to know what happened next  sir .         next .  there was a next .         um   yes  sir .  quite a lot of next  actually  sir .  um .  the three gates through which most of the agricultural produce comes into the city are picketed  sir  on your orders  so the carters and drovers are bringing their stuff in along short street  sir .  fortunately  not too many animals at this time of night  sir  but there were six millers    wagons  one wagon of  er  dried fruits and spices  four dairymen   s wagons  and three hegglers    carts .  all wrecked  sir .  those oxen really were very feisty  sir .         hegglers .  what the hell are hegglers .         egg marketers  sir .  they travel around the farms  pick up the eggs           yes  all right .  and what are we supposed to do .         we could make an enormous cake  sir .         tom .         sorry  sir .  but the city doesn   t stop  you see .  it   s not like a battlefield .  the best place for urban fighting is right out in the countryside  sir  where there   s nothing else in the way .         it   s a bloody big barricade  tom .  too well defended .  we can   t even set fire to the damn thing  it   ll take the city up with it .         yes  sir .  and the point is  sir  that they   re not actually doing anything  sir .  except being there .         what do you mean .         they   re even putting old grannies up on the barricades  shouting down to the lads .  poor sergeant franklin  sir  his granny saw him and said that if he didn   t turn it up she   d tell everyone what he did when he was eleven  sir .         the man are armed  aren   t they .         oh  yes .  but we   ve kind of advised them not to shoot unarmed old ladies  sir .  we don   t want another dolly sisters  do we  sir .      the major stared at the map .  there was a solution  he felt .      well  what did sergeant franklin do when he was           she didn   t say  sir .      a sudden feeling of relief stole over the major .     captain  you know what this is now .         i   m sure you   ll tell me  sir .         i will  tom  i will .  this is political  tom .  we   re soldiers .  political goes higher up .         you   re right  sir .         good .  dig out a lieutenant who has been a bit slack lately and send him up to tell their lordships .         isn   t that a bit cruel  sir .         of course it is .  this is politics now .          lord albert selachii didn   t much like parties .  there was too much politics .  and he particularly didn   t like this one  because it meant he was in the same room as lord winder  a man whom  deep down  he believed to be a bad sort .  in his personal vocabulary  there was no worse term .  what made it worse was that  while seeking to avoid him  he also had to try at the same time to avoid lord venturi .  their families cordially detested one another .  lord albert wasn   t sure  now  what event in history had caused the rift  but it must have been important  obviously  otherwise it would be silly to go on like this .  had the selachiis and the venturis been hill clans  they would have been a feudin    and a fightin     since they were two of the city   s leading families  they were chillingly  viciously  icily polite to each other whenever social fate forced them together .  and right now his careful orbit of the less dangerously political areas of the damn party had brought him face to face with lord charles venturi .  it was bad enough having to campaign with the feller  he thought  without being forced to talk to him over some rather inferior wine  but currently the party   s tides offered no way of escape without being impolite .  and  curiously  upper class etiquette in ankh morpork held that  while you could snub your friends any time you felt like it  it was the height of bad form to be impolite to your worst enemy .      venturi     he said  raising his glass a carefully calculated fraction of an inch .      selachii     said lord venturi  doing the same thing .      this is a party     said albert .      indeed .  i see you are standing upright .         indeed .  so are you  i see .         indeed .  indeed .  on that subject  i notice many others are doing the same thing .         which is not to say that the horizontal position doesn   t have its merits when it comes to  for example  sleeping     said albert .      quite so .  obviously  that would not be done here .         oh  indeed .  indeed .       a brisk lady in a magnificent purple dress advanced across the ballroom floor  her smile traveling in front of her .      lord selachii .     she said  proffering a hand .     i hear you have been doing sterling work defending us from the mob .      his lordship  on social automatic pilot  bowed stiffly .  he wasn   t used to forward women  and this one was all forward .  however  all safe topics of conversation with a venturi had been exhausted .      i fear you have the advantage of me  madam       he murmured .      i certainly expect so .     said madam  giving him such a radiant smile that he didn   t analyze her actual words .     and who is this imposing military gentleman .  a comrade in arms .      lord selachii floundered .  he   d been brought up knowing that you always introduced men to women  and this smiling lady hadn   t told him her        lady roberta meserole     she said .     most people who know me call me madam .  but my friends call me bobbi .      lord venturi clicked his heels .  he was quicker on the uptake than his    comrade in arms     and his wife told him more of the current gossip .      ah  you must be the lady from genua     he said  taking her hand .     i have heard so much about you .         anything good .     said madam .   his lordship glanced across the room .  his wife appeared to be deep in conversation .  he knew to his cost that her wifely radar could fry an egg half a mile away .  but the champagne had been good .      mostly expensive     he said  which didn   t sound quite as witty as he intended .  she laughed anyway .  perhaps i was witty  he thought .  i say  this champagne really is excellent        a woman has to make her way in the world as best she can     she said .      may i make so bold as to ask if there is a lord meserole .     he said .      so early in the evening .     said madam and laughed again .  lord venturi found himself laughing with her .  my word  he told himself  this wit is a lot easier than i thought .      no  of course i meant       he began .      i   m sure you did     said madam  tapping him lightly with her fan .     now  i mustn   t monopolize you  but i really must drag both of you away to talk to some of my friends        she took lord venturi by the unresisting arm and piloted him across the floor .  selachii followed morosely  being of the opinion that when respectable women called themselves bobbi the world was about to end  and ought to .      mr .  carter has extensive interests in copper  and mr .  jones is very interested in rubber     she whispered .   there were about six men in the group  talking in low voices .  as their lordships approached  they caught       and at a time like this one really must ask oneself where one   s true loyalties lie   oh  good evening  madam        on her apparently random walk to the buffet table  madam happened to meet several other gentlemen and  like a good hostess  piloted them in the direction of other small groups .  probably only someone lying on the huge beams that spanned the hall high above would spot any pattern  and even then they   d have to know the code .  if they had been in a position to put a red spot on the heads of those people who were not friends of the patrician  and a white spot on those who were his cronies  and a pink spot on those who were perennial waiverers  then they would have seen something like a dance taking place .   there were not many whites .   they would have seen that there were several groups of reds  and white spots were being introduced into them in ones  or twos if the number of reds in the group was large enough .  if a white left a group  he or she was effortlessly scooped up and shunted into another conversation  which might contain one or two pinks but was largely red .   any conversation entirely between white spots was gently broken up with a smile and an    oh  but now you must meet       or was joined by several red spots .  pinks  meanwhile  were delicately passed from red group to red group until they were deeply pink  and then they were allowed to mix with other pinks of the same hue  under the supervision of a red .   in short  the pinks met so many reds and so few whites that they probably forgot about whites at all  while the whites  constantly alone or hugely outnumbered by reds or deep pinks  appeared to be going red out of embarrassment or a desire to blend in .   lord winder was entirely surrounded by reds  leaving the few remaining whites out in the cold .  he looked the way all the patricians tended to look after a certain time in office   unpleasantly plump  with the pink jowliness of a man of normal build who had too much rich food .  he was sweating slightly in this quite cool room  and his eyes swiveled this way and that  looking for the flaws  the clues  the angles .   at last madam reached the buffet  where doctor follett was helping himself to the deviled eggs and miss rosemary palm was debating with herself as to whether the future should contain strange pastry things with a green filling that hinted mysteriously of prawn .      and how are we doing  do we think .     said doctor follett  apparently to a swan carved out of ice .      we are doing well     madam told a basket of fruit .     there   s four  however  that are still proving awkward .         i know them     said the doctor .     they   ll fall into place  trust me .  what else can they do .  we   re used to this game here .  we know that if you complain too loudly when you lose  you might not be asked to play again .  but i shall station some stout friends near them  just in case their resolve needs a little   bolstering .         he is suspicious     said miss palm .      when isn   t he .     said doctor follett .     go and talk to him .         where is our new best friend  doctor .     said madam .      mr .  snapcase is dining quietly but visibly  in impeccable company  some way away .      they turned when the double doors opened .  so did several of the other guests  and then turned back hastily .  but it was only a servant  who hurried over to madam and whispered something .  she indicated the two military commanders  and the man went to hover anxiously beside them .  there was a brief exchange and then  without even a bow toward lord winder  all three men went out .      i shall just go and see to the arrangements     said madam and  without in any sense following the men  headed toward the doors .   when she stepped into the hall  the two servants waiting by the cake stopped lounging and snapped to attention  and a guard who   d been patrolling the corridor gave her a quick glance of interrogation .      now  madam .     said one of the servants .      what .  oh .  no .  just wait .     she glided over to where the commanders were in animated conversation with a couple of junior officers  and took lord venturi   s arm .      oh dear  charles  are you leaving us so soon .      lord venturi didn   t think of wondering how she knew his first name .  the champagne had been plentiful  and he saw no reason at the moment why any attractive woman of a certain age shouldn   t know his name .      oh  there are one or two pockets of resistance left     he said .     nothing to concern you  madam .         bloody big pocket     murmured lord selachii into his mustache .      they destroyed big mary  sir     said the luckless messenger .     and they           major mountjoy standfast can   t outthink a bunch of gormless watchmen and civilians and some veterans with garden forks .     said lord venturi  who had no idea of how much damage a garden fork could do if hurled straight down from an elevation of twenty feet .      that   s just it  sir  they are veterans and they know all           and the civilians .  unarmed civilians .     said venturi .   the messenger  who was a sub lieutenant and very nervous  couldn   t find the right words to explain that    unarmed civilian    was stretching a point when it was a two hundred pound slaughterhouse man with a long hook in one hand and a flensing knife in the other .  young men who   d joined up for the uniform and a bed all to themselves do not expect that kind of treatment .      permission to speak freely  sir .     he tried .      very well .         the men haven   t got the heart for it  sir .  they   d kill a klatchian in a wink  sir  but   well  some of the old soldiers are from the regiment  sir  and they   re shouting down all kinds of stuff .  a lot of the men come from down there  and it   s not good for them .  and what some of the old ladies shout  sir  well  i   ve never heard such language .  dolly sisters was bad enough  sir  but this is a bit too much .  sorry  sir .      their lordships looked out of the window .  there was half a regiment in the palace grounds  men who   d had nothing to do for several days but stand guard .      some backbone and a quick thrust     said selachii .     that   s what   s needed  by io .  lance the boil .  this is not a cavalry action  venturi .  and i   ll take those men .  fresh blood .         selachii  we do have orders           we have all kinds of orders     said selachii .     but we know where the enemy is  don   t we .  aren   t there enough guards here .  how many guards does one fool need .         we can   t just       lord venturi began  but madam said     i   m sure charles will see that no harm comes to his lordship .     she took his arm .     he does have his sword  after all        a few minutes later  madam glanced out of the window and saw that the troops were quietly moving out .   she also noticed  after watching for some time  that the guard patrolling in the hall seemed to have vanished .       there were rules .  when you had a guild of assassins  there had to be rules that everyone knew and that were never  ever broken .    an assassin  a real assassin  had to look like one   black clothes  hood  boots  and all .  if they could wear any clothes  any disguise  then what could anyone do but spend all day sitting in a small room with a loaded crossbow pointed at the door .   and they couldn   t kill a man incapable of defending himself  although a man worth more that am        a year was considered automatically capable of defending himself or at least of employing people who were  .   and they had to give the target a chance .   but there was no helping some people .  it was regrettable how many rulers of the city had been inhumed by the men in black because they didn   t recognize a chance when they saw it  didn   t know when they   d gone too far  didn   t care that they   d made too many enemies  didn   t read the signs  didn   t know when to walk away after embezzling a moderate and acceptable amount of cash .  they didn   t recognize that the machine had stopped  that the world was ripe for change  that it was time  in fact  to spend more time with their family in case they ended up spending it with their ancestors .   of course  the guild didn   t inhume the rulers on its own behalf .  there was a rule about that  too .  the assassins were simply there when needed .   there was a tradition  once  far back in the past  called the king of the bean .  a special dish was served to all the men of the clan on a certain day of the year .  it contained one small hard baked bean  and whoever got the bean was  possibly after some dental attention  hailed as king .  it was quite an inexpensive system  and it worked well  probably because the clever little bald men who actually ran things and paid some attention to possible candidates were experts at palming a bean into the right bowl .   and while the crops ripened and the tribe thrived and the land was fertile  the king thrived  too .  but when  in the fullness of time  crops failed and the ice came back and animals were inexplicably barren  the clever little bald men sharpened their long knives  which were mostly used for cutting mistletoe .   and on the due night  one of them went into his cave and carefully baked one small bean .   of course  that was before people were civilized .  these days  no one had to eat beans .       people were still working on the barricade .  it had become a sort of general hobby  a kind of group home improvement .  fire buckets  some full of water  some of sand  had turned up .  in places  the barricade was more impregnable than the city walls  considering how often the latter had been pillaged for stone .  there were occasional drumbeats down in the city  and the sound of troop movements .      sergeant .      vimes looked down .  a face had appeared at the top of the ladder leading down to the street .      ah  miss battye .  i didn   t know you were with us .         i didn   t intend to be  but suddenly there was this big wall        she climbed all the way up .  she was holding a small bucket .      dr .  lawn presents his compliments and says how come you haven   t beaten up anyone yet .     she said  putting it down .     he says he   s got three tables scrubbed  two buckets of tar on the boil  six ladies rolling bandages  and all he   s had to deal with so far is a nosebleed .  you   ve let him down  he says .         tell him ha  ha  ha     said vimes .      i   ve brought you up some breakfast     said sandra  and vimes realized that down below  doing their not very best to remain unseen  were some of the lads .  they were sniggering .      mushrooms .     he said .      no     said the girl .     i was told to tell you that since it   s tomorrow  you   re going to get everything you wished for        for a moment vimes tensed  not certain where the world was taking him .      a hard boiled egg     said sandra .     but sam vimes said you probably like the yolk still slightly runny and some toast cut up into soldiers .         just like he does     said vimes weakly .     good guess  that man .      vimes tossed the egg up into the air  expecting to catch it when it came down .  instead  there was a noise like scissors closing and the air rained runny yolk and bits of shell .  and then it rained arrows .       the noise level of the conversation had gone up .  madam moved in on the group around lord winder .  magically  within ten seconds  they were left alone as all the other people in the group saw people across the room that they really had to talk to .      who are yer .     said winder  his eyes surveying her with that care a man takes when he fears that a woman is carrying concealed weaponry .      madam roberta meserole  my lord .         the one from genua .     winder snorted  which was his attempt at a snigger .     i   ve heard stories about genua .         i could probably tell you a few more  my lord     said madam .     but right now it   s time for the cake .         yeah     said winder .     did you know we got another assassin tonight .  they keep trying  you know .  eleven years  and still they try .  but i get    em  every time  sneak about though they may .         well done  my lord     said madam .  it did help that he was an unpleasant person  ugly clear to the bone .  in some ways  it made things easier .  she turned and clapped her hands .  surprisingly  this small noise caused a sudden cessation in the chatter .   the double doors at the end of the hall opened  and two trumpeters appeared .  they took up positions on either side of the door        stop    em .     winder yelled and ducked .  his two guards ran down the hall and grabbed the trumpets from the frightened men .  they handled them with extreme care  as if expecting them to explode or issue a strange gas .      poison darts     said winder in a satisfied voice .     can   t be too careful  madam .  in this job  you learn to watch every shadow .  all right  let    em go .  but no trumpets .  i    ate tubes pointed at me .      there was some bewildered conversation at the other end of the hall  and then the bereft trumpeters stood back and whistled as best they could .   lord winder laughed as the cake was pushed in .  it was in tiers  about man height  and heavily iced .      lovely     he said  as the crowd clapped .     i do like some entertainment at a party .  and i cut it  do i .      he took a few steps back and nodded at the bodyguards .      off you go  boys     he said .   swords stabbed into the top tier several times .  the guards looked at winder and shook their heads .      there   s such a thing as dwarfs  you know     he said .   they stabbed at the second layer  again meeting no more resistance than can be offered by dried fruit and suet and a crust of marzipan with sugar frosting .      he could be kneeling down     said winder .   the audience watched  their smiles frozen .  when it became clear that the cake was solid and unoccupied  the food taster was sent for .  most of the guests recognized him .  his name was spymould  he was said to have eaten so much poison in his time that he was proof against anything  and that he ate a toad every day to keep in condition .  it was also rumored that he could turn silver black by breathing on it .   he selected a piece of cake and chewed it thoughtfully  staring intently upward while he did so .      hmm     he said  after a while .      well .     said winder .      sorry  milord     said spymould .     nuffin    .  i thought there was a touch of cyanide there  but no luck  it   s just the almonds .         no poison at all .     said the patrician .     you mean it   s edible .         well  yes .  it   d be all the better for some toad  o   course  but that   s just one man   s opinion .         perhaps the servants can serve it now  my lord .     said madam .      don   t trust servants serving food     said winder .     sneakin    about .  could slip somethin    in .         do you mind if i do it then  my lord .         yeah  all right     said lord winder  watching the cake carefully .     i   ll have the ninth piece they cut .     but  in fact  he snatched the fifth piece  triumphantly  as if saving something precious from the wreckage .   the cake was disassembled .  lord winder   s objection to servants handling food withered once the food was headed for other people  and so the party spread out a little as the guests pondered the ancient question of how to hold a plate and a glass and eat at the same time without using one of those little glass holding things that clip on the side of the plate and make the user look as though they   re four years old .  this takes a lot of concentration  and that might have been why everyone was so curiously self absorbed .   the door opened .  a figure walked into the room .  winder looked up  over the top of his plate .   it was a slim figure  hooded and masked  all in black .   winder stared .  around him  the conversation rose  and a watcher above might have noticed that the drift of the party tides was such that they were leaving a wide empty path  stretching from the door all the way to winder  whose legs didn   t want to move .   as it strolled toward him  the figure reached both hands behind it .  they came back each holding a small pistol bow .  there were a couple of small tic noises  and the bodyguards collapsed gently to the floor .  it tossed the bows behind it  and kept coming .  its footfalls made no sound .      brw .     said winder  staring .  his mouth was open and stuffed with cake .  people chattered on .  somewhere  someone had told a joke .  there was laughter  perhaps a shade shriller than might normally be the case .  the noise level rose again .   winder blinked .  assassins didn   t do this .  they snuck around .  they used the shadows .  this didn   t happen in real life .  this was how it happened in dreams .   and now the thing was in front of him .  he dropped his spoon  and there was a sudden silence after it tinkled on the ground .   there was another rule .  whenever possible  the inhumed to be should be told who had sent the assassin  and who the assassin was .  it was felt by the guild that this was only fair .  winder did not know this  and it was not widely advertised  but nevertheless  in the midst of terror  eyes wide  he asked the questions .      who sent yer .         i come from the city     said the figure  drawing a thin  silvery sword .      who are yer .         think of me as   your future .      the figure drew the sword back  but it was too late .  terror   s own  more subtle knife had done its work .  winder   s face was crimson  his eyes were staring at nothing  and coming up from the throat  through the crumbs of the cake  was a sound that merged a creak with a sigh .   the dark figure lowered its sword  watched for a moment in the echoing silence  and then said     boo .      it reached out one gloved hand and gave the patrician a push .  winder went over backward  his plate dropping from his hand and shattering on the tiles .   the assassin held his bloodless sword at arm   s length and let it drop on the floor beside the figure .  then he turned and walked slowly back across the marble floor .  he shut the double doors behind him .   madam counted slowly to ten before she screamed .  that seemed long enough .       lord winder got to his feet and looked up at the black clad figure .      another one .  where did you creep in from .      i do not creep .   winder   s mind felt even fuzzier than it had done over the past few years  but he was certain about cake .  he   d been eating cake  and now there wasn   t any .  through the mists  he saw it  apparently close  but  when he tried to reach it  a long way away .   a certain realization dawned on him .      oh     he said .   yes  said death .      not even time to finish my cake .      no .  there is no more time  even for cake .  for you  the cake is over .  you have reached the end of cake .       a grapnel thudded into the wall beside vimes .  there were shouts along the barricade .  more hooks snaked up and bit into the wood .   another rain of arrows clattered on the roofs of the houses .  the attackers weren   t ready to risk hitting their own side  but arrows were snapping and bouncing in the street below .  vimes heard shouts and the clang of arrows on armor .   a sound made him turn .  a helmeted head rose level with his  and the face beneath it blanched in terror when it saw vimes .      that was my egg  you bastard .     he screamed  punching the nose .     with soldiers .      the man fell back  by the sound of it  onto other climbers .  men were yelling all along the parapet .   vimes pulled out his truncheon .     at    em  lads .     he yelled .     truncheons .  nothing fancy .  bop    em on the fingers and let gravity do the work .  they   re goin    down .      he ducked  pressing close to the wood  and tried to find a spyhole        they   re using big catapults     said sandra  who   d found a gap a few feet away .     there   s a        vimes pulled her away .      what are you still doing up here .     he roared .      it   s safer than the street .     she yelled back  nose to nose with him .      not if one of those grapnels hits you it isn   t .     he grabbed his knife .     here  take this   you see a rope anywhere  cut it .      he scurried along behind the shelter of wobbling parapet  but the defenders were doing very well .  it wasn   t exactly rocket magic  in any case .  the people at ground level were firing out through any crack they could find and  while aiming was not easy  it didn   t need to be .  there is nothing like the zip and zing of arrows around them to make people nervous at their work .   and the climbers were too bunched up .  they had to be .  if they tried attacking on a broad front there   d be three defenders to greet each man .  so they were in one another   s way  and every falling man would take a couple more down with him  and the barricade was full of little gaps and holes where a defender with a spear could seriously prod those trying to climb up the outside .   this is stupid  vimes thought .  it   d take a thousand men to break through  and that   d only be when the last fifty ran up the slope made of the bodies of all the rest of them .  someone out there is doing the old hit them at their strongest point to show    em we mean business thinking .  ye gods  is this how we won our wars .   so how would i have dealt with this .  well  i   d have said     detritus  remove the barricade    and made sure that the defenders heard me  that   s what i   d have done .  end of problem .   there was a scream from further along the parapet .  a grapnel had caught one of the watchmen and pulled him hard against the wood .  vimes reached him in time to see a hook dragged into the man   s body  through breastplate and mail  as an attacker hauled himself up     vimes caught the man   s sword arm in one hand and punched him with the other  letting him tumble into the melee below .   the stricken watchman was nancyball .  his face was blue white  his mouth opened and shut soundlessly  and blood pooled around his feet .  it dripped through the planks .      let   s get the bloody thing out       wiglet said  grabbing the hook .  vimes pushed him away  as a couple of arrows hummed overhead .      that could do more damage .  call up some lads  take him down really carefully  and get him to lawn .     vimes snatched up nancyball   s truncheon and brought it down on the helmet of another struggling climber .      he   s still breathing  sarge .     said wiglet .      right  right     said vimes .  it was amazing how willing people were to see life in the corpse of a friend .     so make yourself useful and get him down to the doctor .     and  speaking as one who has seen some stricken men in his time  he mentally added  and if lawn can sort him out  he can start his own religion .   a lucky attacker  who   d achieved the top of the barricade and then found himself horribly alone  slashed desperately at vimes with his sword .  vimes turned back to business .       ankh morpork was good at this  and had become good at it without anyone ever discussing it .  things flowed quietly rather than happened  that is  you   d sometimes have to look quite hard to find the point of change between    hasn   t been done yet    to    already taken care of  old boy .     and that was how it was done .  things were taken care of .   it was twenty minutes before mr .  snapcase arrived and twenty five minutes before he was duly sworn in as patrician  had magically become lord snapcase  and was sitting in the oblong office  this included the one minute   s silence for the late lord winder  whose body had been taken care of .   a number of servants were shown the door without any great unpleasantness  and spymould was even allowed to remove his toad farm in peace .  but those who filled the grates and dusted the furniture and swept the floors stayed on  as they had stayed on before  because they seldom paid any attention to  or possibly didn   t even know  who their lord was  and  in any case  were too useful and knew where the brooms were kept .  men come and go  but dust accumulates .   and it was the morning of a new day  which looked  seen from below  quite like the old ones .   after a while  someone raised the question of the fighting  which clearly needed to be taken care of .       there were scuffles all along the barricade now  but they were going only one way .  siege ladders had been brought up  and at several places along the parapet men had managed to climb in .  but they could never get enough in one place .  there were far more defenders than attackers  and they weren   t all men under arms .  one thing vimes was learning fast was the natural vindictiveness of old ladies  who had no sense of fair play when it came to fighting soldiers  give a granny a spear and a hole to jab it through  and young men on the other side were in big trouble .   and then there was reg shoe   s inspired idea of the use of steak dinners as a weapon .  the attackers did not come from homes where steak was ever on the table .  meat tended to be the flavoring  not the meal .  but  here and there  men who   d achieved the top of the ladders  in darkness  with the groans and yells of their unsuccessful comrades below them  had their weapons dragged from their hands by well fed former colleagues who were not unkind and who directed them down the ladder inside for steak and eggs and roast chicken and a promise that every day would be like this  come the revolution .   vimes didn   t want that news to get out  in case there was a rush to invade .   but the grannies  oh  the grannies   the area of the republic was a natural recruiting ground for the regiments .  it was also an area of big families and matriarchs whose word was family law .  it had almost been cheating  putting them on the parapet with a megaphone during the lulls     i knows you   re out there  our ron .  this is your nan .  you climb up one more time and you   ll feel the back of my hand .  our rita sends her love and wants you to hurry home .  grandpa is feeling a lot better with the new ointment .  now stop being a silly boy .      it was a dirty trick  and he was proud of it .  messages like that sapped fighting spirit better than arrows .   and then vimes realized that there were no more men on the ropes and ladders .  he could hear yells and groans below  but those soldiers who could stand were withdrawing to a safe distance .   now me  thought vimes  i   d have gone down to the cellars of the houses near the street .  ankh morpork is all cellars .  and i   d have chipped my way through the rotten walls  and half the cellars on this side of the barricades would have men in them now  nice and snug .   admittedly  last night i had the men nail up and bar every cellar door they could find  but  after all  i wouldn   t be fighting me  now  would i .   he peered through a gap between planks  and was amazed to see a man walking gingerly forward among the wreckage and the groaning men .  he was carrying a white flag  and stopped occasionally to wave it but not to shout    hurrah .      when he was as close as possible to the barricade  he called up     i say .      behind his planking  vimes shut his eyes .  oh gods  he thought .   he called down     yes .  can we help you .         who are you .         sergeant keel  night watch .  and you .         sub lieutenant harrap .  er   we ask for a brief truce .         why .         er   so that we can recover our wounded .      the rules of war  vimes thought .  the field of honor .  good grief        and then .     he said .      sorry .         what happens after that .  we start fighting again .         um   hasn   t anyone told you .     said the sub lieutenant .      told us what .         we   ve just heard .  lord winder is dead .  um .  lord snapcase is patrician .      a cheer began among the nearby defenders  and was taken up below .  vimes felt the relief rise .  but he wouldn   t be vimes if he just let things lie .   he called out     so would you like to change sides .         er   sorry .         i mean  would you chaps like to have a go at defending the barricade and we can try attacking it .      vimes heard laughter from the watchmen .   there was a pause .  then the young man said     um   why .         because  correct me if i am wrong  we are now the loyal supporters of the official government and you are the rebellious rump of a discredited administration .  am i right .         um   i think we did have  um  legitimate orders           heard of a man called captain swing .         um   yes           he thought he had legitimate orders  too     said vimes .      um   yes .         boy  was he surprised .  all right  all right .  a truce .  we agree .  would you like my lads to give you a hand .  we   ve got a doctor here .  very good .  i   ve yet to hear screaming .         um   thank you  sir .     the young man saluted .  vimes saluted back .   then he relaxed and turned to the defenders .     okay  lads     he said .     stand down .  steal    em if you haven   t got    em .      he shinned down the ladder .  well  then  that was it .  it was over .  ring out bells  dance in the streets        sarge  did you mean that about helping them others with their wounded .     said sam  who was standing at the bottom of the ladder .      well  it makes as much sense as anything else that   s been happening     said vimes .     they   re city lads just like us  not our fault they were given the wrong orders .     and it messes with their heads  he thought  makes    em wonder why all this is happening        only   nancyball   s dead  sarge .      vimes took a deep breath .  he   d known it anyway  up there on the wobbling ramparts  but hearing it said aloud was still a shock .      i daresay there   s a few of theirs who didn   t make it through the morning     he said .      yes  but they were the enemy  sarge .         it   s always worth thinking about who your enemy is     said vimes  tugging at the barricade .      how about the man who   s trying to stick a sword into you .     said sam .      that   s a good start     said vimes .     but there are times when it pays to be a little less tightly focused .          in the oblong office  snapcase put his hands together and tapped his front teeth with his index fingers .  quite a lot of paperwork was spread in front of him .      what to do  what to do     he said thoughtfully .      a general amnesty is usual  my lord     said mr .  slant .  mr .  slant  as head of the guild of lawyers  had advised many leaders of the city .  he was also a zombie  although this had  if anything  benefited his career .  he was precedent .  he knew how things should go .      yes  yes  of course     said snapcase .     a clean start .  of course .  no doubt there is a traditional form of words .         in fact  my lord  i happen to have a copy right here           yes  yes .  tell me about this barricade  though  will you .  the one that was still standing .     he looked up at the crowd assembled in the office .      you know about that  sir .     said doctor follett .      i do have my own informants  you know     said snapcase .     it has caused rather a stir  has it not .  some fellow put together a rather smart defense force  cut us off from the vital organs of the city  broke up captain swing   s organization  and has withstood the best attacks that could be made against him .  and he is a sergeant  i hear .         may i suggest that a promotion is in order .     said madam .      i was thinking exactly the same thing     said snapcase  his little eyes gleaming .     and then there is the question of his men .  loyal  are they .         apparently  sir     said madam .  she exchanged a puzzled glance with doctor follett .   snapcase sighed .     on the other hand  a soldier can hardly be punished for loyalty to a senior officer  especially in these difficult times .  there is no reason to take formal action against them .      eyes met again .  they all felt it  the sense of the world slipping .      but not keel  however     said snapcase  standing up and removing a snuffbox from his waistcoat .     think about it  i pray you .  what ruler could tolerate the existence of such a man .  he did all that in just a few days .  i dread to think what he might take it into his head to do tomorrow .  these are delicate times .  are we to be hostage to every whim of a mere sergeant .  we do not need someone like keel doing things his way .  besides  you know  the particulars could have been useful to us .  suitably reeducated  obviously .         i thought you said you wanted to promote him .     said doctor follett bluntly .   lord snapcase took a pinch of snuff and blinked once or twice .      yes     he said .     promote him  as they say  to glory .      the crowd in the room was silent .  one or two of its members were horrified .  some were impressed .  you didn   t stay at the top in ankh morpork without developing a certain pragmatic approach to life  and snapcase seemed to have got a grip on that with commendable speed .      the barricade is coming down .     said the patrician  shutting the snuffbox with a click .      yes  my lord     said doctor follett .     because of the general amnesty     he added  just to make sure the word was repeated .  the guild of assassins had a code of honor as well as rules  it was an odd code  carefully constructed to fit their needs  but it was a code nonetheless .  you didn   t kill the unprotected or the servants  you did it up close  and you kept your word .  this was appalling .      capital     said snapcase .     ideal time .  streets full .  much confusion .  unreconstructed elements  vital message not passed on  right hand not knowing what right hand doing  difficulties of the situation  regrettable .  no  my dear doctor  i do not intend to make any demands on your guild .  fortunately  there are those whose loyalty to the city is a little less   conditional .  yes .  and now  please  there is much to be done .  i shall look forward to meeting you all later .      the crowd was ushered politely but firmly out of the room  and the doors shut behind it .      it seems we   re back at school     muttered doctor follett as they were swept along the corridor .      ave .  duci novo  similis duci seneci     murmured mr .  slant drily  as only a zombie can manage .     or  as we used to say at school     ave .  bossa nova  similis bossa seneca .        he gave a little schoolmasterly laugh .  he felt at home with dead languages .     of course  grammatically that is completely           and that means    .     said madam .         here comes the new boss  same as the old boss        muttered doctor follett .      i counsel patience     said slant .     he   s new in the job .  he may settle into it .  the city is good at working around problems .  give him time .         and we want someone who is decisive     said someone in the hurrying crowd .      we wanted someone who decides the right things     said madam .  she elbowed her way to the front of the crowd  hurried down the main staircase  and darted into an anteroom .   miss palm stood up as she came in .      have they       she began .      where   s havelock .     madam demanded .      here     said vetinari  detaching himself from a shadow by the curtains .      take my coach .  find keel .  warn him .  snapcase wants him dead .         but where is       madam pointed a threatening  trembling finger .      do it now or receive an aunt   s curse .          when the doors were shut  lord snapcase stared at them for some moments  and then pressed the bell for his chief secretary .  the man insinuated himself into the room via the private door .      everyone is settling in .     said snapcase .      yes  my lord .  there are a number of matters for your attention .         i am sure people would like to believe there are     said snapcase  leaning back in the chair .  he shifted his weight from side to side .     does this thing swivel .         i believe not  sir  but i shall have a skilled swiveler here within the hour .         good .  now  what was the other thing   oh  yes .  tell me  are there any up and coming men in the guild of assassins .         i am sure there are  my lord .  would you like me to prepare dossiers on  say  three of them .         do it .         yes  my lord .  my lord  various people are urgently seeking an audience with           let them wait .  now that we have the patricianship  we mean to enjoy it .     snapcase drummed his fingers on the edge of the desk for a moment  still staring at the doors .  then he said     my inaugural speech is prepared .  very sorry hear unexpected death winder  overwork  new direction  et cetera  keep best of old while embracing best of new  beware dangerous elements  sacrifices must be made  et cetera  pull together  good of city .         exactly  sir .         add that i was particularly sad to hear tragic death sergeant keel  hope that fitting memorial to him would be the uniting of citizens of all shades of opinion in an effort to  et cetera  et cetera .      the secretary made a few notes .     quite  sir     he said .  snapcase smiled at him .      i expect you   re wondering why i   ve taken you on even though you worked for my predecessor  eh .     he said .      no  sir     said the secretary without looking up .  he wasn   t wondering  firstly because he had a pretty good idea  and secondly because there were  in any case  things he found it safest not to wonder about .      it is because i recognize talent whenever it presents itself     said snapcase .      it is good of you to say so  sir     said the secretary smoothly .      many a rough stone can be polished into a gem .         exactly  my lord     said the secretary  and he was thinking exactly  my lord  too  because there were things he   d found it safest not to think  either  and these included phrases like what a little tit .      where is my new captain of the guard .         i believe captain carcer is in the rear courtyard  my lord  exhorting the men in no uncertain terms .         tell him i want to see him here now     said snapcase .      certainly  sir .          the barricade was taking some while to dismantle .  chair legs and planks and bedsteads and doors and balks of timber had settled into a tangled mass .  since every piece belonged to someone  and ankh morpork people care about that sort of thing  it was being dismantled by collective argument .  this was not least because people who had donated a three legged stool to the common good were trying to take away a set of dining chairs  and similar problems .   and then there was the traffic .  carts that had been held up outside the city were trying to make their way to the destinations before eggs hatched or milk got so rotten it could get out and walk the rest of the way .  if ankh morpork had a grid  there would have been gridlock .  since it did not  it was  in the words of sergeant colon     a case of no one being able to move because of everyone else .     admittedly  this phrase  while accurate  did not have the same snap .   some of the watchmen had joined in the dismantling work  mostly to stop the fights that were breaking out among irate householders .  but a group of them had congregated at the end of heroes street  where snouty had set up a mess and a cocoa urn .  there wasn   t  in fact  much to do .  a few hours ago they   d been fighting .  now the streets were so crowded that even patrols were impossible .  every good copper knows that there are times when the wise man keeps out of the way  and the conversation had turned to the kind of questions that follow victory  such as    is there going to be any extra money .  and    are there going to be any medals .  with an option on    which was never far from the watchmen   s thoughts  are we going to get into trouble over this .      an amnesty means we ain   t     said dickins .     it means everyone pretends nothing really happened .         all right  then     said wiglet .     are we going to get medals .  what i mean is  if we   ve been       he concentrated       val i ent defenders of freedom  that sounds like medal time to me .         i reckon we should simply have barricaded the whole city     said colon .      yeah  fred     said snouty     but then that   s mean the bad people  hnah  would be in here with us .         right  but we   d be in charge     said fred .   sergeant dickins puffed on his pipe  and said     lads  you   re just flapping your mouths .  there   s been fighting  and here you are with all your arms and legs and walking around in the gods    good sunlight .  that   s winning  that is .  you   ve won  see .  the rest is just gravy .      no one spoke for a while until young sam said     but nancyball didn   t win .         we lost five men in all     said dickins .     two got hit by arrows  one fell off the barricade and one cut his own throat by accident .  it happens .      they stared at him .      oh  you thought it didn   t .     said dickins .     you get a lot of worried people and edged weapons and a lot of scurrying  all in one place .  you   d be amazed at the casualties you can get even when you   re fifty miles from an enemy .  people die .         did nancyball have a mum .     said sam .      he was brought up by his gran  but she   s dead     said wiglet .      no one else .         dunno .  he never talked about them .  he never talked about anything much     said wiglet .      what you do is  you have a whip round     said dickins firmly .     wreath  coffin  the lot .  you don   t let anyone else do it .  and another thing        vimes sat a little way from the men  watching the street .  there were groups of former defenders and veterans and watchmen everywhere .  he watched a man buy a pie from dibbler  and shook his head  and grinned .  on a day when you couldn   t give steak away  some people would still buy a pie from dibbler .  it was a triumph of salesmanship and the city   s famously atrophied taste buds .   the song began .  whether it was a requiem or a victory chant he didn   t know  but dickins started it and the rest joined in  each man singing as though he was all by himself and unaware of the rest .         see the little angels rise up high       others were picking up the tune .   reg shoe was also sitting all alone  on a piece of barricade currently not in dispute  still clutching the flag and looking so miserable that vimes felt moved to go and speak to him .         do they rise up  rise up  rise up  how do they rise up  rise up high .         it could have been good  sergeant     said reg  looking up .     it really could .  a city where a man can breathe free .            they rise arse up  arse up  arse up  see the little angels rise up high           wheeze free  reg     said vimes  sitting down next to him .     this is ankh morpork .     and they all hit that line together  thought the part of him that was listening with the other ear .  strange that they should do that  or maybe not .      yeah  make a joke of it .  everyone thinks it   s funny     said reg  looking at his feet .      i don   t know if this   ll help  reg  but i didn   t even get my hard boiled egg     said vimes .      and what   s going to happen next .     said reg  far too sunk in misery to sympathize or  for that matter  notice .      all the little angels rise up  rise up           i really don   t know .  things   ll get better for a while  i expect .  but i don   t know what i   m        vimes stopped .  on the far side of the street  oblivious to the traffic  a little wizened old man was sweeping dust out of a doorway .   vimes stood up and stared .  the little man saw him and gave him a wave .  and at that moment yet another cart rumbled down the road  piled high with former barricade .   vimes flung himself flat and stared between the legs and wheels .  yes  the slightly bandy legs and the battered sandals were still there  and still there  too  when the cart had passed  and still there when vimes started to run across the street  and may have been there when the unregarded following cart almost knocked him over  and were completely not there when he straightened up .   he stood where they had been  in the busy street  on the sunny morning  and felt the night sweep over him .  he felt the hairs stand up on the back of his neck .  the conversations around him grew louder  became a clamor in his ears .  and the light was too bright .  there were no shadows  and he was looking for shadows now .   he dodged and jinked across the street to the singing men  and waved them into silence .      get ready     he growled .     something   s going to happen           what  sarge .     said sam .      something not good  i think .  an attack  maybe .     vimes scanned the street for   what .  little old men with brooms .  if anything  the scene was less menacing than before the troubles  because now the other shoe had dropped .  people weren   t standing around waiting for it anymore .  there was a general bustle .      no offense  sarge     said dickins     but it all looks peaceful enough to me .  there   s an amnesty  sarge .  no one   s fighting anyone .         sarge .  sarge .      they all turned .  nobby nobbs was sidling and skipping down the street .  they saw his lips shape a message  completely drowned out by the squeals from a wagonload of pigs .   lance constable sam vimes looked at the face of his sergeant .      something is wrong     he said .     look at sarge .         well  what .     said fred colon .     a giant bird   s going to drop out of the sky or something .      there was a thud  and a gasp from wiglet .  an arrow had hit him in the chest and had gone right through .   another one smacked into the wall above vimes   s head  showering dust .      in here .     he yelled .  the door to the shop behind them was open  and he plunged through .  people piled in behind him .  he heard the noise of arrows outside  and one or two screams .      amnesty  sergeant .     he said .  outside  the rumbling carts had stopped  blocking out the light to the bull   s eye panes of the shop windows and temporarily shielding it .      then it   s got to be some idiots     said dickins .     rebels  maybe .         why .  there were never that many rebels  we know that .  anyway  they won .     now there was shouting outside  beyond the carts .  nothing like a cart for blocking the road        counterrevolutionaries  then .     dickins suggested .      what  people who want to put winder back in charge .     said vimes .     well  i don   t know about you  but i   d join .     he looked around the shop .  it was packed wall to wall .     who are all these people .         you said    in here     sergeant     said a soldier .      yeah  and we didn   t need telling    cos it was raining arrows     said another soldier .      i didn   t mean to come but i couldn   t swim against the tide     said dibbler .      i wanted to show solidarity     said reg .      sarge  sarge  it   s me  sarge .     said nobby  waving his hands .   a firm  authoritative voice  thought vimes .  it   s amazing the trouble it can get you into .  there were about thirty people crowded into the shop  and he didn   t recognize half of them .      can i help any of you gentlemen .     said a thin  querulous little voice behind him .  he turned and saw a very small  almost doll like old lady  all in black  cowering behind her counter .   he looked desperately at the shelves behind her .  it was piled with skeins of wool .      er  i don   t think so     he said .      then do you mind if i finish serving mrs .  soupson .  four ounces of gray two ply  was it  mrs .  soupson .         yes please  ethel .     quavered a tiny  frightened voice somewhere in the middle of the crowd of armed men .      we   d better get out of here     muttered vimes .  he turned to the men and waved his hands frantically to suggest that  as far as possible  no one should upset any old ladies .     do you have a back way  please .      the shopkeeper   s innocent old eyes looked up at him .      it helps if people buy something  sergeant     she said meaningfully .      er  we  um       vimes looked around desperately  and inspiration struck .     ah  right  yes   i   d like a mushroom     he said .     you know  one of those wooden things for           yes  sergeant  i know .  that will be sixpence  thank you  sergeant .  i always like to see a gentleman ready to do it for himself  i must say .  could i interest you in a           i   m in a big hurry  please .     said vimes .     i   ve got to darn all my socks .     he nodded at the men  who responded heroically .      me  too           full of holes  it   s disgusting .         got to patch them up right now .         it   s me  sarge  nobby  sarge .      you can use mine for fishing nets .      the lady unhooked a big key ring .     i think it   s this one  no  i tell a lie  i think it   s no   wait a moment   ah  yes  this is the one           here  sarge  there   s a bunch of men with crossbows in the street     said fred colon from the window .     about fifty of    em .            no  that   s the one  dear me  that   s for the lock we used to have   does this one look right to you .  let   s try this one        very carefully  and very slowly  she unlocked and unbolted the door .   vimes poked his head out .  they were in an alley  filled with trash and old boxes and the horrible smell of alleys everywhere .  no one seemed to be around .      okay  everybody out     he said .     we need a bit of space .  who   s got a bow .         just me  sarge     said dickins .     it   s not like we were expecting trouble  see .         one .  that   s bad odds     said vimes .     let   s get out of here .         are they after us  sarge .         they shot wiglet  didn   t they .  let   s move .      they scuttled along the alleyway .  as they crossed a wider one  there was the distant sound of the shop door being kicked open again  and a gleeful shout .      i got you now  duke .      carcer     an arrow clattered off a wall and pinwheeled  end over end  along the alley .   vimes had run before .  every watchman knew about running .  they called it the backyard handicap .  vimes had taken that route many times  ducking through alleys  leaping on wings of terror over the walls from one dog infested yard to the next  falling into the chicken runs and slipping down privy roofs  looking for safety or his mates  or  failing that  for somewhere to stand with his back to the wall .  sometimes you had to run .   and  like the herd  you stayed together by instinct .  in a crowd of thirty  you were harder to hit .   fortunately  dickins had taken the lead .  the old coppers were best at running  having run so much during their lives .  as on the battlefield  only the cunning and the fast survived .   and so he didn   t bother to stop as the cart appeared at the end of the alley .  it was a heggler   s wagon  probably trying to take a shortcut and escape the    no one being able to move because of everyone else    chaos in the main streets .  the man  with the back of his wagon piled ten feet high with boxes and his vehicle scraping the walls  looked in horror at the stampede heading for him .  no one had any brakes and absolutely no one was going to go backward .   vimes  in the rear  watched the group flow over and under the wagon  to the splintering of boxes and the pop of exploding eggs .  the horse danced in the shafts and men dived through its legs or clear over its back .   when vimes reached it he clambered onto the seat just as an arrow hit the woodwork .  he grinned desperately at the driver .      jump     he suggested  and smacked the horse on the flank with the flat of his sword .  both men were thrown back as it reared and sent the remains of the stricken load sliding off the wagon .   vimes hauled the driver upright as soon as the debris stopped falling .  he was covered in egg .      sorry about that  sir .  watch business .  ask for sergeant keel .  got to rush .      behind them  the wagon rattled up the alley  wheel rims knocking sparks off the walls .  there were doorways and side alleys to escape into  but carcer   s crew would certainly be slowed down .   the rest of his crew had stopped when they heard the noise  but vimes piled into them and forced them on until they reached a road  blocked with carts and thronged with people .      well  you got your soldiers covered in egg  sarge     said sam with a worried grin .     what   s all that about .         it   s some of the unmentionables     said vimes .     probably want to settle the score .     well  that was close enough .      but i saw watchmen and soldiers with    em     said fred colon .      sarge  it   s me  sarge .  please  sarge .     nobby elbowed his way through the men .      is this a good time  nobby .     said vimes .      there   s men after you  sarge .         well done  nobby .         carcer  sarge .  he   s got a job with snapcase .  captain of the palace guard  sarge .  and they gonna get you .  snapcase told    em to  sarge .  my mate scratch    n    sniff is the under   boot boy at the palace and he was in the yard and heard    em talking  sarge .      i should have known  vimes thought .  snapcase was a devious devil .  and now carcer   s got his feet under another bastard   s table .  captain of the guard        i haven   t been making a lot of friends lately     said vimes .     okay  gentlemen  i   m going to run .  if you lot melt away into the crowd you   ll be fine  i expect .         no fear  sarge     said sam  and there was a general murmur of agreement .      we had an amnesty     said dickins .     they can   t do this .         anyway  they were shooting at everyone     said one of the soldiers .     bastards .  they need a good going over .         they   ve got bows     said vimes .      so we ambush    em  sarge     said dickins .     choose your ground and fight up close and a crossbow   s just a piece of wood .         did any of you hear me .     said vimes .     they   re after me .  not you .  you do not want to mix it with carcer .  you  snouty  you shouldn   t be doing this at your time of life .      the old jailer glared at him through runny eyes .      that   s a hell of a thing for you  hnah  to say to me  sarge     he said .      how do we know he won   t decide to come after us anyway .     said dickins .     an amnesty   s an amnesty  right .  they can   t do this .     there was a general chorus of the lines of    yeah  that   s right .      it   s happening  vimes thought .  they are talking themselves right into it .  but what can i do .  we   ve got to face    em .  i   ve got to face    em .  i   ve got to face carcer .  the thought of leaving him here  with all he knows        how about if we head down cable street .     said dickins .     lots of little alleyways off there .  they   ll go rushing along  thinking we   ve bolted for the watch house  and we   ll    ave    em .  we ain   t standing for this  sarge .      vimes sighed .     okay     he said .     thank you .  you   re of one mind .      there was a cheer .      then i won   t make a speech     said vimes .     there isn   t time .  i   ll just say this .  if we don   t win this  if we don   t see them off   well  we   ve got to .  otherwise it   ll be   very bad for this city .  very bad .         that   s right     dickins cut in insistently .     there was an amnesty .         but  look     said one of the soldiers .     i don   t know half the men here .  if we   re going to close in  we want to know who   s on our side           that   s right  hnah     said snouty .     i mean  some of them chasing us was watchmen .      vimes raised his eyes .  the wide alley in front of them  known as lobsneaks  stretched all the way to cable street .  it was lined with gardens  and there were purple flowers on the bushes .   the morning air smelled of lilac .      i recall a battle once     said dickins  looking up at a tree .     in history  it was .  and there was this company  see  and they was a ragtag of different squads and all covered in mud in any case  and they found themselves hiding in a field of carrots .  so  as a badge  they all pulled up carrots and stuck them on their helmets  so   s they   d know who their friends were and incidentally have a nourishing snack for later  which is never to be sneezed at on a battlefield .         well .  so what .     said dibbler .      so what   s wrong with a lilac flower .     said dickins  reaching up and pulling down a laden branch .     makes a spanking plume  even if you can   t eat it        and now  vimes thought  it ends .      i think they are very bad men .     said a high  rather elderly  but nevertheless determined voice from somewhere in the crowd  and there was a glimpse of a skinny hand waving a knitting needle .      and i shall need a volunteer to escort mrs .  soupson home     he said .       carcer looked down the length of lobsneaks .      looks like we just follow the trail of egg     he said .     looks like keel has a yellow streak .      it didn   t get quite the laugh he   d expected .  a lot of the men he   d been able to collect had a more physical sense of humor .  but carcer had  in his own way  some of vimes   s qualities  only they were inverted .  a certain kind of man looks up to someone who   s brave enough to be really bad .      are we going to get into trouble for this  captain .      and  of course  you got those who were just along for the ride .  he turned to sergeant knock  with corporal quirke lurking behind him .  he fully shared vimes   s view of them  although he approached it  as it were  from the other direction .  you couldn   t trust either of them .  but they hated keel with that gnawing  nerve sapping hatred that only the mediocre can really bring to bear  and that was useful .      how do you think we   re going to get into trouble  sergeant .     he said .     we   re working for the government .         he   s a devious devil  sir .     said knock  as if this was a character flaw .      now you lot listen to me  right .     said carcer .     no mess ups this time .  i want keel alive  okay .  and that kid vimes .  you can do what the hell you like to the rest of them .         why d   you want him taken alive .     said a quiet voice behind carcer .     i thought snapcase wanted him dead .  and what   s the kid done that   s so wrong .      carcer turned .  to his mild surprise  the watchman behind him didn   t flinch .      what   s your name  mister .     he said .      coates .         ned   s the one i told you about  sir     said knock urgently  leaning over carcer   s shoulder .     keel gave him the push  sir  after           shut up     said carcer  without taking his eyes off coates .  there wasn   t a hint of fear there  not even a glimmer of bravado .  coates just stared back .      did you just come along for the ride  coates .     he said .      no  captain .  i don   t like keel .  but vimesy is just a kid that got dragged along .  what   re you going to do to him .      carcer leaned forward  coates did not lean back .      you were a rebel  weren   t you .     he said .     don   t like to do what you   re told  eh .         they   re going to get a big drink of ginger beer .     said a voice drunk with evil delight .   carcer turned and looked down at the skinny  black clad ferret .  he was somewhat battered  partly because he   d put up a fight when the watchmen had tried to pry him out of his cell  and mostly because todzy and muffer had been waiting outside .  but he   d been allowed to live  beating something like ferret to death was  to the other two  an embarrassing and demeaning waste of fist .   he certainly flinched under carcer   s gaze .  his whole body was a flinch .      did i ask you to speak  you little dog   s tonker .     carcer inquired .      nosir .         right .  remember that .  it could save your life one day .     carcer turned his attention back to ned .     okay  sunshine  this is the bright new dawn you wanted .  you asked for it  you got it .  we   ve just got to sweep away a few of yesterday   s leftovers .  by order of lord snapcase  your mate .  and it ain   t your job to ask why and who  but young vimesy .  why  i think he   s a game lad who   ll be a credit to the city if he   s kept out of the way of bad company .  now  knock says you   re good at thinking .  so now you tell me what you think keel   s gonna do .      ned gave him a look that went on for slightly longer than carcer felt comfortable with .      he   s a defender     he said eventually .     he   ll be back at the watch house .  he   ll set a few traps  get the men tooled up  and wait for you .         huh .     said carcer .      he doesn   t like to see his men hurt     said ned .      this is not going to be his day  then     said carcer .       halfway down cable street was a barricade .  it wasn   t much .  a few doors  a table or two   by the standards of the big one that was even now being turned back into unbelligerent dining room furniture  it barely existed at all .   carcer   s informal crew walked slowly  staring up at buildings and into the mouths of alleys .  people in the street fled at their approach .  some men walk in a way that projects bad news ahead of them .   vimes crouched behind the makeshift wall and peered through a crack .  they   d snatched a few crossbows from aimless soldiers on the way here  but by the look of it carcer   s men had at least fifteen between them .  and they outnumbered the lilac lads almost two to one .   if push came to shove  he   d take carcer out right now .  it wasn   t the way it ought to go .  he wanted people to see the man hang  he wanted the city to execute him .  going back empty handed would leave a loose end flapping .   he heard the sound of sobbing from further along the barricade .  it wasn   t young sam  he knew  and nobby nobbs had probably cried all the tears a body was capable of some time ago .  it was reg .  he sat with his back to the makeshift defense  the threadbare flag across his knees and tears dripping off his chin .      reg  you ought to go     vimes hissed .     you don   t even have a weapon .         what   s the good of it  eh .     said reg .     you were bloody right  sarge .  things just go round and round .  you got rid of the bloody unmentionables and here they are again .  what   s the point  eh .  this city could be such a great place but no  oh no  the bastards always end up on top .  nothing ever bloody changes .  they just take our money and mess us around .      carcer had stopped twenty yards from the barricade  and was watching it carefully .      way of the world  reg     murmured vimes  counting enemies under his breath .   and a big covered cart came around the corner  rocking under its load .  it rolled to a halt a little way from carcer   s crew  partly because the way was blocked but mostly  perhaps  because one of the men had walked up to the driver and aimed a crossbow at his head .      and now the bloody bastards have won     moaned reg .      every day of the week  reg     said vimes  trying to follow the movements of too many people at once .   the other men were spreading out .  after all  they had the firepower .  he couldn   t let them get behind the barricade .   the man holding up mr .  dibbler  the cart driver  wasn   t paying too much attention .  now vimes wished he   d put himself in the wagon .  oh  well  someone had to start the rumble        yeah .  you want to shoot something .  bastards .      they all stared  carcer too .  reg had stood up  was waving the flag back and forth  was clambering over the barricade     he held the flag like a banner of defiance .      you can take our lives but you   ll never take our freedom .     he screamed .   carcer   s men looked at one another  puzzled by what sounded like the most badly thought out war cry in the history of the universe .  vimes could see their lips moving as they tried to work it out .   carcer raised his crossbow  gestured to his men  and said     wrong .      reg was hit by five heavy bolts  so that he did a little dance before falling to his knees .  it happened within seconds .   vimes opened his mouth to give the order to charge  and shut it when he saw reg raise his head .  in silence  using the flagpole as an aid  reg got back to his feet .   three more arrows hit him .  he looked down at his skinny chest bristling with feathers and took a step forward .  and another .   one of the crossbowmen drew his sword and ran at the stricken man  and was knocked into the air by a blow from reg that must have felt like it had come from a sledgehammer .  and in the ranks of the crew there was a fight .  someone in a copper   s uniform had drawn his own sword and taken out two bowmen .  and the man at the cart was running back to the action        get them .     vimes yelled and leaped over the barricade .   there was no plan anymore .  dickins and his men poured out of the cart .  there were still loaded crossbows out there  but a bow is suddenly not the weapon you want to be holding when angry swords are approaching from both directions .   it   ll come when you call     all plans  all futures  all politics   were elsewhere .  vimes scooped up a fallen sword and with a sword in either hand screamed wordless defiance and launched himself at the nearest enemy .  the man went down headless .   he saw snouty go down in the melee  and sprang over him to catch his attacker in a windmill of blades .  and then he spun around to confront knocker  who dropped his sword and ran .  and vimes ran on  not fighting but hacking  ducking strokes without seeing them  blocking attacks without turning his head  letting the ancient senses do their work .  someone was slicing toward young sam  vimes brought a sword down on the arm in true self defense .  he moved on  in the center of a widening circle .  he wasn   t an enemy  he was a nemesis .   and as suddenly as it had come  the beast withdrew  leaving an angry man with two swords .   carcer had retreated to the side of the street  his men   far fewer men   with him .   colon was on his knees  throwing up .  dickins was down  and vimes knew he was dead .  nobby was down  too  but that was just because someone had kicked him hard and he   d probably decided that staying down was best .  there were a lot of carcer   s men down  more than half .  some more had fled a maniac with two swords .  some had even fled reg shoe  who was sitting on the barricade  staring at the sheer weight of arrows in him .  as he watched  his brain evidently decided that he must be dead on this evidence  and he fell backward .  but in a few hours  his brain would be in for a surprise .   no one knew why some people became natural zombies  substituting sheer stubborn willpower for blind life force .  but attitude played a part .  for reg shoe  life was only just beginning     young sam was upright .  he looked as though he   d thrown up  but he   d done well to survive his first real melee .  he gave vimes a weak smile .      what   s happening now  sarge .     he managed  taking off his helmet and wiping his forehead .   vimes sheathed a sword and quietly slipped one of mrs .  goodbody   s little friends out of his pocket .      that depends on what happens over there     he said  nodding toward the other end of the street .  sam obediently turned to look and fell asleep .   vimes pocketed the cosh and saw coates looking at him .      whose side are you on  ned .     he said .      what did you hit the kid for .     said ned .      so he   s out of it .  you got anything to say .         not much  sarge .     ned grinned .     we   re all learning a lot today  ain   t we .         true enough     said vimes .      there   s even bigger bastards than you  for a start .      this time vimes grinned .     but i try harder  ned .         you know carcer .         he   s a murderer .  and just about everything else  too .  a stone cold killer .  with brains .         this is going to go the distance .         yep .  it   s got to .  we   ve got to stop this  and this is the only chance .  can you imagine him loose now he   s pally with snapcase .         yes .  i can     said ned .     just as well i wasn   t planning anything this evening  eh .  but you can tell me one thing  sarge .  how do you know all this .      vimes hesitated .  but at a time like this  what difference did it make .      i   m from this city     said vimes .     but  oh  there was a hole in time  something like that .  you want to know .  i traveled here in time  ned  and that   s the truth .      ned coates looked him up and down .  blood covered vimes   s armor  and his hands  and half his face .      from how far back .     he said .       time stopped .  coates faded  in a world made up of shades of gray .      nearly there  your grace     said sweeper behind vimes .      ye gods .     yelled vimes  flinging his sword to the ground .     you are not making any friends here  you know .      the sword hadn   t hit the ground .  it hung a few inches from his hands  and had faded to grayness .      there   s just a few things we need to tell you     said sweeper  as if a sword in midair was a minor consideration .      what   s happened to the bloody sword .     said vimes  to whom it wasn   t .          time has stopped for everyone but you     said sweeper patiently .     actually  that sentence is wrong in every particular  but it   s quite a useful lie .  it   ll just take us a moment to set things up        now vimes had time  of some kind  to look around .  the whole street was darker  as if the fight had been taking place in the half light just before dawn .  the only color was in the robes and faces of sweeper and qu as they maneuvered a handcart out of an alley .  it held a couple of small stone columns and the body of john keel  wrapped in a shroud .      we have some good news     said sweeper .      you have .     said vimes weakly .  he walked over to the body .      indeed     said qu  unshipping the stone cylinders .     we thought we might have to persuade you to remove all your armor but you will not  i think  need to do this .         that   s because it will stay here     said lu tze .     belongs here  see .         no     said vimes .     i don   t know what the hell you   re talking about .     he touched the body .     so cold     he said .     that   s what i remember .  he was so cold .         a morgue does that to people     said sweeper in a matter of fact voice .      now please pay attention  commander     said qu .     when we operate the        vimes looked up  violence in his eyes .  sweeper laid a hand on qu   s arm .      we   ve got things to do for a minute or two     he said .      yes  but it   s vital that he knows how           we   ve got things to do for a minute or two     sweeper repeated  making a face .      oh .  what .  oh .  yes .  er   we   ve got  er   things .  to do .  things to do   er   things .      they wandered away .  out of the corner of his eye  vimes saw them walking back and forth across the street  as if taking measurements .   he looked back at john keel .  but what could you say .  sorry you   re dead .  keel had originally died on the barricades  not in a street fight .  but he was just as dead  all the same .   vimes was hazy on religion .  he attended watch funerals and went to such religious events as the proper fulfilling of the office of commander entailed  but as for the rest   well  you saw things sometimes that made it impossible to believe not only in gods  but also in common humanity and your own eyes .  from what he could remember  keel had felt the same way .  you got on with things .  if there was any gods  you expected them to get on with things  too  and didn   t interrupt them while they were working .   what could you say to a dead copper .  what would he want said .   ah     he leaned closer .      carcer   s going to bloody swing for this     he said and stood back .   behind him  sweeper coughed theatrically .      ready  your grace .     he said .      ready enough     said vimes .      we were telling you about the armor     said sweeper .     it   ll           the thing is  commander     qu interrupted     that you and this fellow carcer and all the clothes and possessions you arrived with form an elongated trans time anomaly  which is under considerable tension .      vimes looked at sweeper .      it   s very  very hard to move things out of the time where they belong  but it takes much less effort to move them back to where they were     sweeper translated .   vimes carried on staring .      everything really  really wants to be back where it should be     sweeper tried .      you   re right there     said vimes .      all we do is   grease the way     said sweeper .     we give a little push  and it   ll all snap back .  and away you go .  have you had anything to eat this morning .         no .         shouldn   t be too messy  then     said sweeper .  when vimes looked puzzled  he went on     undigested food .  it   ll stay here  you see .         you mean it   ll come tearing out of           no  no  no     said qu quickly .     you won   t notice .  but a nourishing meal when you get back would be a good idea .         and the armor stays here .      qu beamed .     yes  your grace .  everything .  eyepatch  socks  everything .         boots  too .         yes .  everything .         what about my drawers .         yes  those too .  everything .         so i   ll arrive in the nuddy .         the one costume that   s in fashion anywhere     said sweeper  grinning .      then why did all my armor arrive with me when i came .     said vimes .     and damn carcer had his knives  that   s for sure .      qu opened his mouth  but sweeper answered faster .      it takes a thousand steps to get to the top of a mountain but one little hop   ll take you all the way back to the bottom     he said .     okay .         well  i suppose it makes sen       vimes began .      that isn   t how it works at all  lu tze .     wailed qu .      no     said sweeper     but it   s a bloody good lie .  look  commander  we don   t have a damn great thunderstorm and we don   t have enough stored time .  this is a field operation .  it   s the best we can do .  we   ll get you back  and your prisoner  although you almost certainly won   t arrive in the same place     cos of quantum .  it   s hard enough making sure you don   t arrive two hundred feet in the air  believe me .  pushing all your clothes as well  when they belong here  that just takes too much power .  now  are you ready .  you need to go back to where you were standing .  get to carcer as soon as you can .  you must grab him  otherwise he   ll stay behind .         okay  but i   ve changed lots of things .     said vimes .      leave that to us     said sweeper .      what about keel .     said vimes  walking away with reluctance .      don   t worry .  we told you at the temple .  we   ll put him in your armor .  he   ll have died in battle .         make sure nothing happens to young sam .     said vimes  as qu carefully prodded him into position .  the little stone columns began to spin .      we will .         make sure reg shoe gets a decent burial .         we will .         not too deep  he   ll be wanting to come out again in a few hours .      qu gave him a last prod .      goodbye  commander .      time came back .       ned was looking at him .      what happened just then  sarge .  you blurred .         you only get one question  ned     said vimes  fighting the moment of nausea .     now  let   s show snapcase where the line   s drawn  shall we .  let   s finish it        they charged  the men falling in behind them .   vimes remembered in slow motion .  some of carcer   s men ran at the sight of them  some raised their hastily reclaimed weapons  and carcer stood there and grinned .   vimes headed for him  ducking and weaving through the fight .   the man   s expression changed as vimes approached .  vimes was speeding up  shoulder charging and thrusting other bodies away .  carcer raised his sword and took a stance  but there was no room for finesse in the melee  and vimes closed like a bull  knocking the sword up and grabbing carcer by the throat .      you   re nicked  my ol    chum     he said .  and then it all went black .       he felt  later on  that there should have been more to it .  there should have been rushing blue tunnels  or flashes  or the sun should have shot round and round the sky .  even pages tearing off a calendar and fluttering away would have been something .   but it was just the blackness of the deepest sleep  followed by pain as he hit the floor .   vimes felt arms reach down and haul him to his feet .  he shook them off as soon as he was upright and focused  through the bleary mist  on the face of captain carrot .      good to see you  sir .  oh  dear           i   m fine     croaked vimes through a throat that felt stuffed with sand .     where   s carcer .         you   ve got a nasty cut on           really .  i   m amazed     growled vimes .     now  where the hell is carcer .         we don   t know  sir .  you just appeared in midair and landed on the floor .  in a lot of blue light  sir .         ah     muttered vimes .     well  he   s come back somewhere .  somewhere close  probably .         right  sir  i   ll tell the men to           no  don   t     said vimes .     he   ll keep .  after all  where   s he going to go .      he wasn   t too sure of his legs .  they felt as though they belonged to someone with a very poor sense of balance .      how long was i   away .     he said .  ponder stibbons stepped forward .      about half an hour  your grace .  er  we have  er hypothesized that there was some temporal disturbance  which  coupled with the lightning stroke and a resonance in the standing wave of the library  caused a space time rupture           yeah  it felt something like that     said vimes hurriedly .     half an hour  did you say .         did it feel longer .     said ponder  taking out a notebook .      a bit     vimes conceded .     now  has anyone here got a pair of drawers i        i can see your house from up here     that was carcer .  he liked you to stew  to use your imagination .   and vimes had said  where   s he going to go .      captain  i want you and every man you can spare  every damn man  to get up to my house right now  understand     he said .     just do it .  just do it now .     he turned to ridcully .     archchancellor  can you get me there faster .         the watch wants magical assistance .     said the archchancellor  taken aback .      please     said vimes .      of course  but you realize that you have no clothes on        vimes gave up .  people always wanted explanations .  he set off  overruling the jelly in his legs  running out of the octangle and across the lawns until he reached the university   s bridge of size  where he sped past nobby and colon who were drawn into the wake of watchmen running to keep up .   on the other side of the bridge was the garden known as the wizard   s pleasaunce .  vimes ploughed through it  twigs whipping at his bare legs  and then he was out and onto the old towpath  mud splashing up over the blood .  then a right and a left  past amazed bystanders  and then there were the cathead cobbles of scoone avenue under his feet and he found the wind to accelerate a little .  he didn   t slow until he reached the gravel drive and almost collapsed at the front door  hanging on to the bellpull .   there were hurrying feet  and the door was wrenched open .      if you   re not willikins     growled vimes  focusing     there   s going to be trouble .         your grace .  whatever has happened to you .     said the butler  pulling him into the hall .      nothing .     said vimes .     just get me a fresh uniform  nice and quietly  and don   t let sybil know        he read everything in the way the butler   s face changed .      what   s happened to sybil .      willikins backed away .  a bear would have backed away .      don   t go up there  sir .  mrs .  content says it   s   all rather difficult  sir .  things aren   t  um  happening quite right           is the child born .         no sir  a apparently not  sir .  it   s rather   mrs .  content says she   s trying everything but maybe we   ought to send for the doctors  sir .         for a childbirth .      willikins looked down .  after twenty unflappable years as a butler  he was shaking .  no one deserved a confrontation with sam vimes at a time like this .      sorry  sir           no .     snapped vimes .     don   t send for a doctor .  i know a doctor .  he knows all about   this sort of thing .  he   d better .      he ran back outside in time to see a broomstick touch down on the lawn  piloted by the archchancellor himself .      i thought i   d better come along anyway     said ridcully .     is there anything        vimes swung himself onto it before the wizard could get off .      take me to twinkle street .  can you do that .     he said .     it   s   important .         hang on  your grace     said ridcully  and vimes   s stomach dropped into his legs as the stick climbed vertically .  he made a small mental note to promote buggy swires and buy him the buzzard he   d always wanted .  anyone prepared to do this every day for the good of the city couldn   t be paid too much .   he hadn   t had time to put a pair of drawers on .  it was cold up there  but at least it was fast .      try my left pocket     said ridcully  when they were well aloft .     there   s something that belongs to you  i believe .      nervously  well aware of what a wizard   s pocket might hold  vimes pulled out a bunch of paper flowers  a string of flags of all nations   and a silver cigar case .      landed on the bursar   s head     said the archchancellor  steering around a seagull .     i hope it   s not damaged .         it   s   fine     said vimes .     thank you .  er   i   ll put it back for now  shall i .  don   t seem to have any pockets on me at the moment .      it found its way back  vimes thought .  we   re home .      and a suit of ornamental armor landed in the high energy magic building     ridcully went on     and  i am happy to report  it is           very badly bent out of shape .     said vimes .  ridcully hesitated .  he was aware of vimes   s feelings of gilt .      excessively  your grace .  completely and irreparably bent out of shape because of quantum thingummies  i suspect .      vimes shivered .  he was still naked .  even the hated formal uniform would have helped up here .  but it didn   t matter either way  now .  gilt and feathers and badges and feeling chilly   there were other things that mattered more  and always would .   he jumped off the stick before it had stopped  stumbled in a circle  and fell against dr .  lawn   s door  hammering on it with his fists .   after a while  it opened a crack  and a familiar voice  changed only a little with age  said     yes .      vimes thrust the door fully open .      look at me  doctor lawn     said vimes .   lawn stared .     keel .     he said .  in his other hand he was holding the world   s biggest syringe .      can   t be .  they buried john keel .  you know they did     said vimes .  he saw the huge instrument in the man   s hand .     what the hell were you going to do with that .         baste a turkey  as a matter of fact .  look  who are you  then  because you look like           grab all your midwifing stuff and come with me now     said vimes .     all those funny tools you said worked so well .  bring    em all .  right now .  and i   ll make you the richest doctor that ever lived     said vimes  a man wearing nothing but mud and blood .   lawn gestured weakly toward the kitchen .     i   ll just have to take the turkey out           stuff the turkey .         i already           come on .      the broomstick did not fly well with three on board  but it was faster than walking  and vimes  at this point  knew he   d be incapable of anything else .  he was out of breath and strength before he   d been home the first time .  merely standing upright was a test of endurance .  it was the broomstick or crawling .   now it lumbered out of the sky and landed unsteadily on the lawn .      lady upstairs  big bedroom on left     said vimes  pushing vaguely at the doctor .     midwife there  not got a clue .  all the money you want .  go on .      lawn hurried off .  vimes  helped by ridcully  followed rather more stiffly  but  as they reached the door  the doctor came out  walking backward very slowly .  it became apparent  as he emerged  that this was because detritus   s huge crossbow was pressed against his nose .   when vimes spoke  his voice was slightly muffled  because he was lying flat on the ground .      put the bow down  sergeant     he managed .      he come rushin    in  mister vimes     rumbled detritus .      that   s because he   s the doctor  sergeant .  let him go upstairs .  that is an order  thank you .         right  mister vimes     said detritus  stepping aside with reluctance and shouldering the bow .  at which point  the bow discharged .   when the thunder had died away  vimes got up and looked around .  he hadn   t actually liked the shrubbery very much .  that was just as well .  nothing remained but some tree trunks  and they were all stripped of bark down one side .  there were a few small fires .      er  sorry about that  mister vimes     said the troll .      what did i tell you about mister safety catch .     said vimes weakly .      when mister safety catch is not on  mister crossbow is not your friend     recited detritus  saluting .     sorry  sir  but we all a bit tense at dis time .         i certainly am     said ridcully  picking himself off the lawn and pulling twigs out of his beard .     i may not walk properly for the rest of the day .  i suggest  sergeant  that we pick the doctor up  bring him round under the pump  and take him upstairs        the things that happened next were a waking dream for vimes .  he moved like a ghost through his own house  which was full of watchmen .  no one wanted to be anywhere else .   he shaved himself very slowly  concentrating on every stroke .  he was aware of noises off  which arrived via the pink clouds in his head .         he says he wants them boiled  the nasty horrid things .  what   s that for  to make them softer .            trolls and dwarfs on tonight  every door and window covered and i mean covered              stood over me and said damn well boil them for twenty minutes .  like they were cabbage              now he   s asked for a small brandy              mrs .  content stormed out and he said not to let her in again              igor came and offered to help  and lawn took one look and said only if he   s been boiled for twenty minutes              pox doctor  when all   s said and done              old stoneface   ll cover him with gold if it all turns out right              yeah  and if it turns out wrong .      vimes got dressed in his street uniform  moving slowly and willing every limb into position .  he brushed his hair .  he went out into the hall .  he sat down on an uncomfortable chair  with his helmet on his knees  while ghosts both living and dead hurried around him .   usually   always   there was a part of vimes that watched the other parts  because he was at heart a policeman .  this time it wasn   t there .  it was in here with the rest of him  staring at nothing and waiting .         someone take up more towels            now he   s asked for a large brandy .            he wants to see mister vimes .      vimes   s brain lit up from whatever little pilot light of thought had been operating at the most basic level .  he walked up the stairs  helmet under his arm  like a man going to take a statement .  he knocked at the door .   lawn opened it .  he was holding a brandy glass in his other hand  and moved aside with a smile .   sybil was sitting up .  he saw  through the mist of exhaustion  that she was holding something wrapped in a shawl .      he   s called sam  sam     she said .     and no argument .      the sun came out .      i   ll teach him to walk .     beamed vimes .     i   m good at teaching people to walk .      and he fell asleep before he hit the carpet .       it was a pleasant stroll in the early evening air .  vimes trailed cigar smoke behind him as he walked down to pseudopolis yard  where he acknowledged the cheers and congratulations and thanked people for the lovely flowers .   his next stop was at doctor lawn   s house  where he sat and spoke for a while of such things as memory and how tricky it can be  and forgetfulness and how profitable it could prove .   then  with the doctor  he went to his bank .  this institution was  not surprisingly  willing to open outside normal hours for a man who was a duke  and the richest man in the city  and the commander of the city watch and  not least  quite prepared to kick the door down .  there he signed over one hundred thousand dollars and the freehold of a large corner site in goose gate to one dr .  j .     mossy    lawn .   and then  alone  he went up to small gods .  legitimate first  whatever his private feelings  knew enough not to shut the gates on this night  and he   d filled the lamps .   vimes strolled over the moss grown gravel .  in the twilight  the lilac blooms seemed to shine .  their scent hung in the air like fog .   he waded through the grass and reached the grave of john keel  where he sat on the headstone  taking care not to disturb the wreaths  he had a feeling that the sergeant would understand that a copper sometimes needed to take the weight off his feet .  and he finished his cigar and stared into the sunset .   after a while  he was aware of a scraping noise to his left and could just make out the turf starting to sag on one of the graves .  a gray hand was thrust out of the ground  clutching a shovel .  a few pieces of turf were pushed aside and  with some effort  reg shoe rose from the grave .  he was halfway out before he noticed vimes and nearly fell back .      oh  you frightened the life out of me  mister vimes .         sorry  reg     said vimes .      of course  when i say you frightened the life out of me       the zombie began gloomily .      yes  reg  i understood you .  quiet down there  was it .         very peaceful  sir  very peaceful .  i think i   ll have to get myself a new coffin before next year  though .  they don   t last any time at all these days .         i suppose not that many people look for durability  reg .      reg slowly shoveled the soil back into place .     i know everyone thinks it   s a bit odd  but i think i owe it to them  really     he said .     it   s only one day a year  but it   s like   solidarity .         with the downtrodden masses  eh .     said vimes .      what  sir .         no argument from me  reg     said vimes happily .  this was a perfect moment .  not even reg  fussing around smoothing down earth and patting turf into place  could detract from it .   there   ll come a time when it   ll all be clear  sweeper had said .  a perfect moment .   the occupants of these graves had died for something .  in the sunset glow  in the rising of the moon  in the taste of the cigar  in the warmth that comes from sheer exhaustion  vimes saw it .   history finds a way .  the nature of events changed  but the nature of the dead had not .  it had been a mean  shameful little fight that ended them  a flyspecked footnote of history  but they hadn   t been mean or shameful men .  they hadn   t run  and they could have run with honor .  they   d stayed  and he wondered if the path had seemed as clear to them then as it did to him now .  they   d stayed not because they wanted to be heroes  but because they chose to think of it as their job  and it was in front of them        i   ll be off  then  sir     said reg  shouldering his shovel .  he seemed a long way away .     sir .         yeah  right .  right  reg .  thank you     mumbled vimes  and in the pink glow of the moment watched the corporal march down the darkening path and out into the city .   john keel  billy wiglet  horace nancyball  dai dickins  cecil    snouty    clapman  ned coates  and  technically  reg shoe .  probably there were no more than twenty people in the city now who knew all the names  because there were no statues  no monuments  nothing written down anywhere .  you had to have been there .   he felt privileged to have been there twice .   the night was welling up as the sun set .  it unfolded from the shadows where it had hidden from the day  and flowed and joined together .  he felt his senses flow with it  spreading out like the whiskers of a dark  giant cat .   beyond the gates of the cemetery the city noise died down a little  although ankh morpork never truly slept .  it probably didn   t dare .   vimes felt now  in this strange calm mood  that he could hear everything  everything  just as he had done back in that terrible moment in heroes street when history came to claim its own .  he heard the tiny sounds in the stone wall as it cooled  the slither of dirt underground as reg   s vacated plot settled  the faint movement of the long grass around the graves   a thousand subtle sounds added up to a richly textured  localized silence .  it was the song of the dark  and in it  on the edge of detection  was a discord .   let   s see   he   d put a guard on his house and they were core people  ones he could trust not to stand around and get bored  but to remain watchful all night long .  he hadn   t had to explain how important that was .  so the house was safe .  and the watch houses had double guard  too     there was something wrong with keel   s grave .  there was always the egg  every year  a little joke out of history .  but now  it looked as though there was nothing down there but bits of eggshell     as he leaned forward to look  the blade went over his head .   but the beast had been ready .  the beast didn   t think about guards and defenses .  the beast didn   t think at all .  but it forever sniffed the air and eyed the shadows and sampled the night and almost before the swish of the sword it had sent vimes   s hand thrusting into his pocket .   crouched  he swiveled and punched carcer on the kneecap with one of mrs .  goodbody   s finest items .  he heard things crackle  he launched himself up and forward  he bore carcer to the ground .   there was no science to this .  the beast was off the chain and looking to kill .  it was not often that vimes was sure that he could make the world a better place  but he was now .  it was all very clear now .   and also very hard .  the sword had gone  tumbling into the grass as carcer went down .  but carcer fought  and was as tough as teak .  and it is very hard  with your hands  to kill a man who does not want to be killed .   vimes shook off the brass knuckles because what he needed to do now was throttle .  there was no room  though .  carcer was trying to stick a thumb in his eye .   they rolled across the graves  scrabbling and struggling for advantage .  blood filled vimes   s left eye .  his rage needed just one second  and that second was being denied .   he rolled again  and flung out a hand .   and there was the sword .  he rolled again  and again  and staggered up with the blade in his hand .   carcer had rolled  too  and was pulling himself up with remarkable speed for a man with only one good knee .  vimes saw that he was dragging himself upright by one of the lilac trees  blossoms and scent floated down in the darkness .   metal slid .  there was the momentary gleam of a knife .  and a little chuckle  carcer   s little laugh that said  hey  this is all good fun  eh .      so who   s gonna arrest me .     he said  as they both gulped air .     sergeant keel or commander vimes .         who said you were going to be arrested .     said vimes  trying to fill his lungs .     i   m fighting an attacker  carcer .         oh  you was  mister vimes     said the shadow .     only now i   m in front of you .     metal clinked on the gravel path .     and i ain   t armed no more  haha .  thrown down my last weapon .  can   t kill an unarmed man  mister vimes .  you got to arrest me now .  drag me in front of vetinari .  let me have my little say  haha .  you can   t kill me  just standin    here .         no one wants to hear anything you   ve got to say  carcer .         then you   d better kill me  mister vimes .  i got no weapon .  i can   t run .         you   ve always got an extra knife  carcer     said vimes above the roar of the beast .      not this time  mister vimes .  come on  mister vimes .  can   t blame a man for tryin     eh .  a man   s got to give it his best shot  right .  no hard feelings .      and that was carcer .  no hard feelings .  his best shot .  can   t blame a man for trying .   innocent words got dirty in his mouth .   vimes took a step closer .      you got a nice home to go to  mister vimes .  i mean  what   ve i got .      and the man was convincing .  he fooled everybody .  you could almost forget the corpses .   vimes glanced down .      whoops  sorry     said carcer .     i walked over your grave there .  no offense meant  eh .      vimes said nothing .  the beast was howling .  it wanted to shut that mouth up .      you   re not going to kill me  mister vimes .  not you .  not you with a badge .  that ain   t your way  mister vimes .      without looking  vimes reached up and tore his badge off .      ah  well  i know you want to give me a fright  mister vimes  and many would say you   ve got a right .  look  here   s what i   ll do  i   ll throw away my other knife  haha  you knew i   d got another one  right .      it was the voice .  it could make you think that what you knew was wrong .      okay  okay  i can see you   re upset  haha  fair enough  and you know i   ve always got a third knife  well  i   m dropping it now  see  there it goes        vimes was only a step or two away now .      that   s it  mister vimes .  no more knives .  i can   t run .  i surrender .  no messing about this time .  i give in  okay .  just arrest me .  for old times    sake .      the beast screamed inside vimes .  it screamed that no one would blame him for doing the hangman out of ten dollars and a free breakfast .  yeah  and you could say a swift stab now was the merciful solution  because every hangman knew you could go the easy way or the hard way and there wasn   t one in the country that   d let something like carcer go the easy way .  the gods knew the man deserved it        but young sam was watching him  across thirty years .   when we break down  it all breaks down .  that   s just how it works .  you can bend it  and if you make it hot enough you can bend it in a circle  but you can   t break it .  when you break it  it all breaks down until there   s nothing unbroken .  it starts here and now .   he lowered the sword .   carcer looked up  grinning  and said     never tastes right  does it  haha  an egg without salt        vimes felt his hand begin to move of its own accord     and stopped .  red rage froze .   there was the beast  all around him .  and that   s all it was .  a beast .  useful  but still a beast .  you could hold it on a chain  and make it dance  and juggle balls .  it didn   t think .  it was dumb .  what you were  what you were  was not the beast .   you didn   t have to do what it wanted .  if you did  carcer won .   he dropped the sword .   carcer stared at him  the gleam of vimes   s sudden smile more worrying than the rictus of his rage .  then metal gleamed in his hand .  but vimes was already on him  grabbing the hand  slamming it again and again on john keel   s headstone until the hidden knife dropped from bleeding fingers .  he dragged the man upright with both hands forced up behind his back and rammed him hard against the stone .      see that up in the sky  carcer .     he said  his mouth by the man   s ear .     that   s the sunset  that is .  that   s the stars .  and they   ll shine all the better on my lad sam tomorrow night    cos they won   t be shining down on you  carcer  by reason of the fact that before the dew   s off the leaves in the morning i   ll drag you in front of vetinari  and we   ll have the witnesses there  lots of    em  and maybe even a lawyer for you if there   s any of    em who could plead for you with a straight face  and then  carcer  we   ll take you to the tanty  one gallows  no waiting  and you can dance the hemp fandango .  and then i   ll bleedin    well go home and maybe i   ll even have a hard boiled egg .         you   re hurting .         you know  you   re right there  carcer .     vimes managed to get both the man   s wrists in a steel grip  and ripped the sleeve off his own shirt .     i   m hurting and i   m still doing it all by the book .     he wrapped the linen around the wrists a couple of times and knotted it firmly .     i   ll make sure there   s water in your cell  carcer .  i   ll make sure you get breakfast  anything you like .  i   ll make sure the hangman doesn   t get sloppy and let you choke to death .  i   ll even make sure the trapdoor is greased .     he released the pressure .  carcer stumbled  and vimes kicked his legs from under him .      the machine ain   t broken  carcer .  the machine is waiting for you     he said  tearing a sleeve off the man   s own shirt and fashioning it into a crude binding for his ankles .     the city will kill you dead .  the proper wheels   ll turn .  it   ll be fair  i   ll make sure of that .  afterward you won   t be able to say you didn   t have a fair trial .  won   t be able to say a thing  haha .  i   ll see to that  too        he stood back .      good evening  your grace     said lord vetinari .  vimes spun around .  there was a change of texture in the darkness  which could have been man shaped .   vimes snatched up his sword and peered into the night .  the shape came forward  became recognizable .      how long were you there .     he demanded .      oh   some little while     said the patrician .     like you  i prefer to come alone and   contemplate .         you were very quiet .     said vimes accusingly .      is that a crime  your grace .         and you heard    .         a very neat arrest     said vetinari .     congratulations  your grace .      vimes looked at the unblooded sword .      i suppose so     he said  temporarily derailed .      on the birth of your son  i meant .         oh   yes .  oh .  of course .  yes .  well   thank you .         a healthy lad  i am given to understand .         we   d have been just as happy with a daughter     said vimes quickly .      quite so .  these are modern times  after all .  oh  i see you have dropped your badge        vimes glanced at the long grass .      i   ll come and find it in the morning     he said .     but this     he picked up the moaning carcer and slung him over his shoulder with a grunt     is going back to pseudopolis yard right now .      they walked slowly down the gravel path  leaving the scent of lilac behind .  ahead was the everyday stink of the world .      you know     said lord vetinari after a few moments     it has often crossed my mind that those men deserve a proper memorial of some sort .         oh yes .     said vimes in a noncommittal voice .     in one of the main squares  perhaps .         yes  that would be a good idea .         perhaps a tableau in bronze .     said vimes .     all seven of them raising the flag  perhaps .         bronze  yes     said vetinari .      really .  and some sort of inspiring slogan .     said vimes .      yes  indeed .  something like  perhaps     they did the job they had to do    .         no     said vimes  coming to a halt under a lamp by the crypt entrance .     how dare you .  how dare you .  at this time .  in this place .  they did the job they didn   t have to do  and they died doing it  and you can   t give them anything .  do you understand .  they fought for those who   d been abandoned  they fought for one another  and they were betrayed .  men like them always are .  what good would a statue be .  it   d just inspire new fools to believe they   re going to be heroes .  they wouldn   t want that .  just let them be .  forever .      they walked in heavy silence  and then vetinari said  as if there had been no outburst     happily  it appears that the new deacon at the temple has suddenly heard the call .         what call .         i   m never very good at religious matters  but apparently he was filled with a burning desire to spread the good word to the benighted heathens     said vetinari .      where .         i suggested ting ling .         that   s right on the other side of the world .         well  a good word can   t be spread too far  sergeant .         well  at least it puts        vimes stopped at the entrance gates .  overhead  another lamp flickered .  he dropped carcer to the ground .      you knew .  you bloody well knew  didn   t you .         not until  oh  one second ago     said vetinari .     as one man to another  commander  i must ask you  did you ever wonder why i wore the lilac .         yeah .  i wondered     said vimes .      but you never asked .         no .  i never asked     said vimes shortly .     it   s a flower .  anyone can wear a flower .         at this time .  in this place .         tell me  then .         then i   ll recall the day i was sent on an urgent errand     said vetinari .     i had to save the life of a man .  not a usual errand for an assassin  although  in fact  i had already saved it once before .     he gave vimes a quizzical look .      you   d shot a man who was aiming a crossbow .     said vimes .      an inspired guess  commander .  yes .  i have an eye for the   unique .  but now i was fighting time .  the streets were blocked .  chaos and confusion were everywhere  and it wasn   t as if i even knew where he could be found .  in the end  i took to the rooftops .  and thus i came at last to cable street  where there was a different sort of confusion .         tell me what you saw     said vimes .      i saw a man called carcer   vanish .  and i saw a man called john keel die .  at least  i saw him dead .         really     said vimes .      i joined the fight .  i snatched up a lilac bloom from a fallen man and  i have to say  held it in my mouth .  i   d like to think i made some difference  i certainly killed four men  although i take no particular pride in that .  they were thugs  bullies .  no real skill .  besides  their leader had apparently fled  and what morale they had had gone with him .  the men with the lilac  i have to say  fought like tigers .  not skillfully  i   ll admit  but when they saw that their leader was down they took the other side to pieces .  astonishing .      and then  afterward  i took a look at john keel .  it was john keel .  how could there be any question about that .  blood on him  of course .  there was blood everywhere .  his wounds looked somewhat old  i thought .  and death  as we know  changes people .  yet i remember wondering  this much .  so i put it down as half a mystery and today   sergeant   we find the other half of the mystery .  it   s wonderful  isn   t it  how alike men can be .  i can imagine that even your sergeant colon would not realize anything .  after all  he saw keel die and he watched you grow up           where is this leading .     vimes demanded .      nowhere  commander .  what could i prove .  and to what end would i prove it .         then i   m saying nothing .         i cannot imagine what you could say     said vetinari .     no .  i agree .  let us leave the dead alone .  but for you  commander  as a little gift on the occasion of the birth of           there   s nothing i want     said vimes quickly .     you can   t promote me any further .  there   s nothing left to bribe me with .  i   ve got more than i deserve .  the watch is working well .  we don   t even need a new bloody dartboard           in memory of the late john keel       vetinari began .      i warned you              i can give you back treacle mine road .      only the high pitched squeak of bats  hunting around the poplars  broke the silence that followed .   then vimes muttered     a dragon burned it years ago .  the watch house was in ruins .  some dwarfs live in the cellars now           yes  commander .  but dwarfs   well  dwarfs are so refreshingly open about money .  the more money the city offers  the less dwarf there is .  the stable   s still there  and the old mining tower .  stout stone walls all around .  it could all be put back  commander .  in memory of john keel  a man who in a few short days changed the lives of many and  perhaps  saved some sanity in a mad world .  why  in a few months you could light the lamp over the door        again  all that could be heard was the bats .   perhaps they could even bring back the smell  vimes thought .  perhaps there could be a window above the privy that   d spring open if you thumped it just right .  perhaps they could teach new coppers to learn old tricks        we could do with the space  it   s true     he conceded with some effort .      i can see you like the sound of it already     said vetinari .     and if you care to come along to my office tomorrow  we can settle the           there   s a trial tomorrow     said vimes sharply .      ah  yes .  of course .  and it will be a fair one     said the patrician .      it   d better be     said vimes .     i want this bastard to hang  after all .         well  then     said vetinari     afterward we could           afterward i   m going home to my family for a while     said vimes .      good .  well said     said vetinari  not missing a beat .     you have a gift  i have noticed  for impressive oratory .     and vimes heard the gentle note of warning  as he added     at this time  commander  and in this place .         that   s sergeant at arms  thank you     said vimes .     for now .      he grabbed carcer   s shirt collar  and dragged him to justice .       on the way back to scoone avenue  in the dark of night  vimes walked along the alley behind clay lane and stopped when he reckoned he was at a point halfway between the backs of the pawnshop and the shonky shop  and therefore behind the temple .   he threw his cigar stub over the fence .  he heard it land on gravel  which moved a little .   and then he went home .  and the world turned toward morning .       about the author      terry

as a result of a long forgotten magical accident .  it was so forgotten  in fact  that now people were forgetting he was an orangutan .  this might seem quite hard to do  given that even a small orangutan is quite capable of filling all immediately available space  but to the wizards and most of the citizens he was now just the librarian  and that was that .  in fact  if somebody ever
