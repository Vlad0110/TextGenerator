introduction      special note  the erudite copy reader points out that since the stories that follow were written for separate publication in a magazine originally  i identify the continuing characters each time  and do it repetitious ly .  he pointed out several of the more nauseating examples of this and  with reverence for his exalted position  i corrected the matter in accordance with his suggestions .  there undoubtedly remain some dozens of repetitions that could bear revision  but i hate to introduce too many changes from the pristine originals .  would you forgive me  then  for

sight        introduction  because i have a friendly and personal writing style  readers have a tendency to write to me in a friendly and personal way  asking all kinds of friendly and personal questions .  and because i really am what my writing style  such as it is  portrays me to be  i answer those letters .  and since i don t have a secretary or any form of assistant whatever  it takes a lot of the time i should be devoting to writing .   it is only natural  then  that i have taken to writing introductions to my books in an attempt to answer some of the anticipated questions in advance  thus forestalling some of the letters .   for instance  because i write in many fields  i frequently get questions such as these    why do you  a lowly science fiction writer  think you can write a two volume work on shakespeare .     why do you  a shakespearean scholar  choose to write science fiction thrillers .     what gives you  a biochemist  the nerve to write books on history .     what makes you  a mere historian  think you know anything about science .    and so on  and so on .   it seems certain  then  that i will be asked  either with amusement or with exasperation  why i am writing mystery stories .   here goes  then .     i started my writing career in science fiction  and i still write science fiction when i can  for it remains my first and chief literary love .  however  i am interested in many things and among them has been the mystery .  i have been reading mysteries almost as long as i have been reading science fiction .  i remember risking my life when  as a ten year old  i pilfered forbidden copies of the shadow from under my father s pillow when he was taking his afternoon nap .   i asked him why he read it if i was forbidden  and he said he needed it in order to learn english  whereas i had the advantage of school .  what a rotten reason i thought that was .    in writing science fiction  then  i frequently introduced the mystery motif .  two of my novels  the caves of steel  doubleday        and the naked sun  doubleday         are full fledged murder mysteries for all that they are science fiction as well .  i have written enough shorter science fiction mysteries of one sort or another to make it possible to publish a collection of them as asimov s mysteries  doubleday        .   i also wrote a  straight  mystery novel  the death dealers  avon          well  it was rejected by doubleday  if you must know  which was eventually reissued in      by walker   company under my own title of a whiff of death .  this  however  dealt entirely with science and scientists and its atmosphere was still that of the science fiction novel  as was true of two mystery short stories i sold to mystery magazines .   increasingly  i felt the itch to write mysteries that had nothing to do with science .  one thing that held me back  though  was the fact that the mystery had evolved in the last quarter century and my tastes had not .  mysteries these days are heavily drenched in liquor  injected with drugs  marinated in sex  and roasted in sadism  whereas my detective ideal is hercule poirot and his little gray cells .   but then  back in       i received a letter from that gorgeous blond young lady  eleanor sullivan  who is managing editor of ellery queen s mystery magazine  or eqmm for short   asking if i would consider writing a short story for the magazine .  of course  i jubilantly agreed  because i thought that if they asked for one  they couldn t possibly have the cruelty to reject it once written  and that meant i could safely write my own kind of story  very cerebral .     i began revolving plot possibilities in my head rather anxiously  for i wanted something with a reasonable twist to it and agatha christie  all by herself  had already used virtually all possible twists .   while the wheels were slowly turning in the recesses of my mind  i happened to be visiting the actor david ford  who was in both the broadway and hollywood versions of       .  his apartment is filled with all kinds of interesting oddities  and he told me that he was convinced once that someone had taken something from his apartment but he could never be sure because he couldn t tell whether anything was missing .   i laughed and all the wheels in my head  heaving a collective sigh of relief  stopped turning .  i had my twist .     i then needed a background against which to display the twist and here we have something else .   back in the early      s  legend has it  someone got married to a lady who found her husband s friends unacceptable  and vice versa .  in order to avoid breaking off a valued relationship  those friends organized a club without officers or bylaws for the sole purpose of having a dinner once a month .  it would be a stag organization so that the husband in question could be invited to join and his wife legitimately requested not to attend .   nowadays  with women s lib so powerful  this might not have worked .    the organization was named the trap door spiders  or tds  for short  probably because the members felt themselves to be hiding .   thirty years have passed since the tds was organized but it still exists .  it is still stag  though the member whose marriage inspired the organization is long since divorced .   as a concession to male non chauvinism  a cocktail party was given on february         at which the tds wives could meet one another and this may become an annual custom .    once a month  the tds meets  always on a friday night  almost always in manhattan  sometimes in a restaurant  sometimes in a member s apartment .  each meeting is co hosted by two volunteers who bear all the expenses for the occasion and who may each bring a guest .  the average attendance is twelve .  there are drinks and conversation from      to      p . m .   food and conversation from      to      p . m .   and just conversation thereafter .   after the meal each guest is grilled on his interests  his profession  his hobbies  his views  and the results are almost always interesting  often fascinating .   the chief among the general eccentricities of the tds are these      every member is addressed as  doctor  by the others  the title going along with the membership  and     each member is supposed to try to arrange for a mention of the tds in his obituary .   i had been a guest myself on two different occasions  and when i moved to new york in       i was elected to membership .   well  then  thought i  why not tell my mystery story against the background of the meeting of an organization something like the tds .  my club would be called the black widowers and i would cut it in half to make it manageable six people and one host .   naturally  there are differences .  the members of the tds have never  in real life  attempted to solve mysteries and none of them is as idiosyncratic as the members of the black widowers .  in fact  the members of the tds are  one and all  lovable people and there is a mutual affection that is touching to see .  therefore  please be assured that the characters and events in the stories in this book are my own invention and are not to be equated with anyone or anything in the tds  except insofar as they may seem intelligent or lovable .   in particular  henry  the waiter  is my own invention and has no analogue  however remote  in the tds .     so  having my plot and my background  i wrote a story  i named  the chuckle .   it was accepted by eqmm  which renamed it  the acquisitive chuckle .    eqmm invariably changes my titles .  this doesn t bother me  because i always look forward to book publication  in which i can change the titles back to what they should be .  sometimes i don t  as  on rare occasions  an editorial change of title meets my approval .  for instance  i really think  the acquisitive chuckle  is better than  the chuckle   so i am keeping that .    after the first sale  there was no stopping me  of course .  i began to write one black widower tale after another and in little more than a year i had written eight and sold each of them to eqmm .   the trouble was that  even though i was holding myself back  and not writing as many as i wanted to write  i was still producing them faster than eqmm could publish them .   i finally broke under the strain of not writing  so i wrote three more  at my natural rate of production  and decided not to plague the magazine with them .  then i wrote a fourth and sold it to them .  that brought the total to twelve  with enough wordage for a book .  my loyal publishers  doubleday   company  had been waiting patiently in the wings ever since the first story  so i am now putting them together as tales of the black widowers  and here you are .   any questions .    i hope not .         the acquisitive chuckle    hanley bartram was the guest  that night  of the black widowers  who monthly met in their quiet haunt and vowed death to any female who intruded for that one night per month  at any rate .   the number of attendees varied  five members were present on this occasion .   geoffrey avalon was host for the evening .  he was tall  with a neatly trimmed mustache and a smallish beard  more white than black now  but with hair nearly as black as ever .   as host  it was his duty to deliver the ritual toast that marked the beginning of the dinner proper .  loudly  and with gusto  he said   to old king cole of sacred memory .  may his pipe be forever lit  his bowl forever full  his fiddlers forever in health  and may we all be as merry as he all our lives long .    each cried   amen   touched his lips to drink  and sat down .  avalon put his drink to the side of his plate .  it was his second and was now exactly half full .  it would remain there throughout the dinner and was not to be touched again .  he was a patent lawyer and he carried over into his social life the minutiae of his work .  one and a half drinks was precisely what he allowed himself on these occasions .   thomas trumbull came storming up the stairs at the last minute  with the usual cry of  henry  a scotch and soda for a dying man .    henry  the waiter at these functions for several years now  and with no last name that any black widower had ever heard used   had the scotch and soda in readiness .  he was sixtyish but his face was unwrinkled and staid .   his voice seemed to recede into the distance even as he spoke .   right here  mr .  trumbull .    trumbull spotted bartram at once and said to avalon in an aside   your guest .     he asked to come   said avalon  in as near a whisper as he could manage .   nice fellow .  you ll like him .    the dinner itself went as miscellaneously as the black widowers  affairs usually did .  emmanuel rubin  who had the other beard a thin and scraggly one under a mouth with widely spaced teeth had broken out of a writer s block and was avidly giving the details of the story he had finished .  james drake  with a rectangular face  a mustache but no beard  was interrupting with memories of other stories  tangentially related .  drake was only an organic chemist but he had an encyclopedic knowledge of pulp fiction .   trumbull  as a code expert  considered himself to be in the inner councils of government and took it into his head to be outraged at mario gonzalo s political pronouncements .   god damn it   he yelled  in one of his less vituperative moods   why don t you stick to your idiotic collages and your burlap bags and leave world affairs to your betters .    trumbull had not recovered from gonzalo s one man art show earlier that year  and gonzalo  understanding this  laughed good naturedly  and said   show me my betters .  name one .    bartram  short and plump  with hair that curled in ringlets  clung firmly to his role as guest .  he listened to everyone  smiled at everyone  and said little .   eventually the time came when henry poured the coffee and began to place the desserts before each guest with practiced legerdemain .  it was at this moment that the traditional grilling of the guest was supposed to begin .   the initial questioner  almost by tradition  on those occasions when he was present   was thomas trumbull .  his swarthy face  wrinkled into a perennial discontent  looked angry as he began with the invariable opening question   mr .  bartram  how do you justify your existence .    bartram smiled .  he spoke with precision as he said   i have never tried .  my clients  on those occasions when   give satisfaction  find my existence justified .     your clients .   said rubin .   what is it you do  mr .  bartram .     i am a private investigator .     good   said james drake .   i don t think we ve ever had one before .  manny  you can get some of the data correct for a change when you write your tough guy crap .     not from me   said bartram quickly .   trumbull scowled .   if you don t mind  gentlemen  as the appointed grillster  please leave this to me .  mr .  bartram  you speak of the occasions upon which you give satisfaction .  do you always give satisfaction .     there are times when the matter can be debated   said bartram .   in fact  i would like to speak to you this evening concerning an occasion that was particularly questionable .  it may even be that one of you might be useful in that connection .  it was with that in mind that i asked my good friend jeff avalon to invite me to a meeting  once i learned the details of the organization .  he obliged and i am delighted .     are you ready now to discuss this dubious satisfaction you gave or did not give  as the case may be .     yes  if you will allow me .    trumbull looked at the others for signs of dissent .  gonzalo s prominent eyes were fixed on bartram as he said   may we interrupt .   quickly  and with an admirable economy of strokes  he was doodling a caricature of bartram on the back of his menu card .  it would join the others which memorialized guests and which marched in brave array across the walls .    within reason   said bartram .  he paused to sip at his coffee and then said   the story begins with anderson  to whom i shall refer only in that fashion .  he was an acquisitor .     an inquisitor .   asked gonzalo  frowning .    an acquisitor .  he gained things  he earned them  he bought them  he picked them up  he collected them .  the world moved in one direction with respect to him  it moved toward him  never away .  he had a house into which this flood of material  of varying value  came to rest and never moved again .  through the years  it grew steadily thicker and amazingly heterogeneous .  he also had a business partner  whom i shall call only jackson .    trumbull interrupted  frowning  not because there was anything to frown about  but because he always frowned .  he said   is this a true story .     i tell only true stories   said bartram slowly and precisely .   i lack the imagination to lie .     is it confidential .     i shall not tell the story in such a way as to make it easily recognized  but were it to be recognized  it would be confidential .     i follow the subjunctive   said trumbull   but i wish to assure you that what is said within the walls of this room is never repeated  nor referred to  however tangen tially  outside its walls .  henry understands this  too .    henry  who was refilling two of the coffeecups  smiled a little and bent his head in agreement .   bartram smiled also and went on   jackson had a disease  too .  he was honest  unavoidably and deeply honest .  the characteristic permeated his soul as though  from an early age  he had been marinated in integrity .    to a man like anderson  it was most useful to have honest jackson as partner  for their business  which i carefully do not describe in detail  required contact with the public .  such contact was not for anderson  for his acquisitiveness stood in the way .  with each object he acquired  another little crease of slyness entered his face  until it seemed a spider s web that frightened all flies at sight .  it was jackson  the pure and the honest  who was the front man  and to whom all widows hastened with their mites  and orphans with their farthings .    on the other hand  jackson found anderson a necessity  too  for jackson  with all his honesty  perhaps because of it  had no knack for making one dollar become two .  left to himself  he would  entirely without meaning to  lose every cent entrusted to him and would then quickly be forced to kill himself as a dubious form of restitution .  anderson s hands were to money  however  as fertilizer is to roses  and he and jackson were  together  a winning combination .    yet no paradise continues forever  and a besetting characteristic  left to itself  will deepen  widen  and grow more extreme .  jackson s honesty grew to such colossal proportions that anderson  for all his shrewdness  was occasionally backed to the wall and forced into monetary loss .  similarly  anderson s acquisitiveness burrowed to such infernal depths that jackson  for all his morality  found himself occasionally twisted into questionable practices .    naturally  as anderson disliked losing money  and jackson abhorred losing character  a coolness grew between the two .  in such a situation the advantage clearly lay on the side of anderson  who placed no reasonable limits on his actions  whereas jackson felt himself bound by a code of ethics .    slyly  anderson worked and maneuvered until  eventually  poor honest jackson found himself forced to sell out his end of the partnership under the most disadvantageous possible conditions .    anderson s acquisitiveness  we might say  had reached a climax  for he acquired sole control of the business .  it was his intention to retire now  leaving its everyday running to employees  and concerning himself no further than was required to pocket its profits .  jackson  on the other hand  was left with nothing more than his honesty  and while honesty is an admirable characteristic  it has small direct value in a hockshop .    it was at this point  gentlemen  that i entered the picture .   .   .   .  ah  henry  thank you .    the glasses of brandy were being passed about .    you did not know these people to begin with .   asked rubin  his sharp eyes blinking .    not at all   said bartram  sniffing delicately at the brandy and just touching it to his upper lip   though i think one of you in this room did .  it was some years ago .    i first met anderson when he entered my office in a white heat .   i want you to find what i ve lost   he said .  i have dealt with many cases of theft in my career and so i said  naturally   just what is it you have lost .   and he answered   damn it  man  that s what i ve just asked you to find out .     the story came out rather raggedly .  anderson and jackson had quarreled with surprising intensity .  jackson was outraged  as only an honest man can be when he finds that his integrity is no shield against the conniving of others .  he swore revenge  and anderson shrugged that off with a laugh .     beware the wrath of a patient man   quoted avalon  with the air of precision research he brought to even his least portentous statements .    so i have heard   said bartram   though i have never had occasion to test the maxim .  nor  apparently  had anderson  for he had no fear of jackson .  as he explained  jackson was so psychotically honest and so insanely law abiding that there was no chance of his slipping into wrongdoing .  or so anderson thought .  it did not even occur to him to ask jackson to return the office key  something all the more curious since the office was located in anderson s house  in among the knickknackery .    anderson recalled this omission a few days after the quarrel  for  returning from an early evening appointment  he found jackson in his house .  jackson carried his old attache case  which he was just closing as anderson entered  closing with startled haste  it seemed to anderson .    anderson frowned and said  inevitably   what are you doing here .       returning some papers which were in my possession and which now belong to you   said jackson   and returning the key to the office .   with this remark  he handed over the key  indicated papers on the desk  and pushed the combination lock on his battered attache case with fingers that anderson could swear trembled a little .  jackson looked about the room with what appeared to anderson to be a curious  almost a secretively satisfied  smile and said   i will now leave .   he proceeded to do so .    it was not until anderson heard the motor of jackson s car whirring into action and then retreating into the distance that he could rouse himself from a kind of stupor that had paralyzed him .  he knew he had been robbed  and the next day he came to me .    drake pursed his lips  twirled his half empty brandy glass  and said   why not to the police .     there was a complication   said bartram .   anderson did not know what had been taken .  when the certainty of theft dawned on him  he naturally rushed to the safe .  its contents were secure .  he ransacked his desk .  nothing seemed to be missing .  he went from room to room .  everything seemed to be intact as far as he could tell .     wasn t he certain .   asked gonzalo .    he couldn t be .  the house was inordinately crowded with every variety of object and he didn t remember all his possessions .  he told me  for instance  that at one time he collected antique watches .  he had them in a small drawer in his study  six of them .  all six were there  but he was nagged by the faint memory of seven .  for the life of him  he could not remember definitely .  in fact  it was worse than that  for one of the six present seemed strange to him .  could it be that he had had only six but that a less valuable one had been substituted for a more valuable one .  something of this sort repeated itself a dozen times over in every hideaway and with every sort of odd ment .  so he came to me     wait a while   said trumbull  bringing his hand down hard on the table .   what made him so certain that jackson had taken anything at all .     ah   said bartram   that is the fascinating part of the story .  the closing of the attache case  and jackson s secretive smile as he looked about the room  served in themselves to rouse anderson s suspicions  but as the door closed behind him  jackson chuckled .  it was not an ordinary chuckle .   .   .   .  but i ll let anderson tell it in his own words  as nearly as i remember them .      bartram   he said   i have heard that chuckle innumerable times in my life .  i have chuckled that way myself a thousand times .  it is a characteristic chuckle  an unmistakable one  an unmaskable one .  it is the acquisitive chuckle  it is the chuckle of a man who has just obtained something he wants very much at the expense of someone else .  if any man in all the world knows that chuckle and can recognize it  even behind a closed door  that man is myself .  i cannot be mistaken .  jackson had taken something of mine and was glorying in it .     there was no arguing with the man on this point .  he virtually slavered at the thought of having been victimized and  indeed  i had to believe him .  i had to suppose that for all jackson s pathological honesty  he had been lured  by the once in a lifetime snapping of patience  into theft .  helping lure him must have been his knowledge of anderson .  he must have known anderson s intent hold on even the least valued of his belongings  and realized that the hurt would extend far deeper and far beyond the value of the object taken  however great that value might have been .    rubin said   maybe it was the attache case he took .     no  no  that was jackson s .  he d owned it for years .  so there you have the problem .  anderson wanted me to find out what had been taken  for until he could identify a stolen object and show that the object was  or had been  in the possession of jackson  he could not prosecute and he was most intent on prosecution .  my task  then  was to look through his house and tell him what was missing .     how would that be possible  if he himself couldn t tell .   growled trumbull .    i pointed that out to him   said bartram   but he was wild and unreasoning .  he offered me a great deal of money  win or lose  a very handsome fee  indeed  and he put down a sizable portion of it as a retainer .  it was clear he resented beyond measure the deliberate insult to his acquisitiveness .  the thought that an amateur non acquis itor like jackson should dare beard him in this most sacred of his passions had driven him  on this one point  mad  and he was prepared to go to any expense to keep the other s victory from being final .    i am myself quite human .  i accepted the retainer and the fee .  after all  i reasoned  i had my methods .  i took up the question of insurance lists first .  all were outdated  but they served to eliminate the furniture and all the larger items as possible victims of jackson s thievery  for everything on the lists was still in the house .    avalon interrupted .   they were eliminated anyway  since the stolen object would have had to fit into the attache case .     provided that it was indeed the attache case that was used to transport the item out of the house   pointed out bartram patiendy .   it might easily have been a decoy .  prior to anderson s return  jackson could have had a moving van at the door and taken out the grand piano had he so chosen  and then snapped the attache case in anderson s face to mislead him .    but never mind that .  it wasn t likely .  i took him around the house room by room  following a systematic procedure of considering the floor  walls  and ceiling  studying all the shelves  opening every door  considering every piece of furniture  going through every closet .  nor did i neglect the attic and the basement .  never before had anderson been forced to consider every item of his vast and amorphous collection in order that somewhere  somehow  some item would jog his memory of some companion item that was not there .    it was an enormous house  a heterogeneous one  an endless one .  it took us days  and poor anderson grew more befuddled each day .    i next tackled it from the other end .  it was obvious that jackson had deliberately taken something unnotice able  perhaps small  certainly something that anderson would not easily miss and therefore not something to which he was greatly attached .  on the other hand  it made sense to suppose that it was something jackson would want to take away  and which he would find valuable .  indeed  his deed would give him most satisfaction if anderson  too  found it valuable once he realized what it was that was gone .  what  then  could it be .     a small painting   said gonzalo eagerly   which jackson knew to be an authentic cezanne  but which anderson thought was junk .     a stamp from anderson s collection   said rubin   which jackson noted had a rare mistake in the engraving .   he had once written a story which had hinged on this precise point .    a book   said trumbull   which contained some hidden family secret with which  in due time  jackson could blackmail anderson .     a photograph   said avalon dramatically   that anderson had forgotten but which contained the likeness of an old sweetheart which  eventually  he would give a fortune to buy back .     i don t know what business they were in   said drake thoughtfully   but it might have been the kind where some unvalued gimcrack might actually be of great value to a competitor and drive anderson to bankruptcy .  i remember one case where a formula for a hydrazo intermediate     oddly enough   said bartram  breaking in firmly   i thought of each of these possibilities  and i went over each with anderson .  it was clear that he had no taste in art and such pieces as he had were really junk  and no mistake .  he did not collect stamps  and though he had many books and could not tell for certain whether one was gone  he swore he had no hidden family secrets anywhere that were worth the skipped beat of a blackmailer s heart .  nor had he ever had any old sweethearts  since in his younger days he had confined himself to professional ladies whose photographs he did not prize .  as for his business secrets  they were of the sort that would interest the government far more than any competitor  and everything of that sort had been kept far from jackson s honest eyes in the first place and were still in the safe  or long in the fire  in the second .  i thought of other possibilities  but  one by one  they were knocked down .    of course  jackson might betray himself .  he might blossom out into sudden wealth  and in ferreting out the source of the wealth  we might learn the identity of the stolen object .    anderson suggested that himself and paid lavishly to have a twenty four hour watch put on jackson .  it was useless .  the man kept a dull way of life and behaved precisely as you would expect someone minus his life savings to behave .  he lived parsimoniously  and  eventually  took a menial job  where his honesty and his calm demeanor stood him in good stead .    finally  i had but one alternative left    wait  wait   said gonzalo   let me guess  let me guess .   he tossed off what was left of his brandy  signaled henry for another  and said   you asked jackson .     i was strongly tempted to   said bartram ruefully   but that would scarcely have been feasible .  it doesn t do in my profession to even hint at an accusation without evidence of any sort .  licenses are too fragile .  and in any case  he would simply deny theft  if accused  and be put on his guard against any self incrimination .     well  then  .   .   .     said gonzalo blankly  and petered out .   the other four furrowed brows one and all  but only silence followed .   bartram  having waited politely  said   you won t guess  gentlemen  for you are not in the profession .  you know only what you read in romances and so you think gentlemen like myself have unlimited numbers of alternatives and invariably solve all cases .  i  myself  being in the profession  know otherwise .  gentlemen  the one alternative i had left was to confess failure .    anderson paid me  however  i ll give him that much credit .  by the time i said my goodbyes to him  he had lost some ten pounds .  there was a vacant look in his eyes and  as he shook hands with me  they moved round and round the room he was in  still looking  still looking .  he muttered   i tell you i couldn t possibly mistake that chuckle .  he took something from me .  he took something from me .     i saw him on two or three occasions thereafter .  he never stopped looking  he never found the missing object .   he went rather downhill .  the events i have described took place nearly five years ago  and last month  he died .    there was a short silence .  avalon said   without ever finding the missing object .     without ever finding it .    trumbull said  with disapproval   are you coming to us to help you with the problem now .     in a way  yes .  the occasion is too good to miss .  anderson is dead and whatever is said within these walls will go no farther  we all agree  so that i may now ask what i could not ask before .   .   .   .  henry  may i have a light .    henry  who had been listening with a kind of absent minded deference  produced a book of matches and lit bartram s cigarette .    let me introduce you  henry  to those you so efficiently serve .   .   .   .  gentlemen  may i introduce to you  henry jackson .    there was a moment of clear shock and drake said   the jackson .     exactly   said bartram .   i knew he was working here and when i heard it was at this club that you met for your monthly meetings  i had to beg  rather shamelessly  for an invitation .  it was only here that i could find the gentleman with the acquisitive chuckle  and do so under conditions of both bonhomie and discretion .    henry smiled and bent his head .   bartram said   there were times during the course of the investigation when i could not help but wonder  henry  whether anderson might not have been wrong and whether there might possibly have been no theft at all .  always  however  i returned to the matter of the acquisitive chuckle  and i trusted anderson s judgment .     you did right to do so   said jackson softly   for i did steal something from my one time partner  the gentleman you have referred to as anderson .  i never regretted the act for one moment .     it was something of value  i presume .     it was of the greatest value and no day passed without my thinking of the theft and rejoicing in the fact that the wicked man no longer had what i had taken away .     and you deliberately roused his suspicions in order that you might experience the greater joy .     yes  sir .     and you did not fear being caught .     not for one moment  sir .     by god   roared avalon suddenly  his voice soaring to breakneck loudness .   i say it again .  beware the wrath of a patient man .  i am a patient man  and i am tired of this endless cross examination .  beware my wrath  henry .  what was it you carried off in your attache case .     why  nothing  sir   said henry .   it was empty .     heaven help me .  where did you put whatever it was you took from him .     i didn t have to put it anywhere  sir .     well  then  what did you take .     only his peace of mind  sir   said henry gently .     afterword  this story first appeared in the january      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine .   it taught me an object lesson  too  in this matter of chains of logical deduction .  i ve often thought that the ease with which story detectives weave their inexorable webs of logic was too pat  that in real life there would always be large holes .   sometimes  the holes appear even in the stories .  after  the acquisitive chuckle  had appeared  a reader wrote to tell me that i had neglected to specify that jackson s attache case was really his own  and that it might well have been the attache case that he had stolen .  that had never occurred to me and so  of course  it didn t occur to any of the characters in the story .   for the book  therefore  i added a couple of lines to take care of that possibility .   that shows you  by the way  that readers aren t merely replete with troublesome questions  as the introduction would seem to imply .  sometimes they are very useful  and i appreciate those occasions greatly .           ph as in phony    the meeting of the black widowers was marred  but only slightly  by the restlessness of james drake .   it was a shame that this had to be so  for the dinner was unusually good  even allowing for the loving care with which the milano restaurant took care of its special group every month .  and if the veal cordon bleu needed anything to add the final bit of luster  it was henry s meticulous service  which had plates on the table where no plate had been before  yet without any person present able to catch it en route .   it was thomas trumbull s turn to host  something he did with a savagery to which no one paid the slightest bit of attention  a savagery made particularly bitter by the fact that  as host  he did not think it fit to come charging in just one second before the pre dinner drinks had completed their twice around  three times for rubin  who never showed the effects  .   trumbull exercised host s privilege and had brought a guest for the grilling .  the guest was tall  almost as tall as geoffrey avalon  the black widowers  patent attorney member .  he was lean  almost as lean as geoffrey avalon .  he was clean shaven  though  and lacked the solemnity of avalon .  indeed  his face was round and his cheeks plump  in a manner so out of keeping with the rest of his body that one might have thought him the product of a head transplant .  he was arnold stacey  by name .    arnold stacey  ph . d .    trumbull had introduced him .    ah   said avalon  with the air of portentousness he automatically brought to his most trivial statement   doctor doctor stacey .     doctor doctor .   murmured stacey  his lips parting as  though getting ready for a smile at the pleasantry sure to follow .    it is a rule of the black widowers   said trumbull impatiently   that all members are doctors by virtue of membership .  a doctor for any other reason is     a doctor doctor   finished stacey .  and he smiled .    you can count honorary doctorates  too   said rubin  his wide spaced teeth gleaming over a beard as straggly as avalon s was crisp   but then i would have to be called doctor doctor doctor    mario gonzalo was mounting the stairs just then  bringing with him a faint whiff of turpentine as though he had come straight from his artist s studio .   trumbull maintained you couldn t draw that conclusion  that gonzalo placed a drop of turpentine behind each ear before any social engagement .    gonzalo was in time to catch emmanuel rubin s statement and said  before he had quite reached the top step   what honorary doctorates did you ever receive  manny .  dishonorary doctorates  i m ready to believe .    rubin s face froze as it usually did when he was attacked without warning  but that was merely the short pause necessary to gather his forces .  he said   i can list them for you .  in       when i was only fifteen  it so happens i was a revivalist preacher and i received a d . d .  from     no  for god s sake   said trumbull   don t give us the list .  we accept it all .     you re fighting out of your weight  mario   said avalon with wooden amiability .   you know rubin can never be spotted in an inconsistency when he starts talking about his early life .     sure   said gonzalo   that s why his stories are so lousy .  they re all autobiographical .  no poetry .     i have written poetry   began rubin  and then drake came in .  usually  he was the first person there  this time  the last .    train was late   he said quietly  shucking his coat .  since he had to come in from new jersey to attend  the only surprise was that it didn t happen oftener .    introduce me to the guest   drake added  as he turned to take the drink henry held out for him .  henry knew which he preferred  of course .   avalon said   doctor doctor arnold stacey  .   .   .  doctor doctor james drake .     greetings   said drake  holding up his glass in salute .   what s the nature of the lesser doctorate  doctor stacey .     ph . d .  in chemistry .  doctor doctor  and call me arnold .    drake s small grizzled mustache seemed to bristle .   ditto   he said .   my ph . d .  is in chemistry  too .    they looked at each other  warily  for a moment .  then drake said   industry .  government .  academic .    i teach .  assistant professor at berry university .    where .     berry university .  it s not a large school .  it s in    i know where it is   said drake .   i did graduate work there .  considerably before your time  though .  did you get your degree at berry before you joined the faculty .    no  i     let s sit down  for god s sake   roared trumbull .   there s more drinking and less eating going on here all the time .   he was standing at the host s seat  with his glass raised  glowering at the others as each took his seat .   sit down .  sit down .   and then he intoned the ritual toast to old king cole in singsong while gonzalo blandly kept time with a hard roll  which he broke and buttered when the last syllable was done .    what s this .   said rubin suddenly  staring down at his dish in dismay .    p  t   de la maison  sir   said henry softly .    that s what i thought .  chopped liver .  damn it  henry  i ask you  as a pathologically honest man  is this fit to eat .     the matter is quite subjective  sir .  it depends on the personal taste of the diner .    avalon pounded the table .   point of order .  i object to manny s use of the adjectival phrase  pathologically honest .   violation of confidence .    rubin colored slightly .   hold on  jeff .  i don t violate any confidence .  that happens to be my opinion of henry quite independently of what happened last month .     ruling from the chair   said avalon stubbornly .   trumbull said   shut up both of you .  it is the ruling of the chair that henry may be recognized by all black widowers as that rare phenomenon  a completey honest man .  no reason need be given .  it can be taken as a matter of common knowledge .    henry smiled gently .   shall i take away the pate  sir .     would you eat it  henry .   asked rubin .    with pleasure  sir .     then i ll eat it  too .   and he did so  with every sign of barely controlled nausea .   trumbull leaned over to drake and said in a voice that was low for him   what the hell s bothering you .    drake started slightly and said   nothing .  what s bothering you .     you are   said trumbull .   i ve never seen a roll taken apart into so many pieces in my life .    the conversation grew general after that  centering chiefly on rubin s aggrieved contention that honesty lacked survival value and that all the forces of natural selection combined to eliminate it as a human trait .  he did well defending his thesis till gonzalo asked him if he attributed his own success as a writer   such as it is   said gonzalo  to plagiarism .  when rubin met the point head on and tried to prove  by close reasoning  that plagiarism was fundamentally different from other forms of dishonesty and might be treated independently  he was hooted down .   then  between main course and dessert  drake left for the men s room and trumbull followed him .   trumbull said   do you know this guy stacey  jim .    drake shook his head .   no .  not at all .     well  what s wrong  then .  i admit you re not an animated phonograph needle like rubin but you haven t said a word all dinner  damn it .  and you keep looking at stacey .    drake said   do me a favor  tom .  let me question him after dinner .    trumbull shrugged .   sure .    over the coffee  trumbull said   the time has come for the grilling of the guest .  under ordinary circumstances  i  as the possessor of the only logical mind at the table  would begin .  on this occasion  i pass to doctor doctor drake since he is of the same professional persuasion as our honored guest .     doctor doctor stacey   began drake heavily   how do you justify your existence .     less and less as time goes on   said stacey  unperturbed .    what the hell does that mean .   broke in trumbull .    i m asking the questions   said drake with unaccustomed firmness .    i don t mind answering   said stacey .   since the universities seem to be in deeper trouble each year  and as i do nothing about it  my own function as a university appendage seems continually less defensible  that s all .    drake ignored that .  he said   you teach at the school where i earned my master s degree .  have you ever heard of me .    stacey hesitated .   i m sorry  jim .  there are a lot of chemists i haven t heard of .  no offense intended .     i m not sensitive .  i never heard of you  either .  what i mean is  have you ever heard of me at berry u .  .  as a student there .     no  i haven t .     i m not surprised .  but there was another student at berry at the same time as myself .  he went on for his doctorate at berry .  his name was faron  fa r o n  lance faron .  did you ever hear of him .     lance faron .   stacey frowned .    lance may have been short for lancelot  lancelot faron .  i don t know .  we always called him lance .    finally stacey shook his head .   no  the name isn t familiar .    drake said   but you have heard of david st .  george .     professor st .  george .  certainly .  he died the same year i joined the faculty .  i can t say i know him  but i ve certainly heard of him .    trumbull said   hell and damnation  jim .  what kind of questions are these .  is this old grad week .    drake  who had drifted off into thought  scrambled out of it and said   wait  tom .  i m getting at something  and i don t want to ask questions .  i want to tell a story first .  my god  this has been bothering me for years and i never thought of putting it up to all of you till now that our guest     i vote the story   shouted gonzalo .    on condition   said avalon   it not be construed as setting a precedent .     chair decides the precedents   said trumbull at once .   go ahead  drake .  only  for god s sake  don t take all night .     it s simple enough   said drake   and it s about lance faron  which is his real name  and i m going to slander him  so you ll have to understand  arnold  that everything said within these walls is strictly confidential .     that s been explained to me   said stacey .    go on   shouted trumbull .   you will take all night .  i know it .    drake said   the thing about lance is that i don t think he ever intended to be a chemist .  his family was rich enough well  i ll tell you .  when he was doing graduate work  he had his lab outfitted with a cork floor at his own expense .     why a cork floor .   gonzalo wanted to know .    if you d ever dropped a beaker on a tile floor  you wouldn t ask   said drake .   he majored in chemistry as an undergraduate because he had to major in something and then he went on to do graduate work in the same field because world war ii was on in europe  the draft was beginning it was      and graduate work in chemistry would look good to the draft board .  and it did  he never got into the army as far as i know .  but that was perfectly legitimate  i never got into uniform  either  and i point no fingers .    avalon  who had been an army officer  looked austere  but said   perfectly legitimate .    drake said   he wasn t serious about it about chemistry  i mean .  he had no natural aptitude for it and he never worked  particularly .  he was satisfied to get no more than a b minus and it was about all he was good for .  nothing wrong with that  i suppose  and it was good enough to sweat out a master s degree for himself which doesn t amount to much in chemistry .  the grades weren t good enough to qualify him for research toward the doctorate  however .    that was the whole point .  we all the rest of us who were in graduate chemistry that year assumed he would only go as far as the master s .  then he d get some sort of job that would keep his draft exemption going  we figured his father would help out there     were the rest of you jealous of him .   asked rubin .   because that kind of guy     we weren t jealous of him   said drake .   sure  we envied the situation .  hell  those were the days before government grants fell about us like snowflakes .  every college semester  i lived a suspense story called  do i dig up the tuition or do i drop out .   all of us would have liked to be rich .  but lance was a likable guy .  he didn t parade the situation and would lend us a few bucks when we were in a hole and do it unostentatiously .  and he was perfectly willing to admit he wasn t a brain    we even helped him .  gus blue tutored him in physical organic for a fee .  of course  he wasn t always scrupulous .  there was one preparation he was supposed to have synthesized in lab  and we knew that he bought a sample at a chemical supply house and turned it in as his own .  at least  we were pretty sure he did  but it didn t bother us .    rubin said   why not .  that was dishonest  wasn t it .     because it wouldn t do him any good   said drake in annoyance .   it just meant another b minus at best .  but the reason i bring it up is that we all knew he was capable of cheating .     you mean the rest of you wouldn t have .   interposed stacey .  there was a touch of cynicism in his voice .   drake lifted his eyebrows  then dropped them again .   i wouldn t guarantee any of us if we were really pushed .  the point is  we weren t .  we all had a fighting chance to get through without the risk of cheating  and none of us did .  as far as i know .  certainly  i didn t .    but then there came a time when lance made up his mind to go on for his ph . d .  it was at a smoker .  the war jobs were just beginning to open up and there were a few recruiters on campus .  it meant money and complete security from the draft  but ph . d .  s meant a lot to us and there was some question as to whether we d come back to school once we got away from class for any reason .    someone  not i  said he wished he were in lance s shoes .  lance had no choice to make .  he would take the job .      i don t know   said lance  maybe just to be contrary .   i think i ll stay right here and go on for the ph . d .     he may have been joking .  i m sure he was joking .  anyway  we all thought he was  and we laughed .  but we were all a little high and it became one of those laughs without reason  you know .  if one of us started to die down  he would catch someone else s eyes and start off again .  it wasn t that funny .  it wasn t funny at all .  but we laughed till we were half suffocated .  and lance turned red  and then white .    i remember i tried to say   lance  we re not laughing at you   but i couldn t .  i was choking and sputtering .  and lance walked out on us .    after that  he was going for his ph . d .  he wouldn t  talk about it but he signed all the necessary forms and that seemed to satisfy him .  after a while  the situation was as before .  he was friendly .    i said to him   listen  lance  you ll be disappointed .  you can t get faculty approval for doctoral research with not a single a on your record .  you just can t .     he said   why not .  i ve talked to the committee .  i told them i d take chemical kinetics under st .  george  and that i d make an a in that .  i said i d let them see what i could do .     that made less than no sense to me .  that was funnier than the remark we laughed at .  you d have to know st .  george .  you ought to know what i mean  arnold .    stacey nodded   he gave a stiff course in kinetics .  one or two of the brightest would get an a minus  b s and c s otherwise .    drake shrugged .   there are some professors who take pride in that .  it s a kind of professorial version of captain bligh .  but he was a good chemist  probably the best berry has ever had .  he was the only member of the faculty to achieve national prominence after the war .  if lance could take his course and get a high mark  that would be bound to be impressive .  even with c s in everything else  the argument would be   well  he hasn t worked much because he hasn t had to  but when he finally decided to buckle down  he showed fire cracking ability .     he and i took chemical kinetics together and i was running and sweating and snorting every day of that course .  but lance sat in the seat next to me and never stopped smiling .  he took notes carefully  and i know he studied them  because when i found him in the library it was always chemical kinetics he was working on .  it went down to the wire like that .  st .  george didn t give quizzes .  he let everything hang on the discussion periods and on the final examination  which lasted three hours a jull three hours .    in the last week of the course  there were no lectures and the students had their last chance to pull themselves together before finals week .  lance was still smiling .  his work in the other courses had been usual lance quality  but that didn t bother him .  we would say   how are you doing in kinetics  lance .   and he would say   no sweat .   and sound cheerful  damn it .    then came the day of the finals   drake paused  and his lips tightened .    well .   said trumbull .   drake said  his voice a little lower   lance faron passed .  he did more than pass .  he got a    .  no one had ever gotten over    before in one of st .  george s finals .  i doubt somehow that anyone ever did afterward .     i never heard of anyone getting it in recent times   said stacey .    what did you get .   asked gonzalo .    i got      said drake .   and except for lance s  it was the best mark in the class .  except for lance s .     what happened to the fellow .   asked avalon .    he went on for his ph . d .   of course .  the faculty qualified him without trouble and the story was that st .  george himself went to bat for him .    i left after that   drake went on .   i worked on isotope separation during the war and eventually shifted to wisconsin for my doctoral research .  but i would hear about lance sometimes from old friends .  the last i heard he was down in maryland somewhere  running a private lab of his own .  about ten years ago  i remember i looked up his name in chemical abstracts and found the record of a few papers he turned out .  run of the mill .  typically lance .     he s still independently wealthy .   asked trumbull .    i suppose so .    trumbull leaned back .   if that s your story  jim  then what the hell is biting you .    drake looked about the table  first at one and then at another .  then he brought his fist down so that the coffee cups jumped and clattered .   because he cheated  damn his hide .  that was not a legitimate final exam and as long as he has his ph . d .   mine is cheapened by that much  and yours  too   he said to stacey .   stacey murmured   phony doctor .     what .   said drake  a little wildly .    nothing   said stacey   i was just thinking of a colleague who did a stint at a medical school where the students regarded the m . d .  as the only legitimate doctor s degree in the universe .  to them  a ph . d .  stood for  phony doctor .      drake snorted .    actually   began rubin  with the typical air of argu mentativeness he could put into even a casual connective   if you    avalon cut in from his impressive height   well  see here  jim  if he cheated  how did he get through .    because there was nothing to show he cheated .    did it ever occur to you   said gonzalo   that maybe he didn t cheat .  maybe it was really true that when he buckled down  he had fire cracking ability .     no   said drake  with another coffeecup rattling fist on the table .   that s impossible .  he never showed the ability before and he never showed it afterward .  besides he had that confidence all through the course .  he had the confidence that could only mean he had worked out a foolproof plan to get his a .    trumbull said heavily   all right  say he did .  he got his ph . d .  but he didn t do so well .  from what you say  he s just off in a corner somewhere  poking along .  you know damn well  jim  that lots of guys get through to all kinds of professional positions  even without cheating  who have all their brains in their elbows  and so what .  why get mad at one particular guy  cheating or not .  you know why i think you re off your rocker on the subject  jim .  what gripes you is that you don t know how he did it .  if you could figure it out  why you d forget the whole thing .    henry interrupted   more brandy for anyone  gentlemen .    five delicate little glasses were raised in air .  avalon  who measured out his allowance with an eye dropper  kept his down .   drake said   well  then  tom  you tell me .  how did he do it .  you re the code expert .     but there s no code involved .  i don t know .  maybe he  he managed to get someone else to do the test for him and handed in someone else s paper .     in someone else s handwriting .   said drake scornfully .   besides  i thought of it .  we all thought of it .  you don t suppose i was the only one who thought lance cheated  do you .  we all did .  when that    went up on that bulletin board  after we got our breath back and that took a while we demanded to see his paper .  he handed it over without trouble and we all went over it .  it was a near perfect job  but it was in his handwriting and with his turns of phrase .  i wasn t impressed by the few errors he made .  i thought at the time he threw them in just in order not to have a perfect paper .     all right   said gonzalo   someone else did the test and your friend copied it over in his own words .     impossible .  there was no one in the class but the students and st .  george s assistant .  the assistant opened the sealed test papers just before the test started .  no one could have written a paper for lance and another for himself  even if you could imagine no one else seeing it done .  besides  there wasn t anyone in the class capable of turning out a    level paper .    avalon said   if you were doing it right there  it would be impossible .  but suppose someone managed to get a copy of the questions well before the test and then swatted away at the textbooks till he worked out perfect answers .  couldn t lance have done that somehow .     no  he couldn t   said drake flatly .   you re not suggesting anything we didn t think of then  take my word for it .  the university had had a cheating scandal ten years before or so and the whole procedure had been tightened up .  st .  george followed standard procedure .  he worked out the questions and turned it in to his secretary the day before the test .  she mimeographed the necessary number of copies in st .  george s presence .  he proofread them  then destroyed the mimeograph and the original .  the question papers were packaged and sealed and placed in the school safe .  the safe was opened just before the test and the papers handed to st .  george s assistant .  there was no chance of lance seeing the questions .     maybe not just then   said avalon .   but even if the professor had the questions mimeographed the day before the test  how long might he have had the questions in his possession .  he might have used a set of questions used on a previous     no   interrupted drake .   we carefully studied all previous test papers prepared by st .  george as a matter of course before the final exam .  do you think we were fools .  there were no duplications .     all right .  but even if he prepared an entirely new test  he might have prepared it at the beginning of the semester for all you know .  lance might somehow have seen the questions early in the semester .  it would be a lot easier to work out answers to a fixed number of questions in the course of the semester than to try to learn the entire subject matter .     i think you ve got something there  jeff   said gonzalo .    he s got crud there   said drake   because that s not the way st .  george worked it .  every question in that final exam turned on some particular point that some particular student goofed up on in class .  one of them  and the most subtle  covered a point that i had missed in the last week of lectures .  i pointed out what i thought was a mistake in a derivation  and st .  george well  never mind .  the point is that the tests had to be prepared after the last lectures .    arnold stacey broke in   did st .  george always do that .  if he did  he would have been handing a hell of a lot to the kids .     you mean the students would have been waiting for questions covering errors made in the discussion periods .     more than that .  the students would have deliberately pulled boners on those parts of the subject they actually knew well in order to lure st .  george into placing twenty points  worth on it .    drake said   i can t answer that .  we weren t in his previous classes  so we don t know whether his previous tests followed the same line .     previous classes would have passed on the news  wouldn t they .  at least if classes in the forties were anything like classes now .     they would have   admitted drake   and they didn t .  he did it that way that year  anyway .     say  jim   said gonzalo   how did lance do in the dicsussion periods .     he kept quiet  played it safe .  we all took it for granted he d do that .  we weren t surprised .    gonzalo said   what about the department secretary .  couldn t lance have wheedled her into telling him the questions .    drake said grimly   you don t know the secretary .  besides  he couldn t have .  he couldn t have suborned the secretary  or broken into the safe  or pulled any trick at all .  from the nature of the questions  we could tell the exam had been constructed in the last week before it had been taken  and during that last week he couldn t have done a thing .     are you sure .   asked trumbull .    oh  you bet .  it bugged us all that he was so confident .  the rest of us were sea green with the fear of flunking and he smiled .  he kept smiling .  on the day of the last lecture  someone said   he s going to steal the question sheet .   actually    said it  but the others agreed and we decided to to well  we kept an eye on him .     you mean you never let him out of your sight .   demanded avalon .   did you watch at night in shifts .  did you follow him into the john .     damn near .  he was burroughs  roommate and burroughs was a light sleeper and swore he knew every time lance turned over .     burroughs might have been dragged one night   said rubin .    he might have  but he didn t think so  and no one else thought so .  lance just didn t act suspicious in any way  he didn t even act annoyed at being watched .     did he know he was being watched .   said rubin .    he probably did .  every time he went somewhere he would grin and say   who s coming along .       where did he go .     just the normal places .  he ate  drank  slept  eliminated .  he went to the school library to study  or sat in his room .  he went to the post office  the bank  a shoestore .  we followed him on every errand all up and down berry s main street .  besides     besides  what .   said trumbull .    besides  even if he had gotten hold of the question paper  it could only have been in those few days before the test  maybe only the night before .  he would have had to sweat out the answers  being lance .  it would have taken him days of solid work over the books .  if he could have answered them just by getting a look at them  he wouldn t have had to cheat  he would have gotten a look at them in the opening minutes of the test period .    rubin said sardonically   it seems to me  jim  that you ve painted yourself into a corner .  your man couldn t possibly have cheated .     that s the whole point   cried drake .   he must have cheated and he did it so cleverly no one could catch him .  no one could even figure out how .  tom s right .  that s what gripes me .    and then henry coughed and said   if i may offer a word  gentlemen .    every face went up as though some invisible puppeteer had pulled the strings .    yes  henry .   said trumbull .    it seems to me  gentlemen  that you are too much at home with petty dishonesty to understand it very well .     why  henry  you hurt me cruelly   said avalon with a smile  but his dark eyebrows curled down over his eyes .    i mean no disrespect  gentlemen  but mr .  rubin maintained that dishonesty has value .  mr .  trumbull thinks that dr .  drake is only annoyed because the cheating was clever enough to escape detection and not because it existed at all  and perhaps all of you agree to that .    gonzalo said   i think you re hinting  henry  that you re so honest that you re more sensitive to dishonesty than we are and can understand it better .    henry said   i would almost think so  sir  in view of  the fact that not one of you has commented on a glaring improbability in dr .  drake s story that seems to me to explain everything .     what s that .   asked drake .    why  professor st .  george s attitude  sir .  here is a professor who takes pride in flunking many of his students  and who never has anyone get above the    s on the final examination .  and then a student who is thoroughly mediocre and i gather that everyone in the department  both faculty and students  knew of the mediocrity gets a    and the professor accepts that and even backs him before the qualifying committee .  surely he would have been the first to suspect dishonesty .  and most indignantly  too .    there was a silence .  stacey looked thoughtful .   drake said   maybe he couldn t admit that he could be cheated from  if you know what i mean .    henry said   you find excuses  sir .  in any situation in which a professor asks questions and a student answers them  one always feels somehow that if there is dishonesty  it is always the student s dishonesty .  why .  what if it were the professor who were dishonest .    drake said   what would he get out of that .     what does one usually get .  money  i suspect  sir .  the situation as you described it is that of a student who was quite well off financially  and a professor who had the kind of salary a professor had in those days before the government grants began to come .  suppose the student had offered a few thousand dollars     for what .  to hand in a fake mark .  we saw lance s answer paper  and it was legitimate .  to let lance see the questions before having them mimeographed .  it wouldn t have done lance any good .     look at it in reverse  sir .  suppose the student had offered those few thousand dollars to let him  the student  show the professor the questions .    again the invisible puppeteer worked and there was a chorus of  what .  s in various degrees of intonation .    suppose  sir   henry went on patiently   that it was mr .  lance faron who wrote the questions  one by one in the course of the semester  polishing them as he went along .  he polished them as the semester proceeded  working hard .  as mr .  avalon said  it is easier to get a few specific points straight than to learn the entire subject matter of a course .  he included one question from the last week s lectures  inadvertently making you all sure the test had been created entirely in the last week .  it also meant that he turned out a test that was quite different from st .  george s usual variety .  previous tests in the course had not turned on students  difficulties .  nor did later ones  if i may judge from dr .  stacey s surprise .  then at the end of the course  with the test paper completed  he would have mailed it to the professor .     mailed it .   said gonzalo .    i believe dr .  drake said the young man visited the post office .  he might have mailed it .  professor st .  george would have received the questions with   perhaps  part of the payment in reasonably small bills .  he would then have written it over in his own handwriting  or typed it  and passed it on to his secretary .  from then on all would be normal .  and  of course  the professor would have had to back the student thereafter all the way .     why not .   said gonzalo enthusiastically .   good god  it makes sense .    drake said slowly   i ve got to admit that s a possibility that never occurred to any of us .   .  .  .  but  of course  we ll never know .    stacey broke in loudly .   i ve hardly said a word all evening  though i was told i d be grilled .     sorry about that   said trumbull .   this meathead  drake  had a story to tell because you came from berry .     well  then  because i come from berry  let me add something .  professor st .  george died the year i came  as i said  and i didn t know him .  but i know many people who did know him and i ve heard many stories about him .     you mean he was known to be dishonest .   asked drake .    no one said that .  but he was known to be unscrupulous and i ve heard some unsavory hints about how he maneuvered government grants into yielding him an income .  when i heard your story about lance  jim  i must admit i didn t think st .  george would be involved in quite that way .  but now that henry has taken the trouble to think the unthinkable from the mountain height of his own honesty why  i believe he s right .    trumbull said   then that s that .  jim  after thirty years  you can forget the whole thing .     except except  a half smile came over drake s face and then he broke into a laugh  i am dishonest because i can t help thinking that if lance had the questions all along  the bastard might have passed on a hint or two to the rest of us .     after you had all laughed at him  sir .   asked henry quietly  as he began to clear the table .    afterword  this story first appeared in the july      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine  under the title  the phony ph . d .    the reason for the title change was clear .  eqmm runs a series of excellent stories by lawrence treat with titles such as  h as in homicide    c as in cutthroat   and so on .  naturally  the magazine wanted to reserve such titles to mr .  treat .   here in the book  however  i hope mr .  treat won t mind if i go back to  ph as in phony   since that seems to me to be perfect .  i promise i won t use that type of title again .   this story  incidentally  betrayed me into a bit of vanity of a type unusual for me .   certain other types are usual .   a professor porter of the university of oregon wrote to point out certain infelicities in the story in connection with qualifying for research toward the doctorate .  he signed it with a  ph . d .   after his signature to indicate that he was qualified to discuss the matter .   and he was  for he was entirely right and i have adjusted the version of the story as presented here to meethis objections .  however  in answering the letter  i was so anxious not to have him think i was myself unqualified that i placed a  ph . d .   after my signature  too .  the initials were legitimate  for i obtained it in chemistry at columbia in       but i think it s the only time i used it in anything but official scholarly communications .          truth to tell     when roger halsted made his appearance at the head of the stairs on the day of the monthly meeting of the black widowers  the only others yet present were avalon and rubin .  they greeted him with jubilation .   emmanuel rubin said   well  you ve finally managed to stir yourself up to the point of meeting your old friends  have you .   he trotted over and held out his hands  his straggly beard stretching to match his broad grin .   where ve you been the last two meetings .     hello  roger   said geoffrey avalon  smiling from his stiff height .   pleased to see you .    halsted shucked his coat .   damned cold outside .  henry  bring    but henry  the only waiter the black widowers ever had or ever would have  had the drink waiting .   i m glad to see you again  sir .    halsted took it with a nod of thanks .   twice running something came up .   .   .   .  say  you know what i ve decided to do .     give up mathematics and make an honest living .   asked rubin .   halsted sighed .   teaching math at a junior high school is about as honest a living as one can find .  that s why it pays so little .     in that case   said avalon  swirling his drink gently   why is free lance writina  so dishonest a racket .     free lance writing is not dishonest   said free lance rubin  rising to the bait at once   as long as you make no use of an agent     what have you decided to do  roger .   interrupted avalon blandly .    it s just this project i dreamed up   said halsted .  his forehead rose white and high  showing no signs of the hairline that had been there perhaps ten years ago  though the hair was still copious enough at the top and around the sides .   i m going to rewrite the iliad and the odyssey in limericks  one for each of the forty eight books they contain .    avalon nodded .   any of it written .     i ve got the first book of the iliad taken care of .  it goes like this        agamemnon  the top ranking greek   to achilles in anger did speak .   they argued a lot   then achilles grew hot   and went stamping away in a pique .     not bad   said avalon .   in fact  quite good .  it gets across the essence of the first book in full .  of course  the proper name of the hero of the iliad is achilleus  with the  ch  sound as in     that would throw off the meter   said halsted .    besides   said rubin   everyone would think the extra    u    was a mistake and that s all they ll see in the limerick .    mario gonzalo came racing up the stairs .  he was host for that session and he said   anyone else here .     nobody here but us old folks   said avalon agreeably .    my guest is on his way up .  real interesting guy .  henry will like him because he never tells a lie .    henry lifted his eyebrows as he produced mario s drink .    don t tell me you re bringing george washington .   said halsted .    roger .  a pleasure to see you again .   .  .  .  by the way  jim drake won t be here with us today .  he sent back the card saying there was some family shindig he had to attend .  the guest i m bringing is a fellow named sand  john sand .  i ve known him on and off for years .  crazy guy .  horse race buff who never tells a lie .  i ve heard him not telling lies .  it s about the only virtue he has .   and gonzalo winked .   avalon nodded portentously .   good for those who can .  as one grows older  however     and i think it will be an interesting session   added gonzalo hurriedly  visibly avoiding avalon s non libidinous confidences .   i was telling him about the club  and that for the last two times we had mysteries on our hands     mysteries .   said halsted with sudden interest .   gonzalo said   you re a member of the club in good standing  so we can tell you .  but get henry to do it .  he was a principal both times .     henry .   halsted looked over his shoulder in mild surprise .   are they getting you involved in our idiocies .     i assure you  mr .  halsted  i tried not to be   said henry .    tried not to be .   said rubin hotly .   listen  henry was the sherlock of the session last time .  he     the point is   said avalon   that you may have talked too much  mario .  what did you tell your friend about us .     what do you mean  talk too much .  i m not manny .  i carefully told sand that there could be no details because we were priests at the confessional  one and all  as far as anything in this room is concerned  and he said he wished he were a member because he had a difficulty that was driving him wild  and i said he could come the next time because it was my turn to host and he could be my guest and here he is .    a slim man  his neck swathed in a thick scarf  was mounting the stairs .  the slimness was accentuated when he took off his coat .  under the scarf  his tie gleamed bloody red and seemed to lend color to a thin and pallid face .  he seemed thirtyish .    john sand   said mario  introducing him all round in a pageant that was interrupted by thomas trumbull s  heavy tread on the steps and the loud cry of  henry  a scotch and soda for a dying man .    rubin said   tom  you can come early if you relax and stop trying so hard to be late .     the later i come   said trumbull   the less i have to hear of your goddamn stupid remarks .  ever think of that .   then he was introduced  too  and all sat down .   since the menu for that meeting had been so incautiously devised as to begin with artichokes  rubin had launched into a dissertation on the preparation of the only proper sauce for it .  then  when trumbull had said disgustedly that the only proper preparation for artichokes involved a large garbage can  rubin said   sure  if you don t have the right sauce    sand ate uneasily and left at least a third of an excellent steak untouched .  halsted  who had a tendency to plumpness  eyed the remains enviously .  his own plate was the first one cleaned .  only a scraped bone and some fat were left .   sand seemed to grow aware of halsted s eyes and said to him   frankly  i m too worried to have much appetite .  would you care for the rest of this .     me .  no  thank you   said halsted glumly .   sand smiled .   may i be frank .     of course  if you ve been listening to the conversation around the table  you ll realize frankness is the order of the evening .     good  because i would be anyway .  it s my fetish .  you re lying  mr .  halsted .  of course you want the rest of my steak  and you d eat it  too  if you thought no one would notice .  that s perfectly obvious .  social convention requires you to lie  however .  you don t want to seem greedy and you don t want to seem to ignore the elements of hygiene by eating something contaminated by the saliva of a stranger .    halsted frowned .   and what if the situation were reversed .     and i was hungry for more steak .     yes .     well  i might not want to eat yours for hygienic rea   sons  but i would admit i wanted it .  almost all lying is the result of a desire for self protection or out of respect for social convention .  to myself  though  it seems that a lie is rarely a useful defense and i am not at all interested in social convention .    rubin said   actually  a lie is a useful defense if it is a thorough going one .  the trouble with most lies is that they don t go far enough .     been reading mein kampf lately .   said gonzalo .   rubin s eyebrows went up .   you think hitler was the first to use the technique of the big lie .  you can go back to napoleon iii  you can go back to julius caesar .  have you ever read his commentaries .    henry was bringing the baba au rhum and pouring the coffee delicately  and avalon said   let s get to our honored guest .    gonzalo said   as host and chairman of this session  i m going to call off the grilling .  our guest has a problem and i direct him to favor us with it .   he was drawing a quick caricature of sand on the back of the menu card  with a thin  sad face accentuated into that of a distorted bloodhound .   sand cleared his throat   i understand everything said in this room is in confidence  but    trumbull followed the glance  and growled   don t worry about henry .  henry is the best of us all .  if you want to doubt someone s discretion  doubt someone else .     thank you  sir   murmured henry  setting up the brandy glasses on the sideboard .   sand said   the trouble  gentlemen  is that i am suspected of a crime .     what kind of crime .   demanded trumbull at once .  it was his job  ordinarily  to grill the guests and the look in his eye was that of someone with no intention of missing the grillage .    theft   said sand .   there is a sum of money and a wad of negotiable bonds missing from a safe in my company .  i m one of those who have the combination  and i had the opportunity to get to it unobserved .  i also had a motive because i ve had some bad luck at the races  and needed some cash badly .  so it doesn t look good for me .    gonzalo said eagerly   but he didn t do it .  that s the point .  he didn t do it .    avalon twirled the half drink he was not going to finish and said   i think in the interest of coherence we ought to allow mr .  sand to tell his story .     yes   said trumbull   how do you know he didn t do it  mario .     that s the whole point  damn it .  he says he didn t do it   said gonzalo   and that s good enough .  not for a court maybe  but it s good enough for me and for anyone who knows him .  i ve heard him admit enough rotten things     suppose i ask him myself  okay .   said trumbull .   did you take the stuff  mr .  sand .    sand paused .  his blue eyes flicked from face to face  then he said   gentlemen  i am telling the truth .  i did not take the cash or the bonds .  that is only my unsupported word  but anyone who knows me will tell you that i can be relied on .    halsted passed his hand over his forehead upward  as though trying to clear away doubts .   mr .  sand   he said   you seem to have a position of some trust .  you can get into a safe with assets in it .  yet you play the horses .     lots of people do .     and lose .     i didn t quite plan it that way .     but don t you risk losing your job .     my advantage is  sir  that i am employed by my uncle  who is aware of my weakness  but who also knows i don t lie .  he knew i had the means and opportunity  and he knew i had debts .  he also knew i had recently paid off my gambling debts .  i told him so .  the circumstantial evidence looked bad .  but then he asked me directly whether i was responsible for the loss and i told him exactly what i told you  i did not take the cash or the bonds .  since he knows me well  he believes me .     how did you come to pay off your debts .   said avalon .    because a long shot came through .  that happens  too  sometimes .  that happened shortly before the theft was discovered and i paid off the bookies .  that s true  too  and i told this to my uncle .     but then you had no motive   said gonzalo .    i can t say that .  the theft might have been carried out as long as two weeks before the discovery .  no one looked in that particular drawer in the safe for that period of time except the thief  of course .  it could be argued that after i took the assets the horse came through and made the theft unnecessary too late .     it might be argued   said halsted   that you took the money in order to place a large bet on the horse that came in .     the bet wasn t that large  and i had other sources  but it could be argued so  yes .    trumbull broke in   but if you still have your job  as i suppose you do  and if your uncle isn t prosecuting you  as i assume he isn t .   .   .  has he gone to the police at all .     no  he can absorb the loss and he feels the police will only try to pin it on me .  he knows that what i have told him is true .     then what s the problem  for god s sake .     because there s no one else who can have done it .  my uncle can t think of any other way of accounting for the theft .  nor can i .  and as long as he can t  there will always be the residuum of uneasiness  of suspicion .  he will always keep his eye on me .  he will always be reluctant to trust me .  i ll keep my job  but i ll never be promoted  and i may be made uncomfortable enough to be forced into resignation .  if i do  i can t count on a wholehearted recommendation  and from an uncle  a halfhearted one would be fatal .    rubin was frowning .   so you came here  mr .  sand  because gonzalo said we solved mysteries .  you want us to tell you who really took the stuff .    sand shrugged .   maybe not .  i don t even know if i can give you enough information .  it s not as though you re detectives who can make inquiries .  if you could tell me just how it might have been done even if it s farfetched that would help .  if i could go to my uncle and say   uncle  it might have been done this way  mightn t it .   even if we couldn t be sure  even if we couldn t ever get the assets back  it would at least spread the suspicion .  he wouldn t have the eternal nagging thought that i was the only possible guilty party .     well   said avalon   we can try to be logical  i suppose .  how about the other people who work with you and your uncle .  would any of them need money badly .    sand shook his head .   enough to risk the possible consequences of being caught .  i don t know .  one of them might be in debt  or one might be undergoing blackmail  or one might be greedy  or just have the opportunity and act on impulse .  if i were a detective i could go about asking questions  or i could track down documents  or whatever it is they do .  as it is     of course   said avalon   we can t do that either .   .   .   .  now you had both means and opportunity  but did anyone else .     at least three people could have gotten to the safe more easily than i and gotten away with it more easily  but not one of them had the combination  and the safe wasn t broken into  that s certain .  there are two people besides my uncle and myself who have the combination  but one had been hospitalized over the period in question and the other is such an old and reliable member of the firm that to suspect him seems unthinkable .     aha   said mario gonzalo   there s our man right there .     you ve been reading too many agatha christies   said rubin at once .   the fact of the matter is that in almost every crime on record  the most suspicious person is indeed the criminal .     that s beside the point   said halsted   and too dull besides .  what we have here is a pure exercise in logic .  let s have mr .  sand tell us everything he knows about every member of the firm  and we can all try to see if there s any way in which we can work out motive  means  and opportunity for some one person .     oh  hell   said trumhull   who says it has to be one person .  so someone s in a hospital .  big deal .  the telephone exists .  he phones the combination to a confederate .     all right  all right   said halsted hastily   we re bound to think up all sorts of possibilities and some may be more plausible than others .  after we ve thrashed them out  mr .  sand can choose the most plausible and use it  too     may i speak  sir .   henry spoke so quickly  and at a sound level so much higher than his usual murmur  that everyone turned to face him .   henry said  softly once more   although not a black widower     not so   said rubin .   you know you re a black widower .  in fact  you re the only one who s never missed a meeting .     then may i point out  gentlemen  that if mr .  sand carries your conclusions  whatever they may be  to his uncle  he will be carrying the proceedings of this meeting beyond the walls of this room .    there was an uncomfortable silence .  halsted said   in the interest of saving the ruin of an innocent person s life  surely    henry shook his head gently .   but it would be at the cost of spreading suspicion to one or more other people  who might also be innocent .    avalon said   henry s got something there .  we seem stymied .     unless   said henry   we can come to some definite conclusion that will satisfy the club and will not involve the outside world .     what do you have in mind  henry .   asked trumbull .    if i may explain  .  .  .  i was interested to meet someone who  as mr .  gonzalo said before dinner  never tells a lie .     now come  henry   said rubin   you re pathologically honest yourself .  you know you are .  that s been settled .     that may be so   said henry   but i tell lies .     do you doubt sand .  do you think he s lying .   said rubin .    i assure you   began sand  almost in anguish .   no   said henry   i believe that every word mr .  sand has said is true .  he didn t take the money or the bonds .  he is  however  the logical one against whom suspicion may rest .  his career may be ruined .  his career  on the other hand  may not be ruined if some reasonable alternative can be found  even if that does not actually lead to a solution .  and  since he can think of no reasonable alternatives himself  he wants us to help him find some for him .  i am convinced  gentlemen  that this is all true .   sand nodded .   well  thank you .     and yet   said henry   what is truth .  for instance  mr .  trumbull  i think that your habit of perpetually arriving late with a cry of  scotch and soda for a dying man  is rude  unnecessary  and  worse yet  has grown boring .  i suspect others here feel the same .    trumbull flushed  but henry went on firmly .   yet if  under ordinary circumstances  i were asked if i disapproved of it  i would say i did not .  strictly speaking  that would be a lie  but i like you for other reasons  mr .  tram bull  that far outweigh this trick of yours  so the telling of the strict truth  which would imply a dislike for you  would end by actually being a great lie .  therefore i lie to express a truth  my liking for you .    trumbull muttered   i m not sure i like your way of liking  henry .    henry said   or consider mr .  halsted s limerick on the first book of the iliad .  mr  avalon quite rightly said that achilleus is the correct name of the hero  or even akhil leus with a  k   i suppose  to suggest the correct sound .  but then mr .  rubin pointed out that the truth would seem like a mistake and ruin the effect of the limerick .  again  truth creates a problem .    mr .  sand said that all lies arise out of a desire for self protection or out of respect for social convention .  but we cannot always ignore self protection and social convention .  if we cannot lie  we must make the truth lie for us .    gonzalo said   you re not making sense  henry .     i think i am mr gonzalo .  few people listen to exact words  and many a literal truth tells a lie by implication .  who should know that better than a person who carefully always tells the literal truth .    sand s pale cheeks were less pale  or his red tie was reflecting light upward more efficiently .  he said   what the hell are you implying .     i would like to ask you a question  mr .  sand .  if the club is willing  of course .     i don t care if they are or not   said sand  glowering at henry .   if you take that tone  i might not choose to answer .     you may not have to   said henry .   the point is that each time you deny having committed the crime  you deny it in precisely the same form of words .  i couldn t help but notice since i made up my mind to listen to your exact words as soon as i heard that you never lied .  each time  you said   i didn t take the cash or the bonds .       and that is perfectly true   said sand loudly .    i m sure it is  or you wouldn t have said so   said henry .   now this is the question i would like to ask you .  did you  by any chance  take the cash and the bonds .    there was a short silence .  then sand rose and said   i ll take my coat now .  goodbye .  i remind you all that nothing that goes on here can be repeated outside .    when sand was gone  trumbull said   well  i ll be damned .    to which henry replied   perhaps not  mr .  trumbull .  don t despair .     afterword  this story first appeared in the october      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine  under the title  the man who never told a lie .   i think the magazine title is pedestrian  so i changed it back to my original one .   i wrote this story on february          .  i remember that  not because i have a phenomenal memory  but because it was written in the hospital the day before my one and  so far  only operation .  larry ashmead  my dou bleday editor  visited me that day and i gave him the manuscript and asked him to see that it was delivered to the eqmm offices by messenger .   i also told him to explain that i was in the hospital  as i ordinarily deliver the manuscripts myself so that i can flirt with the beauteous eleanor  to say nothing of the vivacious constance dirienzo  who is the executive editorial secretary  .   larry did as requested  of course  and i got the news  .  that the story was taken while i was still in the hospital recovering .  since then i have wondered  when i had nothing better to do  if the story was accepted out of sympathy for my poor  suffering self  but i guess not .  it was tapped for a best of the year mystery anthology put out by dutton  so i guess it s okay .   oh  and that accounts for the fact that this story is the shortest in the book .  i had to get it done before the surgeon took his scalpel from between his teeth  whetted it on his thigh  and got to work .          go  little book .       my wife   said emmanuel rubin  with a tremor of indignation shaking his sparse chin beard   has bought another bull .    discussion of women and  particularly  of wives  was considered out of bounds at the staunchly masculine monthly meetings of the deliberately named black widowers  but habits die hard .  mario gonzalo  who was sketching the guest of the meeting  said   in your mini apartment .     it s a perfectly good apartment   said rubin indignantly .   it just looks small .  and it wouldn t look all that small if she didn t have bulls in it made of wood  of porcelain  of tile  of bronze  and of felt .  she has them from a foot across to an inch across .  she has them on the wall  on the shelves  on the floor  and suspended from the ceiling    avalon  from his austere height  swirled his drink slowly and said   she requires a symbol of virility  i presume .     when she has me .   said rubin .    because she has you   said gonzalo  and took the drink pressed upon him by the black widowers  perennial and indispensable waiter  henry then hurried to his seat to avoid rubin s explosive reply .   at the other end of the table  james drake said to roger halsted   a  b   and paused  lengthily .    what .   said halsted  his high  white forehead flushing and wrinkling as his eyebrows moved upward .    long time  no c   said drake  coughing at his own cigarette smoke  which he frequently did .   halsted looked disgusted .   i think i ll make it longer next time .    was here last month  but you weren t .     family .   said drake briefly .   what s this i hear about you rewriting the iliad into limericks .     one for each book   said halsted  with obvious self satisfaction .   the odyssey  too .     jeff avalon recited the limerick to the first book as soon as he saw me .     i ve written one for the second .  would you lake to  hear it .     no   said drake .   it goes like this        agamemnon s dream strategy slips   the morale of his troops quickly dips .   first thersites complains   but odysseus restrains   and we next have the cat log of ships .    drake received it stolidly .  he said   you have one too many syllables in the last line .     can t help it   said halsted with unusual heat .   it s impossible to do the second book without mentioning the catalog of ships and that phrase has three unaccented syllables in a row .  i leave one out by elision and say cat log with an apostrophe .  that makes it all fifteen perfect anapests .    drake shook his head .   wouldn t satisfy a purist .    thomas trumbull  scowling malevolently  said   i hope  henry  that you noticed i came early today  even though i m not the host .     i did notice  mr .  trumbull   said henry  smiling urbanely .    the least you can do is give the act public approval after what you said about me last time .     i approve  sir  but it would be wrong to make an issue of it .  that would give the impression that it was hard for you to arrive on time and no one would expect to have you repeat the feat next time .  if we all ignore it  it will  seem as though we take it for granted that you can do it  and then you will have no trouble repeating .     give me my scotch and soda  henry  and spare me the dialectic .    as a matter of fact  it was rubin who was the host and his guest was one of his publishers  a round faced  smooth cheeked gentleman with a good humored smile on his face .  his name was ronald klein .   like most guests  he found it difficult to hop onto the merry go round of talk  and he finally plunged in the direction of the one man at the table he knew .    manny   he said   did i hear you say jane had bought another bull .     that s right   said rubin .   a cow  actually  because it s sitting on a crescent moon  but it s hard to tell for sure .  the makers of these things rarely go into careful anatomical detail .    avalon  who had been wielding his knife and fork in workmanlike fashion over the stuffed veal  paused to say   collector s mania is something that seizes almost every gentleman of leisure it has many delights  the excitement of the search  the ecstasy of the acquisition  the joy of later contemplation .  you can do it with anything .  i collect stamps myself .     stamps   said rubin at once   are the very worst thing you can collect .  they are thoroughly artificial .  vest pocket nations put out issues designed deliberately to fetch high sums .  mistakes  misprints  and so on create false values .  the whole thing is in the hands of entrepreneurs and financiers .  if you ve got to collect  collect things with no value .    gonzalo said   a friend of mind collects his own books .  so far  he has published a hundred and eighteen and carefully gets copies of every edition  american and foreign  hard cover and paperback  book club and condensed .  he s got a whole roomful of them and says he is the only person in the world with a complete collection of his works and that it will be worth a tremendous sum someday     after he s dead   said drake briefly .    i think he s planning to fake death  sell the collection for a million dollars  then come back to life and continue writing under a pseudonym .    at this point  klein made his way back on the merry go round .   i met a fellow yesterday   he said   who collects matchbooks .     i collected matchbooks when i was a kid   said gon zalo .   i used to go searching all the curbs and alleys  for    but trumbull  who had been eating in unwonted silence  suddenly raised his voice to a shout .   god damn it  you bunch of hack talkers  our guest has said something .  mr .  uh klein  what was that you said .    klein looked startled .   i said i met a fellow yesterday who collects matchbooks .     that could be interesting   said halsted agreeably    if     shut up   roared trumbull .   i want to hear about this .   his creased  bronzed face turned to klein .   what s the guy s name .  the collector .     i m not sure i remember   said klein .   i just met him at lunch yesterday  never saw him before that .  there were six of us at the table  and he got to talking about his matchbooks .  listen  i thought he was crazy at first  but by the time he got through  i decided to start a collection of my own .     did he have grayish sideburns  with a little red in it .    asked trumbull .    why  yes  as a matter of fact .  do you know him .    umm   said trumbull .   hey  manny  i know you re the host  and i don t want to overstep your prerogatives  .  .  .     but you re going to   said rubin .   is that it .    no  i m not  damn it   said trumbull hotly .   i m asking your permission .  i would like to have our guest tell us all about his lunch yesterday with this matchbook collector .    rubin said   you mean instead of his being put on the grill .  we never put anyone on the grill any more .    this could be important .    rubin thought about it  with a look of some dissatisfaction on his face  then said   okay  but after the dessert .   .  .   .  what have we got for dessert today  henry .     zabaglione  sir  to go with the italian motif of tonight s meal .     calories  calories   groaned avalon softly .   halsted s teaspoon clinked as he stirred the sugar in his coffee and elaborately ignored rubin s flat ukase that anyone who added anything at all to good coffee was a barbarian .  he said   do we humor tom now and get our guest to tell us about matchbooks .    klein looked about the table and said with a small laugh   i m willing to do it  but i don t know that it s interesting     i say it s interesting   said trumbull .    all right .  i won t fight it .  i started the whole thing  as a matter of fact .  we were at the cock and bull on fifty third street     jane insisted on eating there one time because of the name   said rubin .   not so hot .    trumbull said   i ll strangle you  manny .  what s all this talk about your wife today .  if you miss her  go home .     you re the only one i know  tom  who would make any man miss any wife .     please go on  mr .  klein   said trumbull .   klein began again .   okay .  i started it  as i said  by lighting a cigarette  while we were waiting for the menu  and then getting uncomfortable about it .  i don t know how it is  but it seems there s a lot less smoking at meals these days .  at this table  for instance  mr .  drake is the only one smoking .  i guess he doesn t mind     i don t   muttered drake .    i did  though  so after a few puffs i stubbed out the cigarette .  only i was embarrassed  so i fiddled with the matchbook i had lit the cigarette with  you know  the ones restaurants always supply at every table .     advertising themselves   said drake .   yes .     and this fellow  .  .  .  i have his name now ottiwell .  i don t know his first name .     frederick   growled trumbull  with glum satisfaction .   then you do know him .    i do know him .  but go on .     i was still holding the matchbook in my hand  and ottiwell reached for it and asked if he could see it .  so i passed it to him .  he looked at it and he said something like  moderately interesting .  not particularly imaginative in design .  i ve got it .   or something like that .  i don t remember the exact words .    halsted said reflectively   that s an interesting point  mr .  klein .  at least you know you don t remember the exact words .  in all these first person narratives  the fellow telling the story always remembers every word everyone has said  and in the right order .  it never carries conviction with me .         it s just a convention   said avalon seriously as he sipped at his coffee   but i admit third person is more convenient .  when you use first person  you know that the narrator will survive all the deadly perils into which he  will be     i wrote a first person narrative once   said rubin    in which the narrator dies .     that happens in the western song   el paso   too    said gonzalo .    in  the murder of roger    began avalon .   and trumbull rose and banged his fist on the table .   so help me  you bunch of idiots  i will kill the next guy who talks .  don t you believe me when i tell you this thing is important .   .   .   .  go on  mr .  klein .    klein looked more than a little uncomfortable .   i don t see its importance myself  mr .  trumbull .  there s not even much to it .  this ottiwell took to telling us about matchbooks .  apparently  there s a whole thing about it to people who are involved in it .  there are all kinds of factors that increase the value  not only beauty and rarity but also whether the matches are intact and whether the friction strip is unmarked .  he talked about difference in design  in location of the friction strip  in type and quantity of printing  whether the inside of the cover is blank or not  and so on .  he went on and on  and that s about it .   except that he made it sound so interesting it captured me  as i said .     did he invite you to visit his place and see his collection .     no   said klein   he didn t .     i ve been there   said trumbull  and having said that  he sat back in his chair with a look of deepest dissatisfaction covering it thickly .   there was a silence and  as henry distributed the small brandy glasses  avalon said  with a touch of annoyance   if the threat of murder has been lifted  tom  may i ask what the collector s place was like .    trumbull seemed to return  as from a distance .   what .  oh  .   .   .  it s weird .  he started collecting when he was a kid .  for all i know he got his first samples out of gutters and alleys like gonzalo did  but at some point it turned serious .    he s a bachelor .  he doesn t work .  he doesn t have to .  he s inherited some money and has invested shrewdly  so all he lives for are those damned matchbooks .  i think they own his house and keep him on as a caretaker .    he s got exhibits of prize items on the wall  framed  if you please .  he s got them in folders and cases  everywhere .  his whole basement is given over to filing cabinets in which they re catalogued by type and alphabet .  you wouldn t believe how many tens of thousands of different matchbooks have been manufactured the world over  with how many different legends  and with how many different peculiarities  and i think he s got them all .    he s got skinny matchbooks that hold two matches apiece  some as long as your arm that hold a hundred and fifty .  he s got matches shaped like beer bottles  others shaped like baseball bats or bowling pins .  he s got blank matchbooks with nothing on the cover  he s got match books with musical scores on them .  damn it  he s got a whole folder of pornographic matchbooks .     that i d like to see   said gonzalo .    why .   said trumbull .   it s the same stuff you can see anywhere else  except that on a matchbook it s handier to burn and get rid of .     you ve got the soul of a censor   said gonzalo .   i prefer the real thing   said trumbull .   maybe at one time you could   said gonzalo .   what do you want to do .  play verbal ping pong .  we have something serious under discussion .     what s so serious about a bunch of matchbooks .   de manded gonzalo .    i ll tell you .   trumbull looked up and down the table .   listen  you bunch of meatheads  what s said in here is always confidential .     we all know that   said avalon dryly .   if anyone s forgotten  it s you  or you wouldn t have to remind us .    mr .  klein will also have to    rubin interrupted at once .   mr .  klein understands exactly .  he knows that nothing that ever goes on in this room is ever  under any circumstances  to be referred to outside .  i ll vouch for him .     okay .  all right   said trumbull .   so now i ll tell you as little as i can .  so help me god  i wouldn t have told you anything except for klein s luncheon yesterday .  it just irritates me .  i ve had this chewing holes in me for months now  over a year  in fact  and having it come  up     look   said drake flatly .   either tell us or don t tell  us .    trumbull rubbed his eyes angrily .  he said   there s an  information leak .     what kind .  where .   said gonzalo .    never mind .  i m specifically not saying it s the government .  i m specifically not saying foreign agents are involved  you understand .  maybe it s industrial espionage  maybe it s the theft of the new york mets  baseball signals  maybe it s cheating on a test  as in the problem drake brought up a couple of months ago .  let s just call it an information leak  all right .     all right   said rubin .   and who s involved .  this guy  ottiwell .     we re pretty sure .     then reel him in .    trumbull said   we have no proof .  all we can do is try to block any information from getting to him  and we don t even want to do that entirely .     why not .     because it s not who the guy is .  it s how he does it .  if we pull him in and don t know the method he s using  then someone will take his place .  people are cheap .  it s the modus operandi we want .     do you have any ideas on the subject .   asked hal sted  blinking slowly .    it s the matchbooks .  what else .  it s got to be .  all our evidence points to ottiwell as the leak and he s a crazy guy who collects matchbooks .  there s got to be a connection .     you mean he started collecting matchbooks so he could     no  he s been collecting them all his life .  there s no doubt about it .  that collection he has right now took thirty years a building .  but once he had his collection  when he was somehow recruited into the business of transmitting information  he naturally worked out a scheme that involved his matchbooks .     what scheme .   broke in rubin impatiently .    that s what i don t know .  but it s there .  in a way  the matchbooks are perfect for the task .  they carry messages already and  properly chosen  they need no tampering .  for instance  the restaurant you were in yesterday  klein  the cock and bull .  its matchbooks surely said  cock and bull  on the covers .     sounds reasonable .  i didn t look .     i m sure of it .  well  now  if you want to cancel out a previous message  you put one of those things in the mail  or just tear off half the cover  and mail it .  aren t you saying the previous message was just a cock and bull story .    gonzalo said   that s pure bull  .   .   .  sorry  manny  didn t mean to raise a sore point  .   .   .  but look  tom  anyone who mails a matchbook cover  let alone a matchbook  is asking for it .  you spot something funny at once .     not if there s a plausible reason to mail matchbooks .     like what .     matchbook nuts do it .  they correspond and they trade .  they send matchbooks back and forth .  maybe one guy needs a cock and bull to flesh out an animal collection he s building up and returns a spare girlie picture for someone who s specializing in that kind of art .     and ottiwell trades .   asked avalon .    sure he does .     and you never managed to pick up anything he put  into the mail .    a look of contempt came across trumbull s face .   of course  we did .  a number of times .  we d pick it up  go over it with a fine tooth comb  then send it on .     and by so doing   said rubin  looking off into the distance   interfering with the united states mails .  that s an easy thing to do when it s only a matter of the new york mets  baseball signals .     oh  for god s sake   said trumbull   don t be a jackass for  say  fifteen minutes  manny  just for the novelty of it .  you know my field is in codes and ciphers .  you know i m consulted by the government and have my contacts there .  naturally they re interested .  they would be even if the leak involved only a case of over the fence gossip  and i m not saying it s any more than that .     why .   said rubin .   are we that far gone in big  brotherism .     it s simple if you ll stop to think .  any system for transmitting information that can t be broken whatever the information is is top flight dangerous .  if it works and is being used for something utterly unimportant  it can be later used to deal with something vital .  the government doesn t want any system of transmitting information to remain unbroken  unless it s under its own control .  that s got to make sense to you .     all right   said drake   so you studied the match books this ottiwell puts in the mail .  what did you get .     nothing   grunted trumbull .   there was nothing we could make out of it .  we studied those damned advertising items on each cover and came up with nothing .     you mean you looked to see if initial letters of the items spelled a word or something .   said klein with interest .    if it were a six year old sending it  yes  that s what we would have tried .  no  we worked a lot more subtly than that and came up with nothing .     well   said avalon heavily   if you can t find anything in any of the printed matter of any of the matchbooks he mails maybe it s a false lead .     you mean maybe it s not the matchbooks at all .     that s right   said avalon .   it could be all misdirection .  this man has the matchbooks handy and he s a bona fide collector  so he makes his collection look as prominent as possible to attract all the attention it can .  he shows it to anyone who wants to see it .   .  .  .  how did you get to see it  tom .     he invited me .  i cultivated his friendship .     and he responded   said rubin .   there s a man who deserves everything he gets .  don t cultivate my friendship  tom .     i never have .   .   .   .  look  jeff  i know what you mean .  he talked to klein yesterday about the matchbooks  he d talk to anyone .  he d show his collection to anyone willing to go out to queens .  that s why i asked if he invited klein up to his place .  with all that talking  all that self advertisement  all that glitter and shine  it wouldn t surprise you  i suppose  if he then used some device that had nothing at all to do with the matchbooks .  right .     right   said avalon .    wrong   said trumbull .   i just don t believe it .  he s the real thing .  he s really a matchbook nut with nothing else in his life .  he has no ideological reason to run the terrible risk he s actually running .  he isn t committed to the side for which he s working  whether it is national  industrial  or local and i m not saying which .  he lacks any interest in that .  it s only the matchbooks .  he s worked out a way of using his damned matchbooks in a new way and that s the glory of it as far as he s concerned .     listen   said drake  coming out of a reverie .   how many matchbooks does he mail off at a time .     who can say .  the cases we ve intercepted have never been more than eight .  and he doesn t really mail them often .  i have to admit that .     all right .  how much information can he get across in a few matchbooks .  he can t use the messages literally and directly .  if he tries to do the cock and bull bit to cancel a message  my kid nephew could spot him  let alone you .  so it s something subtle and maybe each matchbook can work out to one word  or maybe only one letter .  what can you do with that .     plenty   said trumbull indignantly .   what do you think is needed in these cases .  an encyclopedia .  whoever is looking for information  you simp  has it almost all to begin with .  there s just some key point missing and that s what s needed .    for instance  suppose we re back in world war ii .  germany has rumors that something big is going on in the united states .  a message arrives with only two words on it   atom bomb .   what more does germany need .  sure  no atom bomb existed at the time  but any german with a high school education would get the idea from those two words and any german physicist would get a damned good idea .  then a second message arrives saying   oak ridge  tenn .   that would be a total of twenty individual letters in the two messages taken together and it could have changed the history of the world .     you mean this guy  ottiwell  is putting across information like that .   demanded gonzalo  in awe .    no .  i told you he wasn t   said trumbull  annoyed .   he isn t important at all in that way .  do you think i would be talking to all of you about it if he were .  it s just that the modus operandi could be used for that as well as for anything else  and that s why we have to break it .  besides  there s my reputation .  i say he s using the match books and i can t show how .  you think i like that .    gonzalo said   maybe there s secret writing on the inside of the matchbooks .     we tested for that routinely  but not a chance .  if that s it  why bother using matchbooks .  it could be done in ordinary letters and attract a lot less attention .  it s a matter of psychology .  if ottiwell is going to use match books  he s going to use a system that can be used only on matchbooks  and that means he s using only the messages that are on them already somehow .    klein interrupted .   imagine starting all this by mentioning yesterday s lunch .  do you have  maybe  a list of matchbooks he sent off .  if you have a photostat  we could all look at it     and work out the code that i couldn t .  right .   said trumbull .   you know ever since conan doyle pitted sherlock holmes against the scotland yard bunglers  there seems to be a notion going around that the professional can t do anything .  i assure you  if i can t do it    avalon said   well  now  how about henry .    henry  who had been listening gravely  with a look of interest on his unlined  sixtyish face  smiled briefly and shook his head .   but a look of deep thought came over trumbull s face .   henry   he said .   i forgot about henry .  you re right  jeff .  he s the smartest man here  which would ordinarily be a compliment  if you weren t all a pack of prize imbeciles .    henry   he said   you re the honest man .  you can see the dishonesty of the world without having it blurred by your own larcenous yearnings .  do you agree with me .  do you think this ottiwell  if he were going to engage in this kind of work  would do so only by using his matchbooks in a way that would make them uniquely useful  or not .     as a matter of fact  mr .  trumbull   said henry  collecting the dishes that remained   i do .  i agree with you .    trumbull smiled .   here we have the word of a man who knows what he s talking about .     because he agrees with you   said rubin .    i don t entirely agree with mr .  trumbull  to be sure   said henry .    aha   said rubin .   now what do you think  tom .     what i always think   said trumbull .   that your silence is the best part of you .     may i make a little speech .   said henry .   wait a while   said rubin .   i m still the host  and i m taking over .  i decide on procedures  and i decide that henry makes a little speech and that the rest of us all keep quiet except to answer henry s questions or to ask questions of our own that are right to the point .  i have in mind particularly tom tom the drumbeat as a candidate for quiet .     thank you  mr .  rubin   said henry .   i listen to you gentlemen  on the occasion of all your monthly meetings  with the greatest interest .  it is obvious to me that all of you get enormous pleasure  in an innocent way  out of flailing at each other with words .  you can t very well flail at a guest  however  so you all have a tendency to ignore the guest and to fail to listen to him when he speaks .    have we done that .   asked avalon .   yes  and  it seems to me  mr .  avalon  you may have missed a most important point in consequence .  since it is not my place to talk ordinarily i listen to all of you impartially  the guest included  and i seem to have heard what the rest of you did not .  may i have permission  mr .  rubin  to ask mr .  klein a few questions .  the answers may prove to be of no help  but there is a small chance    well  sure   said rubin .   he should be grilled anyway .  go ahead .     it wouldn t be a grilling   objected henry softly .   mr .   klein .     yes  henry   said klein  a rather pleased flush crossing his face at being the undoubted center of attention .    it s just this  mr .  klein .  when you began to tell  rather briefly  the story of your lunch yesterday  you said something like and i can t repeat the exact words either  you thought he was crazy  but he made everything sound so interesting that by the time he was through  you decided to start a collection of matchbooks of your own .     that s right   said klein  nodding .   sort of silly  i suppose .  i certainly wouldn t do anything at all like his  deal .  i don t mean the spying  i mean this huge collection of his     yes   said henry   but the impression i got was that you were driven to an impulse of collecting right on the spot .  did you by any chance pick up a cock and bull matchbook at the conclusion of the lunch .     that s right   said klein .   it s a little embarrassing  now that i think of it  but i did .     from which table  sir .     from our own .     you mean you took the matchbook you had been holding and had passed on to ottiwell .  it was put back on the table eventually and you picked it up .     yes   said klein  suddenly defensive .   nothing wrong with that  is there .  they re there for the diners  aren t they .     absolutely  sir .  we have matchbooks on this table  which you re all welcome to .  but  mr .  klein  what did you do with the matchbook when you picked it up .    klein thought a bit .   i don t know .  it s hard to remember .  i put it in my jacket pocket  or in my coat pocket after we got our overcoats out of hock .     did you do anything with it once you got home .     no  as a matter of fact .  i forgot all about it .  all this matchbook bit just passed out of my head till manny rubin mentioned about his wife collecting bulls .     you re not wearing the same jacket now  are you .     no .  but i m wearing the same coat .     would you look in the coat pocket and see if you have the matchbook there .    klein vanished into the private cloakroom used by the black widowers on the occasion of their meetings .    what are you getting at  henry .   asked trumbull .    probably nothing   said henry .   i m playing a long chance  and we ve already had one this evening .     which is that .     that mr .  klein had lunch with a man who turns out to be someone you ve been stalking  and that you find out about it the day after .  asking for two chances like that is a bit much  perhaps .     here it is   said klein joyously  returning with a small object held high .   i ve got it .    he tossed it on the table and everyone rose to look at it .  it said  cock and bull  upon it in semi archaic lettering  and there was the small picture of a bull s head  with a rooster perched on one horn .  gonzalo reached for it .    if you please  mr .  gonzalo   said henry .   i don t think anyone ought to touch it yet .   .   .   .  mr .  klein  this is the matchbook that was at your table  the one you used to light a cigarette and which mr .  ottiwell then used to demonstrate some points about the place where the friction strip is located and so on .     yes .     and he put it down and you picked it up .     yes .     did you happen to notice how many matches were present in the matohbook when you lit your cigarette .    klein looked surprised .   i don t know .  i didn t pay any attention .     but  in any case  you tore off one match to light your  cigarette .     oh  yes .     so that even if it had been a full book of matches to begin with  there would be one missing now .  since this looks like a standard matchbook  with thirty matches  there can t be more than twenty nine matches in it right now  and maybe less .     i suppose so .     and how many matches are there in the book now .  would you look and see .    klein paused and then opened the matchbook .  he stared at it for quite a while  then said   it hasn t been touched .  it s got all thirty matches in it .  let me count them .   .  .   .  yes  there are thirty .     but you did pick it up from your table  and you did think it was the matchbook you had used .  you didn t pick it up from another table altogether .     no  no  it was our matchbook .  or at least i was convinced it was .     all right .  if you gentlemen would care to look at it  now  please do so .  if you ll notice  there is no mark on the friction strip  no sign of any match being lighted .    trumbull said   you mean that ottiwell substituted this matchbook for the one that was on the table .     i thought such a thing was possible as soon as you said he was passing information  mr .  trumbull .  i agreed with you  mr .  trumbull  that mr .  ottiwell would make use of matchbooks .  the psychology seemed sound to me .  but i also agreed with mr .  avalon that indirection might be used .  it s just that mr .  avalon did not quite see the possible subtlety of the indirection .     being too crooked myself to see clearly   sighed avalon .   i know .     by concentrating on his collection   said henry   and on his mailing and receiving matchbooks  he had you quite firmly pinned there  mr .  trumbull .  yet it seemed to me that mr .  ottiwell was not involved with matchbooks only in connection with his collection .  every time he ate in a decent restaurant  which might be often  he would be near a matchbook .  even if he were with others  it would be easy for him to substitute another matchbook for the one already on the table .  once he and the rest of the party left  a confederate could pick it up .     not this time   said rubin sardonically .     no  not this time .  when the party left  the table was empty of matchbooks .  this leads to some bothersome thoughts .  have you been followed  mr .  klein .    klein looked alarmed .   no .  at least at least i don t know .  i didn t notice anyone .     any pocket picking attempts .     no .  none that i know of .     in that case  they may not be sure who took it after all there were four others at the table besides yourself and ottiwell  and a waiter might have cleared it  too .  or else they think that a lost matchbook will cause far less trouble than an attempt at retrieval might .  or else i m all wrong from beginning to end .    trumbull said   don t worry  klein .  i ll arrange to have an eye kept on you for a while .    he then went on .   i see the point you re making   henry .  there are dozens of these matchbooks in any given restaurant at any given time  all of them identical .  ottiwell could easily have picked up one or two on a previous visit or a dozen  if he wanted to and then use them as substitutes .  who would notice .  who would care .  and are you suggesting now that that one little substitute matchbook would carry the information .     it certainly would seem a strong possibility to me   said henry .    go  little book .  from this my solitude i cast thee on the waters go thy way .   muttered halsted .   that s robert southey .     but how would it work .   said trumbull  ignoring halsted s whispered verse .  he turned the matchbook from side to side between his fingers .   it s one match book  just like all the rest .  it says  cock and bull  on it  plus an address and a phone number .  where would there be any information on this one as opposed to others .     we would have to look in the right place   said henry .    and where would that be .   said trumbull .   i go by what you said  sir   said henry .   you said mr .  ottiwell would be sure to use the matchbook in a way that would involve its unique qualities  and i agree .  but what is unique about the message that matchbooks carry .  in almost every case  it is just advertising matter  and you ll find such matter in almost any number of other places from cereal boxtops to the inside covers of magazines .     well  then .     only one thing is truly unique about a matchbook  and that is the matches it contains .  in the standard matchbook there are thirty matches that seem to be arranged in a moderately complicated pattern .  if you study the bottom of the matches  though  you will see that there are two pieces of cardboard  from each of which there arise fifteen matches .  if you count from left to right  first the back row as you look at them from the direction of the opened flap and then the front row  say  you can  give each match a definite and unequivocal number from   to    .     yes   said trumbull   but all the matches are identical with each other and with the matches in other match books of the same kind .  the matches in this particular matchbook are absolutely standard .     but do the matches have to stay identical  sir .  suppose you took out one match any one match .  there would be thirty different ways of taking out one match .  if you took out two matches  or three  there would be many more additional ways .     no matches are missing .     just a manner of speaking .  tearing out matches would be far too crude a way of differentiating .  suppose certain matches had pinholes in them  or little scratches  or a tiny drop of fluorescent paint on the tips that would show up under ultraviolet light .  with thirty matches  how many different patterns could you produce by marking any number  from none at all to all thirty .     i ll tell you that   interrupted halsted .   two to the thirtieth power  which comes to oh  a little over one billion  that s billion  not million .  and if you also marked or didn t mark the flap just behind the matches  you would double that to two billion .     well   said henry   if you could give a particular matchbook any number from zero to two billion  such numbers could encode considerable information  perhaps .     as many as six words  easily   said trumbull thoughtfully .   damn .   he shouted  jumping to his feet .   give me that thing .  i m leaving now .    he left for the cloakroom at a run and was back fumbling into his coat and shouting   get your coat  klein  you re coming with me .  i need your statement and you ll be safer .    henry said   i may be quite wrong  sir .     wrong  hell .  you re right  i know you are .  the whole thing fits a few items you don t know about .   .   .   .  henry  would you consider getting involved in this sort of thing .  i mean  professionally .     hey   shouted rubin   don t you go taking henry away from us .     no fear  mr .  rubin   said henry softly   i find it much more exciting here .     afterword  this story first appeared in a slightly shorter version  in the december      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine  under the title  the matchbook collector .   once again  i consider the magazine title pedestrian .   i ll leave it up to you .  the phrase  go  little book .   is the beginning of a line from chaucer and from a poem by robert southey  and that line from southey was satirized very effectively by lord byron  so it has meaning in the history of english literature .  on top of that  it perfectly expresses the nub of the story in which the little  match  books are sent outward on errands of information .   what do you say  then .  don t i owe it to all mankind to change  the matchbook collector  back into  go  little book .   .   sure i do  by the way  when i first wrote the story i calculated out the value of      that is     two s mukiplied together  in my head out of sheer vainglory .  naturally  i got an answer that was off a little  and serves me right .  a young lady named mildred l .  stover wrote me a letter in which the value was carefully calculated out  multiplication by multiplication  and i corrected my mistake for the book .  if you are interested                      .   thank you  miss stover .          early sunday morning     geoffrey avalon swirled his second drink as he sat down to the table .  it had not yet diminished to the halfway mark and he would take one more sip before abandoning it .  he looked unhappy .   he said   this is the first time within my memory that the black widowers have met without a guest .   his bushy eyebrows  still black  although his mustache and trim beard had become respectably gray with the years   seemed to twitch .    oh  well   said roger halsted  flicking his napkin with an audible slap before placing it over his knees .   as host this session  it s my decision .  no appeal .  besides  i have my reasons .   he placed the palm of his hand on his high forehead and made a motion as though to brush back hair that had disappeared from the forepart of his pate years before .    actually   said emmanuel rubin   there s nothing in the bylaws that says we must have a guest .  the only thing we must have present at the dinner is no women .    the members can t be women   said thomas trum bull  glowering out of his perpetually tanned face .   where does it say that a guest can t be a woman .     no   said rubin sharply  his sparse beard quivering .   any guest is a member ex officio for the meal and must abide by all the rules  including not being a woman .     what does ex officio mean  anyway .   asked mario gonzalo .   i always wondered .    but henry was already presenting the first course  which seemed to be a long roll of pasta  stuffed with spiced cheese  broiled  and sauce covered .   at last rubin  looking pained  said   as near as i can make out this seems to be a roll of pasta  stuffed    but by that time  the conversation had grown general and halsted seized a break to announce that he had his limerick for the third book of the iliad .   trumbull said   damn it to hell  roger  are you going to inflict one of those on us at every meeting .     yes   said halsted thoughtfully .   i was planning just that .  it keeps me working at it .  besides  you have to have some item of intellectual worth at the dinner .   .   .   .  say  henry  don t forget that if it s steak tonight  i want mine rare .     trout tonight  mr .  halsted   said henry  refilling the water glasses .    good   said halsted .   now here it is    menelaus  though not very mighty   was stronger than paris  the flighty .   menelaus did well in  the duel over helen   but was foiled by divine aphrodite .    gonzalo said   but what does it mean .    avalon interposed   oh  well  in the third book  the greeks and trojans decide to settle the matter by means of a duel between menelaus and paris .  the latter had eloped with the former s wife  helen  and that was what caused the war .  menelaus won  but aphrodite snatched paris away just in time to save his life .   .   .   .  i m glad you didn t use venus in place of aphrodite  roger .  there s too much of the use of roman analogues .    halsted  through a full mouth  said   i wanted to avoid the temptation of obvious rhyming .     didn t you ever read the iliad  mario .   asked james drake .    listen   said gonzalo   i m an artist .  i have to save my eyes .    it was with dessert on the table that halsted said   okay  let me explain what i have in mind .  the last four times we met  there s been some sort of crime that s come up every discussion  and in the course of that discussion  it s been solved .     by henry   interrupted drake  stubbing out his cigarette .    all right  by henry .  but what kind of crimes .  rotten crimes .  the first time i wasn t here  but i gather the crime was a robbery  and not much of one either  from what i understand .  the second time  it was worse .  it was a case of cheating on an examination  for heaven s sake .     that s not such a minor thing   muttered drake .    well  it s not exactly a major thing .  the third time  and i was here then it was theft again  but a better one .  and the fourth time it was a case of espionage of some sort .     believe me   said trumbull   that wasn t minor .     yes   said halsted in his mild voice   but there was no violence anywhere .  murder  gentlemen  murder .     what do you mean  murder .   asked rubin .    i mean that every time we bring a guest  something minor turns up because we take it as it comes .  we don t deliberately invite guests who can offer us interesting crimes .  in fact  they re not even supposed to offer us crimes at all .  they re just guests .     so .     so there are now six of us present  no guests  and there must be one of us who knows of some killing that s a mystery and     hell .   said rubin in disgust .   you ve been reading agatha christie .  we ll each tell a puzzling mystery in turn and miss marple will solve it for us .   .  .  .  or henry will .    halsted looked abashed .   you mean they do things like that     oh  god   said rubin emotionally .    well  you re the writer   said halsted .   i don t read murder mysteries .     that s your loss   said rubin   and it shows what an idiot you are .  you call yourself a mathematician .  a proper mystery is as mathematical a puzzle as anything you can prepare and it has to be constructed out of much more intractable material .     now wait a while   said trumbull .   as long as we re here  why don t we see if we can dig up a murder .     can you present one .   said halsted hopefully .   you re with the government  working on codes or whatever .  you must have been involved with murder  and you don t have to name names .  you know that nothing gets repeated outside these walls .     i know that better than you   said trumbull   but i don t know about any murders .  i can give you some interesting code items but that s not what you re after .   .   .   .  how about you  roger .  since you bring this up  i suppose you have something up your sleeve .  some mathematical murder .     no   said halsted thoughtfully   i don t think i can recall being involved in a single murder .     you don t think .  you mean there s a doubt in your mind .   asked avalon .    i guess i m certain .  how about you  jeff .  you re a lawyer .     not the kind that gets murderers for clients   avalon said  with an apparently regretful shake of his head .   patent complications are my thing .  you might ask henry .  he s more at home with crimes than we are  or he sounds it .     i m sorry  sir   said henry softly as he poured the coffee with practiced skill .   in my case  it is merely theory .  i have been fortunate enough never to be involved with violent death .     you mean   said halsted   that with six of us here  seven  counting henry we can t scare up a single murder .    drake shrugged .   in my game  there s always a good chance of death .  i haven t witnessed one in the chem lab personally  but there ve been poisonings  explosions  even electrocutions .  at worst  though  it s murder through negligence .  i can t tell you anything about any of them .    trumbull said   how come you re so quiet  manny .  in all your colorful career  you mean you ve never had occasion to kill a man .     it would be a pleasure sometimes   said rubin   like now .  but i don t really have to .  i can handle them perfectly well at any size without having to lay a hand on them .  listen  i remember    but mario gonzalo  who had been sitting there with his lips clamped tightly together  suddenly said   i ve been involved in a murder .     oh .  what kind .   asked halsted .    my sister   he said broodingly   about three years ago .  that was before i joined the black widowers .     i m sorry   said halsted .   i guess you don t want to talk about it .     i wouldn t mind talking about it   said mario  shrugging  his large and prominent eyes looking them all in the face  one by one   but there s nothing to talk about .  no mystery .  it s just another one of those things that make this city the fun place it is .  they broke into the apartment  tried to loot it  and killed her .     who did .   asked rubin .    who knows .  addicts .  it happens all the time in that neighborhood .  in the apartment house she and her husband lived in  there d been four burglaries since new year s and it was only the end of april when it happened .     were they all murders .     they don t have to be .  the smart looter picks a time when the apartment is empty .  or if someone s there  they just scare them or tie them up .  marge was stupid enough to try to resist  to fight back .  there were plenty of signs of a struggle .   gonzalo shook his head .   halsted said  after a painful pause   did they ever get the ones who did it .    gonzalo s eyes lifted and stared into halsted s without any attempt at masking the contempt they held .   do you think they even looked .  that sort of thing goes on all day long .  nobody can do anything .  nobody even cares .  and if they got them  so what .  would it bring back marge .     it might keep them from doing it to others .     there d be plenty of other miserable creeps to do it .   gonzalo drew a deep breath  then said   well  maybe i d better talk about it and get it out of my system .  it s all my fault  you see  because i wake up too early .  if it weren t for that  maybe marge would be alive and alex wouldn t be the wreck he is now .     who s alex .   asked avalon .    my brother in law .  he was married to marge  and i liked him .  i think i liked him better than i ever did her  to be truthful .  she never approved of me .  she thought being an artist was just my way of goofing off .  of course  once i started making a decent living no  she never really approved of me even then and most of the time she was  meaning no disrespect to the dead  one big pain .  she liked alex  though .     he wasn t an artist .   avalon was carrying the burden of the questioning and the others seemed willing to leave it to him .    no .  he wasn t much of anything when they married  just a drifter  but afterward he became exactly what she wanted .  she was what he needed to get a little push into him .  they needed each other .  she had something to care for     no children .     no .  none .  unless you want to count one miscarriage .  poor marge .  something biological  so she couldn t have kids .  but it didn t matter .  alex was her kid  and he flourished .  he got a job the month he was married  got promoted  did well .  they were getting to the point where they were planning to move out of that damned death trap  and then it happened .  poor alex .  he was as much to blame as i was .  more  in fact .  of all days  he had to leave the house on that one .     he wasn t in the apartment  then .     of course not .  if he was  he might have scared them off .     or he might have gotten killed himself .     in which case they would probably have run off and  left marge alive .  believe me  i ve listened to him list the possibilities .  no matter how he slices it  she d still be alive if he hadn t left that day  and it bothers him .  and let me tell you  he s gone to pot since it happened .  he s just a drifter again now .  i give him money when i can and he gets odd jobs now and then .  poor alex .  he had that five years of marriage when he was really making it .  he was a go getter .  now it s all for nothing .  nothing to show for it .    gonzalo shook his head .   what gets me is that the victim isn t the one who gets the worst of it .  it s a senseless murder hell  everything they got in the apartment amounted to no more than about ten  fifteen dollars in small bills but at least marge died quickly .  the knife was right in the heart .  but alex suffers every day of his life now  and my mother took it hard .  and it bothers me  too .     listen   said halsted   if you don t want to talk about it     it s all right .   .  .  .  i think of it nights sometimes .  if i didn t wake up early that day     that s the second time you said that   said trumbull .   what s your waking up early got to do with it .     because people who know me count on it .  look  i always wake up at eight a . m .  sharp .  it doesn t vary by as much as five minutes one way or the other .  i don t even bother keeping the clock by my bed  it stays in the kitchen .  it s got something to do with rhythms in the body .     the biological clock   muttered drake .   i wish it worked that way with me .  i hate getting up in the morning .     it works with me all the time   said gonzalo  and even under the circumstances  there was a hint of complacence in his voice as he said so .   even if i go to sleep late three in the morning  four i always wake up at exactly eight .  i go back to sleep later in the day if i m knocked out  but at eight i wake up .  even on sunday .  you d think i d have the right to sleep late on sunday  but even then  damn it  i wake up .     you mean it happened on a sunday .   asked rubin .   gonzalo nodded .   that s right .  i should have been asleep .  i should have been the kind of person people would know better than to wake early sunday morning  but they don t hesitate .  they know i ll be awake  even on sunday .     nuts   said drake  apparently still brooding over his difficulties in the morning .   you re an artist and make your own hours .  why do you have to get up in the morning .     well  i work best then .  besides  i m time conscious  too .  i don t have to live by the clock  but i like to know what time it is at all times .  that clock i have .  it s trained  you know .  after it happened  after marge was killed  i wasn t home for three days and it just happened to stop either eight p . m .  sunday or eight a  . m .  monday .  i don t know .  anyway  when i came back there it was with the hands pointing to eight as though rubbing it in that that was wake up time .    gonzalo brooded for a while and no one spoke .  henry passed around the small brandy glasses with no expression on his face  unless you counted the merest tightening of his lips .   gonzalo finally said   it s a funny thing but i had a rotten night  that night before  and there was no reason for it .  that time of year  end of april  cherry blossom time  is my favorite .  i m not exactly a landscape artist  but that s the one time i do like to get into the park and make some sketches .  and the weather was good .  i remember it was a nice mild saturday  the first really beautiful weekend of the year  and my work was doing pretty well  too .    i had no reason to feel bad that day  but i got more and more restless .  i remember i turned off my little television set just before the eleven o clock news .  it was as though i felt that i didn t want to hear the news .  it was as though i felt there would be bad news .  i remember that .  i didn t make it up afterward  and i m not a mystic .  but i had a premonition .  i just did .    rubin said   more likely you had a touch of indigestion .     all right   said gonzalo  moving his hands as though to take in and welcome the suggestion .   call it indigestion .  all i know is that it was before eleven p . m .  and i went into the kitchen and wound the clock i always wind it at night and said to myself   i can t go to bed this early   but i did .    maybe it was too early  because i couldn t sleep .  i kept tossing and worrying i don t remember about what .  what i should have done was get up  do some work  read a book  watch some late movie but i just didn t .  i just made up my mind to stay in bed .     why .   asked avalon .    don t know .  it seemed important at the time .  god  how i remember that night  because i kept thinking  maybe i ll sleep late because i m not sleeping now and i knew i wouldn t .  i must have dropped off at about four a . m .   but at eight i was up and crawled out of bed to get myself breakfast .    it was another sunny day .  pleasant and cool  but you knew it was going to have all the warmth of spring with none of the heat of summer .  another nice day .  you know it hurts me  now and then  that i didn t tike marge better than i did .  i mean  we got along all right  but we weren t close .  i swear i visited them more to be with alex than to be with her .  and then i got a call .    halsted said   you mean a telephone call .     yes .  eight o clock of a sunday morning .  who would make a call at that time to anyone unless they knew the jerk always got up at eight .  if i had been asleep and had been awakened  and growled into the mouthpiece  the whole thing would have been different .     who was it .   asked drake .    alex .  he asked if he woke me .  he knew he didn t  but he felt guilty calling that early  i suppose .  he asked what time it was .  i looked at the clock and said   it s eight oh nine a . m .  of course i m awake .   i was sort of proud of it  you see .    and then he asked if he could come over  because he had had an argument with marge and had stamped out of the house and didn t want to go back till she had cooled down .   .  .  .  i tell you  i m glad i never married .    anyway  if i d only said no .  if i d only told him i d had a bad night and i needed my sleep and i didn t want company  he d have gone back to his apartment .  he had no place else to go .  and then it all wouldn t have happened .  but no  big hearted mario was so proud of being an early riser that he said   come on over and i ll fix you coffee and eggs   because i knew marge wasn t one for early sunday breakfasts  and i knew alex hadn t eaten .    so he was over in ten minutes and by eight thirty i had the scrambled eggs and bacon in front of him  and marge was alone in the apartment  waiting for murderers .    trumbull said   did your brother in law tell his wife where he was going .    gonzalo said   i don t think so .  i assumed he didn t .  i figure what happened was he stamped out in a fit of rage without even knowing where he was going himself .  then he thought of me .  even if he knew he was going to visit me  he might not have told her .  he would figure  let her worry .     all right   said trumbull   and then when the junkies came to the door and maybe tried the lock  she figured it was alex coming back and she opened the door to them .  i ll bet the lock wasn t broken .     no  it wasn t   said gonzalo .    isn t sunday morning a queer time for junkies to make the rounds .   asked drake .    listen   said rubin   they ll do it any time .  the craving for drugs knows no season .     what was the fight about .   asked avalon suddenly .   i mean  between alex and marge .     oh  i don t know .  a little thing .  alex had done something at work that must have looked bad and that was one thing that marge couldn t stand .  i don t even know what it was  but whatever it was  it must have been a blow at her pride in him and she was sore .    the trouble was that alex never learned to just let her run down .  when we were kids  i always did that .  i would say   yes  marge  yes  marge   and then she d run down .  but alex would always try to defend himself and then things would just get worse .  that time  most of the night was filled with argument .   .  .  .  of course  he says now that if he only hadn t made a federal case out of it  he wouldn t have left  and then none of it would have happened .     the moving finger writes     said avalon .   brooding on these ifs does no good .     sure  but how do you stop  jeff .  anyway  they had a bad night and i had a bad night .  it was as though there were some kind of telepathic communication .    oh  bull   said rubin .   we were twins   said gonzalo defensively .   only fraternal twins   said rubin   unless you re a girl underneath all those clothes .    so what .     so it s only identical twins that are supposed to have this telepathic sympathy  but that s bull  too .     anyway   said gonzalo   alex was with me and i ate and he didn t eat much  and he cried on my shoulder about how hard marge was on him sometimes  and i sympathized and said   listen  why do you pay so much attention to her .  she s a good kid if you ll only not take her seriously .   you know all the consoling things people say .  i figured in a couple of hours he d be talked out and he d go home and make it up and i d go out to the park or maybe back to bed .  only in a couple of hours the telephone rang again  and it was the police .     how d they know where to find alex .   asked halsted .   they didn t .  they called me .  i m her brother .  alex and i went over and identified her .  for a while there  he looked like a dead man .  it wasn t just that she was dead .  after all  he d had a fight with her and the neighbors must have heard .  now she was dead  and they always suspect the husband .  of course  they questioned him and he admitted the fight and leaving the apartment and coming to my place the whole thing .     it must have sounded phony as hell   said rubin .    i corroborated the fact that he was at my place .  i said he d arrived at my place at eight twenty  maybe eight twenty five  and had been there since .  and the murder had taken place at nine .     you mean there were witnesses .   asked drake .    hell  no .  but there d been noise .  the people underneath heard .  the people across the hall heard .  furniture being overturned  a scream .  of course  no one saw anyone  no one saw anything .  they sat behind their locked doors .  but they heard the noise and it was around nine o clock .  they all agreed to that .    that settled it as far as the police were concerned .  in that neighborhood  if it isn t the spouse  it s some petty thief  probably an addict .  alex and i went out and he got drunk and i stayed with him a couple of days because he was in no condition to be left alone and that s all there is to the story .    trambull said   do you ever see alex these days .     once in a while .  i lend him a few bucks now and then .  not that i expect to get paid back .  he quit his job the week after marge was killed .  i don t think he ever went back to work .  he was just a broken man because he blamed himself  you know .  why did he have to argue with her .  why did he have to leave the house .  why did he have to come over to my place .  anyway  there it is .  it s a murder but no mystery .    there was silence for a time  and then halsted said   do you mind  mario  if we speculate about it  just  just     just for fun .   said mario .   sure  go ahead  have fun .  if you have questions  i ll answer as best i can but as far as the murder is concerned  there s nothing to say .     you see   said halsted awkwardly   no one saw anybody .  it s only an assumption that some nameless addicts came in and killed her .  someone might have killed her with a better reason  knowing that it would be blamed on addicts and he d be safe .  or she  maybe .     who s the someone .   said mario skeptically .    didn t she have any enemies .  did she have money that somebody wanted .   said halsted .    money .  what there was was in the bank .  it all went to alex  of course .  it was his to begin with  everything was joint .     how about jealousy .   said avalon .   maybe she was having an affair .  or he was .  maybe that s what the argument was about .     and he killed her .   said gonzalo .   the fact is he was in my apartment at the time she was killed .     not necessarily he .  suppose it was her boy friend  or his girl friend .  the boy friend  because she was threatening to break off the affair .  the girl friend  because she wanted to marry your brother in law .    mario shook his head .   marge was no femme fatale .  i was always surprised she made it with alex .  for that matter  maybe she didn t .     did alex complain about that .   asked trumbull with sudden interest .    no  but then he s no great lover  either .  listen  he s been a widower for three years now and i m willing to swear he has no girl of any kind .  no boy  either  before you start talking about that .    rubin said   hold it  you still don t know what the argument was really about .  you said it was something that happened at work .  did he actually tell you what it was and you ve just forgotten  or did he never tell you .     he didn t go into detail  and i didn t ask .  it wasn t my business .     all right   said rubin   how about this .  it was an argument about something big at work .  maybe alex had stolen fifty thousand dollars and marge was sore about it  and that was the argument .  or marge had made him steal it and he was getting cold feet about it and that was the argument .  and maybe the fifty thousand was in the house and someone knew about it and that someone killed her and took it and alex doesn t dare mention it .     what someone .   demanded gonzalo .   what theft .  alex wasn t that kind of guy .     famous last words   intoned drake .   well  he wasn t .  and if he had done it  the firm he worked for wouldn t have kept quiet .  no chance .    trumbull said   how about the kind of in fighting that goes on in apartment houses .  you know  feuds between tenants .  was there someone who hated her and finally let her have it .     hell  if there were anything that serious  i d know about it .  marge never kept things like that quiet .    drake said   could it be suicide .  after all  her husband had just walked out on her .  maybe he said he was never coming back and she was in despair .  in a fit of irrational depression  she killed herself .     it was a knife from the kitchen   said gonzalo .   there s that .  but marge isn t the suicidal type .  she might kill someone eke  but not herself .  besides  why would there be that struggle and the scream if she had killed herself .    drake said   in the first place  things might have been knocked about during the argument with her husband .  in the second place  she might have faked a murder to get her husband into trouble .  vengeance is mine  saith the aggrieved wife .     oh  come on   said gonzalo contemptuously .   marge wouldn t do something like that in a million years .     you know   said drake   you don t really know all that much about another person even if she s a twin .     well  you won t get me to believe it .    trumbull said   i don t know why we re wasting our time .  why don t we ask the expert .   .   .   .  henry .    henry  whose face mirrored only polite interest  said   yes  mr .  trumbull .     how about telling us all about it .  who killed mr .  gonzalo s sister .    henry s eyebrows lifted slightly .   i do not represent myself to be an expert  mr .  trumbull  but i must say that all the suggestions made by the gentlemen at the table  including yours  are unlikely in the extreme .  i myself think that the police are perfectly correct and that if  in this case  the husband did not do it  then housebreakers did .  and these days  one must assume that those housebreakers were drug addicts desperate for money or for something they can convert into money .     you disappoint me  henry   said trumbull .   henry smiled gently .    well  then   said halsted   i guess we d better adjourn after we settle who hosts next time  and i suppose we d better go back to having guests .  this scheme of mine didn t work out so well .     sorry i couldn t make it better  folks   said gonzalo .    i didn t mean it that way  mario   said halsted hastily    i know .  well  let s forget it .    they were leaving  with mario gonzalo bringing up the rear .  a light tap at his shoulder caused gonzalo to turn .   henry said   mr .  gonzalo  could i see you privately  without the others knowing .  it s quite important .    gonzalo stared a moment and said   okay  i ll go out  say my goodbyes  take a taxi  and have it bring me back .   he was back in ten minutes .    is this something about my sister  henry .     i m afraid so  sir .  i thought i had better talk to you  privately .     all right .  let s go back into the chamber .  it s empty now .     better not  sir .  anything said in that room can t be repeated outside and i do not wish to talk in confidence .  i don t mind finding myself hushed up about average run of the mill misdeeds  but murder is another thing altogether .  there s a corner here that we can use .    they went together to the indicated place .  it was late and the restaurant was virtually empty .   henry said  in a low voice   i listened to the account and i would like your permission to repeat some of it just to make sure i have it right .     sure  go ahead .     as i understand it  on a saturday toward the end of april  you felt uneasy and went to bed before the eleven o clock news .     yes  just before eleven o clock .     and you didn t hear the news .     not even the opening headlines .     and that night  even though you didn t sleep  you didn t get out of bed .  you didn t go to the bathroom or the kitchen .     no  i didn t .     and then you woke up at exactly the same time you always do .     that s right .     well  now  mr .  gonzalo  that is what disturbs me .  a person who wakes up every morning at exactly the same time  thanks to some sort of biological clock inside him  wakes up at the wrong time twice a year .     what .     twice a year  sir  in this state  ordinary clocks are shifted  once when daylight saving time starts  and once when it ends  but biological time doesn t change suddenly .  mr .  gonzalo  on the last sunday in april  daylight saving time starts .  at one a . m .  sunday morning the clocks are shifted to two a . m .  if you had listened to the eleven o clock news you would have been reminded to do that .  but you wound you clock before eleven p . m .  and you said nothing about adjusting it .  then you went to bed and never touched it during the night .  when you woke at eight a . m .   the clock should have said nine a . m .  am i right .     good lord   said gonzalo .    you left after the police called and you didn t come back for days .  when you came back the clock was stopped  of course .  you had no way of knowing that it was an hour slow when it had stopped .  you set it to the correct time and never knew the difference .     i never thought of that  but you re perfectly right .     the police should have thought of that  but it s so easy these days to dismiss run of the mill crimes of violence as the work of addicts .  you gave your brother in law his alibi and they followed the line of least resistance .     you mean he     it s possible  sir .  they fought  and he killed her at nine a . m .  as the statements of the neighbors indicated .  i doubt that it was premeditated .  then  in desperation  he thought of you and rather clever of him it was .  he called you and asked you what time it was .  you said eight oh nine and he knew you hadn t altered the clock and rushed over to your place .  if you had said nine oh nine  he would have tried to get out of town .     but  henry  why should he have done it .     it s hard to tell with married couples  sir .  your sister may have had too high standards .  you said she disapproved of your way of life  for instance  and probably made that very plain  plain enough to cause you not to like her very well .  now she must have disapproved of her husband s way of life  as it was before she had married him .  he was a drifter  you said .  she made of him a respectable  hard working employee and he may not have liked it .  after he finally exploded and killed her  he became a drifter again .  you think this is so out of despair  he may have nothing more than the feeling of relief .     well .   .   .  what do we do .     i don t know  sir .  it would be a hard thing to prove .  could you really remember  after three years  that you didn t adjust the clock .  a cross examining attorney would tear you apart .  on the other hand  your brother in law might break down if faced with it .  you ll have to consider whether you wish to go to the police  sir .     i .   said gonzalo hesitantly .    it was your sister  sir   said henry softly .    afterword  this story first appeared in the march      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine  under the title  the biological clock .    in this case it seems to me that the magazine title stresses something i would rather the reader slurred over  since it is the key to the puzzle .  if he concentrates too hard on that because of the title  he will outguess me .  therefore  it s back to  early sunday morning   which refers to the matter also  so that it s fair  but is sufficiently neutral to give me a fair chance  too .        the obvious factor     thomas trumbull looked about the table and said  with some satisfaction   well  at least you won t get yourself pen and inked into oblivion  voss .  our resident artist isn t here .  .   .   .  henry .    henry was at trumbull s elbow before the echo of the bellow had died  with no sign of perturbation on his bright eyed and unlined face .  trumbull took the scotch and soda the waiter had on his tray and said   has mario called  henry .     no  sir   said henry calmly .   geoffrey avalon had reduced his second drink to the halfway point and swirled it absently .   after last month s tale about his murdered sister  it could be that he didn t      he did not complete the sentence  but put down his glass carefully at the seat he intended to take .  the monthly banquet of the black widowers was about to begin .   trumbull  who was host  took the armchair at the head of the table and said   have you got them all straight  voss .  at my left is james drake .  he s a chemist and knows more about pulp fiction than about chemistry  and that probably isn t much .  then geoffrey avalon  a lawyer who never sees the inside of a courtroom  emmanuel rubin  who writes in between talking  which is practically never  and roger halsted .   .   .   .  roger  you re not inflicting another limerick on us this session  are you .     a limerick .   said trumbull s guest  speaking for the first time .  it was a pleasant voice  light and yet rich  with all consonants carefully pronounced .  he had a white beard  evenly cut from temple to temple  and white hair  too .  his youthful face shone pinkly within its fence of white .    a poet  then .     a poet .   snorted trumbull .   not even a mathematician  which is what he claims to be .  he insists on writing a limerick for every book of the iliad .     and odyssey   said halsted  in his soft  hurried voice .   but  yes  i have my limerick .     good .  it s out of order   said trumbull .   you are not to read it .  host s privilege .     oh  for heaven s sake   said avalon  the flat lines of his well preserved face set in disappointment .   let him recite the poor thing .  it takes thirty seconds and i find it fun .    trumbull pretended not to hear .   you ve all got it straight about my guest now .  he s dr .  voss eldridge .  he s a ph . d .  so is drake  voss .  we re all doctors  though  by virtue of membership in the black widowers .   he then raised his glass  gave the monthly invocation to old king cole  and the meal was officially begun .   halsted  who had been whispering to drake  passed a paper to him .  drake rose and declaimed     next a lycian attempted a ruse  with an arrow permitted by zeus .   who will trust trojan candor  as  this sly deed of pandoras  puts an end to the scarce proclaimed truce .       damn it   said trumbull .   i ruled against reading it .     against my reading it   said halsted .   drake read it .     it s disappointing not to have mario here   said avalon .   he would ask what it means .     go ahead  jeff   said rubin .   i ll pretend i don t understand it and you explain .    but avalon maintained a dignified silence while henry presented the appetizer and rubin fixed it with his usual suspicious stare .    i hate stuff   he said   that s so chopped up and drowned in goop that you can t see what the ingredients are .    henry said   i think you ll find it quite wholesome .     try it  you ll like it   said avalon .   rubin tried it  but his face showed no signs of liking it .  it was noted later  however  that he had finished it .   dr .  eldridge said   is there a necessity of explaining these limericks  dr .  avalon .  are there tricks to them .     no  not at all  and don t bother with the doctorate .  that s only for formal occasions  though it s good of you to humor the club idiosyncrasy .  it s just that mario has never read the iliad  few have  these days .     pandarus  as i recall  was a go between and gives us the word  pander .   that  i take it  was the sly deed mentioned in the limerick .     oh  no  no   said avalon  unsuccessfully hiding his delight .   you re thinking now of the medieval troilus tale  which shakespeare drew on for his troilus and cres sida .  pandarus was the go between there .  in the iliad he was merely a lycian archer who shot at menelaus during a truce .  that was the sly deed .  he is killed in the next book by the greek warrior diomedes .     ah   said eldridge  smiling faintly   it s easy to be fooled  isn t it .     if you want to be   said rubin  but he smiled as the london broil arrived .  there was no mistaking the nature of the components there .  he buttered a roll and ate it as though to give himself time to contemplate the beauty of the meat .    as a matter of fact   said halsted   we ve solved quite a few puzzles in recent meetings .  we did well .     we did lousy   said trumbull .   henry is the one who did well .     i include henry when i say  we     said halsted  his fair face flushing .    henry .   asked eldridge .    our esteemed waiter   said trumbull   and honorary member of the black widowers .    henry  who was filling the water glasses  said   you honor me  sir .     honor  hell .  i wouldn t come to any meeting if you weren t taking care of the table  henry .     its good of you to say so  sir .    eldridge remained thoughtfully quiet thereafter  as he followed the tide of conversation that  as was usual  grew steadily in intensity .  drake was making some obscure distinction between secret agent x and operator    and rubin  for some reason known only to himself  was disputing the point .   drake  whose slightly hoarse voice never rose  said   operator   may have used disguises .  i won t deny that .  it was secret agent x  however  who was  the man of a thousand faces .   i can send you a xerox of a contents page of a magazine from my library to prove it .   he made a note to himself in his memo book .   rubin  scenting defeat  shifted ground at once .   there s no such thing as a disguise  anyway .  there are a million things no one can disguise  idiosyncrasies of stance  walk  voice  a million habits you can t change because you don t even know you have them .  a diguise works only because no one looks .     people fool themselves  in other words   said eldridge  breaking in .    absolutely   said rubin .   people want to be fooled .    the ice cream parfait was brought in  and not long after that  trumbull struck his water glass with his spoon .    inquisition time   he said .   as grand inquisitor i pass  since i m the host .  manny  will you do the honors .    rubin said  at once   dr .  eldridge  how do you justify the fact of your existence .     by the fact that i labor to distinguish truth from folly .     do you consider that you succeed in doing so .     not as often as i wish  perhaps .  and yet as often as most .  to distinguish truth from folly is a common desire  we all try our hands at it .  my interpretation of pandarus  deed in halsted s limerick was folly and avalon corrected me .  the common notion of disguise you claimed to be folly and you corrected it .  when i find folly  i try to correct it  if i can .  it s not always easy .     what is your form of folly correction  eldridge .  how would you describe your profession .     i am   said eldridge   associate professor of abnormal psychology .     where do you  .  .  .   .   began rubin .   avalon interrupted  his deep voice dominating   sorry  manny  but i smell an evasion .  you asked dr .  eldridge s profession and he gave you a title  .   .   .  what do you do dr .  eldridge  to occupy your time most significantly .     i investigate parapsychological phenomena   said eldridge .    oh  god   muttered drake  and stubbed out his cigarette .   eldridge said   you disapprove of that  sir .   there was no sign of annoyance on his face .  he turned to henry and said   no  thank you  henry  i ve had enough coffee   with perfect calmness .   henry passed on to rubin  who was holding his cup in the air as a signal of its emptiness .    it s not a question of approval or disapproval   said drake .   i think you re wasting your time .     in what way .     you investigate telepathy  precognition  things like that .     yes .  and ghosts and spiritual phenomena  too .     all right .  have you ever come across something you couldn t explain .     explain in what way .  i could explain a ghost by saying   yes  that s a ghost .   i take it that s not what you mean .    rubin broke in .   i hate to be on drake s side right now  but he means to ask  as you well know  whether you have ever come across any phenomenon you could not explain by the accepted and prosaic laws of science .     i have come across many such phenomena .     that you could not explain .   asked halsted .    that i could not explain .  there s not a month that passes but that something crosses my desk that i cannot explain   said eldridge  nodding his head gently .   there was a short silence of palpable disapproval and then avalon said   does that mean that you are a believer in these psychic phenomena .     if you mean  do i think that events take place that violate the laws of physics .  no .  do i think  however  that i know all there is to know about the laws of physics .  also  no .  do i think anyone knows all there is to know about the laws of physics .  no  a third time .     that s evasion   said drake .   do you have any evidence that telepathy exists  for instance  and that the laws of physics  as presently accepted  will have to be modified accordingly .     i am not ready to commit myself that far .  i well know that in even the most circumstantial stories  there are honest mistakes  exaggerations  misinterpretations  outright hoaxes .  and yet  even allowing for all that  i come across incidents i cannot quite bring myself to dismiss .    eldridge shook his head and continued   it s not easy  this job of mine .  there are some incidents for which no conceivable run of the mill explanation seems possible  where the evidence for something quite apart from the known rules by which the universe seems to run appears irrefutable .  it would seem i must accept and yet i hesitate .  can i labor under a hoax so cleverly manipulated  or an error so cleverly hidden  that i take for the gold of fact what is only the brass of nonsense .  i can be fooled  as rubin would point out .    trumbull said   manny would say that you want to be fooled .     maybe i do .  we all want dramatic things to be true .  we want to be able to wish on a star  to have strange powers  to be irresistible to women and would inwardly conspire to believe such things no matter how much we might lay claim to complete rationality .     not me   said rubin flatly .   i ve never kidded myself in my life .     no .   eldridge looked at him thoughtfully .   i take it then that you will refuse to believe in the actual existence of parapsychological phenomena under all circumstances .     i wouldn t say that   said rubin   but i d need damned good evidence better evidence than i ve ever seen advanced .     and how about the rest of you gentlemen .    drake said   we re all rationalists .  at least i don t know about mario gonzalo  but he s not here this session .     you  too  tom .    trumbull s lined face broke into a grim smile .   you ve never convinced me with any of your tales before this  voss .  i don t think you can convince me now .     i never told you tales that convinced me  tom .   .   .   .  but i have one now  something i ve never told you and that no one really knows about outside my department .  i can tell it to you all and if you can come up with an explanation that would require no change in the fundamental scientific view of the universe  i would be greatly relieved .     a ghost story .   said halsted .    no  not a ghost story   said eldridge .   it is merely a story that defies the principle of cause and effect  the very foundation stone on which all science is built .  to put it another way  it defies the concept of the irreversible forward flow of time .     actually   said rubin  at once   it s quite possible  on the sub atomic level  to consider time as flowing either     shut up  manny   said trumbull   and let voss talk .    quietly  henry had placed the brandy before each of the diners .  eldridge lifted his small glass absently and sniffed at it  then nodded to henry  who returned a small  urbane smile .    it s an odd thing   said eldridge   but so many of those who claim to have strange powers  or have it claimed for them  are young women of no particular education  no particular presence  no particular intelligence .  it is as though the existence of a special talent has consumed what would otherwise be spread out among the more usual facets of the personality .  maybe it s just more noticeable in women .    at any rate  i am speaking of someone i ll just call mary for now .  you understand i m not using her real name .  the woman is still under investigation and it would be fatal  from my point of view  to get any kind of pub icity hounds on the track .  you understand .    trumbull frowned severely .   come on  voss  you know i told you that nothing said here is ever repeated outside the confines of these walls .  you needn t feel constrained .     accidents happen   said eldridge equably .   at any rate  i ll return to mary .  mary never completed grade school and has earned what money she could earn by serving behind a counter at the five and ten .  she is not attractive and no one will sweep her away from the counter  which may be good  for she is useful there and serves well .  you might not think so  since she cannot add correctly and is given to incapacitating headaches  during which she will sit in a back room and upset the other employees by muttering gibberish to herself in a baleful sort of way .  nevertheless  the store wouldn t dream of letting her go .     why not .   asked rubin  clearly steeling himself to skepticism at every point .    because she spots shoplifters  who  as you know  can these days bleed a store to death through a thousand small cuts .  it isn t that mary is in any way shrewd or keen eyed or unrelenting in pursuit .  she just knows a shoplifter when he or she enters the store  even if she has never seen the person before  and even if she doesn t actually see the person come in .    she followed them herself at first for brief intervals  then grew hysterical and began her muttering .  the manager eventually tied the two things together mary s characteristic behavior and the shoplifting .  he started to watch for one  then the other  and it didn t take long for him to find out that she never missed .    losses quickly dropped to virtually nothing in that particular five and ten despite the fact that the store is in a bad neighborhood .  the manager  of course  received the credit .  probably  he deliberately kept the truth from being known lest anyone try to steal mary from him .    but then i think he grew afraid of it .  mary fingered a shoplifter who wasn t a shoplifter but who later was mixed up in a shooting incident .  the manager had read about some of the work my department does  and he came to us .  eventually  he brought mary to us .    we got her to come to the college regularly .  we paid her  of course .  not much  but then she didn t ask for much .  she was an unpleasant not bright girl of about twenty  who was reluctant to talk and describe what went on in her mind .  i suppose she had spent a childhood having her queer notions beaten out of her and she had learned to be cautious  you see .    drake said   you re telling us she had a gift for pre cognition .    eldridge said   since precognition is just latin for seeing things before they happen  and since she sees things before they happen  how else can i describe it .  she sees unpleasant things only  things that upset or frighten her  which  i imagine  makes her life a hell .  it is the quality of becoming upset or frightened that breaks down the time barrier .    halsted said   let s set our boundary conditions .  what does she sense .  how far ahead in time does she see things .  how far away in space .     we could never get her to do much for us   said eldridge .   her talent wasn t on tap at will and with us she could never relax .  from what the manager told us and from what we could pick up  it seemed she could never detect anything more than a few minutes ahead in time .  half an hour to an hour at the most .   rubin snorted .    a few minutes   said eldridge mildly   is as good as a century .  the principle stands .  cause and effect is violated and the flow of time is reversed .    and in space  there seemed no limits .  as she described it  when i could get her to say anything at all  and as i interpreted her rather clumsy and incoherent words  the background of her mind is a constant flickering of frightening shapes .  every once in a while  this . is lit up  as though by a momentary lightning flash  and she sees  or becomes aware .  she sees most clearly what is close by or what she is most concerned about the shoplifting  for instance .  occasionally  though  she sees what must be taking place farther away .  the greater the disaster  the farther she can sense things .  i suspect she could detect a nuclear bomb getting ready to explode anywhere in . the world .    rubin said   i imagine she speaks incoherently and you fill in the rest .  history is full of ecstatic prophets whose mumbles are interpreted into wisdom .     i agree   said eldridge   and i pay no attention or at least not much to anything that isn t clear .  i don t even attach much importance to her feats with shoplifters .  she might be sensitive enough to detect some characteristic way in which shoplifters look and stand  some aura  some smell the sort of thing you talked about  rubin  as matters no one can disguise .  but then     then .   prompted halsted .    just a minute   said eldridge .   uh henry  could i have a refill in the coffeecup after all .     certainly   said henry .   eldridge watched the coffee level rise .   what s your attitude on psychic phenomena  henry .    henry said   i have no general attitude  sir .  i accept whatever it seems to me i must accept .     good .   said eldridge .   i ll rely on you and not on these prejudiced and preconcepted rationalists here .     go on  then   said drake .   you paused at the dramatic moment to throw us off .     never   said eldridge .   i was saying that i did not take mary seriously  until one day she suddenly began to squirm and pant and mumble under her breath .  she does that now and then  but this time she muttered  eldridge .  eldridge .   and the word grew shriller and shriller .    i assumed she was calling me  but she wasn t .  when i responded  she ignored me .  over and over again  it was  eldridge .  eldridge .   then she began to scream  tire .  oh  lord .  it s burning .  help .  eldridge .  eldridge .   over and over again  with all kinds of variations .  she kept it up for half an hour .    we tried to make sense out of it .  we spoke quietly  of course  because we didn t want to intrude more than we had to  but we kept saying   where .  where .   incoherently enough  and in scraps  she told us enough to make us guess it was san francisco  which  i need not tell you  is nearly three thousand miles away .  there s only one golden gate bridge after all  and in one spasm  she gasped out   golden gate   over and over .  afterward it turned out she had never heard of the golden gate bridge and was quite shaky as to san francisco .    when we put it all together  we decided that there was an old apartment house somewhere in san francisco  possibly within eyeshot of the bridge  that had gone up in fire .  a total of twenty three people were in it at the time it burst into fire  and of these  five did not escape .  the five deaths included that of a child .    halsted said   and then you checked and found there was a fire in san francicso and that five people had died  including a child .     that s right   said eldridge .   but here s what got me .  one of the five deaths was that of a woman  sophronia latimer .  she had gotten out safely and then discovered that her eight year old boy had not come out with her .  she ran wildly back into the house  screaming for the boy  and never came out again .  the boy s name was eldridge  so you can see what she was shouting in the minutes before her death .    eldridge is a very uncommon first name  as i need not tell you  and my feeling is that mary captured that particular event  for all that it was so far away  entirely because she had been sensitized to the name  by way of myself  and because it was surrounded by such agony .    rubin said   you want an explanation  is that it .     of  course   said eldridge .   how did this ignorant girl see a fire in full detail  get all the facts correct and believe me  we checked it out  at three thousand miles .    rubin said   what makes the three thousand mile distance so impressive .  these days it means nothing  it s one sixtieth of a second at the speed of light .  i suggest that she heard the tale of the fire on radio or on television more likely the latter and passed it on to you .   that s why she chose that story  because of the name eldridge .  she figured it would have the greatest possible effect on you .     why .   asked eldridge .   why should she put through such a hoax .     why .   rubin s voice faded out momentarily  as though with astonishment  then came back in a shout .   good god  you ve been working with these people for years and don t realize how much they want to hoax you .  don t you suppose there s a feeling of power that comes with perpetrating a good hoax  and money  too  don t forget .    eldridge thought about it  then shook his head .   she doesn t have the brains to put something like this across .  it takes brains to be a faker a good one  anyway .    trumbull broke in .   well  now  voss .  there s no reason to suppose she s in it on her own .  a confederate is possible .  she supplies the hysteria  he supplies the brains .     who might the confederate be .   asked eldridge softly .   trumbull shrugged .   i don t know .    avalon cleared his throat and said   i go along with tom here  and my guess is that the confederate is the manager of the five and ten .  he had noted her ability to guess at shoplifters  and thought he could put this to use in something more splashy .  i ll bet that s it .  he heard about the fire on television  caught the name eldridge  and coached her .     how long would it take to coach her .   asked eldridge .   i keep telling you that she s not very bright .     the coaching wouldn t be difficult   said rubin quickly .   you say she was incoherent .  he would just tell her a few key words  eldridge  fire  golden gate  and so on .  she then keeps repeating them in random arrangements and you intelligent parapsychologists fill it in .    eldridge nodded  then said   that s interesting  except that there was no time at all to coach the girl .  that s what precognition is all about .  we know exactly what time she had her fit and we know exactly what time the fire broke out in san francisco .   it so happens the fire broke out at just about the minute that mary s fit died down .  it was as though once the fire was actual  it was no longer a matter of precognition  and mary lost contact .  so you see  there could be no coaching .  the news didn t hit the network tv news programs till that evening .  that s when we found out and began our investigation in depth .     but wait   said halsted .   what about the time difference .  there s a three hour time difference between new york and san francisco  and a confederate in san francisco     a confederate in san francisco .   said eldridge  opening his eyes wide  and staring .   are you imagining a continental conspiracy .  besides  believe me  i know about the time difference also .  when i say that the fire started just as mary finished  i mean allowing for the time difference .  mary s fit started at just about one fifteen p . m .  eastern standard time  and the fire in san francisco started at just about ten forty five a . m .  pacific standard time .    drake said   i have a suggestion .     go on   said eldridge .    this is an uneducated and unintelligent girl you keep saying that over and over and she s throwing a fit  an epileptic fit  for all i know .     no   said eldridge firmly .    all right  a prophetic fit  if you wish .  she s muttering and mumbling and screaming and doing everything in the world but speaking clearly .  she makes sound which you interpret  and which you make fit together .  if it had occurred to you to hear her say something like  atom bomb   then the word you interpreted as  eldridge  would have become  oak ridge   for instance .     and golden gate .     you might have heard that as  couldn t get  and fitted it in somehow .     not bad   said eldridge .   except that we know that it is hard to understand some of these ecstatics and we are bright enough to make use of modern technology .  we routinely tape record our sessions and we tape recorded this one .  we ve listened to it over and over and there is no question but that she said  eldridge  and not  oak ridge    golden gate  and not  couldn t get .   we ve had different people listen and there is no disagreement on any of this .  besides  from what we heard  we worked out all the details of the fire before we got the facts .  we had to make no modifications afterward .  it all fit exactly .    there was a long silence at the table .   finally eldridge said   well  there it is .  mary foresaw the fire three thousand miles away by a full half hour and got all the facts correct .    drake said uneasily   do you accept it .  do you think it was precognition .     i m trying not to   said eldridge .   but for what reason can i disbelieve it .  i don t want to fool myself into believing it  but what choice have i .  at what point am i fooling myself .  it it wasn t precognition  what was it .  i had hoped that perhaps one of you gentlemen could tell me .    again a silence .   eldridge went on .   i m left in a position where i must refer to sherlock holmes s great precept   when the impossible has been eliminated  then whatever remains  however improbable  is the truth .   in this case  if fakery of any kind is impossible  the precognition must be the truth .  don t you all agree .    the silence was thicker than before  until trumbull cried out   damn it all  henry is grinning .  no one s asked him yet to explain this .  well  henry .    henry coughed .   i should not have smiled  gentlemen  but i couldn t help it when professor eldridge used that quotation .  it seems the final bit of evidence that you gentlemen want to believe .     the hell we do   said rubin  frowning .    surely  then  a quotation from president thomas jefferson would have sprung to mind .     what quotation .   asked halsted .    i imagine mr .  rubin knows   said henry .    i probably do  henry  but at the moment i can t think of an appropriate one .  is it in the declaration of independence .     no  sir   began henry  when trumbull interrupted with a snarl .    let s not play twenty questions  manny .  go on  henry  what are you getting at .     well  sir  to say that when the impossible has been eliminated  whatever remains  however improbable  is the troth  is to make the assumption  usually unjustified  that everything that is to be considered has indeed been considered .  let us suppose we have considered ten factors .  nine are clearly impossible .  is the tenth  however improbable  therefore true .  what if there were an eleventh factor  and a twelfth  and a thirteenth  .  .   .    avalon said severely   you mean there s a factor we haven t considered .     i m afraid so  sir   said henry  nodding .   avalon shook his head .   i can t think what it can be .     and yet it is an obvious factor  sir  the most obvious one .     what is it  then .   demanded halsted  clearly annoyed .   get to the point .     to begin with   said henry   it is clear that to explain the ability of the young lady to foretell  as described  the details of a fire three thousand miles away except by precognition is impossible .  but suppose precognition is also to be considered impossible .  in that case    rubin got to his feet  straggly beard bristling  eyes magnified through thick lensed glasses  staring .   of course .  the fire was set .  the woman could have been coached for weeks .  the accomplice goes to san francicso and they coordinate .  she predicts something she knows is going to happen .  he causes something he knows she will predict .    henry said   are you suggesting  sir  that a confederate would deliberately plan to kill five victims  including an eight year old boy .     don t start trusting in the virtue of mankind  henry   said rubin .   you re the one who is sensitive to wrongdoing .     the minor wrongdoings  sir  the kind most people overlook .  i find it difficult to believe that anyone  in order to establish a fancied case of precognition  would deliberately arrange a horrible multi murder .  besides  to arrange a fire in which eighteen of twenty three people escape and five specific people die requires a bit of precognition in itself .    rubin turned stubborn .   i can see ways in which five people can be trapped  like forcing a card in conjuring     gentlemen .   said eldridge peremptorily  and all turned to look at him .   i have not told you the cause of the fire .    he went on  after looking about the table to make sure he had the attention of all   it was a stroke of lightning .  i don t see how a stroke of lightning could be arranged at a specified time .   he spread out his hands helplessly .   i tell you .  i ve been struggling with this for weeks .  i don t want to accept precognition  but  .  .  .  i suppose this spoils your theory  henry .     on the contrary  professor eldridge  it confirms it and makes it certain .  ever since you began to tell us this tale of mary and the fire  your every word has made it more and more certain that fakery is impossible and that precognition has taken place .  if  however  precognition is impossible  then it follows of necessity  professor  that you have been lying .    not a black widower but exclaimed at that  with avalon s shocked  henry .   loudest of all .   but eldridge was leaning back in his chair  chuckling .   of course i was lying .  from beginning to end .  i wanted to see if all you so called rationalists would be so eager to accept parapsychological phenomena that you would overlook the obvious rather than spoil your own thrill .  when did you catch me out  henry .     it was a possibility from the start  sir  which grew stronger each time you eliminated a solution by inventing more information .  i was certain when you mentioned the lightning .  that was dramatic enough to have been brought in at the beginning .  to be mentioned only at the very end made it clear that you created it on the spot to block the final hope .     but why was it a possibility from the start  henry .   demanded eldridge .   do i look like a liar .  can you detect liars the way i had mary detect shoplifters .     because this is always a possibility and something to be kept in mind and watched for .  that is where the remark by president jefferson comes in .     what was that .     in       professor benjamin silliman of yale reported seeing the fall of a meteorite at a time when the existence of meteorites was not accepted by scientists .  thomas jefferson  a rationalist of enormous talent and intelligence  on hearing the report  said   i would sooner believe that a yankee professor would lie than that a stone would fall from heaven .       yes   said avalon at once   but jefferson was wrong .  silliman did not lie and stones did fall from heaven .     quite so  mr .  avalon   said henry  unruffled .   that is why the quotation is remembered .  but considering the great number of times that impossibilities have been reported  and the small number of times they have been proven possible after all  i felt the odds were with me .     afterword  this story first appeared in the may      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine  under the title i gave it .   i hope that no reader thinks the solution in this tale  isn t fair .   in real life  a great many reports of unconventional phenomena are the results of deviations from the truth  either deliberate or unconscious .  and i am sick and tired of mysteries that end up with some indication that perhaps  after all  something supernatural really did happen .   as far as i am concerned  if  when everything impossible has been eliminated and what remains is supernatural  then someone is lying .  if that be treason  make the most of it .          the pointing finger     it was a rather quiet black widowers banquet until rubin and trumbull had their nose to nose confrontation .   mario gonzalo had been first to arrive  subdued and with the shadow of trouble upon him .   henry was still setting up the table when gonzalo arrived .  he stopped and asked   how are you  sir .   in quiet and unobtrusive concern .   gonzalo shrugged .   all right  i guess .  sorry i missed the last meeting  but i finally decided to go to the police and i wasn t up to much for a while .  i don t know if they can do anything  but it s up to them now .  i almost wish you hadn t told me .     perhaps i ought not to have done so .    gonzalo shrugged .   listen  henry   he said .   i called each of the guys and told him the story .     was that necessary  sir .     i had to .  i d feel constrained if i didn t .  besides  i didn t want them to think you had failed .     not an important consideration  sir .    the others came one by one  and each greeted gonzalo with a hearty welcome that ostentatiously ignored a murdered sister  and each then subsided into a kind of uneasy quiet .   avalon  who was hosting the occasion  seemed  as always  to add the dignity of that office to his natural solemnity .  he sipped at his first drink and introduced his guest  a young man with a pleasant face  thinning black hair  and an amazingly thick mustache which seemed to be waiting only for the necessary change in fashion to be waxed at the end .    this is simon levy   said avalon .   a science writer and a splendid fellow .    emmanuel rubin promptly said   didn t you write a book on the laser  light in step .     yes   said levy with the energetic delight of an author greeting unexpected recognition .   have you read it .    rubin  who was carrying  as he always did  the self conscious soul of a six footer in his five foot four body  looked solemnly at the other through his thick glasses and said   i did  and found it quite good .    levy s smile weakened  as though he considered a judgment of  quite good  no good at all .   avalon said   roger halsted won t be with us today .  he s out of town on something or other .  sends his regrets and says to say hello to mario if he shows up .    trumbull said with his mouth down curved in a sneer   we re spared a limerick .     i missed last month s   said gonzalo .   was it any good .     you wouldn t have understood it  mario   said avalon gravely .    that good  eh .    and then things quieted down to a near whisper until somehow the act of union came up .  afterward  neither rubin nor trumbull could remember exactly how .   trumbull said  in what was considerably more than an ordinary speaking voice   the act of union forming the united kingdom of england  wales  and scotland was made law at the treaty of utrecht in      .     no  it wasn t   said rubin  his straw colored and straggly beard wagging indignantly .   the act was passed in      .     are you trying to tell me  you dumb jackass  that the treaty of utrecht was signed in      .     no  i m not   shouted rubin  his surprisingly loud voice reaching a bellow .   the treaty of utrecht was signed in      .  you guessed that part right  though god only knows how .     if the treaty was signed in       then that settles the act of union .     no  it doesn t  because the treaty had nothing to do with the act of union  which was      .     damn you  five dollars says you don t know the act of union from a union suit .     here s my five dollars .  where s yours .  or can you spare a week s pay at that two bit job you ve got .    they were standing up now  leaning toward each other over james drake  who philosophically added a fresh dollop of sour cream and chives to the last of his baked potato  and finished it .   drake said   no use shouting back and forth  my fellow jackasses .  look it up .     henry .   roared trumbull .   there was the smallest of delays and then henry was at hand with the third edition of the columbia encyclopedia .    host s privilege   said avalon .   i ll check  as an impartial observer .    he turned the pages of the fat volume  muttering   union  union  union  ah  act of .   he then said  almost at once        .  manny wins .  pay up  tom .     what .   cried trumbull  outraged .   let s see that .    rubin quietly picked up the two five dollar bills which had been lying on the table and said in a ruminating voice   a good reference book  the columbia encyclopedia .  best one volume all round reference in the world and more useful than the britannica  even if it does waste an entry on isaac asimov .     on whom .   asked gonzalo .    asimov .  friend of mine .  science fiction writer and pathologically conceited .  he carries a copy of the encyclopedia to parties and says   talking of concrete  the columbia encyclopedia has an excellent article on it only     pages after their article on me .  let me show you .   then he shows them the article on himself .    gonzalo laughed .   sounds a lot like you  manny .     tell him that and he ll kill you if i don t first .    simon levy turned to avalon and said   are there arguments like that all the time here  jeff .         many arguments   said avalon   but they generally don t get to the wager and reference book stage .  when it does happen  henry s prepared .  we have not only the columbia encyclopedia  but copies of the bible  both the king james and the new english  webster s unabridged  second edition  of course  webster s biographical dictionary  webster s geographical dictionary  the guinness book of records  brewer s dictionary of phrase and fable  and the complete works of shakespeare .  it s the black widowers  library and henry is the custodian .  it usually settles all arguments .     i m sorry i asked   said levy .    why .     you mentioned shakespeare and i react to that  right now  with nausea .     to shakespeare .   avalon gazed down at his guest with lofty disapproval .    you bet .  i ve been living with him for two months  reading him backward and forward till one more  why  marry  or  fretful porpentine  and i ll throw up .     really .  well  wait .   .   .   .  henry  is dessert coming up .     directly  sir .  coupe aux marrons .     good .   .   .   .  simon  wait till dessert s finished and we ll carry on .    ten minutes later  avalon placed spoon to water glass and tinkled the assemblage to silence .   host s privilege   he said .   it is time for the usual inquisition  but our honored guest has let it slip that for two months past he has been studying shakespeare with great concentration  and i think this ought to be investigated .  tom  will you do the honors .    trumbull said indignantly   shakespeare .  who the hell wants to talk about shakespeare .   his disposition had not been improved by the loss of five dollars and by the look of unearthly virtue upon rubin s face .    host s privilege   said avalon firmly .    humph .  all right .  mr .  levy  as a science writer  what is your connection with shakespeare .     none  as a science writer .   he spoke with a distinct brooklyn accent .   it s just that i m after three thousand dollars .     in shakespeare .     somewhere in shakespeare .  can t say i ve had any luck  though .     you speak in riddles  levy .  what do you mean three thousand dollars somewhere in shakespeare that you can t find .     oh  well  it s a complicated story .     well  tell it .  that s what we re here for .  it s a longstanding rule that nothing that is said or done in this room is ever repeated outside under any circumstances  so speak freely .  if you get boring  we ll stop you .  don t worry about that .    levy spread out his arms .   all right  but let me finish my tea .     go ahead  henry will bring you another pot  since you aren t civilized enough to drink coffee .   .  .  .  henry .     yes  sir   murmured henry .    don t start till he comes back   said trumbull .   we don t want him to miss any of this .     the waiter .     he s one of us .  best man here .    henry arrived with a new pot of tea and levy said   it s a question of a legacy  sort of .  it s not one of those things where the family homestead is at stake  or millions in jewels  or anything like that .  it s just three thousand dollars which i don t really need  but which would be nice to have .     a legacy from whom .   asked drake .    from my wife s grandfather .  he died two months ago at the age of seventy six .  he d been living with us for five years .  a little troublesome  but he was a nice old guy and  being on my wife s side of the family  she took care of most of it .  he was sort of grateful to us for taking him in .  there were no other descendants and it was either us or a hotel for old people .     get to the legacy   said trumbull  showing some signs of impatience .    grandpa wasn t rich but he had a few thousand .  when he first came to us  he told us that he had bought  three thousand dollars  worth of negotiable bonds and would give them to us when he died .     why when he died .   asked rubin .    i suppose the old guy worried about our getting tired of him .  he held out the three thousand to us as a reward for good behavior .  if he was still with us when he was dying  he would give the bonds to us  and if we kicked him out  he wouldn t .  i guess that was what was in his mind .    levy went on   he hid them in various places .  old guys can be funny .  he d change the hiding place now and then whenever he began to fear we might find them .  of course  we usually did find them before long  but we d never let on and we d never touch them .  except once .  he put them in the clothes hamper and we had to give them back to him and ask him to put them elsewhere  or sooner or later they would get into the washing machine .    that was about the time he had a small stroke no connection  i m sure and after that he was a little harder to handle .  he grew morose and didn t talk much .  he had difficulties in using his right leg and it gave him a feeling of mortality .  after that  he must have hidden the bonds more efficiently  for we lost track of them  though we didn t attach much importance to that .  we assumed he would tell us when he was ready .    then two months ago  little julia  that s my younger daughter  came running to us to tell us that grandpa was lying on the couch and looking funny .  we ran to the living room  and it was obvious that he had had another stroke .  we called the doctor  but it was clear that his right side was gone entirely .  he couldn t speak .  he could move his lips and make sounds  but they came to no words .    he kept moving his left arm and trying to speak and i said   grandpa  are you trying to tell me something .   he could just about tremor his head into a small nod .   about the bonds .   again a small nod .   you want us to have them .   again a nod and his hand began to move as though he were trying to point .    i said   where are they .   his left hand trembled and continued to point .  i couldn t help but say   what are you pointing at  grandpa .   but he couldn t tell me .  his finger just kept pointing in an anxious  quivering way  and his face seemed in agony as he tried to talk and failed .  i was sorry for him .  he wanted to give the bonds to us  to reward us  and he was dying without being able to .    my wife  caroline  was crying and saying   leave him alone  simon   but i couldn t leave him alone .  i couldn t let him die in despair .  i said   we ll have to move the couch toward whatever it is he s pointing to .   caroline didn t want to  but the old man was nodding his head .    caroline got at one end of the couch and i at the other and we moved it  little by little  trying not to jar him .  he was no light weight  either .  his finger kept pointing  always pointing .  he turned his head in the direction in which we were moving him  making moaning sounds as though to indicate whether we were moving him in the right direction or not .  i would say   more to the right  grandpa .    more to the left .   and sometimes he would nod .    finally  we got him up against the line of bookcases  and slowly his head turned .  i wanted to turn it for him  but i was afraid to harm him .  he managed to get it round and stared at the books for a long time .  then his finger moved along the line of books till it pointed toward one particular book .  it was a copy of the complete works oj shakespeare  the kittredge edition .    i said   shakespeare  grandpa .   he didn t answer  he didn t nod  but his face relaxed and he stopped trying to speak .  i suppose he didn t hear me .  something like a half smile pulled at the left side of his mouth and he died .  the doctor came  the body was taken away  we made arrangements for the funeral .  it wasn t till after the funeral that we went back to the shakespeare .  we figured it would wait for us and it didn t seem right to grab for it before we took care of the old man .    i assumed there would be something in the shakespeare volume to tell us where the bonds were  and that s when the first shock came .  we turned through every page   one by one  and there was nothing there .  not a scrap of paper .  not a word .    gonzalo said   what about the binding .  you know  in between the stuff that glues the pages and the backstrip .     nothing there .     maybe someone took it .     how .  the only ones who knew were myself and caroline .  it isn t as though there were any robbery .  eventually  we thought there was a clue somewhere in the book  in the written material  in the plays themselves  you know .  that was caroline s idea .  in the last two months  i ve read every word of shakespeare s plays  every word of his sonnets and miscellaneous poems twice over .  i ve gotten nowhere .     the hell with shakespeare   said trumbull querulously .   forget the clue .  he had to leave them somewhere in the house .     why do you suppose that .   said levy .   he might have put it in a bank vault for all we know .  he got around even after his first stroke .  after we found the bonds in the clothes hamper  he might have thought the house wasn t safe .     all right  but he still might have put them in the house somewhere .  why not just search .     we did .  or at least caroline did .  that was how we divided the labor .  she searched the house  which is a big  rambling one  one reason we could take in grandpa  and i searched shakespeare  and we both came out with nothing .    avalon untwisted a thoughtful frown and said   see here  there s no reason we can t be logical about this .  i assume  simon  that your grandfather was born in europe .     yes .  he came to america as a teen ager  just as world war i was starting .  he got out just in time .     he didn t have much of a formal education  i suppose .     none at all   said levy .   he went to work in a tailor shop  eventually got his own establishment  and stayed a tailor till he retired .  no education at all  except for the usual religious education jews gave each other in tsarist russia .     well  then   said avalon   how do you expect him to indicate clues in shakespeare s plays .  he wouldn t know anything about them .    levy frowned and leaned back in his chair .  he hadn t touched the small brandy glass henry had put in front of him some time before .  now he picked it up  twirled the stem gently in his fingers  and put it down again .    you re quite wrong  jeff   he said  a little distantly .   he may have been uneducated but he was quite intelligent and quite well read .  he knew the bible by heart  and he d read war and peace as a teen ager .  he read shakespeare  too .  listen  we once went to see a production of hamlet in the park and he got more out of it than i did .    rubin suddenly broke in energetically   i have no intention of ever seeing hamlet again till they get a hamlet who looks as hamlet is supposed to look .  fat .     fat .   said trumbull indignantly .    yes  fat .  the queen says of hamlet in the last scene   he s fat  and scant of breath .   if shakespeare says hamlet is fat     that s his mother talking  not shakespeare .  it s the typical motherly oversolicitousness of a not bright woman    avalon banged the table .   not now  gentlemen .    he turned to levy .   in what language did your grandfather read the bible .     in hebrew  of course   levy said coldly .    and war and peace .     in russian .  but shakespeare  if you don t mind  he read in english .     which is not his native tongue .  i imagine he spoke with an accent .    levy s coolness had descended into the frigid .   what are you getting at  jeff .    avalon harumphed .   i m not being anti semitic .  i m just pointing out the obvious fact that if your wife s grandfather was not at home with the language  there was  a limit to how subtly he could use shakespeare as a reference .  he s not likely to use the phrase  and there the an tick sits  from richard ii because  however well read he is  he isn t likely to know what an antick is .     what is it .   asked gonzalo .    never mind   said avalon impatiently .   if your grandfather used shakespeare  it would have to be some perfectly obvious reference .     what was your father s favorite play .   asked trum bull .    he liked hamlet of course .  i know he didn t like the comedies   said levy   because he felt the humor undignified  and the histories meant nothing to him .  wait  he liked othello .     all right   said avalon .   we ought to concentrate on hamlet and othello .     i read them   said levy .   you don t think i left them out  do you .     and it would have to be some well known passage   avalon went on  paying no attention .   no one would think that just pointing to shakespeare would be a useful hint if it were some obscure line that were intended .     the only reason he just pointed   said levy   was that he couldn t talk .  it might have been something very obscure which he would have explained if he could have talked .     if he could have talked   said drake reasonably   he wouldn t have had to explain anything .  he would just have told you where the bonds were .     exactly   said avalon .   a good point  jim .  you said  simon  that after the old man pointed to shakespeare  his face relaxed and he stopped trying to speak .  he felt that he had given you all you needed to know .     well  he didn t   said levy morosely .    let s reason it out  then   said avalon .    do we have to .   said drake .   why not ask henry now .   .   .   .  henry  which verse in shakespeare would suit our purpose .    henry  who was noiselessly taking up the dessert dishes  said   i have an average knowledge of the plays of shakespeare  sir  but i must admit that no appropriate verse occurs to me .    drake looked disappointed  but avalon said   come on  jim .  henry has done very well on past occasions but there s no need to feel that we are helpless without him .  i flatter myself i know shakespeare pretty well .    i m no novice  either   said rubin .   then between the two of us  let s solve this .  suppose we consider hamlet first .  if it s hamlet  then it has to be one of the soliloquies  because they re the best known portions of the play .     in fact   said rubin   the line  to be or not to be  that is the question  is the best known line of shakespeare .  it epitomizes him as the  quartet  from rigoletto typifies opera .     i agree   said avalon   and that soliloquy talks of dying  and the old man was dying .   to die  to sleep  no more  and by a sleep to say we end the heart ache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is       yes  but what good does that do .   said levy impatiently .   where does it get us .    avalon  who always recited shakespeare in what he insisted was shakespearean pronunciation  which sounded remarkably like an irish brogue   said   well  i m not sure .    gonzalo said suddenly   is it in hamlet where shakespeare says   the play s the thing  .     yes   said avalon .     the play s the thing wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king .       well   said gonzalo   if the old man was pointing out a book of plays  maybe that s the line .  do you have a picture of a king  or a carving  or a deck of cards  maybe .    levy shrugged .   that doesn t bring anything to mind .    what about othello .   asked rubin .   listen .  the best known part of the play is iago s speech on reputation   good name in man and woman  dear my lord  .  .  .      so .   said avalon .    and the most famous line in it  and one which the old man was sure to know because it s the one everyone knows  even mario  is  who steals my purse steals trash   tis something  nothing   twas mine   tis his  .   .   .   and so on .     so .   said avalon again .    so it sounds as though it applies to the legacy .     twas mine   tis his   and it also sounds as though the legacy were gone .   who steals my purse steals trash .      what do you mean   gone  .   said levy .    after you found the bonds in the clothes hamper  you lost track of them  you said .  maybe the old man took them off somewhere to be safe and doesn t remember where .  or maybe he mislaid them or gave them away or lost them to some confidence scheme .  whatever it was  he could no longer explain it to you without speech .  so to die in peace  he pointed to the works of shakespeare .  you would remember the best known line of his favorite play  which tells you that his purse is only trash and that is why you have found nothing .     i don t believe that   said levy .   i asked him if he wanted us to have the bonds and he nodded .     all he could do was nod  and he did want you to have them  but that was impossible .   .  .  .  do you agree with me  henry .    henry  who had completed his tasks and was quietly listening  said   i m afraid i don t  mr .  rubin .     i don t  either   said levy .   but gonzalo was snapping his fingers .   wait  wait .  doesn t shakespeare say anything about bonds .     not in his time   said drake  smilmg .    i m sure of it   said gonzalo .   something about bonds being nominated .    avalon said   ah .  you mean  is it so nominated in the bond .   the bond is a legal contract  and the question was whether something was a requirement of the contract .    drake said   wait a bit .  didn t that bond involve a sum of three thousand ducats .     by heaven  so it did   said avalon .   gonzalo s grin split his head from ear to ear .   i think i ve got something there  bonds involving three thousand units of money .  that s the play to look into .    henry interrupted softly .   i scarcely think so  gentlemen .  the play in question is the merchant oj venice and the person asking whether something was nominated in the bond was the jew  shylock  intent on a cruel revenge .  surely the old man would not enjoy this play .    levy said   that s right .  shylock was a dirty word to him  and not so clean to me  either .    rubin said   what about the passage that goes   hath not a jew eyes .  hath not a jew hands  organs  dimensions  senses  affections  passions  .  .   .   .     it wouldn t appeal to my grandfather   said levy .   it pleads the obvious and cries out for an equality my grandfather would not  in his heart  be willing to grant  since i m sure he felt superior in that he was a member of god s uniquely chosen .    gonzalo looked disappointed .   it seems we re not getting anywhere .    levy said   no  i don t think we are .  i went through the entire book .  i read all the speeches carefully  all the passages you mentioned .  none of them meant anything to me .    avalon said   granted they don t  but you may be missing something subtle     come on  jeff  you re the one who said it couldn t be subtle .  my grandfather was thinking of something tailored for the mind of myself and my wife .  it was something we would get  and probably get at once  and we didn t .    drake said   maybe you re right .  maybe some in joke is involved .     i ve just said that .     then why don t you try it backward .  can you think of something  some gag  some phrase .   .  .  .  is there some expression he used every time .     yes .  when he disapproved of someone he would say   eighteen black years on him .       what kind of an expression is that .   asked trumbull .    in yiddish it s common enough   said levy .   another one was  it will help him like a dead man cups .       what does that mean .   asked gonzalo .   it refers to cupping .  you place a lighted piece of paper in a small ro und glass cup and then put the open edge against the skin .  the paper goes out but leaves a partial vacuum in the cup and circulation is sucked into the superficial layers .  naturally  cupping can t improve the circulation of a corpse .     all right   said drake   is there anything about eighteen black years  or about cupping dead men  that reminds you of something in shakespeare .    there was a painful silence and finally avalon said   i can t think of anything .     and even if you did   said levy   what good would it do .  what would it mean .  listen  i ve been at this for two months .  you re not going to solve it for me in two hours .    drake turned to henry again and said   why are you just standing there  henry .  can t you help us .     i m sorry  dr .  drake  but i now believe that the whole question of shakespeare is a false lead .     no   said levy .   you can t say that .  the old man pointed to the collected works without any question .  his fingertip was within an inch of it .  it couldn t have been any other book .    drake said suddenly   say  levy  you re not diddling us  are you .  you re not telling us a pack of lies to make jackasses out of us .     what .   said levy in amazement .    nothing  nothing   said avalon hastily .   he s just thinking of another occasion .  shut up  jim .     listen   said levy .   i m telling you exactly what happened .  he was pointing exactly at shakespeare .    there was a short silence and then henry sighed and said   in mystery stories    rubin broke in with a  hear .  hear .     in mystery stories   henry repeated   the dying hint is a common device  but i have never been able to take it seriously .  a dying man  anxious to give last minute information  is always pictured as presenting the most complex hints .  his dying brain  with two minutes  grace  works out a pattern that would puzzle a healthy brain with hours to think .  in this particular case  we have an old man dying of a paralyzing stroke who is supposed to have quickly invented a clue that a group of intelligent men have failed to work out  and with one of them having worked at it for two months .  i can only conclude there is no such clue .     then why should he have pointed to shakespeare  henry .   asked levy .   was it all just the vague delusions of a dying man .     if your story is correct   said henry   then i think he was indeed trying to do something .  he cannot  however  have been inventing a clue .  he was doing the only thing his dying mind could manage .  he was pointing to the bonds .     i beg your pardon   said levy huffily .   i was there .  he was pointing to shakespeare .    henry shook his head .  he said   mr .  levy  would you point to fifth avenue .    levy thought a while  obviously orienting himself  and then pointed .    are you pointing to fifth avenue .   asked henry .    well  the restaurant s entrance is on fifth avenue  so i m pointing to it .     it seems to me  sir   said henry   that you are pointing to a picture of the arch of titus on the western wall of this room .     well  i am  but fifth avenue is beyond it .     exactly  sir .  so i only know that you are pointing to fifth avenue because you tell me so .  you might be pointing to the picture or to some point in the air before the picture  or to the hudson river  or to chicago  or to the planet jupiter .  if you point  and nothing more  giving no hint  verbal or otherwise  as to what you re pointing at  you are only indicating a direction and nothing more .    levy rubbed his chin .   you mean my grandfather was only indicating a direction .     it must be so .  he didn t say he was pointing to shakespeare .  he merely pointed .     all right  then  what was he pointing at .  the the   he closed his eyes and fingered his mustache gently  as he oriented the room in his house .   the verrazano bridge .     probably not  sir   said henry .   he was pointing in the direction of the collected works .  his finger was an inch from it  you said  so it is doubtful that he could be pointing at anything in front of it .  what was behind the book  mr .  levy .     the bookcase .  the wood of the bookcase .  and when you took the book out  there was nothing behind it .  there was nothing pushed up against the wood  if that s what you have in mind .  we would have seen it at once if any thing at all had been there .     and behind the bookcase  sir .     the wall .     and between the bookcase and the wall  sir .    now levy fell silent .  he thought a while  and no one interrupted those thoughts .  he said   is there a phone i can use  henry .     i ll bring you one  sir .    the phone was placed in front of levy and plugged in .  levy dialed a number .    hello  julia .  what are you doing up so late .   .   .   .  never mind the tv and get to bed .  but first call mamma  dear .   .   .   .  hello  caroline  it s simon .   .   .   .  yes  i m having a good time  but listen  caroline  listen .  you know the bookcase with the shakespeare in it .   .  .  .  yes  that shakespeare .  of course .  move it away from the wall .   .   .   .  the bookcase .   .   .   .  look  you can take the books out of it  can t you .  take them all out  if you have to  and dump them on the floor .   .   .   .  no  no  just move the end of the bookcase near the door a few inches  just enough to look behind and tell me if you see anything .   .   .   .  look about where the shakespeare book would be .   .   .   .  i ll wait  yes .    they were all frozen in attitudes .  levy was distinctly pale .  some five minutes passed .  then   caroline .   .   .   .  okay  take it easy .  did you move  .   .   .   .  okay  okay  i ll be home soon .    he hung up and said   if that doesn t beat everything .  the old guy had them taped to the back of the bookcase .  he must have moved that thing sometime when we were out .  it s a wonder he didn t have a stroke then and there .     you did it again  henry   said gonzalo .   levy said   agent s fee is three hundred dollars  henry .    henry said   i am well paid by the club  and the banquets are my pleasure  sir .  there is no need for more .    levy reddened slightly and changed the subject .   but how did you get the trick of it .  when the rest of us     it was not difficult   said henry .   the rest of you happened to track down all the wrong paths  and i simply suggested what was left .     afterword  this story first appeared in the july      issue of el lery queen s mystery magazine  under the title i gave it .   in the magazine the story has a slightly different beginning because it was thought that one story in the series shouldn t refer to events in earlier stories .  after all  the reasoning is  many of the magazine readers don t get all the issues and might not have read the one with the earlier story .  or if they did  and if that had been half a year ago or so  they wouldn t remember .   that s perfectly right  but here in the book i restore the original beginning .  in fact  it occurs to me that if i had written the series for the book version to begin with  i would have interlocked them quite a bit .  for instance  i wouldn t have let the matter of halsted s limerick version of the iliad and the odyssey drop .  as it was though  i felt that to come across them out of order  or missing some and reading others  would spoil the effect .   oh  well .          miss what .      there was a certain frostiness about the monthly meeting of the black widowers and it clearly centered on the guest brought by mario gonzalo .  he was a large man .  his cheeks were plump and smooth  his hair was almost nonexistent  and he wore a vest  something no one had seen at the black widowers in living memory .   his name was aloysius gordon and the trouble began when he calmly introduced himself by name and occupation  announcing himself quite casually as being connected with the   th precinct .  it was like lowering a window shade against the sun  for the spark went out of the dinner at once .   gordon had no way of comparing the quiet now prevailing with the hubbub characteristic of the usual black widowers dinner .  he had no way of knowing how unusual it was that emmanuel rubin was almost supernaturally reserved and had not contradicted anyone once  that thomas trumbull s voice  even when it was used  was subdued  that geoffrey avalon actually finished his second drink  that twice james drake had stubbed out a cigarette before it was down to the quick  and that roger halsted  having unfolded the piece of paper on which he had written the limerick based on the fifth book of the iliad  merely looked at it mildly  wrinkled his high  pink forehead  and put it away .   in fact  gordon seemed interested only in henry .  he followed the waiter with his eyes  and there was an unmistakable light of curiosity in them .  henry  ordinarily perfect in his job  upset a glass of water  to the horror of all .  his cheekbones seemed to show in his unlined face .   trumbull rose rather ostentatiously and moved in the direction of the men s room .  the gesture he made was unobtrusive but none the less urgent for that  and a minute later gonzalo left the table  too .   in the men s room  trumbull said in a harsh whisper   why the hell did you bring that fellow .     he s an interesting guy   said gonzalo defensively   and it s host s privilege .  i can bring anyone i want .     he s a policeman .     he s a plainclothesman .     what s the difference .  do you know him  or is he here professionally .    gonzalo raised his hands in a kind of helpless anger .  his dark eyes bulged as they usually did in moments of passion .   i know him personally .  i met him it s none of your business how i met him  tom i know him .  he s an interesting guy and i want him here .     yes .  what did you tell him about henry .     what do you mean  what did i tell .     oh  come on  you dumb jerk .  don t play games .  haven t you seen the guy watching henry s every move .  why should he watch a waiter .     i told him henry s a whiz at solving puzzles .     in how much detail .     no detail at all   said gonzalo with heat .   don t you suppose i know that nothing that goes on in the banquet room is mentioned outside .  i just said henry was a whiz at solving puzzles .     and he was interested  i suppose .     well  he said he would like to be at one of our meetings and i    trumbull said   you realize this could be very embarrassing for henry .  did you consult him .    gonzalo played with one of the brass buttons of his blazer .   if i see that henry s embarrassed  i ll use host s privilege and cut the proceedings .     what if this gordon guy doesn t play along .    gonzalo looked miserable and shrugged .  they returned to the table .   when henry was pouring out the coffee and it came time for the game of placing the guest on the griddle  there was still no increase in verve .  gonzalo offered the role of inquisitor to trumbull  as was traditional  and trumbull looked unhappy about it .   the traditional first question came out .   mr .  gordon  how do you justify your existence .     at the moment   said gordon  in a rather rich baritone   by adding to the pleasure of this occasion  i hope .     in what way .   asked avalon glumly .    it is my understanding  gentlemen   said gordon   that guests are expected to pose a problem which the members of the club then attempt to solve .    trumbull shot a furious glance at gonzalo and said   no  no  that s all wrong .  some guests have presented problems  but that was more or less a side issue .  all that s expected of them is interesting conversation .     besides   said drake in his dry voice   it s henry who does the solving .  the rest of us just bat things around foolishly .     for god s sake  jim   began trumbull  but gordon s voice overrode his .    that s exactly what i ve been given to understand   he said .   now i am here in a strictly social capacity and not as a member of the police department at all .  just the same  i can t help having a professional interest in the matter .  in fact  i m damned curious about henry  and i ve come to test him .   .  .  .  if i may  that is   he added in response to the cold silence that had fallen over everyone else .   avalon was frowning  and on his face  with its neat mustache  its closely cut and neatly kept chin beard  and its absolutely luxurious eyebrows  a frown was a portentous phenomenon .   he said   mr .  gordon  this is a private club  the meetings of which serve no purpose but social camaraderie .  henry is our waiter and we value him and we do not wish him to be disturbed in this room .  if your presence here is purely social and not professional  as you say  i think it would be best if we leave henry to himself .    henry had just completed the coffee ritual and he interrupted with the faintest trace of agitation in his voice .  he said   thank you  mr .  avalon .  i appreciate your concern .  however  it may improve the situation if i explain something to mr .  gordon .    he turned to the guest and went on earnestly   mr .  gordon  on some half dozen occasions i have been able to make some obvious point or other in connection with some problem that arose at the dinners .  the puzzles were  in themselves  trivial  and not at all the sort that would interest a policeman .  i know quite well that in solving the kind of cases that interest policemen  what is most important are records  informants  rather tedious procedural work  the cooperation of many different men and agencies .  all of this is quite beyond my abilities .    in fact  i could not even do what i have done were it not for the other members of the club .  the black widowers are ingenious men who can find complicated answers to any problem .  when they are all done then  assuming none of the complicated answers are correct  i can sometimes wiggle past the complications to the simple truth .  that is all i do  and i assure you that it is not worth your while to test me .    gordon nodded his head .   in other words  henry  if there s a gangland killing and we have to track down half a dozen hoods and investigate their alibis  or try to find some bystanders not too afraid to tell us what they saw  you couldn t help us .     not at all  sir .     but if i have an odd piece of paper that carries some words that might make sense and might not  and that may require a little thought past the complications to the simple truth  you could help .     probably not  sir .     but would you look at the paper and give me your thoughts on the matter .     is that the test  sir .     i suppose we can call it that   said gordon .    well  then   said henry  with a slow shake of his head .   mr .  gonzalo is the host .  if he s willing to have you introduce it  then  by the rules of the club  you may .    gonzalo looked uncomfortable .  then he said defiantly   go on  lieutenant  show it to him .     hold on   said trumbull  pointing his blunt finger at gonzalo .   have you seen it  mario .     yes .     can you make sense out of it .     no   said gonzalo   but it s the kind of thing henry might be able to handle .    rubin said   i don t think we ought to put henry on the spot like that .    but henry said   it s host s privilege  sir .  i m willing to look at it .    gordon brought a piece of paper  folded into quarters  out of his upper right vest pocket .  he held it over his shoulder and henry took it .  henry looked at it for a moment  then handed it back .    i m sorry  sir   he said   but i cannot see anything in it except what it says .    drake held out his hand .   how about passing it around .  is that all right  mr .  gordon .     i m willing to pass it around   said gordon .  he gave it to halsted  who sat at his right .  halsted read it and passed it on .  there was absolute silence till it had made its circle and returned to gordon .  gordon glanced at it briefly and put it back in his pocket .   the message  in full  written in a scrawled hand  went    woe unto you  jezebels .   death unto you  rahab .    it sounds biblical   said gonzalo .   doesn t it .   he looked automatically at rubin  who was the biblical authority of the group .    it sounds biblical   said rubin   and it may have been written by a bible nut  but that is not a quotation from the bible .  you can take my word on that .     no one s likely to question your word on the bible  manny   said avalon agreeably .   gordon said   that note was delivered to a girl at the entrance to a restaurant within which the miss earth contestants were holding a press conference .     who delivered it .   asked trumbull .    a drifter .  he had been given a dollar to hand the note to the girl and he couldn t describe the person who had given it to him  except that it was a man .  there is no reason to suppose the drifter was more than an intermediary .  we checked him out .    halsted said   any fingerprints .    gordon said   any number of superimposed smudges .  nothing useful .    avalon looked austere and said   i suppose that the jezebels mentioned in the note referred to the young ladies of the miss earth contest .     that seems a natural thought   said gordon .   the question is  which one .     all of them  i should say   said avalon .   the note used the plural  and the kind of person who uses the term in this context would not make fine distinctions .  anyone who presents her beauty to the public gaze for judgment would be a jezebel .  all of them would be jezebels .     but what about the second phrase .   asked gordon .   rubin said  with just a trace of self importance   i ll explain that .  suppose the writer is a bible nut  i mean the kind who reads the bible every day and hears god whispering in his ear  directing him to destroy immorality .  such a guy would automatically write in biblical style .  it so happens that the chief poetic device in biblical times was the repetition of the same sentence in a slightly different way  such as  .   .   .   he thought for a while  then said   for instance  how goodly are thy tents  o jacob  and thy tabernacles  o israel .  another one is hear my words  o ye wise men  and give ear unto me  ye that have knowledge .    rubin s straggly beard grew stragglier as his lips parted in a broad smile and his eyes glinted through his thick spectacles as he said   that second one is from the book of job .     parallelism   muttered avalon .   gordon said   you mean he s just saying the same thing twice .     that s right   said rubin .   first he predicts woe and then he predicts the ultimate woe  death .  first he calls them jezebels  then he calls them rahabs .     not quite   said gordon .     jezebel  is in the plural .   rahab  isn t .  the fellow who wrote that speaks of  jezebels   plural  when he yells  woe   but only  rahab   singular  when he predicts  death .       can i see that paper again .   said rubin .  it was passed to him and he studied it .  then he said   the way this fellow writes  i don t know whether we can expect exact spelling .  he may have meant to put in the  s .       he may have   said gordon   but we can t rely on that .  his spelling and punctuation are correct and  scrawl or not  the other  s  is clear and sharp     it seems to me   said avalon   it would be safer to assume the singular is what is meant  unless we have good reason to the contrary .    drake tried to blow a smoke ring  an attempt at which no one had ever seen him succeed  and said   do you take this thing seriously  mr .  gordon .     my private inclinations   said gordon   are not in question .  the note has a certain psychotic quality about it and i feel pretty safe in saying that if the writer is not playing a stupid practical joke  then he s crazy .  and crazy people have to be taken seriously .  suppose the writer is someone who considers himself a spokesman for the wrath of god .  naturally  he announces it  he sends for the word of god because that s what the biblical prophets did .     and he announces it in poetic terms   began halsted .    because that s what the biblical prophets did  too   said gordon  nodding .   a man like that may just possibly decide to be the arm of god as well as his voice .  we can t take a chance .  you understand that the miss earth contest offers a more ticklish situation than the miss america contest does .     because there are foreign contestants  i suppose   said rubin .    that s right .  there are about sixty contestants altogether  and exactly one miss united states is homegrown .  we d just as soon nothing happened to any of them  even a minor incident .  i don t say that it would plunge the world into a crisis if anything happened  but the state department would be very unhappy .  so a note like this means that the police have to supply protection for all sixty girls and these days we don t have all that manpower to waste .     if you don t mind   said trumbull frowning   what the hell do you expect us to do about it .    gordon said   it s just possible he may not be planning to kill all the girls .  he may have only one in mind  so that is why he uses the singular when he talks of death .  perhaps henry might give us some ideas as to how to narrow it down .  we d rather concentrate on ten girls than on sixty .  we d rather concentrate on one girl only  in fact .     from that note .   said trumbull  with perfectly obvious disgust .   you want henry to pick out one miss earth contestant from that note .    he turned to look at henry  and henry said   i have no idea  mr .  trumbull .    gordon put the note away again .   i thought you might tell me who rahab is .  why should he call one particular girl rahab and threaten to kill her .    gonzalo said suddenly   why should we suppose that rahab applies to the girl he s after .  maybe it s his signature .  maybe it s a pseudonym he s using because rahab was some important prophet or executioner in the bible .    rubin let out his breath in a snort .   oh  boy .  mario  how can even an artist know so little .   rahab  is part of the line .  if it were the signature  he would put it on the bottom .  if he s the kind of guy who wants to call down the wrath of god in public  he would sign it proudly and unmistakably if he signed it at all .  and if he did  he would never take the pseudonym of rahab  not if he knew anything at all about the bible .  rahab was  .   .   .  no  i tell you what .  henry  get us the king james from the reference shelf .  we might as well make sure we get the words exactly right .     you mean you don t know the bible by heart .   said trambull .    i miss a word now and then  tom   said rubin loftily .   he took the bible from henry .   thanks  henry .  now the only person named rahab in the bible was a harlot .     she was .   said gonzalo incredulously .    that s right .  here it is first verse of the second chapter of the book of joshua .  and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spy secretly  saying  go view the land  even jericho .  and they went  and came into an harlot s house  named rahab  and lodged there .     and that s part of the parellelism   said avalon thoughtfully .   is that what you think .     of course .  and that s why i think  jezebel  and  rahab  both apply to all the girls and should both be plural .  both jezebel and rahab are biblical representatives of immoral women  and i take it that our note writer  whoever he may be  conceives all the miss earth candidates to be just that .     are they .   asked gonzalo .   i mean  immoral .    gordon smiled slightly .   i won t guarantee their private lives  but i don t think they set any records in immorality .  they re young women  carefully selected to represent their countries .  i doubt that anything really notorious would slip by the judges .    avalon said   when a fundamentalist who s a little past the bend speaks of immorality  or when he starts calling someone a jezebel  there is no need  in my opinion  for the existence of real immorality .  it s probably purely subjective .  any woman who rouses feelings of sexual excitement within him will seem to him to be immoral  and the one who does so most will seem to him to be most immoral .     you mean   said gordon  swiveling his eyes toward  avalon   that he s after the most beautiful one and aims to kill her .    avalon shrugged .   what s beauty .  he may be after the one he thinks is most beautiful  but what are his standards .  it might not even be beauty in the most literal sense .  it might be that one of them reminds him of his dead mother  his childhood sweetheart  or some teacher he once had .  how can we tell .     all right   said gordon .   you may be quite correct in all you say  but it doesn t matter .  tell me who he s after  tell me who rahab is  and we can worry about motives afterward .    avalon shook his head .   i don t know that we can dismiss motive quite that easily  but  in any case  we won t get anywhere if we head down the wrong path .  despite what manny says  i don t think there s any parallelism between jezebel and rahab .     there certainly is   said rubin  his jaw lifting at once .    where is it .  to begin with  jezebel wasn t a harlot .  she was the queen of israel and there is no hint in the bible that she was in any way sexually immoral .  it s just that she was an idolator and opposed the yahvists  that is  those who worshipped yahveh or jehovah  to use the more common but less accurate name .    rubin said   i ll explain it to you  if you want .  jezebel was the daughter of the king of tyre  who was also a priest of astarte .  she was probably a priestess herself .  as for rahab  she was probably not a common harlot  but a priestess who participated in fertility rites .  to the israelites that was being a harlot .    halsted said   not everybody has gone into the bible the way you have  manny .  the bible calls jezebel a queen and rahab a harlot  and the average reader wouldn t go past that .     but that s not the point i m trying to make   said avalon .   jezebel  whatever her status  came to a bad end .  she died in a palace coup and was eaten by dogs .  rahab  however  came to a good end .  she was saved alive after the fall of jericho  because she had kept the spies hidden and safe .  one can assume she was converted to the worship of the god of israel and was no longer a harlot or a pagan priestess .  in fact  .   .   .  manny  let me have the bible .    avalon took it and turned its pages rapidly .   it s just at the opening of the book of matthew .  here it is  and salmon begat booz of rachab  and booz begat obed of ruth  and obed begat jesse  and jesse begat david the king .  there  that s the fifth and sixth verse of the first chapter of the gospel of st .  matthew .  according to that  rahab married a prominent israelite and was the great great grandmother of david and therefore a distant ancestress of jesus himself .  having helped the israelites take jericho  having married an israelite  and being the ancestress of david and jesus  rahab couldn t possibly be used as a symbol of immorality by any fundamentalist .    the bible passed from hand to hand  and halsted said   the name isn t spelled the same .  it s  rachab  in matthew .    avalon said   the new testament is translated into english from the greek  the old testament from the hebrew .  the transliterations aren t consistent .   booz  in the passage i just read is  boaz  in the old testament book of ruth .     besides   said rubin   in this case  rachab  is more nearly the correct spelling .  the hebrew letter that occurs in the middle of the name is correctly pronounced like the guttural german  ch .      so if we are going to associate rahab with one of the miss earth contestants   said avalon   we had better forget about the parallelism with jezebel and look for something else .     but what .   asked drake .    don t worry .   avalon lifted an admonitory finger .   i have something in mind .  manny  isn t  rahab  used in the bible as the poetic equivalent of egypt .    rubin said excitedly   yes  you re right .  it s not the same word in hebrew .  there the middle letter is an  h .   still  it s the same word in english .  usually it s translated into  pride  or  might  or something like that  but it s left untranslated in at least one place .   .   .   .  somewhere in the psalms  i think .    he turned the pages and muttered   i wish we had a bible dictionary .  that s something the club ought to buy and add to the reference shelf .   then  with his voice rising to a shout  he said   here it is  by god .  fourth verse of the   th psalm    will make mention of rahab and babylon to them that know me  behold philistia  and tyre  with ethiopia .     how do you know that  rahab  means egypt there .   asked gonzalo .    because throughout old testament history the rival great powers were those in the tigris euphrates valley and on the nile .  babylon clearly typifies the former  so rahab must typify the latter .  there s no dispute there .  biblical scholars agree that  rahab  stands for egypt there .     in that case   said avalon   i don t think we have to fall back on henry .  i suspect that it s miss egypt that our mysterious friend is after .  and that makes sense  too .  there are a couple of million jewish people in this city and considering the present situation between israel and egypt  one of them  with a little derangement  might feel called upon to threaten miss egypt .    gordon said   an interesting thought .  there s only one trouble .     what s that  sir .     there isn t any miss egypt .  you see  the miss earth contest isn t as cut and dried as the miss america contest .  in the miss america you have one contestant from each of the fifty states because foreign policy doesn t enter into it .  in the miss earth contest  nations hostile to the united states  or those which look down on beauty contests as decadent  don t enter .  this year  no arab state is represented .  on the other hand  some nations are represented by more than one entry  each with a different name .  some years ago  i understand  there were two german beauties .  the top winner went as miss germany and the second went as miss bavaria .    avalon looked distinctly annoyed .   if there s no miss egypt  then i don t know what  rahab  can mean .     what does it mean in the bible .   asked gonzalo .   why do they give that name to egypt .  there has to be some reason .    rubin said   oh  well .  egypt was a river kingdom and rahab was associated with the waters .  in fact  it was a mythological remnant of a pre israelite creation myth .  the land was viewed by the sumerians as having been created from the sea .  they visualized the sea as an enormous monster called tiamat that had to be split in two so that the land emerged from between the halves .  in babylonian mythology  it was marduk who killed tiamat .    the priestly writers of the first book of genesis cleaned up the babylonian myths and removed the polytheism  but they left traces .  in the beginning  before the first day of creation  according to chapter    verse   of genesis  and the earth was without form and void  and darkness was upon the face of the deep .  and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters .  well  the hebrew word translated as  the deep  is  tehom  and some commentators think that is a version of tiamat and that this verse is all that is left of the cosmic struggle .     that s pretty farfetched   said drake .    i don t know .  there are occasional verses in the bible which seem to refer to the earlier and less sophisticated creation myth .  there s one toward the end of isaiah  if i can find it .   .  .  .  i used to know where all these references are .    he turned pages back and forth feverishly  ignoring the small glass of brandy henry had placed before him .  gordon sipped at his own brandy and watched calmly .  he made no attempt to stop rubin or to attempt to bring the discussion back to the point .   it was trumbull who said   is this getting us anywhere .    but rubin waved excitedly .   i ve got it .  i ve got it .  listen to this  isaiah  chapter     verse    awake  awake  put on strength  o arm of the lord  awake  as in the ancient days  in the generations of old .  art thou not it  that hath cut rahab and wounded the dragon .  you see   cut rahab  and  wounded the dragon  is another example of parallelism .  rahab and the dragon are alternate expressions that symbolize the raging ocean that has to be defeated and split before dry land can be formed .  some commentators maintain this refers to egypt and the division of the red sea  but in my opinion it is certainly a version of the fight with tiamat .    there was perspiration on rubin s forehead and he kept waving his left hand for silence  even while his right hand continued to turn pages .   there are references to it in the psalms  too .  i can find them if you ll give me a minute .  ah .  psalm     verses   and     thou rulest the raging of the sea  when the waves thereof arise  thou stillest them .  thou hast broken rahab in pieces  as one that is slain .  and then another one  psalm     verses    and     thou didst divide the sea by thy strength  thou bra kest the heads of the dragons in the waters .  thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces .  leviathan was another name for the primeval ocean .    trumbull shouted   god damn it  manny .  you re not a revivalist preacher any more .  where s this all getting us .    rubin looked up indignantly and closed the bible .   if you ll let me talk  tom   he said  with exaggerated dignity   and curb your impulse to bellow  i ll tell you .    he looked about impressively .   i now suspect that to the fellow who wrote this note  rahab meant the raging power of the sea .  now what is the raging power of the sea today .  who controls the sea .  the united states does .  with our aircraft carriers  our nuclear submarines  our polaris missiles  we have the power of rahab .  i think maybe he s after miss united states .     is that so .   said halsted .   the united states has been the predominant sea power only since world war ii .  it hasn t had time to enter legend .  it s great britain that s the ruler of the sea in song and story .   britannia rules the waves .   i vote for miss great britain .    gordon interposed .   there s no miss great britain .  there s a miss england  though .     all right .  i vote for miss england .    drake said   there s no way of getting into this nut s head .  maybe he was just using the name to indicate his method of operation .  rubin said  brakest the head  and  broken in pieces  when he read those verses .  maybe the writer meant he was going to use a blunt instrument .    rubin shook his head .   in one of the verses it was  cut rahab .      gonzalo said   if rahab is an arch opponent of god  the writer might be thinking of the nazis .  jeff said the writer might be jewish and after miss egypt  why not after miss germany .    trumbull said   why does the writer have to be jewish .  most fundamentalists are protestants and they ve had some neat terms in their time for the pope .  he was the  whore of babylon  to some of them and rahab was a harlot .  i don t suppose there s a miss vatican city  but how about miss italy .    henry said   i beg your pardon  gentlemen .    gordon looked up .   ah  you have a suggestion  henry .     yes  i have  sir .  whether it s useful or not  i don t know .   .   .   .  you said  mr .  gordon  that the rules are rather flexible in the miss earth contest as far as the nations represented are concerned .  some nations have no representatives  some have two or more under different names .  you mentioned a miss germany and a miss bavaria  for instance .     that s right   said gordon .    and you said there was no miss great britain  but that there was a miss england .     right again   said gordon .    does the miss england imply the presence of a miss scotland as well .     it does  as a matter of fact .   gordon s eyes narrowed .   and a miss ireland and miss northern ireland as well .    gonzalo brought both hands before him down on the table .   i ll bet i know what henry is driving at .  if the writer of the note is irish  he may be after miss northern ireland .  he would consider her as representing a political division that s a puppet of england  and england rules the waves and is rahab .    henry shook his head .   it s not as complicated as that  i think .  i have always thought that all things being equal  the simplest explanation is best .     occam s razor   muttered avalon .    i must admit   said henry   i never heard of rahab before  but mr .  rubin s explanation was quite enlightening .  if rahab is a monster representing the sea  and if the monster is also called leviathan  and if leviathan is sometimes used as a name for an actual sea monster  and the largest that lives  why might not the writer be referring to miss wales .     ah   said gordon .   henry turned to him .   was that the answer  mr .  gordon .    gordon said gravely   it s a possibility .     no  mr .  gordon   said henry .   you know better than that .  you came here to test me .  how can you test me with a puzzle to which you don t know the answer .    gordon broke into a laugh .   you win again  henry   he said .   everything i told you is true enough  but it happened last year .  the person in question was caught .  he had a knife in his hand  but he wasn t really dangerous .  he surrendered quietly and he s in a mental hospital now .  he was quite incoherent .  we could never be sure what his motive was except that he was sure his victim was particularly wicked .    the trouble was   gordon went on   we had to stake out a lot of men and we never did find out what rahab meant .   .   .   .  but when we caught him he was making his way into the dressing room of miss wales .  we should have had you last year  henry .  you re a remarkable detective .     the black widowers are .  they explore the problem  i only pick up what s left   said henry .     afterword  this story first appeared in the september      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine  under the title  a warning to miss earth   which i simply don t like .  back to  miss what .    i don t always remember the exact genesis of a particular story  but i remember this one .  mrs .  anita summer  who works with the leonard lyons column on the new york post  and who is a science fiction reader  invited me to come with her to a cocktail party being given for the contestants for the miss universe award .   well  of course  i was delighted to go and i wandered from contestant to contestant in a happy daze .  anita  pleased at my artless delight  said   are you going to write a story about this  isaac .    and i said   all right .   and i did .  so this story   miss what .    is dedicated to anita summer .          the lullaby of broadway     for the first time in the history of the black widowers  the monthly banquet was being given in a private apartment .  emmanuel rubin had insisted and his straggly straw colored beard had waggled strenuously as he argued it out in parliamentary fashion .   he was going to be the next host  he said  and the host was an absolute monarch within the wording of the bylaws and nowhere in the bylaws was the place of meeting specifically fixed .    according to tradition   began geoffrey avalon with the kind of solemnity that befitted his profession as patent lawyer   we have always met right here .     if tradition is the master   said rubin   why the bylaws .    and in the end he had had his way  carrying it finally when he pointed out that he was a gourmet cook and mario gonzalo had grinned and said   let s go and smell him burn the hamburgers .     i do not serve hamburgers   said rubin body  but by that time everyone had conceded the point .   so avalon and james drake  who had both come in from across the hudson on the same train  stood in the lobby of rubin s west side apartment house and waited for the doorman to pay attention to them .  it was quite clear that they could not get in without the doorman s permission by anything short  of violence .   avalon muttered   it s the fortress mentality .  it s all over new york .  you can t go anywhere without having to pass the gimlet eye and being frisked for weapons .     i don t blame them   said drake in his soft  hoarse voice .  he lit a cigarette .   it s better than being mugged in the elevator .     i suppose so   said avalon gloomily .   the doorman turned to them .  he was short  round faced  and bald headed  with a gray fringe of hair that was repeated in his mustache  which was as short and bristly as drake s but which occupied a more generous space of upper lip .  he did not look in the least formidable but his gray uniform lent him the cachet of authority and  presumably  that was enough to quell the intruder .    yes .   he said .   avalon cleared his throat  and spoke in his most impressively rich baritone in order to conceal the shyness that no one could believe anyone as tall  straight  and impressive as he could have .   we are dr .  drake and mr .  avalon calling on mr .  emmanuel rubin in    aa .     drake and avalon   repeated the doorman .   one minute .   he moved to the bank of apartment bells and spoke into the intercom .   the squawking sound of rubin s voice came clearly .   send them up .  send them up .    the doorman held the door open for them  but avalon hesitated on the threshold .   do you have many incidents here  by the way .    the doorman nodded importantly .   sometimes  sir .  no matter what you do  things happen .  apartment on the twentieth floor was robbed last year .  there was a lady got hurt in the laundry room not too long ago .  things like that happen .    a voice said gently   may i join you  gentlemen .    drake and avalon both turned to look at the newcomer .  there was a perceptible moment in which neither recognized him .  and then drake chuckled briefly  and said   henry  when you re not waiting on us at the restaurant  you re beautiful .    avalon said  considerably more explosively   henry .  what are you doing  .   .   .   .   he choked it off and looked uncomfortable .    mr .  rubin invited me  sir .  he said that as long as the dinner was not to be held in the restaurant and i could not have the privilege of waiting on you  then i would be his guest .  i believe that was his purpose in insisting the dinner be held here .  one would not think it  but mr .  rubin is a sentimental gentleman .     splendid   said avalon with great enthusiasm  as though to make up for his previous surprise .   doorman  this gentleman is with us .    henry hung back .   would you like to inquire of mr .  rubin  sir .    the doorman  having held the door patiently through this  said   no  that s all right .  you go right ahead .    henry nodded  and all three advanced through the large blue lobby to the bank of elevators .   drake said   henry  i haven t seen an outfit like yours in years .  they ll mob you in new york if you go around dressed like that .    henry looked down upon himself briefly .  his suit was a charcoal brown and cut so conservatively that drake was clearly wondering where the establishment could be found that would have such garments for sale .  the shoes were a sober black  the shirt a gleaming white  and the tie  a narrow and somber gray held with a neat tie clip .   crowning it all was the dark brown derby which henry now doffed  holding it lightly by the brim .    i haven t seen a derby in a long time   said avalon .    or a hat at all   said drake .    it is the freedom of the times   said henry .   we each do our thing now  and this is mine .    avalon said   the trouble is that some people consider the thing to do to be molesting women in laundries .     yes   said henry   i heard what the doorman said .  at least we can hope there will be no trouble today .    one of the elevators arrived at the lobby and a lady with a dog got off .  avalon looked inside  right and left  then entered .  they rose to the fourteenth floor without trouble .   they were all gathered  or almost all .  rubin was wearing his wife s apron  it had a large  jane  crocheted on it  and he was looking harried .  the sideboard had a full collection of bottles and avalon had appointed himself an impromptu bartender  after fending off henry .    sit down  henry   said rubin in a loud voice .   you re the guest .    henry looked uncomfortable .   halsted said  with his very slight stutter   you ve got a nice apartment  manny .     it s all right let me get past you for a minute but it s small .  of course  we don t have children  so we don t need it much larger  and being in manhattan has its conveniences for a writer .     yes   said avalon .   i listened to some of the conveniences downstairs .  the doorman said women have trouble in the laundry .     oh  hell   said rubin contemptuously .   some of the dames here want trouble .  ever since the chinese delegation to the united nations took over a motel a few blocks down  some of the dowagers here see the yellow menace everywhere .     and robberies  too   said drake .   rubin looked chagrined as though any slur against manhattan were a personal attack .   it could happen anywhere .  and jane was careless .    henry  the only one sitting at the table  and with an as yet untouched drink before him  looked surprised an expression which somehow did not put a single wrinkle into his unlined face .  he said   pardon me  mr .  rubin .  do you mean your apartment was entered .     well  yes  the apartment lock can be opened with a strip of celluloid  i think .  that s why everyone puts in fancy locks in addition .     but when was this .   asked henry .    about two weeks ago .  i m telling you  it was jane s fault .  she went down the hall to see someone about recipes or something and didn t double lock the .  door .  that s just asking for it .  the hoodlums have ah instinct for it  a special esp .  she came back just as the bum was leaving and there was a hell of a fuss .     did she get hurt .   asked gonzalo  his ordinarily prominent eyes bulging slightly .    not really .  she was shook up  that s all .  she yelled like anything about the best thing she could have done .  the guy ran .  if i d been there  i d have taken after him and caught him  too .  i d have     it s better not to try   said avalon austerely  stirring his drink by moving the ice with his forefinger .   the end result of a chase could be a knife in the ribs .  your ribs .     listen   said rubin   i ve faced guys with knives in my time .  they re easy to ban  hold it  something s burning .   he dashed into the kitchen .   there was a knock at the door .    use the peephole   said avalon .   halsted did  and said   it s tom .   he opened the door to let thomas trumbull in .   avalon said   how come you weren t announced .    trumbull shrugged .   they know me here .  i ve visited manny before .     besides   said drake   an important government operative like you is above suspicion .    trumbull snorted and his lined face twisted into a scowl  but he didn t rise to the bait .  that he was a code expert all the black widowers knew .  what he did with it  none of the black widowers knew  though all had the same suspicion .   trumbull said   any of you counted the bulls yet .    gonzalo laughed .   it does seem a herd .    the bookcases that lined the wall were littered with bulls in wood and ceramic and in all sizes and colors .  there were several on the end tables  others on the television set .    there are more in the bathroom   said drake  emerging .    i ll bet you   said trumbull   that if we each count all the bulls in the place  we ll each come out with a different answer and every one of them will be wrong .     i ll bet you   said halsted   that manny doesn t know how many there are himself .     hey  manny   shouted gonzalo   how many bulls have you got .     counting me .   called back rubin  amid the clatter of pottery .  he put his head out of the kitchen door .   one thing about eating here is you know damn well you don t get any liver in the appetizer .  you re getting an eggplant dish with all kinds of ingredients in it and don t ask the details because it s my recipe .  i invented it .   .  .  .  and  mario  that bull will chip if you drop it and jane knows them all by heart and she ll inspect each one when she comes back .    avalon said   did you hear about the robbery here  tom .    trumbull nodded .   he didn t get much  i understand .    rubin hustled out  carrying dishes .   don t help  henry .  say  jeff  put down the drink a minute and help me put out the cutlery .   .   .   .  it s roast turkey  so all of you get ready to tell me if you want light meat or dark and don t change your mind once you ve made it up .  and you re all getting stuffing whether you want it or not because that s what makes or    avalon put out the last of the knives with a flourish and said   what did they get  rubin .     you mean the guy who broke in .  nothing .  jane must have come back just as he started .  he messed up some of the items in the medicine chest  looking for drugs  i suppose .  i think he picked up some loose change  and my recording equipment was knocked about .  he may have been trying to carry off my portable stereo to hock it  but he just had a chance to move it a bit .   .   .   .  who wants music  by the way .     no one   shouted trumbull indignantly .   you start making your damned noise  and i ll steal the stereo and kick every one of your tapes intd the incinerator .    gonzalo said   you know  manny  i hate to say it  but the stuffing is even better than the eggplant was .    rubin grunted .   if i had a bigger kitchen   the wail of a siren sounded from outside .  drake jerked a thumb over his shoulder toward the open window .   the lullaby of broadway .    rubin waved his hand negligently .   you get used to it .  if it isn t a fire engine  it s an ambulance  if it isn t an ambulance  it s a police car  if it isn t  .   .   .  the traffic doesn t bother me .    for a moment he seemed lost in thought .  then a look of the deepest malignancy crossed his small face .   it s the neighbors who bother me .  do you know how many pianos there are on this floor alone .  and how many record players .     you have one   said trumbull .    i don t play it at two a . m .  at top volume   said rubin .   it wouldn t be so bad if this were an old apartment house with walls as thick as the length of your arm .  the trouble is  this place is only eight years old and they make the walls out of coated aluminum foil .  hell  the walls carry sound .  put your ear to the wall and you can hear noise from any apartment on any floor  three up and three down .    and it s not as though you can really hear the music and enjoy it   he went on .   you just hear that damned bass  thump  thump  thump  at a subsonic level that turns your bones to water .    halsted said   i know .  in my place  we ve got a couple who have fights and my wife and i listen  but we can never hear the words  just the tone of voice .  infuriating .  sometimes it s an interesting tone of voice  though .     how many families do you have here in this apartment house .   asked avalon .   rubin spent a few moments computing with moving lips .   about six hundred fifty   he said .    well  if you insist on living in a beehive   said avalon   you have to take the consequences .   his neat and graying beard seemed to bristle with high morality .    that s a real fat hunk of comfort   said rubin .   henry  you re going to have another helping of turkey .     no  really  mr .  rubin   said henry  with a kind of helpless despair .   i just can t   and he stopped with a sigh  since his plate was heaped high .   he said   you seem very put out  mr .  rubin  and somehow i feel there is more to it than someone s piano playing .    rubin nodded and  for a moment  his lips actually trembled  as though in passion .   you bet it is  henry .  it s that goddamn carpenter .  you might be able to hear him now .    he tilted his head in an attitude of listening and  automatically  all conversation stopped and all listened .  except for the steady whine of traffic outside  there was nothing .   rubin said   well  we re lucky .  he isn t doing it now  hasn t for a while  in fact .  listen  everyone  dessert was a kind of disaster and i had to improvise .  if anyone doesn t want to eat it  i ve got cake from the bakery  which i wouldn t ordinarily recommend  you understand     let me help this course   said gonzalo .    okay .  anyone but henry .     that   said trumbull   is a kind of reverse snobbery .  henry  this guy rubin is putting you in your place .  if he weren t so damned conscious that you re a waiter  he d let you help wait on us .    henry looked at his plate  still piled high  and said   my frustration is not so much at being unable to help wait on table  as at being unable to understand .     unable to understand what .   asked rubin  coming in with desserts on a tray .  they looked very much like chocolate mousse .    are you having a carpenter working in this apartment house .   asked henry .    what carpenter .   .   .   .  oh  you mean what i said .  no  i don t know what the hell he is .  i just call him a carpenter .  he s forever banging .  three in the afternoon .  five in the morning .  he s forever banging .  and always when i m writing and want it particularly quiet .   .   .   .  how s the bavarian cream .     is that what this is .   asked drake  staring at it suspiciously .    that s what it started out to be   said rubin   but the gelatin wouldn t set properly and i had to improvise .     tastes great to me  manny   said gonzalo .    little too sweet   said avalon   but i m not much of a dessert man .     it is a little too sweet   said rubin magnanimously .   coffee coming up in a minute  and not instant  either .     banging what  mr .  rubin .   asked henry .   rubin had bustled away  and it wasn t till five minutes afterward  with the coffee poured  that henry could ask again   banging what  mr .  rubin .     what .   asked rubin .   henry pushed his chair back from the table .  his mild face seemed to set into a harder outline .   mr .  rubin   he said   you are the host  and i am the guest of the club at this dinner .  i would like to ask a privilege which  as host  you can grant .     well  ask   said rubin .    as guest  it is traditional that i be quizzed .  frankly  i do not wish to be  since  unlike other guests  i will be at next month s banquet and at the one after that  in my ordinary capacity as waiter  of course  and i prefer   henry hesitated .    you prefer your privacy  henry .   asked avalon .    perhaps i would not quite put it   began henry  and then  interrupting himself  he said   yes  i would quite put it that way .  i want my privacy .  but i want something more .  i want to quiz mr .  rubin .     what for .   asked rubin  his eyes widening behind the magnifying effect of his thick lensed spectacles .    something i have heard this night puzzles me and i cannot get you to answer my questions .     henry  you re drunk .  i ve been answering every question .     nevertheless  may i quiz you formally  sir .     go ahead .     thank you   said henry .   i want to know about the annoyance you have been having .     you mean the carpenter  and his lullaby of broadway .     my line   said drake quietly  but rubin ignored him .    yes .  how long has it been going on .     how long .   said rubin passionately .   for months .     very loud .   asked henry .   rubin thought a while .   no  not loud  i suppose .  but you can hear it .  it comes at odd moments .  you can never predict it .     and who s doing it .    rubin brought his fist down on the table suddenly  so that his coffeecup clattered .   you know  that s it .  it isn t the noise so much  irritating though it might be .  i could stand it if i understood it  if i knew who it was  if i knew what he was doing  if i could go to someone and ask him not to do it for a while when i m having particular trouble with a plot line .  it s like being persecuted by a poltergeist .    trumbull held up his hand .   wait a while .  let s not have any of this poltergeist horse manure .  manny  you re not going to try to bring in the supernatural  here .  let s get one thing straight first    halsted said   it s henry that s doing the quizzing  tom .     i m aware of that   said trumbull  nodding his head frigidly .   henry  may i ask a question .     if   said henry   you are about to ask why mr .  rubin  hearing a  noise  can t tell where it s coming from  it is what i am about to ask .     go ahead   said trumbull .   i ll help myself to more coffee .    henry said   would you answer the question  mr .  rubin .    rubin said   i suppose it is hard for you all to understand .  let s see now  two of you live across the hudson  one of you lives down in one of the older sections of brooklyn  and one of you is in greenwich village .  tom lives in a reconverted brownstone .  i m not sure where henry lives but i m sure it s not a modern beehive  as avalon calls it .  none of you live in one of these modern apartment complexes with twenty five stories or more  and twenty five apartments on a floor  and nice sound carrying concrete for a skeleton .    if someone had a good loud record player on  i might be able to tell if it s from upstairs or from downstairs  though i wouldn t bet on it .  if i wanted to  i could go from door to door all along this floor  then door to door all along the floor beneath  and again all along the floor above  and i guess i would be able to tell what apartment it is by plastering my ear against the right door .    if it s just a soft hammering  though  it s impossible to tell .  you can listen at a door and it wouldn t help .  sound doesn t carry so much through the air and the door .  it goes through the walls .  listen  i ve gone from door to door when i got mad enough .  i don t know how many times i ve crept through the corridors .    gonzalo laughed .   if you get caught doing that  that doorman downstairs will be getting reports about vicious looking hoodlums sneaking around .     that doesn t worry me   said rubin .   the doorman knows me .   a look of coy modesty suddenly dripped over rubin s face .   he s a fan of mine .     i knew you had one somewhere   said trumbull  but henry pushed at the turkey on his plate and seemed more distressed than ever .    suppose your fan isn t on duty   said gonzalo argu mentatively .   you ve got to have doormen around the clock and your fan has to sleep .     they all know me   said rubin .   and this one  the guy at the door now  charlie wiszonski  takes the four to twelve evening shift weekdays  which is the heavy shift .  he s senior man .   .  .   .  look  let me clear the table .    henry said   could you have someone else do that  mr .  rubin .  i want to continue questioning you and i want to get back to the carpenter .  if sound carries through the walls and you hear him  don t many other people hear him  too .     i suppose so .     but if he disturbs so many     that s another irritating thing   said rubin .   he doesn t .   .   .   .  thanks  roger  just pile all the dishes in the sink .  i ll take care of them afterward .   .   .   .  this carpenter doesn t seem to bother anyone .  during the day husbands are away and so are lots of the wives and the apartment house isn t rich in children .  the wives that are home are doing housework .  in the evening  everyone has the television set on .  what does anyone care for an occasional banging .  i care because i m home night and day and i m a writer .  i care because i m a creative person who has to do some thinking and needs a little quiet .     have you asked others about it .   said henry .   oh  occasionally  yes .   he tapped his spoon restlessly against the cup .   i suppose your next question is to ask what they said .     i should guess   said henry   from the look of frustration about you  that no one admitted ever hearing it .     well  you re wrong .  one or two would say something about hearing it once or twice .  the trouble is  no one cared .  even if they heard it  they didn t care .  new yorkers get so deadened to noise  you could blow them up and they wouldn t care .     what do you suppose he s doing to make that noise  whoever he is .   asked avalon .   rubin said   i say he s a carpenter .  maybe not professionally  but he works at it .  i could swear he has a workshop up there .  i can still swear it .  nothing else will explain it .     what do you mean  you can still swear it .   asked  henry .    i consulted charlie about it .     the doorman .     what s the good of the doorman .   asked gonzalo .  why didn t you go to the superintendent .  or the owner .     what good are they .   said rubin impatiently .   all i know about the owner is the fact that he lets the air conditioning blow out every heat wave because he prefers to patch it with the finest grade of chewing gum .  and to get the superintendent you have to pull in washington .  besides  charlie s a good guy and we get along .  hell  when  jane had the run in with the hoodlum  and me not there  charlie was the one she called .     didn t she call the police .   asked avalon .    sure she did .  but first charlie .    henry looked terribly unhappy .  he said   so you consulted the doorman about the banging .  what did he say .     he said there were no complaints .  it was the first he had heard of it .  he said he would investigate .  he did and he swore up and down that there were no carpenter s workshops anywhere in the building .  he said he had men go into each apartment to check air conditioners and that s one sure way of getting in anywhere .     so then the doorman dropped the matter .    rubin nodded .   i suppose so .  and that bugged me  too .  it bothered me .  i could see that charlie didn t believe me .  he didn t think there was any banging .  i was the only one to mention it  he said .     doesn t mrs .  rubin hear it .     of course she does .  but i have to call it to her attention .  it doesn t bother her  either .    gonzalo said   maybe it s some gal practicing with castanets  or some percussion instrument .     come on .  i can tell something rhythmic from just random banging .     it could be a kid   said drake   or some pet .  i lived in an apartment in baltimore once and i had banging directly overhead  like someone dropping something a few hundred times a day .  and that s what it was .  they had a dog that kept picking up some toy bone and dropping it .  i got them to put down a cheap rug .     it s no kid and it s no pet   said rubin stubbornly .   i wish you wouldn t all assume i don t know what i m hearing .  listen  i worked in a lumberyard once .  i m a pretty fair carpenter myself .  i know the sound of a hammer on wood .     maybe someone s doing some home repairs   said halsted .    for months .  it s more than that .    henry said   is that where the situation stands now .   did you make any other effort to find the source after the doorman failed you .    rubin frowned .   i tried but it wasn t easy .  everyone has an unlisted number around here .  it s part of the fortress mentality avalon talks about .  and i only know a couple of people to talk to .  i tried knocking on the most likely doors and introducing myself and asking and all i got were hard stares .     i d give up   said drake .    not i   said rubin  tapping himself on the chest .   the main trouble was that everyone thought i was some kind of nut .  even charlie  i think .  there s a kind of general suspicion about writers on the part of ordinary people .     which may be justified   said gonzalo .    shut up   said rubin .   so i thought i would present some concrete evidence .     such as .   asked henry .    well  by god  i recorded the damned banging .  i spent two or three days keeping my senses alert for it and then  whenever it started  i tripped the switch and recorded it .  it played hell with my writing but i ended up with about forty five minutes of banging not loud  but you could hear it .  and it was an interesting thing to do because if you listened to it you could tell just from the banging that the bum is a rotten carpenter .  the blows weren t even and strong .  he had no control over that hammer  and that kind of irregularity wears you out .  once you get the proper rhythm  you can hammer all day without getting tired .  i did that many a time    henry interrupted .   and did you play the recording for the doorman .     no .  a month ago i went to a higher court .    gonzalo said   then you did see the super .     no .  there s such a thing as a tenants  organization .    there was a general smile of approval at the table which left only henry untouched .   didn t think of that   said avalon .   rubin grinned .   people wouldn t in a case like this .  that s because the only purpose of the organization is to  get after the landlord .  it s as though no one ever heard of a tenant annoying another tenant and yet i d say that nine tenths of the annoyances in an apartment house are caused by tenant tenant interactions .  i said that .  i    henry interrupted again .   are you a regular member of the organization  mr .  rubin .     i m a member  sure .  every tenant is a member automatically .     i mean do you attend meetings regularly .     as a matter of fact  this was only the second meeting i d attended .     do the regular attendees know you .     some of them do .  besides  what difference does that make .  i announced myself .  rubin  i said     double a  and i made my speech .  i had my tape recording with me and i held it up and waved it .  i said that was the proof some damn fool was a public nuisance  that i had it labeled with dates and times and would have it notarized if necessary and see my lawyer .  i said that if the landlord had made that noise  everyone in the audience would be howling for united action against the nuisance .  why not react the same to one of the tenants .     it must have been a most eloquent address   growled trumbull .   a pity i wasn t there to hear you .  what did they say .    rubin scowled .   they wanted to know who was the tenant who made the noise and i couldn t tell them .  so they let it drop .  nobody heard the noise  anyway  nobody was interested .     when did the meeting take place .   asked henry .    nearly a month ago .  and they haven t forgotten about it  either .  it was an eloquent address  tom .  i fried them .  i did it deliberately .  the word was going to spread  and it did .  charlie the doorman said he heard half the tenants talking about it which was what i wanted .  i wanted that carpenter to hear it .  i wanted him to know i was after him .     surely you don t intend violence  mr .  rubin   said henry .    i don t need violence .  i just wanted him to know .  it s been pretty quiet the last few weeks  and i ll bet it stays quiet .     when s the next meeting .   asked henry .   next week .   .  .  .  i may be there .    henry shook his head .  he said     wish you wouldn t  mr .  rubin .  i think it might be better if you dropped the whole thing .     i m not scared of whoever it is .         i m sure you re not  mr .  rubin  but i find the situation peculiar on several counts    in what way .   asked rubin hastily .   i i  it seems melodramatic  i admit but  mr .  avalon  you and dr .  drake arrived downstairs in the lobby just ahead of me .  you spoke to the doorman .    yes  that s right   said avalon .        perhaps i came too late .  i may have missed something .  it seems to me  mr .  avalon  that you asked the doorman if there had been any incidents of a distressing nature in the apartment house and he said there had been a robbery in a twentieth floor apartment the last year and that a woman had been hurt in some fashion in the laundry room .        avalon looked thoughtful and nodded .   henry said   yet he knew that we were heading for mr .  rubin s apartment .  how is it that he didn t mention that this apartment had been broken into only two weeks before .    there was a thoughtful pause .  gonzalo said   maybe he didn t like to gossip .     he told us about other incidents .  there might have been a harmless explanation  but when i heard of the break in  i grew perturbed .  everything i ve heard since has increased my feeling of uneasiness .  he was a fan of mr .  rubin .  mrs .  rubin had turned to him at the time .  yet he never spoke of it .     what do you make of it  henry .   asked avalon .    is he involved  somehow .     come on  henry   said rubin at once .   are you trying to say charlie is part of a holdup ring .     no  but if there is something peculiar going on in this apartment house  it might be very useful to slip the doorman a ten dollar bill now and then .  he might not know what it s for .  what is wanted may seem quite harmless to him but then when your apartment is invaded  it may be that he suddenly understands more than he did before .  he feels involved and he won t talk of it any more .  for his own sake .     okay   said rubin .   but what would be so peculiar going on here .  the carpenter and his banging .    henry said   why should someone haunt the floor waiting for you and mrs .  rubin to leave the apartment untenanted and single locked .  and why  when mr .  avalon mentioned the matter of the woman in the laundry early in the evening  mr .  rubin  did you promptly dismiss the matter with some reference to the chinese delegation to the united nations .  is there a connection .    rubin said   only that jane told me some of the tenants were worried about the chinese getting in here .     somehow i feel that is too weak a reason to account for your non sequitur .  did mrs .  rubin say that the man she had surprised in the apartment was an oriental .     oh  you can t go by that   said rubin  drawing his shoulders into an earnest shrug .   what can anyone really notice    avalon said   now wait a while  manny .  no one s asking you if the burglar was really chinese .  all henry is asking is whether jane said he was .    she said she thought he was  she had the impression he was .   .   .   .  come on  henry .  are you proposing espionage .    henry said stolidly   combine all this with the matter of the irregular banging i believe mr .  rubin mentioned the irregularity specifically as the sign of a poor carpenter .  might the irregularity be the product of a clever spy .  it seems to me that the weak point of any system of espionage is the transfer of information .  in this case  there would be no contact between sender and receiver  no intermediate checkpoint  nothing to tap or intercept .  it would be the most natural and harmless sound in the world that no one would hear except for the person listening and  as luck would have it  a writer trying to concentrate on his writing and distracted by even small sounds .  even then it would be considered merely someone hammering a carpenter .    trambull said   come on  henry .  that s silly .   henry said   but then what about a break in where virtually nothing was taken .     nuts   said rubin .   jane came back too soon .  if she had stayed away five minutes more  the stereo would have been gone .    trumbull said   look here  henry .  you ve done some remarkable things in the past and i wouldn t totally dismiss anything you say .  just the same  this is very thin .     perhaps i can present evidence .     what kind .     it would involve the recordings mr .  rubin made of the banging .  could you get them  mr .  rubin .    rubin said   easiest thing in the world .   he stepped through an archway .   trumbull said   henry  if you think i m going to listen to some stupid hammering and tell you if it s in code  you re crazy .     mr .  trumbull   said henry   what connections you have with the government  i don t know  but it is my guess that in a few moments you will want to get in touch with the proper people and my suggestion is that you begin by having the doorman thoroughly questioned  and that    rubin came back  frowning and red faced .   funny .  i can t find them .  i thought i knew exactly where they were supposed to be .  they re not there .  so much for your evidence  henry .  i ll have to  .  .  .  did i leave them somewhere .     it s the absence that s the evidence  mr .  rubin   said henry   and i think we know now what the burglar was after  and why there s been no hammering since .    trumbull said hastily   i d better make   then he paused as the doorbell sounded .   for a moment all were frozen  then rubin muttered    don t tell me jane is getting home early .   he rose heavily  moved to the door  and peered out the peephole .   he stared a moment  then said   what the hell .   and flung the door open .  the doorman was standing there  red faced and clearly uneasy .   the doorman said   it took time to get someone to stand in for me .   .   .   .  listen   he said  his eyes darting uneasily from person to person .   i don t want trouble  but     close the door  manny .   cried trumbull .   rubin pulled the doorman inside and closed the door .   what is it  charlie .     it s been getting to me .  and now someone asked me about troubles here .   .   .   .  you did  sir   he said to avalon .   then more people came and i think i know what it must be about .  i guess some of you are investigating the break in and i didn t know what was going on but i guess i was out of line and i want to explain .  this fellow     name and apartment number   said trumbull .    king .  he s in    u   said charlie .    okay  come into the kitchen with me .  manny  i m going to make that phone call on the phone in here .   he closed the kitchen door .   rubin looked up  as though listening .  then he said   hammering messages .  who d believe it .     exactly why it worked  mr .  rubin   said henry softly   and might have continued to work had there not been in the same apartment house a writer of your if i may say so marked eccentricity .     afterword  this story  and the two that follow  did not appear in ellery queen s mystery magazine  but  as i explained in the introduction  were written especially for the book .   this one is an example of how writing enriches one s life .  the business about hearing mysterious banging from one s apartment is taken from actual fact .  someone in my apartment house bangs away at all hours .  i ve never taken the strong action manny rubin took  but have contented myself with shaking my head and gritting my teeth .   i was getting more and more irritated at it and might have worked myself into an ulcer when it occurred to me that i might use it as the central point of a short story .  so i did .  this one .   now when i hear the banging  it isn t really so often or so bad  i just shrug cheerfully and remember that it supplied me with a story .  then i don t mind it at all .           yankee doodle went to town     it was general knowledge among the black widowers that geoffrey avalon had served as an officer in world war ii and had reached the rank of major .  he had never seen active service  as far as any of them knew  however  and he never talked about wartime experiences .  his stiff bearing  however  seemed suited to the interior of a uniform  so that it never surprised anyone to know that he had once been major avalon .   when he walked into the banquet room with an army officer as his guest  it seemed  therefore  entirely natural .  and when he said   this is my old army friend colonel samuel davenheim   everyone greeted him cordially without so much as a raised eyebrow .  any army buddy of avalon s was an army buddy of theirs .   even mario gonzalo  who had served an uneventful hitch in the army in the late fifties  and who was known to have acerbic views concerning officers  was pleasant enough .  he propped himself on one of the sideboards and began sketching .  avalon looked over gonzalo s shoulder briefly  as though to make sure the artist member of the black widowers would not  somehow  draw the colonel s head upward into a crown of ass s ears .   it would have been most inappropriate for gonzalo to have done so  for there was every indication of clear intelligence about davenheim .  his face  round and a little plump  was emphasized by outmoded hair  short above and absent below .  his mouth curved easily into a friendly smile  his voice was clear  his words crisp .   he said   i ve had you all described to me  for jeff  as you probably all know  is a methodical man .  i ought to be able to identify you all .  for instance  you re emmanuel rubin since you re short  have thick glasses  a sparse beard     straggly beard   said rubin  unoffended   is what jeff usually calls it because his own is dense  but i ve never found that density of facial hair implies     and are talkative   said davenheim firmly  overriding the other with the calm authority of a colonel .   and you re a writer .   .   .   .  you re mario gonzalo  the artist  and i don t even need your description since you re drawing .   .   .   .  roger halsted  mathematician  partly bald .  the only member without a full head of hair  so that s easy .   .   .   .  james drake  or  rather  dr .  james drake     we re all doctors by virtue of being black widowers   said drake from behind a curl of cigarette smoke .    you re right  and jeff explained that carefully .  you re doctor doctor drake because you smell of tobacco smoke at ten feet .     well  jeff should know   said drake philosophically .   and thomas trumbull   said davenheim   because you re scowling  and by elimination .   .   .   .  have i got everyone .     only the members   said halsted .   you ve left out henry  who s all important .    davenheim looked about  puzzled .   henry .     the waiter   said avalon  flushing and staring at his drink .   i m sorry  henry  but i didn t know what to tell colonel davenheim about you .  to say you re the waiter is ridiculously insufficient and to say more would endanger black widower confidentiality .     i understand   said henry agreeably   but i think it would be well to serve the colonel .  what is your pleasure  sir .    for a moment the colonel looked blank .   oh  you mean drinks .  no  that s all right .  i don t drink .     some ginger ale  perhaps .         all right .   davenheim was plainly grasping at straws .   that will be fine .    trumbull smiled .   the life of a non drinker is a difficult one .     something wet must be pressed on one   said davenheim wryly .   i ve never managed to adjust .    gonzalo said   have a cherry put in your ginger ale .  or better yet  put water in a cocktail glass and add an olive .  then drink and replace the water periodically .  everyone will admire you as a man who can hold his liquor .  though  frankly  i ve never seen an officer who could     i think we ll be eating any minute   said avalon hastily  looking at his watch .   henry said   won t you be seated  gentlemen .   and placed one of the bread baskets directly in front of gonzalo as though to suggest he use his mouth for that purpose .   gonzalo took a roll  broke it  buttered one half  bit into it  and said in muffled tones    keep from getting sloppy drunk on one martini   but no one listened .   rubin  finding himself between avalon and davenheim  said   what kind of soldier was jeff  colonel .     damned good one   said davenheim gravely   but he didn t get much of a chance to shine .  we were both in the legal end of matters  which meant desk work .  the difference is that he had the sense to get out once the war was over .  i didn t .     you mean you re still involved with military law .     that s right .     well  i look forward to the day when military law is as obsolete as feudal law .     i do  too   said davenheim calmly .   but it isn t as yet .     no   said rubin   and if you    trumbull interrupted .   damn it  manny  can t you wait for grilling time .     yes   said avalon  coughing semi stentorially   we might as well let sam eat before putting him through his paces .     if   said rubin   military law applied the same considerations to those     later .   roared trumbull .   rubin looked through his thick lensed glasses indignantly  but subsided .   halsted said  in what was clearly intended to be a change of topic   i m not happy with my limerick for the fifth book of the iliad .     the what .   said davenheim  puzzled .    pay no attention   said trumbull .   roger keeps threatening to put together five lines of crap for every book of the iliad .     and the odyssey   said halsted .   the trouble with the fifth book is that it deals chiefly with the feats of the greek hero diomedcs  and   feel i ought to have him part of the rhyme scheme .  i ve been at it  off and on  for months .     is that why you ve spared us limericks the last couple of sessions .   asked trumbull .    i ve had one and i ve been ready to read it  but i m not quite satisfied with it .     then you ve joined the great majority   said trumbull .    the thing is   said halsted quietly   that both  diomedes  and its legitimate variant  diomed  cannot be rhymed seriously .   diomedes  rhymes with  wheaties  and  diomed  rhymes with  shy a bed  and what good are those .     call him tydeides   said avalon .   homer frequently used the patronymic .     what s a patronymic .   asked gonzalo .    a father name  which is the literal translation of the word   said halsted .   diomedes  father was tydeus .  don t you think i ve thought of that .  it rhymes with  di dies  or  if you want to go cockney  with  lydies .       how about  ascites  .   said drake .    wit seeks its own level   said halsted .   how about this .  all i need do is distort the stress and give  diomed  accents on first and last syllables .     cheating   said rubin .    a little   admitted halsted   but here it is    in courage and skill well ahead   into battle went brave diomed .   even gods were his quarries   and the war loving ares  he struck down and left nearly for dead .    avalon shook his head .   ares was only wounded .  he had enough strength left to rise  roaring  to olympus .       must admit i m not satisfied   said halsted .    unanimous .  .   said trumbull .    veal parmesan .   said rubin enthusiastically  for  with his usual agility  henry was already placing the dishes before each .   colonel davenheim said  after he had devoted considerable time to the veal   you do yourselves well here  jeff .     oh  we do our poor best   said avalon .   the restaurant charges in proportion  but it s only once a month .    davenheim plied his fork enthusiastically and said   dr .  halsted  you re a mathematician     i teach mathematics to reluctant youngsters  which isn t quite the same thing .     but why  then  limericks on the epic poems .     precisely because it is not mathematics  colonel .  it s a mistake to think that because a man has a profession that can be named  all his interests must bear that name .     no offense   said the colonel .   avalon stared at a neatly cleaned plate and pushed thoughtfully at his untouched last half glass of liquor .  he said   as a matter of fact  sam knows what it is to have an intellectual hobby .  he is an excellent phoneticist .     oh  well   said davenheim  with heavy modesty   in an amateur way .    rubin said   does that mean you can tell jokes in accent .     in any accent you wish within reason   said davenheim .   but i can t tell jokes even in natural speech .     that s all right   said rubin   i d rather hear a bad joke in an authentic accent than a good one with a poor one .    gonzalo said   then how do you account for the fact that you laugh only at your own jokes when they fail in both respects .    davenheim spoke quickly to cut off rubin s rejoinder .  he said   you ve got me off the subject .   he leaned to one side to allow henry to place the rum cake before him .   i mean  dr .  halsted very well  roger that perhaps you switch to the classics to get your mind off some knotty mathematics problem .  then  while your conscious mind is permutating rhymes  your unconscious mind is       the funny thing about that   said rubin  seizing his own chance to cut in   is that it works .  i ve never been so stymied by a plot that i couldn t get it worked out by going to a movie .  i don t mean a good movie that really absorbs me .  i mean a bad one that occupies my conscious mind just sufficiently to allow my unconscious free reign .  a spy action film is best .    gonzalo said   i can t follow the plot of those things even when i m paying attention .     and yet they re aimed at the twelve year old mind   said rubin  striking back at last .   henry poured the coffee  as davenheim said   i agree with what manny says .  i happen to think that a day spent on phonetics is sometimes the best way of contributing to a problem at work .  but isn t there another aspect to this .  it s easy to see that by keeping the conscious mind occupied  we leave the unconscious free to do as it wishes underground .  but will it stay underground .  might it not obtrude aboveground .  might it not make itself seen or heard  if not to the person himself the person who is thinking then to others .     exactly what do you mean  colonel .   asked tram bull .    look   said davenheim   if we re on first name terms  let it be first names all round .  call me sam .  what i mean is this .  suppose manny is working on a plot involving an undetectable poison     never .   said rubin strenuously .   tarantulas are out  too  and mystic hindus  and the supernatural .  that s all nineteenth century romanticism .  i m not sure that even the locked room mystery hasn t become a matter of      just for example   said davenheim  who had momentary trouble breasting the tide .   you do other things to let your unconscious work and as far as you yourself are concerned you can swear that you have completely forgotten the mystery  that you re not thinking about it  that it s completely wiped out .  then  when you re hailing a cab  you call   toxic .  toxic .      trumbull said thoughtfully   that s farfetched and i don t accept it  but i m beginning to get a notion .  jeff  did you bring sam here because he has a problem on his mind .    avalon cleared his throat .   not really .  i invited him last month for many reasons the most important of which was that i thought you would all like him .  but he stayed over at my house last night and  may i tell them  sam .    davenheim shrugged .   this place is as quiet as the grave  you say .     absolutely   said avalon .   sam knows my wife almost as long as he knows me  but twice he called her farber instead of florence .    davenheim smiled dimly .   my unconscious forcing its way through .  i could have sworn   had put it out of my mind .     you weren t aware of it   said avalon .  he turned to the others .   i didn t notice it .  florence did .  the second time she said   what are you calling me .   and he said   what .   she said   you keep calling me farber .   and he looked absolutely thunderstruck .     just the same   said davenheim   it s not my unconscious that s bothering me .  it s his .     farber s .   asked drake  tamping out his cigarette with his stained fingers .    the other one s   said davenheim .   trumbull said   it s about time for the brandy anyway  jeff .  do you want to grill our esteemed guest  or ought someone else do so .     i don t know that he needs to be grilled   said avalon .    perhaps he ll simply tell us what s occupying his unconscious when his conscious mind is being diverted .     i don t know that i want to do that   said davenheim grimly .   it s rather a delicate matter .     you have my word   said trumbull   that everything said here is in strictest confidence .  i m sure jeff has told you that already .  and that includes our esteemed henry .  and  of course  you needn t go into full detail .     i can t hide behind false names  though  can i .     not if farber is one of the true ones   said gonzalo  grinning .    well  what the devil   sighed davenheim .   actually  it s not much of a story as stories go  and it may be nothing  nothing at all .  i may be so damned wrong .  but if i m not wrong it s going to be embarrassing for the army  and expensive for the country .  i could almost hope i was wrong  but i ve committed myself so far that if i am wrong it may permanently hamper my career .  yet i m not so far away from retirement .    for a moment he seemed lost in thought  then he said fiercely   no  i want to be right .  however embarrassing  it s got to be stopped .     is it treason you re after .   asked drake .    no  not in the narrow sense of the word .  i almost wish it were .  there can be a colossal dignity about treason .  a traitor is sometimes only the other side of the patriot coin .  one man s traitor is another man s martyr .  i m not talking about the penny ante handyman for hire .  i m talking about the man who thinks he is serving a higher cause than his country and wouldn t accept a penny for the risks he undergoes .  we understand that quite well when it is the enemy s traitors we are dealing with .  the men  for instance  whom hitler considered     it s not treason  then .   said trumbull  a bit impatiently .    no .  just corruption .  stinking  fetid corruption .  a gang of men  soldiers  i m sorry to say  officers  conceivably high officers intent on bleeding uncle sam a bit .     why isn t that treason .   snapped rubin .   it weakens us and spreads decay in the army .  soldiers who think so little of their country as to steal from it are scarcely going to think so much of it as to die for it .     if it comes to that   said avalon   people put their emotions and actions in separate compartments .  it s quite possible to steal from uncle sam today and die for him tomorrow and be perfectly sincere about it both times .  many a man who routinely cheats the national treasury out of half his proper income tax considers himself a loyal american patriot .    rubin said   leave the income tax out of it .  considering what consumes most of federal spending  you can make a good case for maintaining that the true patriot is he who goes to jail rather than pay his taxes .    davenheim said   it s one thing not to pay your taxes out of principle  to admit it  and go to jail for it .  it s another thing to duck your share of the fair load for no other reason than to see others carry their own burden and yours to boot .  both actions are equally illegal  but i have some respect for the former .  in the case i m talking about the only motivation is simple greed .  it is quite possible that millions of dollars of the taxpayers  money are involved .     possible .  is that all .   asked trumbull  his forehead wrinkling into a washboard .    that s all .  so far .  i can t prove it and it s a difficult thing to track down without a damned good scent .  if i push too hard and can t back my suspicions all the way  i ll be torn in half .  some big names might be involved  and might not .     what s farber got to do with it .   asked gonzalo .  .    so far we have two men  a sergeant and a private .  the sergeant is farber  robert j .  farber .  the other is orin klotz .  we ve got nothing on them really .     nothing at all .   asked avalon .    not really .  as a result of the action of farber and klotz  thousands of dollars of army equipment have evaporated but we cannot show that their actions were illegal .  they were covered in every case .     you mean because higher ups were involved .   gonzalo smiled slowly .   officers .  with brains .     unlikely as it seems   said davenheim dryly .   that may be so .  but i have no proof .     can t you question the two men you have .   said gonzalo .    i have   said davenheim .   and with farber i can get nothing .  he is that most dangerous of men  the honest tool .  i believe he was too stupid to know the significance of what he did  and that if he did know  he wouldn t have done it .     confront him with the truth   said avalon .    what is the truth .   asked davenheim .   and i m not ready to put my guesses on the table .  if i tell what i know now  it will be dishonorable discharge for the two  at best  and the rest of the ring will pull in its horns for a breathing space and then start in again .  no  i d like to cover my hand until such time as i can get a lead  some lead   can be sufficiently sure of to run the risk i m going to have to run .     you mean a lead to someone higher up .   asked rubin .    exactly .     what about the other fellow .   asked gonzalo .   davenheim nodded .   he s the one .  he knows .  he s the brains of that pair .  but i can t break his story .  i ve been over and over it with him and he s covered .    halsted said   if it s only a guess that there s something more to this than those two guys  why do you take it so seriously .  aren t the chances actually very good that you re wrong .     to other people it would seem so   said davenheim .   and there s no way in which i could explain why i know i m not wrong except by pleading experience .  after all  roger  an experienced mathematician can be quite certain that a particular conjecture is true and yet be unable to prove it by the strict rules of mathematical demonstration .  right .     i m not sure that that s a good analogy   said halsted .    it seems a good one to me .  i ve talked to men who were guilty beyond a doubt and to men who were innocent beyond a doubt and the attitude of each under accusation is different and i can sense that difference .  the trouble is that that sense i have is not admissible as evidence .  farber i can dismiss  but klotz is just a shade too wary  just a shade too unconfused .  he plays games with me and enjoys it  too  and that s one thing i can t possibly miss .     if you insist that you can sense such things   said halsted  dissatisfied   there s no arguing about it  is there .  you put it outside the rational .     there s just no mistake in it   said davenheim  unheeding  as though he were now caught up in the fury of his thoughts to the point where what halsted said was just an outer sound that didn t impinge .   klotz smiles just a little bit whenever i m after him hotly .  it s as though i m a bull and he s a matador  and when i m beginning to lunge at close quarters  he stands there rigidly with his cape flirting negligently to one side  daring me to gore him .  and when i try  he s not there and the cape flips over my head .     i m afraid he s got you  sam   said avalon  shaking his head .   if you feel as though he s playing you for a fool  you ve reached the point where you can t trust your judgment .  let someone else take over .    davenheim shook his head .   no  if it s what i think it is  and i know it s what i think it is  i want to be the one to smash it .     look   said trumbull .   i have a little experience in such things .  do you suppose klotz can break the case wide open for you .  he s only a private  and i suspect that even if there is some sort of conspiracy  he knows very little about it .     all right .  i ll accept that   said davenheim .   i don t expect klotz to hand me the moon .  yet he s got to know one other man  one man higher up .  he s got to know some one fact  some one fact closer to the center than he himself is .  it s that one man and that one fact i m after .  it s all i ask .  and the thing that breaks me in two is that he s giving it away and i still don t get it .     what do you mean  giving it away .   asked trumbull .    that s where the unconscious comes in .  when he and i are sparring  he s entirely occupied with me  entirely engaged in stopping me  heading me off  stymying me  putting me behind the eight ball .  it s a game he plays well  damn him .  the last thing he s going to do is to give me the information i want  but it s in him just the same and when he s busy thinking of everything else but  that information bubbles out of him .  every time i m close upon him and backing and maneuvering him into a corner butting my horns against his damned cape just this far from his groin he sings .     he what .   exploded gonzalo  and there was a general stir among the black widowers .  only henry showed no trace of emotion as he refilled several of the coffeecups .    he sings   said davenheim .   well  not quite he hums .  and it s always the same tune .     what tune is that .  anything you know .    of course i know it .  everyone knows it .  it s  yankee doodle .     avalon said heavily   even president grant  who had no ear for music  knew that one .  he said he knew only two tunes .  one was  yankee doodle  and the other wasn t .     and it s  yankee doodle  that s giving the whole thing away .   asked drake  with that look in his weary chemist s eyes that came when he began to suspect the rationality of another person .    somehow .  he s masking the truth as cleverly as he can  but it emerges from his unconscious  just a bit  just the tip of the iceberg .  and  yankee doodle  is that tip .  i don t get it .  there s just not enough for me to grab hold of .  but it s there .  i m sure of that .     you mean there s a solution to your problem somewhere in  yankee doodle  .   said rubin .    yes .   said davenheim emphatically .   i m positive of that  the thing is he s not aware he s humming it .  at one point i said   what s that .   and he was blank .  i said   what are you humming .   and he just stared at me in what i could swear was honest amazement .     as when you called florence farber   said avalon .   halsted shook his head .   i don t see where you can attach much importance to that .  we all experience times when tunes run through our minds and we can t get rid of them for a while .  i m sure we re bound to hum them under our breath at times .    davenheim said   at random times  perhaps .  but klotz hums only  yaknee doodle  and only at the specific times when i m pressing him .  when things get tense in connection with my probing for the truth about the corruption conspiracy i am sure exists  that tune surfaces .  it must have meaning .     yankee doodle   said rubin thoughtfully  half to himself .  for a moment he looked at henry  who was standing near the sideboard  a small vertical crease between his eyebrows .  henry caught rubin s eye but did not respond .   there was a ruminating silence for a few moments and all the black widowers seemed to be  to one degree or another  unhappy .  finally  trumbull said   you may be all wrong  sam .  what you may be needing here is psychiatry .  this guy klotz may hum  yankee doodle  at all moments of tension .  all it may mean is that he heard his grandfather sing it when he was six years old or that his mother sang him to sleep with it .    davenheim lifted his upper lip in mild derision .   can you believe i didn t think of that .  i had a dozen of his close friends in .  nobody had ever heard him hum anything .     they might be lying   said gonzalo .   i wouldn t tell an officer anything if i could avoid it .     they might never have noticed   said avalon .   few people are good observers .     maybe they lied  maybe they didn t know   said davenheim   but  taken at face value  their testimony  all of it  would make me think that the humming of  yankee doodle  is specifically associated with my investigation and nothing else .     maybe it s just associated with army life .  it s a march associated with the revolutionary war   said drake .    then why only with me  not with anyone else in the army .    rubin said   okay  let s pretend  yankee doodle  means something in this connection .  what can we lose .  so let s consider how it goes .   .   .   .  for god s sake  jeff  don t sing it .    avalon  who had opened his mouth with the clear intention of singing  closed it with a snap .  his ability to hold a true note rivaled that of an oyster and in his saner moments he knew it .  he said  with a trace of hauteur   i will recite the words .     good   said rubin   but no singing .    avalon  looking stern  struck an attitude and began declaiming in his most resonant baritone        yankee doodle went to town  a nding on a pony .   stuck a feather in his cap  and called it macaroni .   yankee doodle  keep it up   yankee doodle dandy .   mind the music and the step  and with the girls be handy .    gonzalo said   it s just a nonsense lyric .     nonsense  hell   said rubin indignantly  and his straggly beard quivered .   it makes perfect sense .  it s a satire on the country boy written by a city slicker .   doodle  is any primitive country instrument a bagpipe  for instance so a yankee doodle is a backwoods new eng lander who s no more sophisticated than a bagpipe .  he comes to town on his pony intent on cutting a fine figure  so he wears what he thinks are city clothes .  he wears a feather in his hat and thinks he s a real dude .  and in the late eighteenth century  that s what a  macaroni  was  a city hepcat dressed in the latest style .    the last four lines are the chorus and show the country boy stepping it up at a city dance .  he is mockingly told to stamp away and be gallant to the ladies .  the word  dandy   which first came into use about mid eighteenth century  meant the same as  macaroni .      gonzalo said   okay  manny  you win .  it s not nonsense .  but how does it help sam s case .     i don t think it does   said rubin .   sorry  sam  but klotz sounds like a country boy making a fool of the city slicker and he can t help but think of the derisive song and how he s turning the tables on you .    davenheim said   i presume  manny  that you think he must be a country boy because his name is klotz .  by that reasoning you must be a rube because your name is rubin .  actually  klotz was born and brought up in philadelphia and i doubt that he s ever seen a farm .  no country boy  he .     all right   said rubin   then i might have been looking at the wrong end of the stick .  he s the city slicker looking down on you  sam .     because i m a country boy .  i was born in stoneham  massachusetts  and went through harvard right up to my law degree .  and he knows that  too .  he has made enough roundabout references to it in his matador moments .    drake said   doesn t your massachusetts birth and upbringing make you a yankee .     not a yankee doodle   said davenheim stubbornly .    he might think so   said drake .   davenheim thought about that a while  then said   yes  i suppose he might .  but if so  surely he would hum it openly  derisively .  the point is  i think he s humming it unconsciously .  it has a connection with something he s trying to hide  not something he s trying to show .    halsted said   maybe he s looking forward to a future when he s going to be enriched by his crimes and when he ll be able to strut his way to town  when he can  stick a feather in his cap  in other words .    drake said   or maybe klotz is thinking that his treatment of you is a feather in his cap .    gonzalo said   maybe some particular word has significance .  suppose  macaroni  means he s hooked up with the mafia .  or suppose  with the girls be handy  means that some wac is involved .  they still have wacs in the army  don t they .    it was at this point that henry said   i wonder  mr .  avalon  if  as host  you will permit me to ask a few questions .    avalon said   come on  henry .  you know you can at any time .     thank you  sir .  would the colonel grant me the same permission .    davenheim looked surprised  but said   well  you re here  henry  so you might as well .    henry said   mr .  avalon recited eight lines of  yankee doodle  four lines of a verse followed by the four lines of the chorus .  but verse and chorus have different tunes .  did private klotz hum all eight lines .    davenheim thought a moment .   no  of course not .  he hummed  uh   he closed his eyes  concentrated  and went  dum dum dum dum dum dum dum  dum dum dum dum dum du u um dum .  that s all .  the first two lines .     of the verse .     that s right .   yankee doodle went to town  a riding on a pony .      always those two lines .    yes  i think always .    drake brushed some crumbs from the table .   colonel  you say this humming took place when the questioning was particularly tense .  did you pay particular attention to exactly what was being discussed at those times .    yes  of course  but i prefer not to go into detail .    i understand  but perhaps you can tell me this .  at those times  was it he himself who was under discussion or sergeant farber as well .     generally   said davenheim slowly   the humming times came when he most emphatically protested innocence  but always on behalf of both .  i ll give him that .  he has never once tried to clear himself at the expense of the other .  it was always that neither farber nor he did thus and so or were responsible for this and that .    henry said   colonel davenheim  this is a long shot .  if the answer is no  then i ll have nothing more to say .  if  however  the answer is yes  it s just possible we may have something .     what s the question  henry .   asked davenheim .    at the same base where sergeant farber and private  klotz are stationed  colonel  does there happen to be a captain gooden or gooding or anything resembling that in sound .    davenheim had  until then  been looking at henry with grave amusement .  now that vanished in a flash .  his mouth closed tight and his face whitened visibly .  then his chair scraped as he shoved it back and rose .    yes   he said strenuously .   captain charles goodwin .  how the hell could you possibly have known that .     in that case  he may be your man .  i d forget about klotz and farber  sir  if i were you  and concentrate on the captain .  that might be the one step upward that you wanted .  and the captain may prove an easier nut to crack than private klotz has been .    davenheim seemed to find no way to speak further and trumbull said   i wish you d explain  henry .     it s the  yankee doodle   as the colonel expected .  the point is  though  that private klotz hummed it .  we have to consider what words he was thinking when he hummed .    gonzalo said   the colonel said he hummed the lines that go  yankee doodle went to town  a riding on a pony .      henry shook his head .   the original poem  yankee doodle  had some dozen verses and the macaroni lines were not among them .  they arose later  though they re now the most familiar .  the original poem tells of the visit of a young farmboy to the camp of washington s continental army and his naivete is made fun of  so i believe mr .  rubin s interpretation of the nature of the song to be correct .    rubin said   henry s right .  i remember now .  washington is even mentioned  but as captain washington .  the farmboy wasn t even aware of the nature of military rank .     yes   said henry .   i don t know all the verses and i imagine very few people do .  perhaps private klotz didn t  either .  but anyone who knows the poem at all knows the first verse or  at any rate  the first two lines  and that s what private klotz may have been humming .  the first line  for instance and it s the farmboy speaking is  father and i went down to camp .   you see .     no   said davenheim  shaking his head .   not quite .     it occurred to me that whenever you pressed hard on private klotz and might say   farber and you did thus and so   and he answered   farber and i did not do thus and so   the humming would start .  you said  colonel  that it was at the moment of denial that it tended to come and that he always denied on behalf of both farber and himself .  so when he said  farber and i   it would trigger the line  farber and   went down to camp .     henry sang it in a soft tenor voice .    farber and he were in an army camp   said avalon   but  good god  that s stretching for it .     if it stood alone  sir  yes   said henry .   but that s why i asked about a captain gooden in the camp .  if he were a third member of the conspiracy  the push to hum the tune might be irresistible .  the first verse  which is the only one i know    but here rubin interrupted .  standing up  he roared        father and i went down to camp  along with cap n good n   and there we saw the men and boys  as thick as hasty puddih  .     that s right   said henry calmly   farber and i went down to camp along with captain goodwin .     by god   said davenheim .   that must be it .  if not  it s the most extraordinary coincidence .   .   .   .  and it can t be .  henry  you ve put your finger on it .     i hope so .  more coffee  colonel .   said henry .    afterword  this story was the occasion of my making a great discovery .  it came about this way   i compose on the typewriter .  even first drafts get type written .  it was my firm belief that it had to be so .  li i dictated  i couldn t see what i was doing  and if i tried writing by hand  my fingers would get stiff and fall off halfway down the second page .   so on november          i found myself in a rochester hotel room with a speech to give the next  day .  for that evening i had nothing to do and while driving to rochester i had thought up the story you have just finished  unless you re skipping through the book just reading the afterwords  .  i was desperate .  all i wanted to do was to write and i had not brought a typewriter with me .   finally  i dug out some of the hotel stationery and decided to start the story by hand and keep on going till my fingers dropped off .  it might kill a little time .  so i wrote  and i wrote and i wrote .  do you know i finished the entire story without lifting pen from paper and my fingers didn t hurt at all .   now i need never take my typewriter .  since then i have handwritten several other items  while i was on board ship .   and you know what .  while i was writing the story i discovered an odd thing .  writing by hand with pen and ink is very silent .  that noise i always make writing isn t the writing  it s the typewriter .  i thought you d want to know that .           the curious omission     roger halsted was clearly suffused with a controlled glee when he arrived at the monthly banquet of the black widowers .  he unwound his scarf  it was a cold evening with considerably more than a hint of snow in the air   since half an inch of it already lay on the ground  and said   have i got a guest for you .    emmanuel rubin looked at him over his scotch and soda and said peevishly   where were you .  even tom trumbull beat you to the drinks and we thought you were welching on the host s responsibility .    halsted looked hurt and his high forehead grew pink .  he said   i called the restaurant .  henry    henry had adjusted the bread baskets and seen to it that the bran muffins affected by geoffrey avalon were in plain view .  he said   yes  mr .  halsted .  the company has been informed that you would be a little late .  i believe mr .  rubin is merely amusing himself at your expense .    trumbull said   what guest .     that s why i m late .  i had to pick him up in white plains and it s snowing harder up there .  i had to call the restaurant from a gas station .     so where is he .   asked mario gonzalo  more than usually nattily dressed in a maroon blazer  matching striped shirt  and matching patterned tie .    downstairs .  men s room .  his name is jeremy at wood  he s about sixty five  and he has a problem .    avalon from his considerably better than six feet of height drew his thick and graying eyebrows together .   i ve been thinking  gentlemen  of this very matter .  the original purpose of the black widowers consisted of nothing more than dining and conversation .  we have now reached the point where we never fail to have a problem to agitate us and disturb our digestion .  what happens when we can t find one .  do we disband .    gonzalo said   then we re back to conversation without a purpose .  there s always manny .    rubin said  his sparse beard lifting noticeably   nothing i say is without a purpose  mario .  failing all else  there s the vague hope my words may serve to educate you .  for one thing  i can show you why your latest painting is completely wrong .     you said you liked it   said mario  frowning and stepping into the trap .    only out of relief when you said it was your last painting and only until i found out you meant it was your latest .    but halsted s guest was coming up the stairs now .  he moved rather slowly and he seemed tired .  halsted helped him off with his overcoat  and when the guest removed his hat  he showed himself to be quite bald .  only a fringe of white hair remained .   halsted said   gentlemen  this is my guest  jeremy at wood .  i met him through the fact that one of his nephews is a fellow teacher .  mr .  atwood  let me present the company .    by the time the introductions were completed and a glass of dry sherry had been pressed into atwood s hand  henry had the first course on the table .  rubin stared at it suspiciously .    no liver .   he asked .    no liver  mr .  rubin   said henry .   kidney slices are the base .     oh  lord   said rubin   what s the soup .     cream of leek  mr .  rubin .     coming and going .  they get you coming and going   he grumbled  and tackled the kidney with a gingerly probing fork .   drake  with a glimmer in his small eyes which meant he thought he was on the track of a fellow chemist  said   what does your nephew teach  mr .  atwood .    atwood said  in a surprisingly musical tenor   english literature  i believe .  i am not very well acquainted with him .     i don t blame you   said rubin at once .   teachers of english literature have probably turned out more illiterates than have any other force of illegitimate culture in the world .     you see  mr .  atwood   said gonzalo  striving for his own back   manny rubin is a writer whose works have never been discussed by any teacher who was sober at the time .    trumbull spoke at once to cut off rubin s retort .   what s your own line of work  mr .  atwood .     i m retired now  but once upon a time i was a civil engineer   said atwood .   avalon said   you do not have to answer any questions now  mr .  atwood .  that will come with the dessert .    it turned out to be unnecessary advice since rubin had the bit in his teeth now and was off and running .  with the soup  of which he had little  he developed the thesis that teachers of english generally and of english literature in particular had as their peculiar object the placing of the english language in chains and the making of literature a fossil in murky amber .   over the main course  roast stuffed duck  rubin proceeded to probe the motives of the english teaching criminals and found it to consist of an embittered and hate filled envy of those who could  past and present  use the english language as a tool .    like emmanuel rubin  of course   said gonzalo in a stage whisper .    like me   said rubin  unabashed .   i know more grammar than any so called english teacher and have read more literature more closely than they can possibly have done  any of them .  the thing is i don t let the grammar bind me or the literature force me .     anyone who writes ungrammatical twaddle can say the same   said avalon .    that means something  jeff   said rubin hotly   only if you re prepared to say that i write ungrammatical twaddle .    having disposed of his wild rice and somewhat neglecting the stuffing  rubin began an eloquent dissertation on the damage done to young minds by those academic delinquents and took on the other five members as each raised objections until the poire au vin was served and the coffee was poured .    can i have a glass of milk  instead .   said atwood apologetically .   henry s assent was lost in rubin s triumphant  there you are .  any english teacher would have said   may i have a glass of milk .   but atwood knows he may .  the question is  does the restaurant have milk to serve .  therefore   can  he  not  may  he .    atwood said   actually  my grammar has always been poor and maybe i should have said    halsted rapped his spoon against the water glass and said   enough grammar  manny  enough .  it s time for our guest .     and that s why   said rubin in a parting shot   i don t collect reviews  because any english lit type who would waste his time writing reviews     he collects only favorable ones   said gonzalo .   i know .  he showed me his empty scrapbook .    halsted s spoon kept up a series of chimes and finally he said   my friend stuart mr .  atwood s nephew  happened to mention  a couple of weeks ago  that mr .  atwood had a literary problem .  naturally  i was interested for reasons we all understand and inquired further .  it turned out stu didn t know much about it .  i got in touch with mr .  atwood and he told me enough to make me think he would make an excellent guest for this meeting .  since i am hosting and he kindly consented to come    avalon harumphed stentoriously .   i trust mr .  atwood understands that he may be cross examined rather     i explained it all thoroughly  jeff   said halsted .   i also explained to him that everything that goes on here is confidential .  as it happens  mr .  atwood is rather interested in a solution to his problem  and is anxious to have us help .    trumbull s dark face lined into savage creases .   god damn it  roger  you haven t guaranteed a solution  have you .     no  but we ve got a fair record   said halsted complacently .    all right  then .  let s begin  .   .   .  henry .  is the brandy on the way .   .  .   .  who does the grilling  roger .     why  you  tom .    the brandy was being poured neatly into the small glasses .  atwood raised his hand in a timid negative and henry passed him .  he turned his bright blue eyes toward trumbull   am i to be grilled .     only a manner of speaking  sir .  we are interested in your literary problem .  would you care to tell us about it in whatever way you please .  we will ask questions when that seems advisable  if you don t mind .     oh  i won t mind   said atwood cheerfully .  his eyes darted from one to the other .   i warn you that it isn t much of a mystery except that i don t know what to make of it .     well  we might not know  either   said gonzalo  touching his brandy to his lips .   drake  who was nursing the remains of a cold and who had to cut down on his smoking in consequence  stubbed out a half finished cigarette morosely  and said   we ll never know if we don t hear what it is .   he blew his nose into a bright red handkerchief and stuffed it into his jacket pocket .    won t you go on  mr .  atwood .   said trumbull .   and let s have some silence from the rest of you .    atwood folded his hands on the edge of the table almost as though he were back in grade school  and a formal intonation colored his words .  he was reciting .    this all involves my friend lyon sanders  who was  like myself  a retired civil engineer .  we had never actually worked together but we had been neighbors for a quarter century and were very close .  i am a bachelor  he was a childless widower  and we both led lives that might  superficially  have seemed lonely .  neither of us was  however  for we had each carved out a comfortable niche .    i myself have written a text on civil engineering which has had some success and for some years i have been preparing a rather elaborate  if informal  tale of my experiences in the field .  i doubt that it will ever be published but  of course  if it is    but that s beside the point .  sanders was a more aggressive person by far than ever   was  louder  more raucous  with a rather coarse sense of humor .  he was a games person    rubin interrupted .   a sports enthusiast .     no  no .  indoor games .  i believe he knew and could play well every card game ever invented .  he could play anything else  too  that used counters  pointers  dice boards  cups  anything .  he was a master at chinese checkers  parcheesi  backgammon  monopoly  checkers  chess  go  three dimensional ticktacktoe .    couldn t even tell you the names of most of the games he played .    he read books on the subject and he invented games himself .  some were clever and i would suggest he patent them and place them on the market .  but that was not what he wanted at all .  it was only his own amusement that interested him .  that was where i came in  you see .  i was what he sharpened his analyses on .    trumbull said   in what way .     well   said atwood   when i say he played those games  i do not mean in the ordinary sense of the word .  he analyzed them carefully  almost as though they involved engineering principles     they do   said rubin suddenly .   any decent game can be analyzed mathematically .  there s a whole field of recreational mathematics .     i know this   atwood managed to interpose gently   but i don t know that sanders went at it in any orthodox manner .  he never offered to explain it to me and i never bothered to ask .    our routine over the last twenty years was to spend the weekend at the games  applying what had been learned over the week  for often he would spend time teaching me .  not out of any urge to educate  you understand  but merely to make the game more interesting for  himself by improving the opposition .  we might play bridge ten weeks running  then switch to gin rummy  then to something in which i had to match numbers he thought of .  naturally  he almost always won .    drake looked at an unlit cigarette as though he wished it would light itself and said   didn t that depress you .     not really .  it was fun trying to beat him and sometimes i did .  i beat him just often enough to keep up my interest .     do you suppose he let you win .   said gonzalo .    i doubt it .  my victories would always either enrage or chagrin him and they would send him into a fury of further analyses .    think he enjoyed it a little  too  for when he had too long a string of unbroken victories he would start educating me .  it was a strange relationship but it worked .  we were very fond of each other .     were .   asked avalon .    yes   sighed atwood .   he died six months ago .  it was no great shock .  we both saw it coming .  of course  i miss him dreadfully .  the weekends are quite empty now .  i even miss the rowdy way in which he poked fun at me .  he bullied me constantly .  he never wearied of making fun of me for being a teetotaler and he never stopped teasing me about my religion .     he was an atheist .   asked gonzalo .    not particularly .  in fact  neither of us went to church often .  it s just that he was brought up one brand of protestant and i another .  he called mine high church and found nothing so humorous as to tease me over the elaborateness of the worship i skipped every sunday in comparison to the simplicity of the worship he skipped every sunday .    trumbull frowned .   i should think that would annoy you .  didn t you ever feel like taking a poke at him .     never .  it was just his way   said atwood .   nor need you think that poor lyon s death was in the least suspicious .  you needn t search for any motives of that kind .  he died at the age of sixty eight of complications from a mi . d but long standing case of diabetes .    he had said that he was going to leave me something in his will .  he expected to die before i did  you see  and he said it was to compensate me for my patience in accepting defeat .  actually  i m sure it was out of affection  but he would be the last to admit that .    it was only in the last year before his death  when he knew he was failing  that this began to enter into our conversations .  naturally i protested that this was no fit subject for talk and that he merely made me uncomfortable .  but he laughed one time and said   i won t make it easy for you  you genuflecting idol worshipper .   you see  just thinking about him makes me fall into his way of talking .  i don t know that that s exactly what he called me at this time  but it was something .  anyway  leaving out the epithets  he said   i won t make it easy for you .  we ll be playing games to the end .     he said that on what turned out to be his deathbed .  i was all he had  except for the various hospital personnel that hovered about impersonally .  he had distant relatives  but none of them visited .  then late in the evening  when i wondered if i ought to leave and return the next morning  he turned his head to me and said in a voice that seemed almost normal  the curious omission in alice .     naturally  i said   what .     but he laughed very weakly and said  that s all you get  old friend  all you get .   and his eyes closed  and he was dead .    rubin said   a dying hint .    avalon said   you say his voice was clear .     quite clear   said atwood .    and you heard him plainly .     quite plainly   said atwood .    you sure he didn t say  the curious admission of wallace  .    gonzalo said   or the furious decision in dallas .      atwood said   please  i haven t finished the story .  i was at the reading of the will .  i was asked to be .  also present were several of the distant relatives who hadn t visited poor lyon .  there were cousins and a young grand niece .  lyon wasn t a really rich man  but he left bequests to each of them  and one to an old servant  and one to his school .  i came last .  i received ten thousand dollars which had been placed in a safe deposit box for me and for which i would be given the key on request .    when the will was read and done with  i asked the lawyer for the key to the safe deposit box .  there is no use denying that i can find perfectly good use for ten thousand dollars .  the lawyer said that i must apply to the bank in which the box was to be found .  if i failed to do so in one year from that date  the bequest was revoked and was to be otherwise disposed of .    naturally  i asked where the bank was located and the lawyer said that except for the fact that it was located somewhere in the united states he could not say .  he had no further information except for one envelope which he had been instructed to hand to me and which he hoped would be useful .  he had one other envelope for himself which was to be opened at the end of one year if i had not  by then  claimed the money .    i accepted my envelope and found inside only the words i had heard from my friend s dying lips .   the curious omission in alice .    .   .   .  and that s where the matter now stands .    trumbull said   you mean you haven t got your ten thousand dollars .     i mean i haven t located the bank .  six months have passed and i have six months more .    gonzalo said   the phrase might be an anagram .  maybe if you rearrange the letters you will get the name of the bank .    atwood shrugged .   it s a possibility i ve thought of .  i can t remember sanders ever playing anagrams  but i ve tried that sort of thing .  i haven t come up with anything hopeful .    drake  who blew his nose again and looked as though he had no patience at the moment with careful reasoning  said   why don t you just go into every bank in white plains and ask if there is a key to a safe deposit box put away in your name .    avalon shook his head .   scarcely playing the game  jim   he said severely .    ten thousand dollars is no game   said gonzalo .   atwood said   i admit that i would feel as though i were cheating if   simply tried to solve it by hit or miss  but i must also admit that i cheated .  i tried the banks in several neighboring communities as well as in white plains .  i drew a blank .  i m not surprised at that  though .  it s unlikely he would place it near home .  he had the whole country to choose from .     did he make any trips out of town the last year of his life during the time he started talking will to you .   asked halsted .    i don t think so   said atwood .   but then he wouldn t have to .  his lawyer could attend to that part .     well   said trumbull   let s try it this way .  you ve had six months to think about it .  what conclusions have you come to .     nothing on the message itself   said atwood   but i knew my friend well .  he once told me that the best way to hide something was to make use of modern technology .  any document  any record  any set of directions could be converted into microfilm  and a tiny piece of material on which that was recorded could be hidden anywhere and never be uncovered by anything but blind luck .  i suppose that the message tells me where to find the microfilm .    rubin shrugged .   that only switches the focus of the problem .  instead of having the message tell us the location of the bank  it tells us the location of the microfilm .  that still leaves us with the curious omission .     i don t think it s quite the same   said atwood thoughtfully .   the bank may be thousands of miles away  but the piece of microfilm  or just an ordinary piece of very thin paper  for all i know  might be close at hand .  but no matter how close at hand  it might as well be a thousand miles away .   he sighed .   poor lyon will win this game  too  i m afraid .    trumbull said   if we tackled the problem for you  and managed to solve it  mr .  atwood  would you feel you had been cheating .     oh  yes   said mr .  atwood   but i would accept the ten thousand gladly just the same .    halsted said curiously   have you got some idea as to the moaning of the message  tom .     no   said trumbull   but if  as mr .  atwood says  we re looking for a tiny message in a nearby and accessible place  and if we assumed that mr .  sanders played fair  then maybe we could carry through some eliminations .   .   .   .  to whom did he leave his own house  mr .  atwood .    to a cousin  who has since sold it .    what was done to the contents .  surely sanders had books  games of all sorts  furniture .    most of it was sold at auction .    did anything go to you .     the cousin was kind enough to offer me whatever i wanted of such material as was not intrinsically valuable .  i didn t take anything .  i am not the collecting type myself .     would your old friend have known this of you .    oh  yes .   atwood stirred resdessly .   gentlemen  i have had six months to think of this .  i realize that sanders would not have hidden the fihn in his own house since he left it to someone else and knew i would have no opportunity to search it .  he had ample opportunity to hide it in my house  which he visited as often as i visited his  and it is in my house that i think it exists .    trumbull said   not necessarily .  he might have felt certain that there would be some favorite books  some certain memento  you would have asked for .     no   said atwood .   how could he be certain i would .  he would have left such an item to me in his will .     that would give it away   said avalon .   are you sure he never hinted that you ought to take something .  or that he didn t give you something casually .     no   said atwood  smiling .   you have no idea how unlike sanders that would be .   .  .  .  i tell you .  i have thought that since he gave me a year to find it  he must have been pretty confident that it would stay in place for  that length of time .  it wouldn t be likely to be part of something i might throw away  sell  or easily lose .    there was a murmur of agreement .   atwood said   he might very likely have pasted it over the molding of a wall  somewhere on the undersurface of a heavy piece of furniture  inside the refrigerator you see what i mean .     have you looked .   said gonzalo .    oh  yes   said atwood .   this little game has kept me busy .  i ve spent considerable spare time going over moldings and under surfaces and drawers and various insides .  i ve even spent time in the cellar and the attic .     obviously   said trumbull   you haven t found anything or we wouldn t be talking about it now .     no  i haven t but that doesn t mean anything .  the thing i m after might be so small as to be barely visible .  probably is .  i could look right at it and miss it  unless i knew i was in the right place and was somehow prepared to see it  if you know what i mean .     which brings us back   said avalon heavily   to the message .  if you understood it  you would know where to look and you would see it .     ah   said atwood   if i understood .     well  it seems to me   said avalon   that the key word is  alice .   does that name have any personal significance to you .  is it the name of someone you both knew .  is it the name of sanders  dead wife  for instance .  the nickname of some object .  some private joke you shared .     no .  no to all of that .    avalon smiled  showing his even teeth beneath his neatly trimmed  ever so slightly graying mustache .   then i would say that  alice  must refer to far and away the most famous alice in the minds of men alice in wonderland .     of course   said atwood  in clear surprise .   that s what makes it a literary puzzle and that s why i turned to my nephew who teaches english literature .  i assumed at the start it was a reference to the lewis carroll classic .   sanders was an alice enthusiast .  he had a collection of various editions of the book  and he had reproductions of the tenniel illustrations all over the house .     you never told us that   said avalon in hurt tones .   atwood said   haven t i .  i m sorry .  it s one of those things i know so well  i somehow expect everyone to know it .     we might have expected it   said trumbull  the corners of his mouth twisting down .   alice involves herself with a deck of cards in the book .     it always helps to have all pertinent information   said avalon stiffly .    well  then   said trumbull   that brings us to the curious omission in alice in wonderland .   .   .   .  and what curious omission is that .  have you any thoughts in that direction  mr .  atwood .     no   said atwood .   i read alice as a child and have never returned to it until the bequest  of course .  i must admit i ve never seen its charm .     good lord   muttered drake under his breath .  atwood heard him  for he turned his head sharply in drake s direction .   i don t deny there may be charm for others but i have never seen the fun in word play .  i m not surprised sanders enjoyed the book  though .  his sense of humor was rather raucous and primitive .  in any case  my dislike was compounded by my annoyance at having to detect an omission .  i did not wish to have to study the book that closely .  i hoped my nephew would help .    a teacher of literature .   said rubin derisively .   shut up  manny   said trumbull .   what did your nephew say  mr .  atwood .     as it happens   said atwood   mr .  rubin is right .  my nephew was entirely at sea .  he said there were a few passages in the original version of the story that lewis carroll had himself written in long hand that did not appear in the final published version .  as it happens  an edition of the prepublished version is available now .  i obtained a copy and checked through it .  i found nothing that seemed significant to me .    gonzalo said   listen .  where we go wrong  henry always tells us  is in getting too damned complex .  why don t we look at the message .  it says   the curious omission in alice .   maybe we don t have to look at the book .  there is a curious omission in the message itself .  the name of the book isn t alice .  it s alice in wonderland .   avalon emerged from his wounded silence long enough to say   it s alice s adventures in wonderland  if you wish to be accurate .     all right   said gonzalo   alice s adventures in wonderland .  then we ought to concentrate on the rest of the title  which is omitted in the message .   .   .   .  isn t that right  henry .    henry  standing quietly by the sideboard  said   it is certainly an interesting point  mr .  gonzalo .     interesting  hell   said trumbull .   what s curious about it .  it s an omission of convenience .  lots of people would say alice .    halsted said   quite apart from that  i don t see what adventures in wonderland would mean .  it s no more helpful than the original message .  here s my idea .  alice in wonderland beg pardon  jeff  alice s adventures in wonderland contains verses  most of which are parodies of well established poems of the day     poor ones   said rubin .    beside the point   said halsted .   they are not perfect parodies  however .  some verses are omitted .  for instance  alice recites a poem beginning  how doth the little crocodile   which is a parody of isaac watts s dreadful poem  how doth  the little busy bee   though i don t think that s the actual title of the poem .  alice recites only two stanzas and i m sure watts s poem has at least four .  maybe the answer lies in the missing verses of the original .     is that a curious omission .   said trumbull .    i don t know .  i don t remember the original version except for the first line  but it should be looked up .   .   .   .  the other originals to the parodies should be studied  too .     i ll be glad to do so   said atwood politely .   the point had not occurred to me .    drake said   i think that s a crock of crud .  the message refers to a curious omission in alice .  i think it means in alice as it now stands and not in some outside source .    you can t know that   protested halsted .   yes  but that s the point   said trumbull .   it seems to me that if we get the right answer  we ll know at once it s right  and if we work out something that only uncovers a new layer of puzzle  that s just wrong .    avalon said   well  nothing more occurs to me .  do we ask henry .    atwood looked puzzled  and avalon went on   you have to understand  mr .  atwood  that henry  whose pleasure it seems to be to wait on us  has the faculty for seeing past complications .    gonzalo said   that s what i tried to do and you all ran me down .   .   .   .  henry  isn t the answer in the full title of the book .    henry smiled regretfully and said   gentlemen  you must not put more on my shoulders than i can carry .  i do not know the book very well  though i ve read it  of course .  if i m to penetrate the meaning of the puzzle  it will have to be very simple .     if it were very simple   said atwood   we would have seen it .     perhaps   said henry   yet it seems to me it must be simple .  surely  your friend  mr .  sanders  wanted you to have the bequest .  he put it in a game  and made a contest out of it  because that was his way  but he must have wanted you to win .    atwood nodded .   i would think so .    then let s look for something very simple he felt you would surely see  but just subtle enough  perhaps  to make the game interesting .  as i said  i don t know the book very well  so i ll have to ask questions .     very well  sir .  mr .  trumbull said alice in wonderland involved a deck of cards  and i do remember  from the disney cartoon version more than from anything else  that the queen of hearts kept shouting  off with his head .       yes   said avalon .   a female henry viii .  the king of hearts and the knave of hearts are also involved .     any other cards .     they re all mentioned   said avalon .   the hearts are the royal family  the clubs are soldiers  the diamonds courtiers  the spades workmen .  three of the spades have speaking parts  the two  the five  and the nine .   .  .  .  do you agree with me  atwood .     yes   said atwood grimly .   it s fresh in my mind .    trumbull said     suspect henry is going to ask if any of the cards were omitted .  only a few are mentioned specifically     the six i listed   said avalon .   the king  queen  and knave of hearts  the two  five  and nine of spades .     but so what .   said trumbull .   as many as necessary were mentioned and the rest were there in the background .  there s nothing  curious  about that .  i insist on respecting the word  curious .      henry nodded  then said   are you an episcopalian  mr .  atwood .     i was brought up an episcopalian .  why do you ask .     you said mr .  sanders teased you about your high church proclivities and you said you were a protestant .  putting those together  i felt you might be an episcopalian .   .   .   .  do you have a chess set  mr .  atwood .     certainly .     yours .  or was it a present from mr .  sanders .     oh  no  mine .  a rather beautiful set that belonged to my father .  sanders and i played many a game on it .    henry nodded .   i ask because it seems to me that we ve all discussed alice in wonderland without mentioning that there was a sequel .     through the looking glass   said avalon .   yes  of course .     might that not be considered as included in the word alice .    avalon nodded .   certainly .  as it happens  the full title is through the looking glass and what alice found there  so it surely bears as much right to be referred to as alice as the other does .     and isn t through the looking glass about chessmen .     absolutely   said avalon benevolently  his role as recognized expert having completely restored his good humor .   the red and white queens are important characters .  the white king has a speaking role but the red king just sleeps under a tree .    and there are knights  too .    avalon nodded .   the white knight has a battle with the red knight and then escorts alice to the final square .  he s the most amiable character in either book and the only one who seems to like alice  he s usually considered a serf portrait by carroll .     yes  yes   said trumbull testily .   what are you getting at  henry .     i m looking for omissions .  there is a reference to a white pawn at the start of the book  i think .    avalon said   i don t think you re as unknowledgeable about the books as you pretend  henry .  there is a mention of a white pawn named lily in the first chapter .  alice herself plays the part of a white pawn  too  and is eventually promoted to a white queen .     and rooks .   said henry .  avalon frowned in silence for a while  then shook his head .   atwood interposed .   there s a reference to them .  take my word for it  i know the stupid books practically by heart .  in chapter    alice enters the looking glass house  sees chessmen moving about  and says to herself   and here are two castles walking arm in arm .   the castles  of course  are also called rooks .   henry said   that accounts  then  for the king  queen  rook  knight  and pawn .  but there is a sixth chesspiece  the bishop .  does it play a role in the book or is it even mentioned .    avalon said   no .    atwood said   two bishops are shown in one of the illustrations to the first chapter .     that s tenniel s work   said henry   not carroll s .  now isn t the total absence of the bishop a curious omission .     i don t know   said avalon slowly .   lewis carroll  a thorough going victorian  probably feared giving offense to the church .     isn t it curious to have him go so far in avoiding offense .     well  supposing it is .   asked halsted .   henry said   i think it possible that if mr .  atwood checks the four bishops of his set  a set which mr .  sanders knew mr .  atwood cherished and would neither sell  give away  or lose  he will probably find the piece of film .  if the head comes off  he should look inside .  if the head doesn t come off  pull off the piece of felt it stands on .    there was an uncomfortable silence .   that s farfetched  henry   said trumbull .    perhaps not  sir   said henry .   mr .  sanders has more than once been described as having a raucous sense of humor .  he teased mr .  atwood constantly about his religion .  perhaps this final message is another way of continuing the joke .  you are an episcopalian  mr .  atwood  and i suppose you know what the word means .     it s from the greek word for bishop   said atwood  half choking .    i imagine  then   said henry   mr .  sanders might think it funny to hide the message in a bishop .    atwood started to his feet .   i think i had better go home .     i ll take you   said halsted .    i think the snow has stopped   said henry   but drive carefully .     afterword  this  in a way  is a twice told tale .   at a time before i had begun the black widowers series  i was asked by union carbide corporation to write a short mystery without a solution for a contest they were running for their employees  who were to supply solutions  with myself making the final judgment on excellence .   well  i wrote the short mystery  which was rather like the story you have just read .  the contest was carried through successfully  two other writers also supplied short mysteries  and all was well .   however  i was made restless by the fact that the short mystery i wrote was never published except on the book jacket of an edition of the adventures of sherlock holmes which was given out to the contest applicants .  that seemed a waste to me  and i abhor literary waste .  it was especially annoying since the story appeared without my solution .   so i completely rewrote the story  lengthening it a good deal  placing it against the black widower background  and now i feel ever so much better .  especially since now my solution is included .           out of sight     the monthly banquet of the black widowers had reached the point where little was left of the mixed grill save for an occasional sausage and a markedly untouched piece of liver on the plate of emmanuel rubin and it was then that voices rose in homeric combat .   rubin  undoubtedly infuriated by the presence of liver at all  was saying  even more flatly than was usual for him   poetry is sound .  you don t look at poetry .  i don t care whether a culture emphasizes rhyme  alliteration  repetition  balance  or cadence  it all comes down to sound .    roger halsted never raised his voice  but one could always tell the state of his emotions by the color of his high forehead .  right now  it was a deep pink  the color extending past the line that had once marked hair .  he said   what s the use of making generalizations  manny .  no generalization can hold generally without an airtight system of axiomatics to begin with .  literature     if you re going to tell me about figurative verse   said rubin body   save your breath .  that s victorian nonsense .     what s figurative verse .   asked mario gonzalo lazily .   is he making that up  jeff .   he added a touch to the tousled hair in his careful caricature of the banquet guest  waldemar long  who  since the dinner had begun  had eaten in a somber silence  but was obviously following every word .    no   said geoffrey avalon judiciously   though i wouldn t put it past manny to make something up if that were the only way he could win an argument .  figurative verse is verse in which the words or lines are arranged typographically in such a way as to produce a visual image that reinforces the sense .   the mouse s tail  in alice in wonderland is the best known example .    halsted s soft voice was unequal to the free for all and he methodically beat his spoon against the water goblet till the decibels had simmered down .   he said   let s be reasonable .  the subject under discussion is not poetry in general  but the limerick as a verse form .  my point is this i ll repeat it  manny that the worth of a limerick is not dictated by its subject matter .  it s easier    james drake stubbed out his cigarette  twitched his small grizzled mustache  and said in his hoarse voice   why do you call a dirty limerick dirty .  the supreme court will get you .    halsted said   because it s a two syllable word with a meaning you all understand .  what do you want me to say .  sexual excretory blasphemous and miscellaneous generally irreverent .    avalon said   go on  roger .  go on .  make your point and don t let them needle you .   and  from under his luxuriant eyebrows  he frowned austerely at the table generally .   let him talk .     why .   said rubin .   he has nothing to  .  .  .  okay  jeff .  talk  roger .     thank you all   said halsted  in the wounded tone of one who has finally succeeded in having his wrong recognized .   the worth of a limerick rests in the unpredictability of the last line and in the cleverness of the final rhyme .  in fact  irreverent content may seem to have value in itself and require less cleverness and produce a less worthwhile limerick  as limerick .  now it is possible to have the rhyme masked by the orthographical conventions .     what .   said gonzalo .   spelling   said avalon .    and then   said halsted   in seeing the spelling and having that instant of delay in getting the sound  you intensify the enjoyment .  but under those conditions you have to see the limerick .  if you just recite it  the excellence is lost .     suppose you give us an example   said drake .    i know what he means   said rubin loudly .   he s going to rhyme m . a .  and c . d .  master of arts and caster of darts .     that s an example that s been used   admitted halsted   but it s extreme .  it takes too long to catch on and amusement is drowned in irritation .  as it happens  i ve made up a limerick while we were having the argument    and now  for the first time  thomas trumbull entered this part of the discussion .  his tanned and wrinkled face twisted into a dark scowl and he said   the hell you did .  you made it up yesterday and you engineered this whole silly nonsense so you could recite it .  if it s one of your iliad things  i ll personally kick you out of here .     it s not the iliad   said halsted .   i haven t been working on that recently .  it s no use my reciting this one  of course .  i ll write it down and pass it around .    he wrote in dark block letters on an unused napkin    you can t call the british queen ms .   tain t as nice as elizabeth is .   but i think that the queen  would be even less keen  to have herself mentioned as ls .   gonzalo laughed aloud when it came too him .  he said   sure  if you know that ms is pronounced miz  then you pronounce ls as liz .     to me   said drake scornfully   ls would have to stand for  lanuscript  if it s going to rhyme with ms .    avalon pursed his lips and shook his head .   using tain t is a flaw .  you ought to lose a syllable some other way .  and to be perfectly consistent  shouldn t the rhyme word is be spelled simply s .    halsted nodded eagerly .   you re quite right  and i thought of doing that  but it wouldn t be transparent  enough and the reader wouldn t get it fast enough to laugh .  secondly  it would be the cleverest part of the limerick and would make the ls anticlimactic .     do you really have to waste all that fancy reasoning on a piece of crap like this .   asked trumbull .    i think i ve made my point   said halsted .   the humor can be visual .    trumbull said   well  then  drop the subject .  since i m host this session  that s an order .   .   .   .  henry  where s the damned dessert .     it s here  sir   said henry softly .  unmoved by trum bull s tone  he deftly cleared the table and dealt out the blueberry shortcake .   the coffee had already been poured and trumbull s guest said in a low voice   may i have tea  please .    the guest had a long upper lip and an equally long chin .  the hair on his head was shaggy but there was none on his face and he had walked with a somewhat bearlike stoop .  when he was first introduced  only rubin had registered any recognition .   he had said   aren t you with nasa .    waldemar long had answered with a startled  yes  as though he had been disturbed out of a half resentful resignation to anonymity .  he had then frowned .  he was frowning now again as henry poured the tea and melted unobtrusively into the background .   trumbull said   i think the time has come for our guest to enter the discussion and perhaps add some portion of sense to what has been an unusually foolish evening .     no  that s all right  tom   said long .   i don t mind frivolity .   he had a deep and rather beautiful voice that had a definite note of sadness in it .  he went on   i have no aptitude for badinage myself  but i enjoy listening to it .    halsted  still brooding over the matter of the limericks  said  with sudden forcefulness   i suggest manny not be the grill master on this occasion .     no .   said rubin  his sparse beard lifting belligerently .    no .  i put it to you  tom .  if manny questions our  guest  he will surely bring up the space program since there s a nasa connection .  then we will go through the same darned argument we ve had a hundred times .  i m sick of the whole subject of space and whether we ought to be on the moon .     not half as sick as i am   said long  rather unexpectedly   i d just as soon not discuss any aspect of space exploration .    the heavy flatness of the remark seemed to dampen spirits all around .  even halsted seemed momentarily at a loss for any other subject to introduce to someone connected with nasa .   then rubin stirred in his seat and said   i take it  dr .  long  that this is a recently developed attitude of yours .    long s head turned suddenly toward rubin .  his eyes narrowed .   why do you say that  mr .  rubin .    rubin s small face came as close to a simper as it ever did .   elementary  my dear dr .  long .  you were on the cruise that went down to see the apollo shot last winter .  i d been invited as a literary representative of the intellectual community  but i couldn t go .  however  i got the promotional literature and noticed you were along .  you were going to lecture on some aspect of the space program  i forget which  and that was voluntary .  so your disenchantment with the subject must have arisen in the six months since the cruise .    long nodded his head very slightly a number of times and said   i seem to be more heard of in that connection than in any other in my life .  the damned cruise has made me famous  too .     i ll go farther   said rubin enthusiastically   and suggest that something happened on the cruise that disenchanted you with space exploration  maybe to the point where you re thinking of leaving nasa and going into some other field of work altogether .    long s stare was fixed now .  he pointed a finger at rubin  a long finger that showed no signs of tremor  and said   don t play games .   then  with a controlled anger  he rose from his chair and said   i m sorry  tom .  thanks for the meal  but i ll go now .    everyone rose at once  speaking simultaneously  all but rubin  who remained sitting with a look of stunned astonishment on his face .   trumbull s voice rose above the rest .   now wait a while  waldemar .  god damn it  will all of you sit down .  waldemar  you too .  what s the excitement about .  rubin  what is all this .    rubin looked down at his empty coffeecup and lifted it as though he wished there were coffee in it so that he could delay matters by taking a sip .   i was just demonstrating a chain of logic .  after all  i write mysteries .  i seem to have touched a nerve .   then  gratefully  he said   thanks  henry   as the cup before him sparkled black to the brim .    what chain of logic .   demanded trumbull .    okay  here it is .  dr .  long said   the damned cruise has made me famous  too .   he said  too  and emphasized the word .  that means it did something else for him and since we were talking about his distaste for the whole subject of space exploration  i deduced that the something else it had done was to supply him with that distaste .  from his bearing i guessed it was sharp enough to make him want to quit his job .  that s all there is to it .    long nodded his head again  in precisely the same slight and rapid way as before  and then settled back in his seat .   all right .  i m sorry  mr .  rubin .  i jumped too soon .  the fact is i will be leaving nasa .  to all intents and purposes  i have left it and at the point of a shoe .  that s all .   .  .  .  we ll change the subject .  tom  you said coming here would get me out of my dumps  but it hasn t worked that way .  rather  my mood has infected you all and i ve cast a damper on the party .  forgive me  all of you .    avalon put a finger to his neat  graying mustache and stroked it gently .  he said   actually  sir  you have supplied us with something we all like above all things the opportunity to exert our curiosity .  may we question you on this matter .     it s not something i m free to talk about   said long  guardedly .   trumbull said   you can if you want to  waldemar .  you needn t mention sensitive details  but as far as anything else is concerned  everything said in this room is confidential .  and  as i always add when i find it necessary to make that statement  the confidentiality includes our esteemed friend henry .    henry  who was standing at the sideboard  smiled briefly .   long hesitated .  then he said   actually  your curiosity is easily satisfied and i suspect that mr .  rubin  at least  with his aptitude for guessing  has already deduced the details .  i m suspected of having been indiscreet  either deliberately or carelessly  and  either way  i may find myself unofficially  but very effectively  blocked off from any future position in my field of competence .     you mean you ll be blackballed .   said drake .    that s a word   said long   that s never used .  but that s what it will amount to .     i take it   said drake   you weren t indiscreet .     on the contrary  i was .   long shook his head .   i haven t denied that .  the trouble is they think the story is worse than i admit .    there was another pause and then avalon  speaking in his most impressively austere tone  said   well  sir  what story .  is there anything you can tell us about it or must you leave it at no more than what you have already said .    long passed a hand over his face  then pushed his chair away from the table so that he could lean his head back against the wall .   he said   it s so damned undramatic .  i was on this cruise  as mr .  rubin told you .  i was going to give a talk on certain space projects  rather far out ones  and planned on going into detail on exactly what was being done in certain fascinating directions .  i can t give you those details .  i found that out the hard way .  some of the stuff had been classified  but i had been told i could talk about it .  then  on the day before i was to give my lecture  i got a radiophone call saying it was all off .  there was to be no declassification .    i was furious .  there s no use denying i have a temper and i also have very little gift for spontaneous lecturing .  i had carefully written out the lecture and i had intended to read it .  i know that s not a good way of giving a talk  but it s the best i can do .  now i had nothing left to give to a group of people who had paid  considerable money to listen to me .  it was a damned embarrassing position .     what did you do .   asked avalon .   long shook his head .   i held a rather pathetic ques tion and answer session the next day .  it didn t go over at all well .  it was worse than just not having a talk .  by that time  you see  i knew i was in considerable trouble .     in what way  sir .   said avalon .    if you want the fun story   said long   here it is .  i m not exactly talkative at meals  as you may perhaps have noticed  but when i went in to dinner after getting the call  i suppose i put on a passable imitation of a corpse that had died with an angry look on its face .  the rest tried to draw me into the conversation  if only  i suppose  to keep me from poisoning the atmosphere .  finally one of them said   well  dr .  long  what will you be talking about tomorrow .   and i blew up and said   nothing .  nothing at all .  i ve got the paper all written out and it s sitting there on the desk in my cabin and i can t give it because i just found out the material is still classified .       and then the paper was stolen .   said gonzalo excitedly .    no .  why steal anything these days .  it was photographed .     are you sure .     i was sure at the time .  when i got back to my cabin after dinner the door was not locked and the papers had been moved .  since then  it s become certain .  we have proof that the information has leaked .    there was a rather depressed silence at that .  then trumbull said   who could have done it .  who heard you .     everyone at the table   said long despondently .   rubin said   you have a strong voice  dr .  long  and if you were as angry as i think you were  you spoke forcefully .  probably a number of the people at adjoining tables heard you .     no   said long  shaking his head .   i spoke through clenched teeth  not loudly .  besides  you don t realize what the cruise was like .  the cruise was badly undersubscribed  you see poor promotion  poor management .  the ship was carrying only forty percent capacity and the shipping company is supposed to have lost a packet .     in that case   said avalon   it must have been a dreary experience apart from your misadventure .     on the contrary  up to that point it was very pleasant for me  and it continued to be very pleasant for all the rest  i imagine .  the crew nearly outnumbered the passengers and the service was excellent .  all the facilities were available without crowding .  they scattered us through the dining room and gave us privacy .  there were seven of us at our dining table .  lucky seven  someone said at the beginning   for a moment long s look of grimness deepened .   none of the tables near us were occupied .  i m quite certain that nothing any of us said was heard anywhere but at our own table .     then there are seven suspects   said gonzalo thoughtfully .    six  since you needn t count me   said long .   i knew where the paper was and what it was .  i didn t have to hear myself to know that .     you re under suspicion  too .  or you implied that   said gonzalo .    not to myself   said long .   trumbull said peevishly   i wish you had come to me with this  waldemar .  i ve been worrying over your obvious green and yellow attitude for months .     what would you have done if i had told you .   trumbull considered .   damn it  i d have brought you here .   .  .  .  all right .  tell us about the six at the table .  who were they .     one was the ship s doctor  a good looking dutchman in an impressive uniform .    rubin said   he would be .  the ship was one of the holland american liners  wasn t it .     yes .  the officers were dutch and the crew the waiters  stewards  and so on  were mostly indonesian .  they d all had three month cram courses in english  but we communicated mostly in sign language .  i don t complain  though .  they were pleasant and hard working  and all the more efficient since there was considerably less than the ordinary complement of passengers .     any reason to suspect the doctor .   asked drake .   long nodded .   i suspected them all .  the doctor was a silent man  he and i were the two silent ones .  the other five made a continuous uproar  much as you do here at this table .  he and i listened .  what i ve brooded about in connection with him was that it was he who asked me about my talk .  asking a personal question like that was uncharacteristic .     he may have been worried about you medically   said halsted .   he may have been trying to draw you out .     maybe   said long indifferently .   i remember every detail of that dinner  i ve gone over and over it in my mind .  it was an ethnic dinner  so everyone was supplied with little dutch hats made out of paper and special indonesian dishes were supplied .  i wore the hat but i hate curried food and the doctor asked about my speech just as a small dish of curried lamb was put before me as an hors d oeuvre .  between fuming over official stupidity and sickening over the smell of curry  i just burst out .  if it hadn t been for the curry  perhaps    anyway  after dinner i discovered that someone had been in my cabin .  the contents of the paper weren t so important  classification or not  but what was important was that someone had taken action so quickly .  someone on the ship was part of a spy network and that was more important than the actual coup .  even if the present item were not important  the next might be .  it was important to report the matter and  as a loyal citizen  i did .    rubin said   isn t the doctor the logical suspect .  he asked the question and he would be listening to the answer .  the others might not have .  as an officer  he would be used to the ship  know how to get to your cabin quick   ly  perhaps have a duplicate key ready .  did he have an opportunity to get to your cabin before you did .     yes  he did   said long .   i thought of all that .  the trouble is this .  everyone at the table heard me  because all the rest talked about the system of classification for a while .  i kept quiet myself but i remember the matter of the pentagon papers came up .  and everyone knew where my cabin was because i had given a small party in it for the table the day before .  and those locks are easy to open for anyone with a little skill at it though it was a mistake not to close it again on leaving  but whoever it was had to be in a hurry .  and  as it happened  everyone at the table had a chance to get to the cabin during the course of the meal .     who were the others  then .   asked halsted .    two married couples and a single woman .  the single woman call her miss robinson was pretty  a little on the plump side  had a pleasant sense of humor  but had the bad habit of smoking during the meal .  i rather think she liked the doctor .  she sat between us we always had the same seats .     when did she have a chance to reach your cabin .   asked halsted .    she left shortly after i made my remark .  i was brooding too deeply to be aware of it at the time but of course i remembered it afterward .  she came back before the fuss over the hot chocolate came up because i remember her trying to help .     where did she say she went .     nobody asked her at the time .  she was asked afterward and she said she had gone to her cabin to go to the bathroom .  maybe she did .  but her cabin was reasonably near mine .     no one saw her at all .     no one would .  everyone was in the dining room and to the indonesians all americans look alike .    avalon said   what s the fuss over the hot chocolate you referred to .    long said   that s where one of the married couples  comes in .  call them the smiths and the other one the joneses  or the other way around .  it doesn t matter .  mr .  smith was the raucous type .  he reminded me  in fact  of     oh  lord   said rubin .   don t say it .     all right  i won t .  he was one of the lecturers .  in fact  both smith and jones were .  smith talked fast  laughed easily  turned everything into a double entendre  and seemed to enjoy it all so much he had the rest of us doing it  too .  he was a very odd person .  the kind of fellow you can t help but take an instant dislike to and judge to be stupid .  but then  as you get used to him  you find you like him after all and that under the surface nonsense  he s extremely intelligent .  the first evening  i remember  the doctor kept staring at him as if he were a mental specimen  but by the end of the cruise  he was clearly pleased with smith .    jones was much quieter .  he seemed horrified  at first  by smith s outrageous comments but eventually he was matching him  i noticed rather  i think  to smith s discomfiture .    avalon said   what were their fields .     smith was a sociologist and jones a biologist .  the idea was that space exploration was to be viewed in the light of many disciplines .  it was a good concept but showed serious flaws in the execution .  some of the talks  though  were excellent .  there was one on mariner   and the new data on mars that was superb  but that s beside the point .    it was mrs .  smith who created the confusion .  she was a moderately tall  thin girl .  not very good looking by the usual standards but with an extraordinarily attractive personality .  she was soft spoken and clearly went through life automatically thinking of others .  i believe everyone quickly grew to feel quite affectionate to her and smith himself seemed devoted .  the evening i shot my mouth off  she ordered hot chocolate .  it came in a tall glass  very top heavy  and  of course  as a mistaken touch of elegance  it was brought on a tray .    smith  as usual  was talking animatedly and waving  his arms as he did so .  he used all his muscles when he talked .  the ship swayed  he swayed well  anyway  the hot chocolate went into mrs .  smith s lap .    she jumped up .  so did everyone else .  miss robinson moved quickly toward her to help .  i noticed that and that s how i know she was back by then .  mrs .  smith waved help away and left in a hurry .  smith  looking suddenly confused and upset  tore off the paper dutch hat he was wearing and followed .  five minutes later he was back  talking earnestly to the head steward .  then he came to the table and said that mrs .  smith had sent him down to assure the steward that she was wearing nothing that couldn t be washed  that she hadn t been hurt  that it wasn t anyone s fault  that no one was to be blamed .    he wanted to assure us she was all right  too .  he asked if we could stay at the table till his wife came back .  she was changing clothes and wanted to join us again so that none of us would feel as though anything very terrible had happened .  we agreed  of course .  none of us were going anywhere .    avalon said   and that means she had time to get to your cabin .    long nodded .   yes  i suppose so .  she didn t seem the type but i suppose in this game you disregard surface appearances .     and you all waited .     not the doctor .  he got up and said he would get some ointment from his office in case she needed it for burns  but he came back before she did by a minute or so .    avalon said  tapping his finger on the table slowly to lend emphasis   and he might have been at the cabin  too  then .  and miss robinson might  when she left before the hot chocolate incident .    rubin said   where do the joneses come in .    long said   let me go on .  when mrs .  smith came back she denied having bean burned and the doctor had no need to give her the ointment  so we can t say if he even went to get it .  he might have been bluffing .     what if she had asked for it .   said halsted .    then he might have said he couldn t find what he had been looking for but if she came with him he d do what he could .  who knows .  in any case  we all sat for a while almost as though nothing had happened and then  finally  it broke up .  by that time  we were the last occupied table .  everyone left  with mrs .  jones and myself lingering behind for a while .     mrs .  jones .   asked drake .    i haven t told you about mrs .  jones .  dark hair and eyes  very vivacious .  had a penchant for sharp cheeses  always taking a bit of each off the tray when it was brought round .  she had a way of looking at you when you talk that had you convinced you were the only object she saw .  i think jones was rather a jealous type in his quiet way .  at least  i never saw him more than two feet from her  except this one time .  he got up and said he was going to the cabin and she said she would be there soon .  then she turned to me and said   can you explain why those terraced icefields on mars are significant .  i ve been meaning to ask you all during dinner and didn t get a chance .     it had been that day that we had had the magnificent talk on mars and i was rather flattered that she turned to me instead of to the astronomer who had given the talk .  it seemed as though she were taking it for granted i knew as much as he did .  so i talked to her for a while and she kept saying   how interesting .      avalon said   and meanwhile  jones could have been in your cabin .     could be .  i thought of that afterward .  it was certainly atypical behavior on both their parts .    avalon said   let s summarize  then .  there are four possibilities .  miss robinson might have done it when she left before the hot chocolate incident .  the smiths might have done it as a team  mr .  smith  deliberately spilling the hot chocolate  so that mrs .  smith could do the dirty work .  or the doctor could have done it while going for the ointment .  or the joneses could have done it as a team  with jones doing the dirty work while mrs .  jones kept dr .  long out of action .    long nodded .   all this was considered and by the time the ship was back in new york  security agents had begun the process of checking the background of all six .  you see  in cases like this  suspicion is all you need .  the only way any secret agent can remain undetected is for him or her to remain unsuspected .  once the eye of coun terintelligence is upon him  he must inevitably be unmasked .  no cover can survive an investigation in depth .   drake said   then which one did it prove to be .   long sighed .   that s where the trouble arose .  none of them .  all were clean .  there was no way  i understand  of showing any of them to be anything other than what they seemed .    rubin said   why do you say you  understand .   aren t you part of the investigation .     at the wrong end .  the cleaner those six are  the dirtier i appear to be .  i told the investigators i had to tell them that those six are the only ones who could possibly have done it  and if none of them did  they must suspect me of making up a story to hide something worse .    trumbull said   oh  hell  waldemar .  they can t think that .  what would you have to gain by reporting the incident if you were responsible .     that s what they don t know   said long .   but the information did leak and if they can t pin it on any of the six  then they re going to pin it on me .  and the more my motives puzzle them  the more they think those motives must be very disturbing indeed .  so i m in trouble .    rubin said   are you sure those six are indeed the only possibilities .  are you sure you really didn t mention it to anyone else .     quite sure   said long dryly .    you might not remember having done so   said rubin .   it could have been something very casual .  can you be sure you didn t .     i can be sure i didn t .  the radiophone call came not long before dinner .  there just wasn t time to tell anyone before dinner .  and once i got away from the table  i was back in the cabin before i as much as said anything to anybody .  anything at all .     who heard you on the phone .  maybe there were eavesdroppers .     there were ship s officers standing around  certainly .  however  my boss expressed himself aesopically .  i knew what he meant  but no one else would have .     did you express yourself aesopically .   asked halsted .   i ll tell you exactly what i said .   hello  dave .   then i said   god damn it to hell .   then i hung up .  i said those seven words .  no more .    gonzalo brought his hands together in a sudden  enthusiastic clap .   listen  i ve been thinking .  why does the job have to be so planned .  it could be spontaneous .  after all  everybody knows there s this cruise and people connected with nasa are going to talk and there might be something interesting on .  someone it could have been anyone kept searching various rooms during the dinner hour each day and finally came across your paper     no   said long sharply .   it passes the bounds of plausibility to suppose that someone would  just by chance  find my paper just in the hour or two after i had announced that a classified lecture was sitting on my desk .  besides  there was nothing in the paper that would have given any indication of importance to the nonexpert .  it was only my own remark that would have told anyone it was there and that it was important .    avalon said thoughtfully   suppose one of the people at the table passed on the information  in perfect innocence .  in the interval they were away from the table  they might have said to someone   did you hear about poor dr .  long .  his paper was shot out from under him .   then that someone  anyone  could have done the job .    long shook his head .   i wish that could be so  but it can t .  that would only happen if the particular individual at my table were innocent .  if the smiths were innocent when they left the table  the only thing on their minds would be the hot chocolate .  they wouldn t stop to chat .  the doctor would be thinking only of getting the ointment .  by the time jones left the table  assuming he was innocent  he would have forgotten about the matter .  if anything  he would talk about the hot chocolate  too .    rubin said suddenly  voice rising   all right .  what about miss robinson .  she left before the hot chocolate incident .  the only interesting thing in her mind would have been your dilemma .  she might have said something .     might she .   said long .   if she is innocent  then she was really doing what she said she was doing  going to the bathroom in her cabin .  if she had to desert the dinner table to do so  there would have had to be urgency  and no one under those conditions stops for idle gossip .    there was silence all around the table .   long said   i m sure investigation will continue and eventually the truth will come out and it will be clear that i m guilty of no more than an unlucky indiscretion .  by then  though  my career will be down the drain .     dr .  long .   said a soft voice .   may i ask a question .    long looked up  surprised .   a question .     i m henry  sir .  the gentlemen of the black widowers organization occasionally allow me to participate     hell  yes  henry   said trumbull .   do you see something the rest of us don t .     i m not certain   said henry .   i see quite plainly that dr .  long believes only the six others at the table might possibly be involved  and those investigating the matter apparently agree with him     there s no way not to   said long .    well  then   said henry .   i am wondering if dr .  long mentioned his views on curry to the investigators .    long said   you mean that i didn t like curry .     yes   said henry .   did that come up .    long spread his hands and then shook his head .   no  i don t think it did .  why should it .  it s irrelevant .  it s just an additional excuse for my talking like a jackass .  i tell it to you here in order to collect sympathy  i suppose  but it would carry no weight with the investigators .    henry remained silent for a moment  and trumbull said   does the curry have meaning to you  henry .     i think perhaps it does   said henry .   i think we are in rather the position mr .  halsted described earlier in the evening in connection with limericks .  some limericks to be effective must be seen  sound is not enough .  and some scenes to be effective must be seen .     i don t get that   said long .    well  dr .  long   said henry .   you sat there in the ship s restaurant at a table with six other people and therefore only those six other people heard you .  but if we could see the scene instead of having you describe it to us  would we see something clearly that you have omitted .     no  you wouldn t   said long doggedly .    are you sure .   asked henry .   you sit here with six other people at a table  too  just as you did on the ship .  how many people hear your story .     six   began long .   and then gonzalo broke in   seven  counting you  henry .     and was there no one serving you at table  dr .  long .  you said the doctor had asked you about the speech just as curried lamb was put before you and it was the smell of curry that annoyed you to the point where you burst out with your indiscretion .  surely  the curried lamb didn t place itself before you of its own accord .  the fact is that at the moment you made your statement  there were six people at the table before you  and a seventh standing just behind you and out of sight .     the waiter   said long in a whisper .   henry said   there s a tendency never to notice a waiter unless he annoys you .  an efficient waiter is invisible  and you mentioned the excellence of the service .  might it not have been the waiter who carefully engineered the spilling of the hot chocolate to create a diversion  or perhaps he who took advantage of the diversion  if it was an accident .  with waiters many and diners few  it might not be too noticeable if he vanished for a while .   or he could claim to have gone to the men s room if it were indeed noticed .  he would know the location of the cabin as well as the doctor did  and be as likely to have some sort of picklock .    long said   but he was an indonesian .  he couldn t speak english .     are you sure .  he d had a three month cram course  you said .  and he might have known english better than he pretended .  you would be willing to conceive that mrs .  smith was not as sweet and thoughtful underneath as on the surface  and that mrs .  jones s vivacity was pretense  and the doctor s respectability and smith s liveliness and jones s devotion and miss robinson s need to go to the bathroom .  might not the waiter s ignorance of english also be pretense .     by god   said long  looking at his watch .   if it weren t so late  i d call washington now .    trumbull said   if you know some home phone numbers  do call now .  it s your career .  tell them the waiter ought to be investigated  and for heaven s sake  don t tell them you got the notion from someone else .     you mean  tell them i just thought of it .  they ll ask why i didn t think of that before .     ask them why they didn t .  why didn t they think a waiter goes with a table .    henry said softly   no reason for anyone to think of it .  only very few are as interested in waiters as i am .      afterword  this story appeared in the december      issue of ellery queen s mystery magazine under the title  the six suspects .   again  i prefer my own title .   the inspiration here arose out of the fact that i was on a cruise like the one described in the story .  some of the events even happened but  i hasten to say  there were no scientific secrets on board as far as i know and no mystery .   one last word .  based on past experience  i am going to get a lot of letters asking me if i intend to write more black widowers stories .  let me answer that with a firm and definite  yes .  that  perhaps  will abort the letters .   as a matter of fact  i have at the moment of this writing  completed and sold six more black widowers  five to ellery queen s mystery magazine and one to the magazine of fantasy and science fiction .  you see  then  that it is quite possible that eventually you will be asked to read something entitled more tales of the black widowers .   i hope so  because its  fun writing these stories and thank you all for reading them .
