after the bombs     it was nine o   clock in the evening  in blackbury high street .   it was dark  with occasional light from the full moon behind streamers of worn out cloud .  the wind was from the southwest and there had been another thunderstorm  which freshened the air and made the cobbles slippery .   a police sergeant moved  very slowly and sedately  along the street .   here and there  if someone was very close  they might have seen the faintest line of light around a blacked out window .  from within came the quiet sounds of people living their lives   the muffled notes of a piano as someone practiced scales  over and over again  and the murmur and occasional burst of laughter from the radio .   some of the shop windows had sandbags piled in front of them .  a poster outside one shop urged people to dig for victory  as if it were some kind of turnip .   on the horizon  in the direction of slate  the thin beams of searchlights tried to pry bombers out of the clouds .   the policeman turned the corner and walked up the next street  his boots seeming very loud in the stillness .   the beat took him up as far as the methodist chapel  and in theory would then take him down paradise street  but it didn   t do that tonight because there was no paradise street anymore .  not since last night .   there was a truck parked by the chapel .  light leaked out from the tarpaulin that covered the back .   he banged on it .      you can   t park that    ere  gents     he said .     i fine you one mug of tea and we shall say no more about it  eh .      the tarpaulin was pushed back and a soldier jumped out .  there was a brief vision of the interior   a warm tent of orange light  with a few soldiers sitting around a little stove  and the air thick with cigarette smoke .   the soldier grinned .      give us a mug and a wad for the sergeant     he said to someone in the truck .   a tin mug of scalding black tea and a brick thick sandwich were handed out .      much obliged     said the policeman  taking them .  he leaned against the truck .      how   s it going  then .     he said .     haven   t heard a bang .         it   s a twenty five pounder     said the soldier .     went right down through the cellar floor .  you lot took a real pounding last night  eh .  want a look .         is it safe .         course not     said the soldier cheerfully .     that   s why we   re here  right .  come on .     he pinched out his cigarette and put it behind his ear .      i thought you lot   d be guarding it     said the policeman .      it   s dark  and it   s been pouring     said the soldier .     who   s going to steal an unexploded bomb .         yes  but       the sergeant looked in the direction of the ruined street .   there was the sound of bricks sliding .      someone is  by the sound of it     he said .      what .  we   ve got warning signs up .     said the soldier .     we only knocked off for a brew up .  oi .      their boots crunched on the rubble that had been strewn across the road .      it is safe  isn   t it .     said the sergeant .      not if someone drops a dirty great heap of bricks on it  no .  oi .  you .      the moon came out from behind the clouds .  they could make out a figure at the other end of what remained of the street  near the wall of the pickle factory .   the sergeant skidded to a halt .      oh  no     he whispered .     it   s mrs .  tachyon .      the soldier stared at the small figure that was dragging some sort of cart through the rubble .      who   s she .         let   s just take it quietly  shall we .     said the sergeant  grabbing his arm .   he shone his flashlight and set his face into a sort of mad friendly grin .      that you  mrs .  tachyon .     he said .     it   s me  sergeant bourke .  bit chilly to be out at this time of night  eh .  got a nice warm cell back at the station  yes .  i daresay there could be a big hot mug of cocoa for you if you just come along with me   how about that .         can   t she read all them warning signs .  is she mental .     said the soldier under his breath .     she   s right by the house with the bomb in the cellar .         yes   no   she   s just different     said the sergeant .     bit   touched .     he raised his voice .     you just stay where you are  love  and we   ll come and get you .  don   t want you hurting yourself on all this junk  do we .         here  has she been looting .     said the soldier .     she could get shot for that  pinching stuff from bombed out houses .         no one   s going to shoot mrs .  tachyon     said the sergeant .     we know her  see .  she was in the cells the other night .         what   d she done .         nothing .  we let her nap in a spare cell in the station if it   s a nippy night .  i gave her sixpence and a pair of ole boots what belonged to me mum only yesterday .  well  look at her .  she   s old enough to be your granny  poor old biddy .      mrs .  tachyon stood and watched them owlishly as they walked  very cautiously  toward her .   the soldier saw a wizened little woman wearing what looked like a party dress with layers of other clothes on top  and a woolly hat with a bobble on it .  she was pushing a wire cart on wheels .  it had a metal label on it .      tesco   s     he said .     what   s that .         dunno where she gets half her stuff     muttered the sergeant .   the cart seemed to be full of black bags .  but there were other things  which glittered in the moonlight .      i know where she got that stuff     muttered the soldier .     that   s been pinched from the pickle factory .         oh  half the town was in there this morning     said the sergeant .     a few jars of gherkins won   t hurt .         yeah  but you can   t have this sort of thing .     ere  you .  missus .  you just let me have a look at        he reached toward the cart .   some sort of demon  all teeth and glowing eyes  erupted from it and clawed the skin off the back of his hand .      blast .     ere  help me get hold of        but the sergeant had backed away .      that   s guilty  that is     he said .     i should come away if i was you .      mrs .  tachyon cackled .      thunderbirds are go .     she chortled .     wot  no bananas .  that   s what you think  my old dollypot .      she hauled the cart around and trotted off  dragging it behind her .      hey  don   t go in there       the soldier shouted .   the old woman hauled the cart over a pile of bricks .  a piece of wall collapsed behind her .   the last brick hit something far below  which went boink .   the soldier and the policeman froze in mid run .   the moon went behind a cloud again .   in the darkness  there was a ticking sound .  it was far off  and a bit muffled  but in that pool of silence both men heard it all the way up their spines .   the sergeant   s foot  which had been in the air  came down slowly .      how long   ve you got if it starts to tick .     he whispered .   there was no one there .  the soldier was accelerating away .   the policeman ran after him and was halfway up the ruins of paradise street before the world behind him suddenly became full of excitement .       it was nine o   clock in the evening  in blackbury high street .   in the window of the electrical shop  nine tvs showed the same picture .  nine televisions projected their flickering screens at the empty air .   a newspaper blew along the deserted pavement until it wrapped around the stalks in an ornamental flower bed .  the wind caught an empty beer can and bowled it across the pavement until it hit a drain .   the high street was what the blackbury district council called a pedestrian precinct and amenity area  although no one was quite sure what the amenities were  or even what an amenity was .  perhaps it was the benches  cunningly designed so that people wouldn   t sit on them for too long and make the place untidy .  or maybe it was the flower beds  which sprouted a regular crop of the hardy perennial chip packet .  it couldn   t have been the ornamental trees .  they   d looked quite big and leafy on the original drawings a few years ago  but what with cutbacks and one thing and another  no one had actually got around to planting any .   the sodium lights made the night cold as ice .   the newspaper blew on again and wrapped itself around a yellow litter bin in the shape of a fat dog with its mouth open .   something landed in an alleyway and groaned .      tick tick tick .  tickety boo .  ow .  national   health   service            the interesting thing about worrying about things  thought johnny maxwell  was the way there was always something new to worry about .   his friend kirsty said it was because he was a natural worrier  but that was because she didn   t worry about anything .  she got angry instead  and did things about it  whatever it was .  he really envied the way she decided what it was and knew exactly what to do about it almost instantly .  currently she was saving the planet most evenings  and foxes on weekends .   johnny just worried .  usually they were the same old worries   school  money  whether you could get aids from watching television  and so on .  but occasionally one would come out of nowhere and knock all the others down .   right now  it was his mind .      it   s not exactly the same as being ill     said yo less  who   d read all the way through his mother   s medical encyclopedia .      it   s not being ill at all .  if lots of bad things have happened to you  it   s healthy to be depressed     said johnny .     that   s sense  isn   t it .  what with the business going down the drain  and dad pushing off  and mum just sitting around smoking all the time and everything .  i mean  going around smiling and saying     oh  it   s not so bad      that would be mental .         that   s right     said yo less  who   d read a bit about psychology as well .      my gran went mental     said bigmac .     she   ow .         sorry     said yo less .     i wasn   t looking where i put my foot  but fair   s fair   you weren   t either .         it   s just dreams     said johnny .     it   s nothing mad .      although  he had to admit  it was dreams during the day  too .  dreams so real that they filled his eyes and ears .   the planes     the bombs     and the fossil fly .  why that .  there   d be these nightmares  and in the middle of it  there   d be the fly .  it was a tiny one  in a piece of amber .  he   d saved up for it and done a science project on it .  but it wasn   t even scary looking .  it was just a fly from millions of years ago .  why was that in a nightmare .   huh .  schoolteachers .  why couldn   t they be like they were supposed to be and just chuck things at you if you weren   t paying attention .  instead they all seemed to have been worrying about him and sending notes home and getting him to see a specialist  although the specialist wasn   t too bad and at least it got him out of math .   one of the notes had said he was    disturbed .     well  who wasn   t disturbed .  he hadn   t shown it to his mum .  things were bad enough as it was .      you getting on all right at your granddad   s .     asked yo less .      it   s not too bad .  granddad does the housework  most of the time anyway .  he   s good at fried bread .  and surprise surprise .         what   s that .         you know that stall in the market that sells tins that   ve got the labels off .         yes .         well  he buys loads of those .  and you   ve got to eat them once they   re opened .         yuk .         oh  pineapple and meatballs isn   t too bad .      they walked on through the evening street .   the thing about all of us  johnny thought  the sad thing is that we   re not very good .  actually  that   s not the worst part .  the worst part is we   re not even much good at being not much good .   take yo less .  when you looked at yo less  you might think he had possibilities .  he was black .  technically .  but he never said    yo     and only said    check it out    in the supermarket  and the only person he ever called a mother was his mother .  yo less said it was racial stereotyping to say all black kids acted like that  but however you looked at it  yo less had been born with a defective cool .  trainspotters were cooler than yo less .  if you gave yo less a baseball cap  he   d put it on the right way around .  that   s how  well  yo less yo less was .  sometimes he actually wore a tie .   now  bigmac   bigmac was good .  he was good at math .  sort of .  it made the teachers wild .  you could show bigmac some sort of horrible equation and he   d say    x   .       and he   d be right .  but he never knew why .     it   s just what it is     he   d say .  and that was no good .  knowing the answers wasn   t what math was about .  math was about showing how you worked them out  even if you got them wrong .  bigmac was also a skinhead .  bigmac and bazza and skazz were the last three skinheads in blackbury .  at least  the last three who weren   t someone   s dad .  and he had love and hat on his knuckles  but only in pen because when he   d gone to get tattooed  he fainted .  and he bred tropical fish .   as for wobbler   wobbler wasn   t even a nerd .  he wanted to be a nerd but they wouldn   t let him join .  he had a nerd pride badge and he messed around with computers .  what wobbler wanted was to be a kid in milk bottle bottom glasses and a deformed parka  who could write amazing software and be a millionaire by the time he was twenty  but he   d probably settle for just being someone whose computer didn   t keep smelling of burning plastic every time he touched it .   and as for johnny        if you go mad  do you know you   ve gone mad .  if you don   t  how do you know you   re not mad .      it wasn   t a bad film     wobbler was saying .  they   d been to screen w at the blackbury odeon .  they generally went to see any film that promised to have laser beams in it somewhere .      but you can   t travel in time without messing things up     said yo less .      that   s the whole point     said bigmac .     that   s what you want to do .  i wouldn   t mind joining the police if they were time police .  you   d go back and say     hey  are you adolf hitler .     and when he said     achtung  that   s me  ja      kablooeee .  with the pump action shotgun .  end of problem .         yes  but supposing you accidentally shot your own grandfather     said yo less patiently .      i wouldn   t .  he doesn   t look a bit like adolf hitler .         anyway  you   re not that good a shot     said wobbler .     you got kicked out of the paintball club  didn   t you .         only    cos they were jealous that they hadn   t thought of a paintball hand grenade before i showed them how .         it was a can of paint  bigmac .  a two liter can .         well  yeah  but in contex    it was a hand grenade .         they said you might at least have loosened the lid a bit .  sean stevens needed stitches .         i didn   t mean actually shooting your actual grandfather     said yo less loudly .     i mean messing things up so maybe you   re not actually born or your time machine never gets invented .  like in that film where the robot is sent back to kill the mother of the boy who   s going to beat the robots when he grows up .         good one  that     said bigmac  strafing the silent shops with an invisible machine gun .      but if he never got born  how did they know he   d existed .     said yo less .     didn   t make any sense to me .         how come you   re such an expert .     said wobbler .      well  i   ve got three shelves of star trek videos     said yo less .      nerd .         trainspotter .         anyway     said yo less     if you changed things  maybe you   d end up not going back in time  and there you would be  back in time  i mean  except you never went in the first place  so you wouldn   t be able to come back on account of not having gone .  or  even if you could get back  you   d get back to another time  like a sort of parallel dimension  because if the thing you changed hadn   t happened  then you wouldn   t   ve gone  so you could only come back to somewhere you never went .  and there you   d be   stuck .      they tried to work this out .      huh  you   d have to be mad even to understand time travel     said wobbler eventually .      job opportunity for you there  johnny     said bigmac .      bigmac     said yo less in a warning voice .      it   s all right     said johnny .     the doctor said i just worry about things too much .         what kind of loony tests did you have .     said bigmac .     big needles and electric shocks and that .         no  bigmac .     johnny sighed .     they don   t do that .  they just ask you questions .         what  like    are you a loony .            it   d be sound to go a long way back in time     said wobbler .     back to the dinosaurs .  no chance of killing your granddad then  unless he   s really old .  dinosaurs   d be all right .         great .     said bigmac .     then i could wipe    em out with my plasma rifle .  oh  yes .         yeah     said wobbler  rolling his eyes .     that   d explain a lot .  why did the dinosaurs die out sixty five million years ago .  because bigmac couldn   t get there any earlier .         but you haven   t got a plasma rifle     said johnny .      if wobbler can have a time machine  then i can have a plasma rifle .         oh  all right .         and a rocket launcher .      a time machine  thought johnny .  that would be something .  you could get your life exactly as you wanted it .  if something nasty turned up  you could just go back and make sure that it didn   t .  you could go wherever you wanted and nothing bad would ever have to happen .   around him  the boys    conversation  as their conversations did  took on its own peculiar style .      anyway  no one   s proved the dinosaurs did die out .         oh  yeah  right  sure .  they   re still around  are they .         i mean p   raps they only come out at night  or are camouflaged or something    .         a brick finished stegosaurus .  a bright red number   brontosaurus .         hey  neat idea .  they   d go around pretending to be a bus  right  and people could get on   but they wouldn   t get off again .  oooo eee oooo           nah .  false noses .  false noses and beards .  then just when people aren   t expecting it   unk .  nothing on the pavement but a pair of shoes and a really big bloke in a raincoat  shuffling away    .      paradise street  thought johnny .  paradise street was on his mind a lot these days .  especially at night .   i bet if you asked the people there if time travel was a good idea  they   d say yes .  i mean  no one knows what happened to the dinosaurs  but we know what happened to paradise street .   i wish i could go back to paradise street .   something hissed .   they looked around .  there was an alleyway between the thrift shop and the video library .  the hissing came from there  except now it had changed into a snarl .   it wasn   t at all pleasant .  it went right into his ears and right through johnny   s modern brain and right down into the memories built into his very bones .  when an early ape had cautiously got down out of its tree and wobbled awkwardly along the ground  trying out this new    standing upright    idea that all the younger apes were talking about  this was exactly the kind of snarl it hated to hear .   it said to every muscle in the body  run away and climb something .  and possibly throw down some coconuts  too .      there   s something in the alley     said wobbler  looking around in case there were any trees handy .      a werewolf .     said bigmac .   wobbler stopped .     why should it be a werewolf .     he said .      i saw this film  curse of the revenge of the werewolf     said bigmac     and someone heard a snarl like that and went into a dark alley  and next thing  he was lying there with all his special effects spilling out on the pavement .         huh     quavered wobbler .     there   s no such things as werewolves .         you go and tell it  then .      johnny stepped forward .   there was a shopping cart lying on its side just inside the alley  but that wasn   t unusual .  herds of shopping carts roamed the streets of blackbury .  while he   d never seen one actually moving  he sometimes suspected that they trundled off as soon as his back was turned .   bulging shopping bags and black plastic dustbin liners lay around it  and there were a number of jars .  one of them had broken open  and there was a smell of vinegar .   one of the bundles was wearing sneakers .   you didn   t see that very often .   a terrible monster pulled itself over the top of the cart and spat at johnny .   it was white  but with bits of brown and black as well .  it was scrawny .  it had three and a half legs but only one ear .  its face was a mask of absolute  determined evil .  its teeth were jagged and yellow  its breath as nasty as pepper spray .   johnny knew it well .  so did practically everyone else in blackbury .         hello  guilty     he said  taking care to keep his hands by his sides .   if guilty was here  and the shopping cart was here     he looked down at the bundle with the sneakers .      i think something   s happened to mrs .  tachyon     he said .   the others hurried up .   it only looked like a bundle because mrs .  tachyon tended to wear everything she owned  all at once .  this was a woolly hat  about twelve sweaters and a pink ra ra skirt  then bare pipe cleaner legs down to several pairs of sports socks and the huge sneakers .      is that blood .     said wobbler .      er     said bigmac .     yuk .         i think she   s alive     said johnny .     i   m sure i heard a groan .         er   i know first aid     said yo less uncertainly .     kiss of life and stuff .         kiss of life .  mrs .  tachyon .  yuk     said bigmac .   yo less looked very worried .  what seemed simple when you did it in a nice warm hall with the instructor watching seemed a lot more complicated in an alleyway  especially with all the woolly sweaters involved .  whoever invented first aid hadn   t had mrs .  tachyon in mind .   yo less knelt down gingerly .  he patted mrs .  tachyon vaguely  and something fell out of one of her many pockets .  it was fish and chips  wrapped in a piece of newspaper .      she   s always eating chips     said bigmac .     my brother says she picks thrown away papers out of the trash to see if there   s any chips still in    em .  yuk .         er       said yo less desperately  as he tried to find a way of administering first aid without actually touching anything .   finally johnny came to his rescue and said     i know how to dial     .      yo less sagged with relief .     yes  yes  that   s right     he said .     i   m pretty sure you mustn   t move people  on account of breaking bones .         or the crust     said wobbler .       mrs .  tachyon     mrs .  tachyon had always been there  as long as johnny could remember .  she was a bag lady before people knew what bag ladies were  although strictly speaking she was a cart woman .   it wasn   t a normal supermarket cart  either .  it looked bigger  the wires looked thicker .  and it hurt like mad when mrs .  tachyon pushed it into the small of your back  which she did quite a lot .  it wasn   t that she did it out of nastiness   well  it probably wasn   t   but other people just didn   t exist on planet tachyon .   fortunately  one wheel squeaked .  and if you didn   t get accustomed to moving away quickly when you heard the squee   squee   squee coming  the monologue was another warning .   mrs .  tachyon talked all the time .  you could never be quite certain who she was talking to .         i sez  that   s what you sez  is it .  that   s what you think .  an    i could get both hands in yer mouth and still wind wool  i sez .  oh  yes .  tell sid .  yer so skinny yer can close one eye and yer   d look like a needle  i sez .  oh  yes .  they done me out of it .  tell that to the boys in khaki .  that   s a pelter or i don   t know what is .      but quite often it was just a mumble  with occasional triumphant shouts of    i told    em .     and    that   s what you think .      the cart with its squeaky wheel could turn up behind you at any hour of the day or night .  no one knew when to expect it .  nor did anyone know what was in all those bags .  mrs .  tachyon tended to rummage a lot  in bins and things .  so no one wanted to find out .   sometimes she   d disappear for weeks on end .  no one knew where she went .  then  just when everyone was beginning to relax  there   d be the squee   squee   squee behind them and the stabbing pain in the small of the back .   mrs .  tachyon picked things out of the gutter .  that was probably how she   d acquired guilty  with his fur like carpet underlay  broken teeth  and boomerang shaped backbone .  when guilty walked  which wasn   t often since he preferred to ride in the cart  he tended to go around in circles .  when he ran  usually because he was trying to fight something  the fact that he only had one and a half legs in front meant that sooner or later his back legs would overtake him  and by then he was always in such a rage that he   d bite his own tail .   even dss  the rabid dog owned by syd the crusty  which once ate a police german shepherd  would run away at the sight of guilty spinning toward him  frantically biting himself .       the ambulance drove off  blue light flashing .   guilty watched johnny from the cart  going cross eyed with hatred .      the ambulance man said she looked as if she   d been hit by something     said wobbler  who was also watching the cat .  it was never a good idea to take your eye off guilty .      what   re we going to do with all this stuff .     said johnny .      yeah  can   t leave it     said bigmac .     that would be littering .         but it   s her stuff     said johnny .      don   t look at me     said bigmac .     some of those bags squelch .         and there   s the cat     said johnny .      yeah  we ought to kill the cat     said bigmac .     it took all the skin off my hand last week .      johnny cautiously pulled the cart upright .  guilty clung to it  hissing .      he likes you     said bigmac .      how can you tell .         you   ve still got both eyes .         you could take it along to the spca in the morning     said yo less .      i suppose so     said johnny     but what about the cart .  we can   t just leave it here .         yeah  let   s push it off the top of the high rise     said bigmac .   johnny prodded a bag .  it moved a bit  and then flowed back  with an unpleasant oozing noise .      y   know  my brother said mrs .  tachyon killed her husband years ago and then went mental and they never found his body     said bigmac .   they looked at the bags .      none of them is big enough for a dead body     said yo less  who wasn   t allowed to watch horror movies .      not a whole one  no     said bigmac .   yo less took a step back .      i heard she stuck his head in the oven     said wobbler .     very messy .         messy .     said yo less .      it was a microwave oven .  get it .  if you put a           shut up     said yo less .      i heard she   s really  really rich     said bigmac .      stinking rich     said wobbler .      look  i   ll just   i   ll just put it in my granddad   s garage     said johnny .      i don   t see why we have to do it     said yo less .     there   s supposed to be care in the community or something .         he doesn   t keep much in there now .  and then in the morning        oh  well .  the morning was another day .      and while you   ve got it  you could have a rummage to see if there   s any money     said bigmac .   johnny glanced at guilty  who snarled .      no  i like a hand with all its fingers on     he said .     you lot come with me .  i   d feel a right clod pushing this by myself .      the fourth wheel squeaked and bounced as he pushed the cart down the street .      looks heavy     said yo less .   there was a snigger from beside him .      well  they say mr .  tachyon was a very big man           just shut up  bigmac .      it   s me  johnny thought  as the procession went down the street .  it   s like on the lottery  only it   s the opposite .  there   s this big finger in the sky and it comes through your window and flicks you on the ear and says    it   s you   har har har .     and you get up and think you   re going to have a normal day and suddenly you   re in charge of a cart with one squeaky wheel and an insane cat .      here     said wobbler     these fish and chips are still warm .         what .     said johnny .     you picked up her actual fish and chips .      wobbler backed away .     well  yeah  why not .  shame to let them go to waste           they might have got her spit on    em     said bigmac .     yuk .         they haven   t even been unwrapped  actually     said wobbler  but he did stop unwrapping them .      put them in the cart  wobbler     said johnny .      dunno who wraps fish and chips in newspaper around here     said wobbler  tossing the package onto the pile in the cart .     hong kong henry doesn   t .  where   d she get them .          sir john was normally awakened at half past eight every morning by a butler who brought him his breakfast  another butler who brought him his clothes  a third butler whose job it was to feed adolf and stalin if necessary  and a fourth butler who was basically a spare .   at nine o   clock his secretary came and read him his appointments for the day .   when the secretary did so this morning  though  he found sir john still staring at his plate with a strange expression .  adolf and stalin swam contentedly in the tank by his desk .      five different kinds of pill  some biscuits made of cardboard  and a glass of orange juice with all the excitement removed     said sir john .     what   s the point of being the richest man in the world   i am still the richest man in the world  aren   t i .         yes  sir john .         well  what   s the point if it all boils down to pills for breakfast .     he drummed his fingers on the table .     well   i   ve had enough  d   y   hear .  tell hickson to get the car out .         which car  sir john .         the bentley .         which bentley  sir john .         oh  one i haven   t used lately .  he can choose .  and find blackbury on the map .  we own a burger bar there  don   t we .         er   i think so  sir john .  wasn   t that the one where you personally chose the site .  you said you just knew it would be a good one .  er   but today you   ve got appointments to see the chairman of           cancel    em all .  i   m going to blackbury .  don   t tell    em i   m coming .  call it   a lightning inspection .  the secret of success in business is to pay attention to the little details  am i right .  people get underdone burgers or the fries turn out to be too soggy  and before you know where you are  the entire business is down around your ears .         er   if you say so  sir john .         right  i   ll be ready in twenty minutes .         er   you could  perhaps  leave it until tomorrow .  only  the committee did ask that           no .     the old man slapped the table .     it   s got to be today .  today is when it all happens  you see .  mrs .  tachyon .  the cart .  johnny and the rest of them .  it   s got to be today .  otherwise       he pushed away the dull yet healthy breakfast .     otherwise it   s this for the rest of my life .      the secretary was used to sir john   s moods  and tried to lighten things a little .      blackbury       he said .     that   s where you were evacuated during the war  wasn   t it .  and you were the only person to escape when one of the streets got bombed .         me and two goldfish called adolf and stalin .  that   s right .  that   s where it all started     said sir john  getting up and going over to the window .     go on  jump to it .      the secretary didn   t go straightaway .  one of his jobs was to keep an eye on sir john .  the old boy was acting a bit odd  people had said .  he   d taken to reading very old newspapers and books with words like    time    and    physics    in the title  and sometimes he even wrote angry letters to very important scientists .  when you   re the richest man in the world  people watch you very closely .      adolf and stalin     said sir john to the whole world in general .     of course  these two are only their descendants .  it turned out that adolf was female .  or was it stalin .      outside the window  the gardens stretched all the way to some rolling hills that sir john   s landscape gardener had imported specially .      blackbury     said sir john  staring at them .     that   s where it all started .  the whole thing .  there was a boy called johnny maxwell .  and mrs .  tachyon .  and a cat  i think .      he turned .      are you still here .         sorry  sir john     said the secretary  backing out and shutting the door behind him .      that   s where it all started     said sir john .     and that   s where it   s all going to end .          johnny always enjoyed those first few moments in the morning before the day leaped out at him .  his head was peacefully full of flowers  clouds  kittens     his hand still hurt .   horrible bits of last night rushed out from hiding and bounced and gibbered in front of him .   there was a shopping cart full of unspeakable bags in the garage .  there was also a spray of milk across the wall and ceiling where guilty had showed what he thought of people who tried to give him an unprovoked meal .  johnny had had to use the biggest band aid in the medicine chest afterward .   he got up  dressed  and went downstairs .  his mother wouldn   t be up yet  and his granddad was definitely in the front room watching saturday morning tv .   johnny opened the garage door and stepped back hurriedly  in case a ball of maddened fur came spinning out .   nothing happened .   the dreadful cart stood in the middle of the floor .  there was no sign of guilty .   it was  johnny thought  just like those scenes in films where you know the monster is in the room somewhere    .   he jumped sideways  just in case guilty was about to drop out of the ceiling .   it was bad enough seeing the wretched cat .  not seeing it was worse .   he scurried out and shut the door quickly  then went back into the house .   he probably ought to tell someone official .  the cart belonged to mrs .  tachyon  actually  it probably belonged to mr .  tesco or mr .  safeway   so it might be stealing if he kept it .   as he went back inside  the phone rang .  there were two ways he could tell .  firstly  the phone rang .  then his grandfather shouted     phone .     because he never answered the phone if he thought there was a chance it could be answered by someone else .   johnny picked it up .      can i speak to       said yo less  in his speaking to parents voice .      it   s me  yo less     said johnny .      hey  you know mrs .  tachyon .         of course i           well  my mum was on duty at the hospital last night .  she   s got horrible bruises and everything .  mrs .  tachyon  i mean  not my mum .  someone really had a go at her  she said .  my mum  not mrs .  tachyon .  she said we ought to tell the police .         what for .         we might have seen something .  anyway   er   someone might think it was   us    .         us .  but we called the ambulance .         i know that .  er   and you   ve got her stuff    .         well  we couldn   t just leave it there .         i know that .  but   well  we did have bigmac with us    .      and that was it  really .  it wasn   t that bigmac was actually evil .  he   d happily fire imaginary nuclear missiles at people  but he wouldn   t hurt a fly  unless perhaps it was a real hard biker fly that   d given him serious grief .  however  he did have a problem with cars  especially big fast ones with the keys still in the ignition .  and he was a skinhead .  his boots were so big that it was quite hard for him to fall over .   according to sergeant comely of the blackbury police station  bigmac was guilty of every unsolved crime in the town  whereas in real life he was probably guilty only of ten percent  maximum .  he looked like trouble .  no one looking at bigmac would think he was innocent of anything .      and wobbler  too     yo less added .   and wobbler would admit to anything if you got him frightened enough .  all the great unsolved mysteries of the world   the bermuda triangle  the marie celeste  the loch ness monster   could be sorted out in about half an hour if you leaned a bit on wobbler .      i   ll go by myself  then     said johnny .     simpler that way .      yo less sighed with relief .     thanks .      the phone rang just as johnny put it down again .   it started saying    hello .  hello .     before he got it to his ear .      er   hello .     he said .      is that you .     said a female voice .  it wasn   t exactly an unpleasant one  but it had a sharp  penetrating quality .  it seemed to be saying that if you weren   t you  then it was your fault .  johnny recognized it instantly .  it was the voice of someone who dialed wrong numbers and then complained that the phone was answered by people she didn   t want to speak to .      yes .  er   yes .  hello  kirsty .         it   s kasandra  actually .         oh .  right     said johnny .  he   d have to make a note .  kirsty changed her name about as often as she changed her clothes  although at least these days she was sticking to ones beginning with k .      have you heard about old mrs .  tachyon .         i think so     said johnny guardedly .      apparently a gang of yobs beat her up last night .  she looked as though a bomb   d hit her .  hello .  hello .  hello .         i   m still here     said johnny .  someone had filled his stomach with ice .      don   t you think that   s shameful .         er .  yes .         one of them was black .      johnny nodded dismally at the phone .  yo less had explained about this sort of thing .  he   d said that if one of his ancestors had joined attila the hun   s huge horde of millions of barbarians and helped them raid ancient rome  people would   ve definitely remembered that one of them was black .  and this was yo less  who collected brass bands  had a matchbox collection  and was a known nerd .      er     he said     it was us .  i mean  we didn   t beat her up  but we found her .  i got the ambulance and yo less tried   yo less was definitely thinking about first aid    .         didn   t you tell the police .         no           honestly  i don   t know what would happen if i wasn   t around .  you   ve got to tell them now .  i   ll meet you at the police station in half an hour .  you know how to tell the time .  the big hand is           yes     said johnny miserably .      it   s only two stops on the bus from your house .  you know about catching buses .         yes  yes  yes  of course i           you need money .  that   s the round stuff you find in your pockets .  ciao .      actually  after he   d been to the toilet  he felt a bit better about it all .  kirs   kasandra took charge of things .  she was the most organized person johnny knew .  in fact she was so organized that she had too much organization for one person  and it overflowed in every direction .   he was her friend .  more or less  anyway .  he wasn   t sure he   d ever been given a choice in the matter .  kirs   kasandra wasn   t good at friends .  she   d told him so herself .  she   d said it was because of a character flaw  only because she was ki   kasandra  she thought it was a character flaw in everyone else .   the more she tried to help people by explaining to them how stupid they were  the more they just wandered off for no reason at all .  the only reason johnny hadn   t was that he knew how stupid he was .   but sometimes   not often   when the light was right and she wasn   t organizing anything  he   d look at ki   kasandra and wonder if there weren   t two kinds of stupidity  the basic el thicko kind that he had  and a highly specialized sort that you got only when you were stuffed too full of intelligence .   he   d better tell granddad where he was going  he thought  just in case the power went off or the tv broke down and he wondered where johnny had gone .      i   m just off to       he began  and then said     i   m just off out .         right     said granddad  without taking his eyes off the set .     hah .  look  there he goes .  right in the gunge tank .          nothing much was going on in the garage .   after a while  guilty crawled out from his nest among the black plastic sacks and took up his usual position in the front of the cart  where he was wont to travel on the off chance that he could claw somebody .   a fly banged on the windowpane for a while and then went back to sleep .   and the bags moved .   they moved like frogs in oil  slithering very slowly around each other .  they made a rubbery  squeaky noise  like a clever conjurer trying to twist an animal out of balloons .   there were other noises  too .  guilty didn   t pay them much attention because you couldn   t attack noises  and besides  he was pretty well used to them by now .   they weren   t very clear .  they might have been snatches of music .  they might have been voices .  they might have been a radio left on  but slightly off station and two rooms away  or the distant roar of a crowd .       johnny met kasandra outside the police station .      you   re lucky i   ve got some spare time     she said .     come on .      sergeant comely was on the desk .  he looked up as johnny and kasandra came in  then looked back at the book he was writing in  and then looked up again slowly .      you .         er  hello  sergeant comely     said johnny .      what is it this time .  seen any aliens lately .         we   ve come about mrs .  tachyon  sergeant     said kasandra .      oh yes .      kasandra turned to johnny .      go on     she said .     tell him .         er       said johnny .     well   me and wobbler and yo less and bigmac           wobbler and yo less and bigmac and i     said kasandra .   sergeant comely looked at her .      all five of you .     he said .      i was just correcting his grammar     said kasandra .      do you do that a lot .     asked the sergeant .  he looked at johnny .     does she do that a lot .         all the time     said johnny .      good grief .  well  go on .  you  not her .      when sergeant comely had been merely pc comely  he   d visited johnny   s school to show everyone how nice the police were  and had accidentally locked himself into his own handcuffs .  he was also a member of the blackbury morris men .  johnny had actually seen him wearing bells around his knees and waving two hankies in the air .  these were important things to remember at a time like this .      well   we were proceeding along       he began .      and no jokes .          twenty minutes later  they walked slowly down the steps of the police station .      well  that wasn   t too bad     said kasandra .     it   s not as though you were arrested or anything .  have you really got her cart .         oh  yes .         i liked the look on his face when you said you   d bring guilty in .  he went quite pale  i thought .         what   s next of kin mean .  he said she   d got no next of kin .         relatives     said kasandra .     basically  it means relatives .         none at all .         that isn   t unusual .         yes     said johnny     but generally there   s a cousin in australia you don   t know about .         is there .         well  apparently i   ve got a cousin in australia  and i didn   t know about her till last month  so it can   t be that unusual .         the state of mrs .  tachyon is a terrible indictment of society     said kasandra .      what   s indictment mean .         it means it   s wrong .         that she   s got no relatives .  i don   t think you can get them from the governm           no  that she   s got no home and just wanders around the place living on what she can find .  something ought to be done .         well  i suppose we could go and see her     said johnny .     she   s only in st .  mark   s .         what good would that do .         well  it might cheer her up a bit .         do you know you start almost every sentence with    well    .         well           going hospital visiting won   t do anything about the disgusting neglect of street people and the mentally ill  will it .         probably not .  she just might be a bit cheered up  i suppose .      kasandra walked in silence for a moment .     it   s just that   i   ve got a thing about hospitals  if you must know .  they   re full of sick people .         we could take her something she likes .  and she   d probably be glad to know that guilty is okay .         they smell bad  too     said kasandra  not listening to him .     that horrible disinfectant smell .         when you   re up close to mrs .  tachyon  you won   t notice .         you   re just going on about it because you know i hate hospitals  aren   t you .         i   just think we ought to do it .  anyway  i thought you did things like this for your duke of edinburgh award or whatever it was .         yes  but there was some point in that .         we could go toward the end of visiting time so we won   t be there very long .  that   s what everyone else does .         oh  all right     said kasandra .      we   d better take her something  too .  you have to .         like grapes  you mean .      johnny tried to picture mrs .  tachyon eating grapes .  it didn   t work .     i   ll think about it .          the garage door swung back and forth slowly .   inside the garage there was   a concrete floor .  it was old and cracked and soaked in oil .  animal footprints crossed it  embedded in the concrete  suggesting that a dog had run across it when it was being laid .  this happens in every patch of wet concrete  everywhere .  there were also a couple of human footprints  fossilized in time  and now filled with black grease and dust .  in other words  it was more or less like any piece of concrete .  there was also   a tool bench .   most of a bicycle  upside down  and surrounded by tools and bits of bike in a haphazard manner that suggested that someone had mastered the art of taking a bike to bits without succeeding in the craft of putting it back together again .   a lawn mower entangled in a garden hosepipe  which is what always happens in garages  and isn   t at all relevant .   a cart  overflowing with plastic bags of all kinds  but most particularly six large black ones .   a small pile of jars of pickles  where johnny had carefully stacked them last night .   the remains of some fish and chips .  as far as guilty was concerned  cat food happened only to other cats .   a pair of yellow eyes  watching intently from the shadows under the bench .   and that was all .       bags of time     to be honest about it  johnny didn   t much like hospitals either .  mostly  the people he   d gone to visit in them were not going to come out again .  and no matter how they tried to cheer the place up with plants and pictures  it never looked friendly .  after all  no one was there because they wanted to be .   but kasandra was good at finding out things and getting harassed people to give her answers  and it didn   t take long to find mrs .  tachyon   s ward .      that   s her  isn   t it .     she said .   kasandra pointed along the line of beds .  one or two of them didn   t have visitors around them  but there was no mistaking the one belonging to mrs .  tachyon .   she was sitting up in bed in a hospital nightgown and her woolly hat  over which she had a pair of hospital headphones .   mrs .  tachyon stared intently in front of her and jigged happily among the pillows .      she looks happy enough     said kasandra .     what   s she listening to .         i couldn   t say for sure     said the nurse .     all i know is the headphones aren   t plugged in .  are you relatives .         no .  we   re       kasandra began .      it   s a sort of project     said johnny .     you know   like weeding old people   s gardens and that sort of thing .      the nurse gave him an odd look  but the magic word project did its usual helpful stuff .   she sniffed .     can i smell vinegar .     she said .   kasandra glared at johnny .  he tried to look innocent .      we   ve just brought some grapes     he said  showing her the bag .   mrs .  tachyon didn   t look up as they dragged chairs over to her bed .   johnny had never spoken to her in his life  except to say    sorry    when she rammed him with her cart .  he wasn   t sure how to start now .   kasandra leaned over and pulled one earphone aside .      hello  mrs .  tachyon .     she said  mrs .  tachyon stopped jigging .  she turned a beady eye on kasandra  and then on johnny .  she had a black eye  and her stained white hair looked frizzled at the front  but there was something horribly unstoppable about mrs .  tachyon .      indeed .  that   s what you think .     she said .     call again tomorrow  baker  and we   ll take a crusty one .  poor old biddy  is it .  that   s what you think .  millennium hand and shrimp .  free teeth and corsets .  maybe  for them as likes it  but not me  thank you so much .  wot  no bananas .  i had a house  oh yes  but it   s all black men now .  hats .         are they treating you all right .     said kasandra .      don   t you worry .  right as rain and twice as ninepence .  hah .  tick tick bang .  i   d like to see them try .  there   s puddings .  of course  i remember when it was all fields  but would they listen .      kasandra looked at johnny .      i think she   s a bit   confused     she said .     she doesn   t understand anything i   m saying .         but we don   t understand anything she   s saying  either     said johnny  who felt confused all the time in any case .   mrs .  tachyon adjusted her headphones and started to boogie again .      i don   t believe this     said kasandra .     excuse me .      she pulled the headphones off the woolly hat and listened to them .      the nurse was right     she said .     there   s nothing at all .      mrs .  tachyon bounced up and down happily .      one born every minute .     she chortled .   then she winked at johnny .  it was a bright  knowing wink  from planet tachyon to planet johnny .      we   ve brought you some grapes  mrs .  tachyon     he said .      that   s what you think .         grapes     said johnny firmly .  he opened the bag  exposing the steaming greaseproof fish and chips paper inside .  her eyes widened .  a scrawny hand shot out from under the covers  grabbed the bag  and disappeared under the blanket again .      him and his coat     she said .      don   t mention it .  er .  i   m keeping your cart safe .  and guilty is all right  although i don   t think he   s eaten anything apart from some chips and my hand .         i blame mr .  chamberlain     said mrs .  tachyon .   a bell tinkled .      oh dear that   s the end of visiting time my word don   t the hours just fly past what a shame     said kasandra  standing up quickly .     nice to have met you mrs .  tachyon sorry we have to be going come on johnny .         lady muck     said mrs .  tachyon .   she nodded at johnny .      what   s the word on the street  mister man .      johnny tried to think like mrs .  tachyon .      er      no parking    .     he suggested .      that   s what you think .  them   s bags of time  mister man .  mind me bike .  where your mind goes  the rest of you   s bound to follow .  here today and gone yesterday .  doing it   s the trick .  eh .      johnny stared .  it was as though he had been listening to a lot of static on the radio and then  just for a second  there was this one clear signal .   the other mrs .  tachyon came back .      he   s mixing sugar with the sand  mr .  mcphee .     she said .     that   s what you think .         what did you have to go and give her them for .     kasandra hissed as she strode out of the ward .     she needs a proper  healthy  balanced diet .  not hot chips .  what did you give her them for .         well  i thought hot chips would be exactly what someone   d like who   d got used to cold chips .  anyway  she didn   t get any supper last night .  hey  there was something very odd about           she is very odd .         you don   t like her much  do you .         well  she didn   t even say thank you .         but i thought she was an unfortunate victim of a repressive political system     said johnny .     that   s what you said when we were coming here .         yes  all right  but courtesy doesn   t cost anything  actually .  come on  let   s get out of here .         hello .     said someone behind them .      they   ve found out about the chips     muttered kasandra  as she and johnny turned around .   but it wasn   t a nurse bearing down on them  unless the hospital had a plainclothes division .   it was a young woman in glasses and a worried hair style .  she also had boots that would have impressed bigmac  and a clipboard .      um   do you two know mrs    .  er   tachyon .     she said .     is that her name .         i suppose so     said johnny .     i mean  that   s what everyone calls her .         it   s a very odd name     said the woman .     i suppose it   s foreign .         we don   t actually know her     said kasandra .     we were just visiting her out of social concern .      the woman looked at her .     good grief     she said .  she glanced at her clipboard .      do you know anything about her .     she said .     anything at all .         like what .     said johnny .      anything .  where she lives .  where she comes from .  how old she is .  anything .         not really     said johnny .     she   s just around .  you know .         she must sleep somewhere .         don   t know .         there   s no records of her anywhere .  there   s no records of anyone called tachyon anywhere     said the woman  her voice suggesting that this was a major criminal offense .      are you a social worker .     said kasandra .      yes .  i   m ms .  partridge .         i think i   ve seen you talking to bigmac     said johnny .      bigmac .  who   s bigmac .         er   simon   wrigley  i think .         oh  yes     said ms .  partridge darkly .     simon .  the one who wanted to know how many cars he had to steal to get a free holiday in africa .         and he said you said you   d only send him if cannibalism was still           yes  yes     said ms .  partridge hurriedly .  when she   d started the job  less than a year ago  she   d firmly believed that everything that was wrong with the world was the fault of big business and the government .  she believed even more firmly now that it was all the fault of bigmac .      he was dead impressed  he said           but you don   t actually know anything about mrs .  tachyon  do you .     said the social worker .     she had a cart full of junk  but no one seems to know where it is .         actually       kasandra began .      i don   t know where it is either     said johnny firmly .      it   d be very helpful if we could find it .  it   s amazing what they hoard     said ms .  partridge .     when i was in bolton  there was an old lady who   d saved every           we   ll miss the bus     said kasandra .     sorry we can   t help  ms .  partridge .  come on  johnny .      she pulled him out of the building and down the steps .      you have got the cart  haven   t you .     she said .     you told me .         yes  but i don   t see why people should take it away from her or poke around in it .  you wouldn   t want people poking around in your stuff .         my mother said she was married to an airman in the second world war and he never came back and she went a bit strange .         my granddad said he and his friends used to tip up her cart when he was a boy .  he said they did it just to hear her swear .      kasandra hesitated .      what .  how old is your granddad .         dunno .  about sixty five .         and how old is mrs .  tachyon  would you say .         it   s hard to tell under all those wrinkles .  sixty .         doesn   t that strike you as odd .         what .         are you dense or something .  she   s younger than your grandfather .         oh   well   perhaps there was another mrs .  tachyon .         that isn   t very likely  is it .         so you   re saying she   s a hundred years old .         of course not .  there   s bound to be a sensible explanation .  what   s your grandfather   s memory like .         he   s good at television programs .  you   ll be watching  and then he   ll say something like     hey  him   the one in the suit   he was the policeman in that program  you know  the one with the man with the curly hair  couple of years ago  you know .     and if you buy anything  he can always tell you that you could get it for sixpence and still have change when he was a lad .         everyone   s granddad does that     said kasandra severely .      sorry .         haven   t you looked in the bags .         no   but she   s got some odd stuff .         how do you mean .         well   there are these jars of pickles    .         well .  old people like pickles .         yes  but these are   kind of new and old at the same time .  and there was fish and chips wrapped up in a newspaper .         well .         no one wraps up fish and chips in newspaper these days .  but they all looked fresh .  i had a look because i thought i might as well give the fish to the cat  and the newspaper        johnny stopped .   what could he say .  that he knew that front page .  he knew every word of it .  he   d found the same one on the microfiche in the library and the librarian had given him a copy to help him with his history project .  he   d never seen it apart from the copy and the fuzzy image on the screen and suddenly there it was  unfolded in front of him  greasy and vinegary but undoubtedly        new .      well  let   s have a look at them  at least .  that can   t hurt .      kasandra was like that .  when all else failed  she tried being reasonable .       the big black car sped up the motorway .  there were two motorcyclists in front and two more behind  and another car trailing behind them containing some serious men in suits who listened to little radios a lot and wouldn   t even trust their mothers .   sir john sat by himself in the back of the black car  with his hands crossed on his silver topped walking stick and his chin on his hands .   there were two screens in front of him  which showed him various facts and figures to do with his companies around the world  beamed down to him from a satellite  which he also owned .  there were also two fax machines and three telephones .   sir john sat and stared at them .   then he reached over and pressed the button that operated the driver   s intercom .   he   d never liked hickson much .  the man had a red neck .  on the other hand  he was the only person there was to talk to right now .      do you believe it   s possible to travel in time  hickson .         couldn   t say  sir     said the chauffeur  without turning his head .      it   s been done  you know .         if you say so  sir .         time   s been changed .         yes  sir .         of course  you wouldn   t know about it  because you were in the time that it changed into .         good thing for me then  sir .         did you know that when you change time  you get two futures heading off side by side .         must have missed that in school  sir .         like a pair of trousers .         definitely something to think about  sir john .      sir john stared at the back of the man   s neck .  it really was very red  and had unpleasant little patches of on it .  he hadn   t hired the man  of course .  he had people who had people who had people who did things like that .  it had never occurred to them to employ a chauffeur with an interest in something else besides what the car in front was doing .      take the next left turn     he snapped .      we   re still twenty miles from blackbury  sir .         do what you   re told .  right now .      the car skidded  spun half around  and headed up the off ramp with smoke coming from its tires .      turn left .         but there   s traffic coming  sir john .         if they haven   t got good brakes  they shouldn   t be on the road .  good .  you see .  turn right .         that   s just a lane .  i   ll lose my job  sir john .      sir john sighed .      hickson  i   d like to lose all our little helpers .  if you can get me to blackbury by myself  i will personally give you a million pounds .  i   m serious .      the chauffeur glanced at his mirror .      why didn   t you say so  sir .  hold on to something  sir .      as the car plunged down between high hedges  all three of the telephones started to ring .   sir john stared at them for a while .  then he pressed the button that wound down the nearest window and  one by one  threw them out .   the fax machines followed .   after some effort he managed to detach the two screens  and they went out too  exploding very satisfactorily when they hit the ground .   he felt a lot better for that .       men in black     the bus rumbled along the road toward johnny   s house .      there   s no sense in getting excited about mrs .  tachyon     said kasandra .     if she   s really been a bag lady here for years and years  then there   s a whole range of perfectly acceptable explanations without having to resort to far fetched ones .         what   s an acceptable explanation .     said johnny .  he was still wrapped up in the puzzle of the newspaper .      she   s an alien  possibly .         that   s acceptable .         or she could be an atlantean .  from atlantis .  you know .  the continent that sank under the sea thousands of years ago .  the inhabitants were said to be very longlived .         they could breathe underwater .         don   t be silly .  they sailed away just before it sank  and built stonehenge and the pyramids and so on .  they were scientifically very advanced  actually .      johnny looked at her with his mouth open .  you expected this sort of thing from bigmac and the others  but not from ki   kasandra  who was already taking ap courses at fourteen years old .      i didn   t know that     he said .      it was hushed up by the government .         ah .      kasandra was good at knowing things that were hushed up by the government  especially considering that they had been  well  hushed up .  they were always slightly occult .  when giant footprints had appeared around the town center during some snow last year  there had been two theories .  there was kir   kasandra   s  which was that it was bigfoot  and johnny   s  which was that it was a combination of bigmac and two    giant rubber feet  a wow at parties .  .  .  .     from the joke emporium in penny street .  ki   kasandra   s theory had the backing of so many official sources in the books she   d read that it practically outweighed johnny   s  which was merely based on watching him do it .   johnny thought about the atlanteans  who   d all be six feet tall in greek togas and golden hair  leaving the sinking continent in their amazing golden ships .  and on the deck of one of them  mrs .  tachyon  ferociously wheeling her cart .   or you could imagine attila the hun   s barbarians galloping across the plain and  in the middle of the line of horsemen  mrs .  tachyon on her cart .  off her rocker  too .      what happens     said kasandra     is that if you see a ufo or a yeti or something like that  you get a visit from the men in black .  they drive around in big black cars and menace people who   ve seen strange things .  they say they   re working for the government  but they   re really working for the secret society that runs everything .         how d   you know all this .         everyone knows .  it   s a well known fact .  i   ve been waiting for something like this ever since the mysterious rain of fish we had in september     said kasandra .      you mean when there was that gas leak under the tropical fish shop .         yes  we were told it was a leak under the tropical fish shop     said kasandra darkly .      what .  of course it was the gas leak .  they found the shopkeeper   s wig in the telephone wires in the high street .  everyone had guppies in their gutters .         the two might have been coincidentally connected     said kasandra reluctantly .      and you still believe that those crop circles last year weren   t made by bigmac even though he swears they were .         all right  perhaps some of them might have been made by bigmac  but who made the first ones  eh .         bazza and skazz  of course .  they read about    em in the paper and decided we should have some too .         they didn   t necessarily make all of them .      johnny sighed .  as if life wasn   t complicated enough  people had to set out to make it worse .  it had been difficult enough before he   d heard about spontaneous combustion .  you could be sitting peacefully in your chair  minding your own business  and next minute  whoosh  you were just a pair of shoes with smoke coming out .  he   d taken to keeping a bucket of water in his bedroom for some weeks after reading about that .   and then there were all these programs about aliens swooping down on people and taking them away for serious medical examinations in their flying saucers .  if you were captured and taken away by aliens  but then they messed around with your brain so you forgot about them  and they had time travel  so they could put you back exactly where you were before they   d taken you away   how would you know .  it was a bit of a worry .   kasandra seemed to think all this sort of thing was interesting  instead of some kind of a nuisance .      kasandra     he said .      yes .  what .         i wish you   d go back to kirsty .         horrible name .  sounds like someone who makes scones .         i didn   t mind kimberly           hah .  i now realize that was a name with    trainee hairdresser    written all over it .            although klymenystra was a bit over the top .         when was that .         about a fortnight ago .         i was probably feeling a bit gothy at the time .      the bus pulled up at the end of johnny   s road  and they got off .   the garages were in a little cul de sac around the backs of the houses .  they weren   t used much  at least for cars .  most of granddad   s neighbors parked in the street so that they could enjoy complaining about stealing one another   s parking spaces .      you haven   t even peeked in the bags .     said kasandra as johnny fished in his pockets for the garage key .      no .  i mean  supposing they were full of old underwear or something .      he pushed open the door .   the cart was where he   d left it .   there was something odd about it that he couldn   t quite put his finger on .  it was clearly standing in the middle of the floor but managed to give the impression of moving very fast at the same time  as though it were a still frame from a movie .   kasandra formerly kirsty looked around .      bit of a dump     she said .     why   s that bike upside down over there .         it   s mine     said johnny .     it got a puncture yesterday .  i haven   t managed to repair it yet .      kasandra picked up one of the jars of pickles from the bench .  the label was sooty .  she wiped it and turned it toward the light .         blackbury preserves ltd .  gold medal empire brand mustard pickle        she read .        six premier awards .  grand prix de foire internationale des cornichons nancy       .  festival of pickles  manchester       .  danzig p  kelnfest       .  supreme prize  michigan state fair       .  gold medal  madras       .  bonza feed award  sydney       .  made from the finest ingredients .     and then there   s a picture of some sort of crazed street kid jumping about  and it says underneath     up in the air leaps little tim  blackbury pickles have bitten him .     very clever .  well  they   re pickles .  so what .         they   re from the old pickle factory     said johnny .     it got blown up during the war .  at the same time as paradise street .  pickles haven   t been made here for more than fifty years .         oh  no .     said kasandra .     you don   t mean   we   re in a town where no pickles are made .  that   s creepy .         you don   t have to be sarcastic .  it   s just odd  was all i meant .      kasandra shook the jar .  then she picked up another sooty jar of gherkins  which sloshed as she turned it over .      they   ve kept well  then     she said .      i tried one this morning     said johnny .     it was nice and crunchy .  and what about this .      out of his pocket came the newspaper that had wrapped mrs .  tachyon   s fish and chips .  he spread it out .      it   s an old newspaper     said johnny .     i mean   it   s very old  but not old .  that   s all stuff about the second world war .  but   it doesn   t look old or feel old or smell old .  it   s           yes  i know  it   s probably one of those reprinted newspapers you can get for the day you were born  my father got me one for           wrapping fish and chips .     said johnny .      it   s odd  i must admit     said kasandra .   she turned and looked at him as though seeing him for the first time .      i   ve waited years for something like this     she said .     haven   t you .         for something like mrs .  tachyon   s cart .         try to pay attention  will you .         sorry .         haven   t you ever wondered what   d happen if a flying saucer landed in your garden .  or you found some sort of magical item that let you travel in time .  or some old cave with a wizard that   d been asleep for a thousand years .         well  as a matter of fact i did once find an old cave with           i   ve read books and books about that sort of thing  and they   re full of unintelligent children who go around saying    gosh .     they just drift along having an adventure  for goodness    sake .  they never seem to think of it as any kind of opportunity .  they   re never prepared .  well  i am .      johnny tried to imagine what   d happen if kirsty was ever kidnapped by aliens .  they   d probably end up with a galactic empire where everyone had sharp pencils and always carried a small flashlight in case of emergencies .  or they   d make a million robot copies who   d fly around the universe telling everyone not to be stupid and forcing them to be sensible .      this is obviously something very odd     she said .     possibly mystic .  possibly a time machine of some sort .      and that was the thing about her .  she arrived at an explanation .  she didn   t mess around with uncertainty .      didn   t you think that .     she said .      a time machine .  a time shopping cart .         well  what other explanation fits the facts .  apart from possibly she was kidnapped by aliens and brought here at the speed of light  which is something they do a lot for some reason .  but there might be something else   i   m sure you   ve thought of it .     she glanced at her watch .     no hurry     she added sarcastically .     take your time .         well           no rush .         well   a time machine   d have flashing lights           why .         you   ve got to have flashing lights .         what for .      johnny wasn   t going to give in .      to flash     he said .      really .  well  who says a time machine has to look like anything .     said kasandra in a superior tone of voice  or at least an even more superior voice than the one she usually used .     or has to be powered by electricity .         yo less says you can   t have time machines because everyone   d keep changing the future     said johnny .      oh .  so what   s the alternative .  how come she turned up with this new old newspaper and all these new old pickle jars .         all right  but i don   t go leaping to great big conclusions .      in fact he did .  he knew he did .  all the time .  but there was something about the way kirsty argued that automatically made you take the other side .   he waved a hand at the cart .      i mean     he said     do you really think something could just press the   oh  the handle  or the bags or something  and suddenly it   s hello  norman the conqueror .      he thumped his hand down on a black bag .   the world flashed in front of his eyes .   there was concrete under his feet  but there were no walls .  at least  not much in the way of walls .  they were one brick high .   a man cementing the new row looked up very slowly .      blimey     he said     how did you get there .     then he seemed to get a grip on himself .     hey  that concrete   s still   fred .  you come here .      a spaniel sitting by the man barked at johnny and rushed forward  jumping up at johnny and knocking him back against the cart .   there was another flash .  it was red and blue  and it seemed to johnny that he was squashed very flat and then pulled out again .   there were walls  and the shopping cart was still in the middle of the floor  as was kasandra  staring at him .      you vanished for a moment     she said  as if he   d done something wrong .     what happened .         i   i don   t know  how should i know .     said johnny .      move your feet     she said .     very slowly .      he did .  they met a very slight obstacle  a tiny ridge in the floor .  he looked down .      oh  they   re just the footprints in the cement     he said .     they   ve been   there   ages        kasandra knelt down to look at the footprints he   d been standing in .  they were ingrained with dust and dirt  but she made him take off his sneaker and held it upside down by the print .   it matched exactly .      see .     she said triumphantly .     you   re standing in your own footprints .      johnny stepped gingerly aside and looked at the footprints where he   d been standing .  there was no doubt they   d been there a long time .      where did you go .         back in time   i think .  there was a man building this place  and a dog .         a dog     said kasandra .  her voice suggested that she would have seen something much more interesting .     oh  well .  it   s a start .      she shifted the cart .  it was standing in four small grooves in the concrete .  they were dirty and oily .  they   d been there a long time too .      this     said kasandra     is no ordinary shopping cart .         it   s got tesco written on it     johnny pointed out  hopping up and down as he replaced his shoe .     and a squeaky wheel .         obviously it   s still switched on or something     kasandra went on  ignoring him .      and that   s time travel  is it .     said johnny .     i thought it   d be more exciting .  you know   battles and monsters and things .  and it   s not much fun if all we can do is   don   t touch it .      kasandra prodded a bag .   the air flickered and changed .   kasandra looked around her .  the garage hadn   t changed in any way .  except        who repaired your bike .     she said .   johnny turned .  his bike was no longer upside down with a wheel off but leaning against the wall  both tires quite full .      you see  i notice things     said kasandra .     i am remarkably observant .  we must have gone into the future  when you   ve mended it .      johnny wasn   t sure .  he   d torn three inner tubes already  plus he   d also lost the thingy from the inside of the valve .  probably no time machine could ever go so far into the future that he   d be good at cycle repair .      let   s have a look around     said kasandra .     obviously where we go is controlled by some factor i haven   t discovered yet .  if we   re in the future  the important thing is to find out which horses are going to win races  and so on .         why .         so we can bet money on them and become rich  of course .         i don   t know how to bet .         one problem at a time .      johnny looked though the grimy window .  the weather didn   t look very different .  there were no flying cars or other definite signs of futurosity .  but guilty was no longer under the bench .      granddad has a racing paper     he said  feeling a bit light headed .      let   s go  then .         what .  into my house .         of course .         supposing i meet me .         well  you   ve always been good at making friends .      reluctantly  johnny led the way out of the garage .  garden paths in the future  he noted  were made of some gritty gray substance that was amazingly like cracked concrete .  back doors were an excitingly futuristic faded blue color  with little dried flakes where the paint had bubbled up .  his was locked  but his ancient key still fitted .   there was a rectangle on the floor consisting of spiky brown hairs .  he wiped his feet on it  and looked at the time measurement module on the wall .  it said ten past three .   the future was amazingly like the present .      now we   ve got to find a newspaper     said kasandra .      it won   t be a lot of help     said johnny .     granddad keeps them around until he   s got time to read them .  they go back months .  anyway  everything   s normal .  this doesn   t look very futuristic to me .         don   t you even have a calendar .         yes .  there   s one on my bedside clock .  i just hope i   m at school  that   s all .      according to the clock  it was the third of october .      the day before yesterday     said johnny .     mind you  it could be the clock .  it doesn   t work very well .         yuk .  you sleep in here .     said kasandra  looking around with an expression like a vegetarian in a sausage factory .      yes .  it   s my room .      kirsty ran her hand over his desk  which was fairly crowded at the moment .      what   re all these photocopies and photos and things .         that   s the project i   m doing in history .  we   re doing the second world war .  so i   m doing blackbury in the war .      he tried to get between her and the desk  but kirsty was always interested in things people didn   t want her to see .      hey  this is you  isn   t it .     she said  grabbing a sepia photograph .     since when did you wear a uniform and a mixing bowl haircut .      johnny tried to grab it .     and that   s granddad when he was a bit older than me     he mumbled .     i tried to get him to talk about the war like the teacher said  but he tells me to shut up about it .         you   re so local  aren   t you     said kasandra .     i can   t imagine much happening here           something did happen     said johnny .  he pulled out mrs .  tachyon   s chip paper and jabbed at the front page with his finger .     at eleven oh seven p . m .  on may          .  bombs .  real bombs .  they called it the blackbury blitz .  and this is the paper from the day after .  look .     he rummaged among the stuff on his desk and pulled out a photocopy .     see .  i got a copy of the same page out of the library .  but this paper   s real  it   s new .         if she is   from the past   why does she wear an old ra ra skirt and sneakers .     said kasandra .   johnny glared angrily at her .  she had no right not to care about paradise street .      nineteen people got killed .  in one night .     he said .     there wasn   t any warning .  the only bombs that fell on blackbury in the whole of the war .  the only survivors were two goldfish in a bowl .  it got blown into a tree and still had water in it .  all the people got killed .      kirsty picked up a felt tipped pen  but it didn   t write because it had dried up .  johnny had a world class collection of pens that didn   t work .   she had this infuriating habit of appearing not to notice him when he was excited about something .      you know you   ve still got thomas the tank engine on your wallpaper .     she said .      what .  have i .  gosh  i hadn   t realized     said johnny  with what he hoped was sarcasm .      it   s okay to have thomas the tank engine when you   re seven  and it   s quite cool to have it when you   re nineteen  but it   s not cool at thirteen .  honestly  if i wasn   t here to help from time to time  you just wouldn   t have a clue .         granddad put it up a couple of years ago     said johnny .     this was my room when i stayed with them .  you know grandparents .  it   s thomas the tank engine until you die .      then there was the click of the front door opening .      your granddad .     hissed kasandra .      he always goes shopping in town on thursdays .     whispered johnny .     and mum   s at work .         who else has got a key .         only me .      someone started to climb the stairs .      but i can   t meet me .     said johnny .     i   d remember  wouldn   t i .  yo less says if you meet yourself  the whole universe explodes .  i   d remember that happening .      kirsty picked up the bedside lamp and glanced at the design on it .      good grief  the mr .  men  you   ve still got mr .            shutupshutupshutup .  what   re you going to do with it .         don   t worry  you won   t feel a thing .  i learned how to do this in self defense classes        the door handle turned .  the door opened a fraction .   downstairs  the phone rang .   the handle clicked back .  footsteps went downstairs again .   johnny heard the phone picked up .  a distant voice said     oh  hi  wobbler .      kasandra looked at johnny and raised her eyebrows .      wobbler phoned     said johnny .     about going to the movies yest   tomorrow .  i just remembered .         were you on the phone long .         don   t   think so .  and i went to get a sandwich afterward .         where   s your phone .         in the front room .         let   s go  then .      kasandra opened the door and darted down the stairs  with johnny trailing behind her .   his coat was on the coatrack .  he was also wearing it .  he stood and stared .      come on     hissed kasandra .   she was almost at the bottom when the door started to open .   johnny opened his mouth to say  oh  yes  i remember  i had to go and get my wallet to see if i   d got any money .   he desperately wanted not to meet himself .  if the entire universe exploded  people would be bound to blame him afterward        and there was a flash in front of his eyes .       the black car slid surreptitiously out of a side road just before a sign indicating that it was about to enter blackbury  twinned with aix et pains  .      nearly there  sir john .         good .  what time are we in .         er   quarter past eleven  sir .         that wasn   t what i meant .  if time was a pair of trousers  what leg would we be in .      it occurred to hickson the chauffeur that this might be quite a difficult million pounds to earn .      they all got mixed up today  you see     said a voice from the seat behind him .      right  sir .  if i see any trousers  sir  you just tell me what leg to drive down .          the truth is out of here     johnny was still on the stairs .  kasandra was still in front of him .  the door was shut .  his coat wasn   t on the coatrack .  the blackbury shopper  which was delivered on fridays and stayed on the hall table until someone threw it away  was indeed on the table .      we   ve time traveled again  haven   t we .     said kasandra calmly .     i think we   re back to where we started .  possibly           i saw the back of my own head .     whispered johnny .     my actual own back of my own head .  without mirrors or anything .  no one   s ever done that since the spanish inquisition .  how can you be so calm about this .         i   m just acting calm     said kirsty .     this is even worse wallpaper  isn   t it .  looks like an indian restaurant .      she opened the front door and slammed it again .      you know how i said that if you started getting too interested in mysterious occult things  these men in black cars turn up .         yes .  well .         look through the letter slot  will you .      johnny levered it open with a finger .   there was a car pulling up outside .  it was black .  utterly .  black .  black tires  black wheels  black headlights .  even the windows were darker than a pair of mafia sunglasses .  here and there were bits of chrome  but they only made the blackness blacker by comparison .   it stopped .  johnny could just make out the shadow of the driver behind the tinted glass .         s   just   coincidence     he said .      your granddad often gets visitors like this  does he .     kasandra demanded .      well       he didn   t .  granddad was not one for the social whirl .   the car door opened .  a man got out .  he was wearing a black chauffeur   s uniform .  the car door shut .  it shut with the kind of final  heavy thonk that only the most expensive car doors can achieve  because they are lined with money .   johnny let go of the letter slot and jumped back .   a few seconds later  someone banged heavily on the door .      run .     whispered kasandra .      where .         the back door .  come on .         we haven   t done anything wrong .         how do you know .      kasandra opened the back door and hurried down the path and into the garage  dragging johnny behind her .  the cart was still in the middle of the floor .      get ready to open the big doors and don   t stop for anything .         why .         open the doors now .      johnny opened them  because practically anything was better than arguing with kirsty .   the little garage area was empty  except for someone washing their car .   johnny was nearly knocked aside as the cart rattled out  with kasandra pushing determinedly on the handle .  it rattled across the concrete and lurched uncertainly into the alleyway that led to the next road .      didn   t you see that program about the flying saucer that crashed and these mysterious men turned up and hushed it all up .     said kasandra .      no .         well  did you even hear about the flying saucer crashing .         no .         see .         all right  but in that case how come there was a tv program about it  then .      a car edged around the corner into the road .      i can   t waste time answering silly questions     said kasandra .     come on .      she shoved the cart as hard as she could .  it rolled down the sloping pavement  the squeaky wheel bouncing and juddering over the slabs .   the car turned the corner very slowly  as though driven by someone who didn   t know the area very well .   johnny caught up with kir kasandra and clung to the handle because the cart was rocking all over the pavement .   the cart  under its heavy load  began to pick up speed .      try to hold it back .         i   m trying .  are you .      johnny risked a look behind .  the car seemed to be catching up .   he jumped onto the cart .      what are you playing at .     said kirsty  who was far too worried to remember any new names now .      come on .      he grabbed her hand and pulled her up on the other side of the cart .  now that she was no longer holding the handle  it surged forward .      do you think this is really a time machine .     he said  as the rushing wind made the bags flutter .      it must be .         did you see that film where the car traveled in time when it went at eighty eight miles an hour .      they looked down .  the wheels were screaming .  smoke was coming out of the axles .  they looked up the hill .  the car was catching up with them .  they looked down the hill .  there were the traffic lights .  the blackbury bypass was a solid wall of thundering traffic .   then they looked up into each other   s frightened faces .      the lights are red .  the lights are red .  i don   t want to die .     said kirsty .     i haven   t even been to university .      a hundred meters ahead  sixteen wheeled trucks barreled onward  taking a million english razor blades from sheffield to italy and  coming the other way  a million italian razor blades from rome to england .   the cart was  without a shadow of a doubt  going to smash right into the middle of them .   the air flickered .   and there were no trucks  or  rather  there were trucks  snorting and hissing and waiting at the lights .  the lights ahead of johnny were green .   the cart rolled through  wheels screaming .  johnny looked up into the puzzled faces of the drivers .   then he risked a look behind .   the black car had vanished .   there were no other turnings off the hill .  wherever it had gone  it hadn   t got there by any means known to normal cars .   he met kirsty   s eyes .      where did it go .     she said .     and what happened with the lights .  did we travel in time again .         you   re wearing your raincoat .     said johnny .     you were wearing your old coat but now you   re wearing your raincoat .  something   s changed .      she looked down  and then back up at him .   beside the crossroads was the neil armstrong shopping mall .  johnny pointed to it .      we can make this go into the parking lot .     he shouted .       the big black bentley jerked to a halt at the side of the road .      they just vanished .     said hickson  staring over the top of the wheel .     that wasn   t   this time travel stuff  was it .  i mean  they just vanished .         i think they went from one now to another now     said sir john .      is that   like   these trousers you were going on about  sir .         i suppose you could say they went from one knee to the other .  one      to another      .      hickson turned around in his seat .      are you serious  sir .  i saw this scientist on tv   you know  the one in the wheelchair   and there was all this stuff about other universes all crammed in  and           he   d know the proper way of talking about it     said sir john .     for the rest of us  it   s easier to think about trousers .         what shall we do now  sir .         oh  i think we wait until they come back to our now .         how long   s that going to be .         about two seconds  i think            in the shopping mall  a joke was going wrong .      make me   er     said bigmac     make me one with pickle and onion rings and fries .         make me one with extra salad and fries  please     said yo less .   wobbler took a long look at the girl in the cardboard hat .      make me one with everything     he said .     because   i   m going to become a muslim .      bigmac and yo less exchanged glances .      buddhist     said yo less patiently .     it   s buddhist .  make me one with everything because i   m going to become a buddhist .  it   s buddhists that want to be one with everything .  singing    om    and all that .  you mucked it up .  you were practicing all the way down here and you still mucked it up .         buddhists wouldn   t have the burger     said the girl .     they   d have the jumbo beanburger .  or just fries and a salad .      they stared at her .      vegetarianism     said the girl .     i may have to wear a paper hat  but i haven   t got a cardboard brain  thank you .     she glared at wobbler .     you want a bun with everything .  you want fries with that .         er   yes .         there you go .  have a day .      the boys took their burgers and wandered back out into the mall .      we do this every saturday     said bigmac .      yes     said wobbler .      and every saturday we work out a joke .         yes .         and you always mess up the punch line .         well   it   s something to do .      and there wasn   t much else to do at the mall .  sometimes there were displays and things .  at christmas there   d been a nice tableau of reindeer and dolls of many countries that really moved  jerkily  to music  but bigmac had found out where the controls were and speeded up everything four times  and a norwegian   s head had gone through the window of the cookie shop on the second floor .   all there was today in the way of entertainment were the people selling plastic window frames and someone else trying to get people to try a new artificial baked potato mix .   the boys sat down by the ornamental pond  and watched out for the security guards .  you could always tell where bigmac was in the mall by watching the flow of the security guards  several of whom had been hit by bits of disintegrating scandinavian and bore a grudge .  as far as anyone knew  bigmac had never been guilty of anything other than the occasional confused approach to the ownership of other people   s cars  but he had an amazing way of looking as though he was thinking about committing some rather daft crime  probably with a can of spray paint .  his camouflage jacket didn   t help .  it might have worked in a jungle  but it tended to stand out when the background was the olde card and cookie shoppe .      old johnny may be a bit of a nerd  but it   s always interesting when he   s around     said wobbler .     stuff happens .         yeah  but he hangs around with kimberly or kirsty or whoever she is today  and she gives me the creeps     said yo less .     she   s weird .  she always looks at me as if i haven   t answered a question properly .         her brother told me everyone expects her to go to university next year     said bigmac .   yo less shrugged .     you don   t have to be dumb to be weird     he said .     if you   re brainy  you can be even weirder .  it   s all that intelligence looking for something to do .  that   s what i think .         well  johnny   s weird     said bigmac .     well  he is .  it   s amazing the stuff that goes on in his head .  maybe he is a bit mental .         it   s amazing the stuff that goes on outside his head     said wobbler .     he   s just        there was a crash somewhere in the mall  and people started to shout .   a shopping cart rolled at high speed up the aisle  with shoppers running to get out of the way .  it had a plastic window frame hanging on the front and was splashed with artificial potato .  johnny and kirsty were hanging on either side .   he waved at them as he drifted past .      help us get this out .         that   s old mrs .  tachyon   s cart  isn   t it .     said yo less .      who cares .     said bigmac .  he put his burger down on the edge of the pond  where it was surreptitiously picked up by wobbler  and ran after the cart .      someone   s chasing us     johnny panted as they caught up .      brilliant .     said bigmac .     who .         some people in a big black car     said johnny .     only   they   ve vanished           oh  an invisible big black car     said yo less .      i see them all the time     said bigmac .      are you going to stand around all day .  kirsty demanded .     it   s probably got some kind of special shield .  come on .      the cart wasn   t massively heavy  although the piles of bags did weigh it down .  but it did need a lot of steering .  even with all of them helping   or  johnny thought later  perhaps because of all of them helping   it skidded and wobbled as they tried to keep it in a straight line .      if we can get out the other doors  we   re in the high street     said johnny .     and it can   t go in there because there   s bollards and things .         i wish i had my five megawatt laser cannon     said bigmac  as they fought the cart around a corner .      you haven   t got a laser cannon     said yo less .      i know  that   s why i wish i had one .         ow .      wobbler leaped back .      it bit me .     he screamed .   guilty stuck his head out of the heap of bags and hissed at johnny .   security guards were strolling toward them .  there were five kids arguing around a cart  bigmac was among them and  as yo less would have pointed out  one of them was black .  this sort of thing attracts attention .      this cart might be a time machine     said johnny .     and that car   kirsty thinks someone   s after it .  i mean me .  i mean us .         great .  how do we make it work .     said bigmac .      a time machine     said yo less .     ah .  yes .         where   s this invisible car got to .     said wobbler .      we can   t go out the other doors     said kirsty flatly .     there   s a couple of guards there .      johnny stared at the black dustbin liners .  then he picked one up and undid the string .  for a moment his fingers felt cold and the air was full of faint whispers     the mall vanished .   it vanished above them  and around them .   and below them .   they landed in a heap on the grass  about a meter below where they   d been standing .  the cart landed on top of them  one wheel slamming into the small of johnny   s back .  bags bounced out  and guilty took the opportunity to scratch bigmac   s ear .   and then there was silence  except for bigmac swearing .   johnny opened his eyes .  the ground sloped up all around him .  there were low bushes at the top .      if i asked what happened     said yo less  from somewhere under bigmac     what   d you say .         i think we may have traveled in time     said johnny .      did you get an electric feeling .     said wobbler  clutching his jaw .     like   all your teeth standing on end .         which way did we go .     said yo less  talking in his deliberate voice .     are we talking dinosaurs  or mutant robots .  i want to know this before i open my eyes .      kirsty groaned .      oh dear  it   s going to be that kind of adventure after all     she hissed  sitting up .     it   s just the sort of thing i didn   t want to happen .  me  and four token boys .  oh  dear .  oh  dear .  it   s only a mercy we haven   t got a dog .     she sat up and brushed some grass off her coat .     anyone got the least idea of where we are .         ah     said yo less .     i see there   s grass .  that means no dinosaurs .  i saw that in a film .  grass didn   t evolve until after there were dinosaurs .      johnny stood up .  his head was aching .  he walked to the edge of the little hollow they   d landed in  and looked out .      really .  someone   s been paying attention     said kirsty .     well  that narrows it down to sometime in the last sixty million years .         proper time travelers have proper digital readouts     wobbler grumbled .     no grass .  what did dinosaurs eat  then .         you only get digital time machine clocks in america     said bigmac .     i saw a film about a time machine in victorian england and it just had lightbulbs .  they ate other dinosaurs  didn   t they .         you   re not allowed to call them dinosaurs anymore     said yo less .     it   s speciesist .  you have to call them pre petroleum persons .         yeah     said bigmac .     one million years pc .  get it .     cos there was this film called one million years bc  but        kirsty   s mouth was open .      do you lot go on like this all the time .     she said .     yes  you do .  i   ve noticed it before  actually .  rather than face up to facts  you start yakking on about weird things .  when are we .         may the twenty first     said johnny  sitting down next to her .     just gone half past three .         oh yes .     said kirsty .     and how come you   re so sure .         i went and asked a man who was walking his dog     said johnny .      did he say what year .      johnny met kirsty   s gaze .     no     he said .     but i know what year .      they climbed out of the hollow and pushed their way through the bushes .   a scrubby field stretched away below them .  there were some allotment gardens at the bottom end of the field  and then a river  and then the town of blackbury .   it was definitely blackbury .  there was the familiar rubber boot factory chimney .  there were a few other tall chimneys as well .  he   d never seen those before .  the man with the dog was watching them from some way off .  so was the dog .  neither of them seemed particularly jurassic  although the dog looked somewhat suspicious .      wha    .     said wobbler .     here  what   s been happening .  what have you done .         i told you we   d traveled in time     said kirsty .     weren   t you listening .         i thought it was just some trick .  i thought you were just messing about .     he gave johnny a very worried look .     this is just messing about  isn   t it .         yes .      wobbler relaxed .      it   s messing about with time travel     said johnny .   wobbler looked scared again .      sorry .  but that   s blackbury all right .  it   s just smaller .  i think we   re where the mall is going to be .         how do we get back .     said yo less .      it just sort of happens  i think .         you   re just doing it with hallucinations  aren   t you .     said wobbler  never a boy to let go of hope .     it   s probably the smell from the cart .  we   ll come around in a minute and have a headache and it   ll all be all right .         it just sort of happens .     said yo less .  he was using his careful voice again  the voice that said there was something nasty on his mind .     how do you get back .         there   s a flash  and there you are     said kirsty .      and you   re back where you left .         of course not .  only if you didn   t move .  otherwise you go back to wherever where you are now is going to be then .      there was silence while they all worked this out .      you mean     said bigmac     that if you walk a couple of meters  you   ll be a couple of meters away from where you started when you get back .         yes .         even if there   s been something built there .     said yo less .      yes   no   i don   t know .         so     said yo less  still speaking very slowly     if there   s a lot of concrete  what happens .      they all looked at kirsty .  she looked at johnny .      i don   t know     he said .     probably you kind of   get lumped together .         yuk     said bigmac .   there was a wail from wobbler .  sometimes  when it involved something horrible  his mind worked very fast .      i don   t want to end up with just my arms sticking out of a concrete wall .         oh  i don   t think it   d happen like that     said yo less .   wobbler relaxed  but not much .     how would it happen  then .     he said .      what i think would happen is  see  all the atoms in your body  right  and all the atoms in the wall would be trying to be in the same place at the same time and they   d all smash together suddenly and           and what .     said kirsty .         and   er   bang  good night  europe     said yo less .     you can   t argue with nuclear physics  sorry .         my arms wouldn   t end up sticking out of a wall .     said wobbler  who hadn   t quite caught up .      no     said yo less .      not a wall near here  anyway     said bigmac  grinning .      don   t wind him up     said yo less severely .     this is serious .  it could happen to any of us .  we dropped when we landed  right .  does that mean that if we suddenly go back now  we   ll be sticking out of the floor of the mall  causing an instant atomic explosion .         they make enough fuss when you drop a coke can     said johnny .      where   s wobbler gone .     said kirsty .   wobbler was a disappearing shape  heading for the allotments .  he shouted something .      what   d he say .     she said .      he said     i   m off home .        said johnny .      yeah  but       said bigmac     where he   s running now   if we   re where the mall is   will be   then over there   s the shopping center .  that field he   s running across .     he squinted .     that   s where curry   s is going to be .         how will we know we   re about to go back .     said yo less .      there   s a sort of flicker for a moment     said johnny .     then   zap .  er   what   ll happen if he comes out where there   s a fridge or something .  is that as bad as a concrete wall .         i don   t know much about fridge atoms     said yo less .     they might not be as bad as concrete atoms .  but i shouldn   t think anyone around here would need new wallpaper ever again .         wow .  an atomic wobbler .     said bigmac .      let   s get the cart and go after him     said johnny .      we don   t need it .  leave it here     said kirsty .      no .  it   s mrs .  tachyon   s .             there   s just one thing i don   t understand     said yo less as they hauled the cart across the field .      there   s millions of things i don   t understand     said johnny .      what .  what .  what are you going on about now .         televisions .  algebra .  how skinless sausages hold together .  chinese     said johnny .     i don   t understand any of them .         the cart   s got no works     said yo less .     there   s no time machinery .         maybe the time is in the bags     said johnny .      oh  right .  bags of time .  you can   t just shove time in a bag .         maybe mrs .  tachyon didn   t know that .  she   s always picking up odds and ends of stuff .         you can   t pick up time  actually .  time   s what you pick things up in     said kirsty .      my granny saves string     said bigmac  in the manner of someone who wants to make a contribution .      really .  well  you can   t pick up the odd half hour and knot it onto another ten minutes you   ve got spare  in case you haven   t noticed     said kirsty .     honestly  don   t they teach you any physics at your school .  fridge atoms was bad enough .  what on earth   s a fridge atom .         the smallest possible particle of fridge     said yo less .   perhaps you could save time  johnny thought rebelliously .  you could waste it  it could run through your fingers  and you could put a stitch in it .  of course  perhaps that was only a manner of speaking and it all depended on how you looked at it  but mrs .  tachyon looked at things in a corkscrew kind of way .   he remembered touching a bag .  had time leaked out .  something had hissed through his fingers .      you can   t have the smallest possible particle of fridge .  it   d just be iron atoms and so on .     said kirsty .      a fridge molecule  then .  one atom of everything you need to make a fridge     said yo less .      you couldn   t ha   well  all right  you could have one atom of everything you need to make a fridge but that wouldn   t make it a fridge molecule because       she rolled her eyes .     what am i saying .  you   ve got me thinking like that now .      the rest of the universe said that time wasn   t an object  it was just nature   s way of preventing everything from happening at once  and mrs .  tachyon had said  that   s what you think    .   the path across the field led through the allotments .  they looked like allotments everywhere  with the occasional old man who looked exactly like the old men who worked on allotments .  they wore the special old man   s allotment trousers .   one by one  they stopped digging as the cart bumped along the path .  they turned and watched in a silent allotment way .      it   s probably yo less   s coat they   re looking at     kirsty hissed .     purple  green  and yellow .  it   s plastic  right .  plastic hasn   t been around for long .  of course  it might be bigmac   s heavy mental t shirt .      they   re planting beans and hoeing potatoes  thought johnny .  and tonight there   s going to be a crop of great big bomb craters    .      i can   t see the bypass     said bigmac .     and there   s no tv tower on blackdown .         there   s all those extra factory chimneys  though     said yo less .     i don   t remember any of those .  and where   s the traffic noise .      it   s may           thought johnny .  i know it .   there was a very narrow stone bridge over the river .  johnny stopped in the middle of it and looked back the way they   d come .  a couple of the allotment men were still watching them .  beyond them was the sloping field they   d arrived in .  it wasn   t particularly pretty .  it had that slightly gray tint that fields get when they   re right next to a town and know that it   s only a matter of time before they   re under concrete .      i remember when all this was buildings     he said to himself .      what   re you going on about now .         oh  nothing .         i recognize some of this     said bigmac .     this is river street .  that   s old patel   s shop on the corner  isn   t it .      but the sign over the window said   smoke woodbines  j .  wilkinson  prop .   .      woodbines .     said bigmac .      it   s a kind of cigarette  obviously     said kirsty .   a car went past .  it was black  but not the dire black of the one on the hill .  it had mud and rust marks on it .  it looked as though someone had started out with the idea of making a very large mobile jelly mold and had changed their mind about halfway through  when it was slightly too late .  johnny saw the driver crane his head to stare at them .   it was hard to tell much from the people on the streets .  there were a lot of overcoats and hats  in a hundred shades of boredom .      we shouldn   t hang around     said kirsty .     people are looking at us .  let   s go and see if we can get a newspaper .  i want to know when we are .  it   s so gloomy .         perhaps it   s the depression     said johnny .     my granddad   s always going on about when he was growing up in the depression .         no tv  everyone wearing old fashioned clothes  no decent cars     said bigmac .     no wonder everyone was depressed .         oh  god     said kirsty .     look  try to be careful  will you .  any little thing you do could seriously affect the future .  understand .      they entered the corner shop  leaving bigmac outside to guard the cart .   it was dark inside  and smelled of floorboards .   johnny had been on a school visit once  to a sort of theme park that showed you what things had been like in the all purpose olden days .  it had been quite interesting  although everyone had been careful not to show it  because if you weren   t careful they   d sneak education up on you while your guard was down .  the shop was a bit like that  only it had things the school one hadn   t shown  like the cat asleep in the sack of dog biscuits .  and the smell .  it wasn   t only floorboards in it .  there was kerosene in it  and cooking  and candles .   a small lady in glasses looked at them carefully .      yes .  what can i do for you .     she said .  she nodded at yo less .      sambo   s with you  dear  is he .     she added .       the olden days     guilty lay on top of the bags and purred .   bigmac watched the traffic .  there wasn   t a lot .  a couple of women met one another as they were both crossing the street  and stood there chatting in the middle of the road  although occasionally one of them would turn to look at bigmac .   he folded his arms over heavy mental .   and then a car pulled up  right in front of him .  the driver got out  glanced at bigmac  and walked off down the street .   bigmac stared at the car .  he   d seen ones like it on television  normally in those costume dramas where one car and two women with a selection of different hats keep going up and down the same street to try to fool people that this isn   t really the present day .   the keys were still in the ignition .   bigmac wasn   t a criminal  he was just around when crimes happened .  this was because of stupidity .  that is  other people   s stupidity .  mainly other people   s stupidity in designing cars that could go from   to     mph in ten seconds and then selling them to even more stupid people who were only interested in dull things like fuel consumption and what color the seats were .  what was the point in that .  that wasn   t what a car was for .   the keys were still in the ignition .   as far as bigmac was concerned  he was practically doing people a favor by really seeing what their cars could do  and no way was that stealing  because he always put the cars back if he could and they were often nearly the same shape .  you   d think people   d be proud to know their car could do     mph along the blackbury bypass instead of complaining all the time .   the keys were still in the ignition .  there were a million places in the world where the keys could have been  but in the ignition was where they were .   old cars like this probably couldn   t go at any speed at all .   the keys were still in the ignition .  firmly  invitingly  in the ignition .   bigmac shifted uncomfortably .   he was aware that there were people in the world who considered it wrong to take cars that didn   t belong to them  but however you looked at it        the keys were still in the ignition .       johnny heard kirsty   s indrawn breath .  it sounded like concorde taking off in reverse .   he felt the room grow bigger  rushing away on every side  with yo less all by himself in the middle of it .   then yo less said     yes  indeed .  i   m with them .  lawdy  lawdy .      the old lady looked surprised .      my word  you speak english very well     she said .      i learned it from my grandfather     said yo less  his voice as sharp as a knife .     he ate only very educated missionaries .      sometimes johnny   s mind worked fast .  normally it worked so slowly that it embarrassed him  but just occasionally it had a burst of speed .      he   s a prince     he said .      prince sega     said yo less .      all the way from nintendo     said johnny .      he   s here to buy a newspaper     said kirsty  who in some ways did not have a lot of imagination .   johnny reached into his own pocket and then hesitated .      only we haven   t got any money     he said .      yes we have  i   ve got at least two pou       kirsty began .      we haven   t got the right money     said johnny meaningfully .     it was pounds and shillings and pence in those days  not pounds and pee           pee .     said the woman .  she looked from one to the other like someone who hopes that it   ll all make sense if they pay enough attention .   johnny craned his head .  there were a few newspapers still on the counter  even though it was the afternoon .  one was the times .  he could just make out the date .   may          .      oh  you have a paper  dear     said the old woman  giving up .     i don   t suppose i shall sell any more today .         thank you very much     said johnny  grabbing a paper and hurrying the other two out of the shop .      sambo     said yo less  when they were outside .      what .     said kirsty .     oh  that .  never mind about that .  give me that newspaper .         my granddad came here in          said yo less in the same plonking  hollow voice .     he said little kids thought his color   d come off if he washed .         yes  well  i can see you   re upset  but that   s just how things were   it   s all changed since then     said kirsty  turning the pages .      then hasn   t even happened yet     said yo less .     i   m not stupid .  i   ve read old books .  we   re back in golliwog history .  plucky darkies and hooray for the empire .  she called me sambo .         look     said kirsty  still reading the newspaper .     this is the olden days .  she didn   t mean it   you know  nastily .  it   s just how she was brought up .  you people can   t expect us to rewrite history  you know .      johnny suddenly felt as though he   d stepped into a deep freeze .  it was almost certainly the you people .  sambo had been an insult  but you people was worse  because it wasn   t even personal .   he had never seen yo less so angry .  it was a kind of rigid  brittle anger .  how could someone as intelligent as kirsty be so dumb .  what she needed to do now was say something sensible .      well  i   m certainly glad you   re here     said yo less  sarcasm gleaming on his words .     so   s you can explain all this to me .         all right  don   t go on about it     she said  without looking up .     it   s not that important .      it was amazing  johnny thought .  kirsty had a sort of talent for striking matches in a fireworks factory .   yo less took a deep breath .   johnny patted him on the arm .      she didn   t mean it   you know  nastily     he said .     it   s just how she was brought up .      yo less sagged  and nodded coldly .      you know we   re in the middle of a war  don   t you .     said kirsty .     that   s what we   ve ended up in .  world war two .  it was very popular around this time .      johnny nodded .   may the twenty first       .   not many people cared or even knew about it now .  just him  and the librarian at the public library who   d helped him find the stuff for the project  and a few old people .  it was ancient history  after all .  the olden days .  and here he was .   and so was paradise street .   until tonight .      are you all right .     said yo less .   he hadn   t even known about it until he   d found the old newspapers in the library .  it was   it was as if it hadn   t counted .  it had happened  but it wasn   t a proper part of the war .  and worse things had happened in a lot of other places .  nineteen people hardly mattered .   but he   d imagined it happening in his town .  it was horribly easy .   the old men would go home from their allotments .  the shops would shut .  there wouldn   t be many lights in any case  because of the blackout  but bit by bit the town would go to sleep .   and then  a few hours later  it   d happen .   it   d happen tonight .       wobbler wheezed along the road .  and he did wobble .  it wasn   t his fault he was fat  he   d always said  it was just his genetics .  he had too many of them .   he was trying to run  but most of the energy was getting lost in the wobbling .   he was trying to think  too  but it wasn   t happening very clearly .   they hadn   t gone time traveling .  it was just a joke .  they were always trying to tease him .  he   d get home and have a sit down  and it   d all be all right    .   and this was home .   sort of .   everything was   smaller  somehow .  the trees in the street were the wrong size and the cars were wrong .  the houses looked   newer .  and this was gregory road .  he   d been along it millions of times .  you went along halfway and turned into        into     a man was clipping a hedge .  he wore a high collar and tie and a pullover with a zigzag pattern .  he was also smoking a pipe .  when he saw wobbler  he stopped clipping and took his pipe out of his mouth .      can i help you  son .     he said .      i   er   i was looking for seeley crescent     whispered wobbler .   the man smiled .      well  i   m councillor edward seeley     he said     but i   ve never heard of a seeley crescent .     he called over his shoulder to a woman who was weeding a flower bed .     have you heard of a seeley crescent  mildred .         there   s a big chestnut tree on the corner       wobbler began .      we   ve got a chestnut tree     said mr .  seeley  pointing to what looked like a stick with a couple of leaves on it .  he smiled .     it doesn   t look much at the moment  but just you come back in fifty years    time  eh .      wobbler stared at it  and then at him .   it was a wide garden here  with a field beyond it .  it struck him that it was quite wide enough for a road  if   one day   someone wanted to build a road    .      i will     he said .      are you all right  young man .     said mrs .  seeley .   wobbler realized that he wasn   t panicking anymore .  he   d run out of panic .  it was like being in a dream .  afterward it all sounded daft  but while you were in the dream  you just got on with it .   it was like a rocket taking off .  there was a lot of noise and worry and then you were in orbit  floating free  and able to look down on everything as if it weren   t real .   it was an amazing feeling .  wobbler had spent a large part of his life being frightened of things  in a vague kind of way .  there were always things he should have been doing  or shouldn   t have done .  but here it all didn   t seem to matter .  he wasn   t even born yet   in a way  anyway   so absolutely nothing could be his fault .      i   m fine     he said .     thank you very much for asking .  i   ll   just be off back into town .      he could feel them watching him as he wandered back down the road .   this was his hometown .  there were all sorts of clues that told him so .  but all sorts of other things were   strange .  there were more trees and fewer houses  more factory chimneys and fewer cars .  a lot less color  too .  it didn   t look much fun .  he was pretty certain no one here would even know what a pizza was           ere  mister     said a hoarse voice .   he looked down .   a boy was sitting by the side of the road .   it was almost certainly a boy .  but its short trousers reached almost to its ankles  it had a pair of glasses with one lens blanked out with brown paper  its hair had been cut apparently with a lawn mower  and its nose was running .  and its ears stuck out .   no one had ever called wobbler    mister    before  except teachers when they wanted to be sarcastic .      yes .     he said .      which way   s london .     said the boy .  there was a cardboard suitcase next to him  held together with string .   wobbler thought for a moment .     back that way     he said  pointing .     dunno why there   s no road signs .         our ron says they took    em all down so jerry wun   t know where he was     said the boy .  he had a line of small stones on the curb beside him .  every so often he   d pick one up and throw it with great accuracy at a tin can on the other side of the road .      who   s jerry .      one eye looked at him with deep suspicion .      the germans     said the boy .     only i wants    em to come here and blow up mrs .  density a bit .         why .  are we fighting the germans .     said wobbler .      are you   n american .  our dad says the americans ought to fight  only they   re waitin    to see who   s winnin    .         er       wobbler decided it might be best to be american for a bit .     yes .  sure .         garn .  say something american .         er   right on .  republican .  microsoft .  spider man .  have a nice day .      this demonstration of transatlantic origins seemed to satisfy the small boy .  he threw another stone at the tin can .      our mam said i   ve got to stop along of mrs .  density   s and the food   s all rubbish     said the boy .     you know what  she makes me drink milk .  i dint mind the proper milk at home  but around here  you know what  it comes out of a cow   s bum .  i seen it .  they took us to a farm with all muck all over the place  and you know what  you know how eggs come out .  urrr .  and she makes us go to bed at seven o   clock and i miss our mam and i   m going home .  i   ve had enough of being    vacuated .         it can really make your arm ache     said wobbler .     i had it done for tetanus .         our ron says it   s good fun  going down the underground station when the siren goes off     the boy went on .     our ron says the school got hit an    none of the kids has to go anymore .      it seemed to wobbler that it didn   t matter what he said .  the boy was really talking to himself .  another stone turned the can upside down .      huh     said the boy .     like to see    em hit the school here .  they just pick on us just    cos we   re from london and  you know what  that atterbury kid pinched my piece of shrapnel .  our ron give it me .  our ron   s a copper  he gets a chance to pick up really good stuff for me .  you don   t get shrapnel around here  huh .         what   s shrapnel .     said wobbler .      are you a loony .  it   s bits of bomb .  our ron says alf harvey got a whole collection an    a bit off   f a heinkel .  our ron said alf harvey found a real nazi ring with an actual finger still in it .     the boy looked wistful  as though unfairly shut off from untold treasures .     huh .  our ron says other kids down our street have gone back home  and i reckon i   m old enough  too  so i   m goin    .      wobbler had never bothered much with history .  as far as he was concerned  it was something that had happened to other people .   he vaguely remembered a tv program with some film shot back in the days when people were so poor they could only afford to be in black and white .   kids with labels around their necks  waiting at railway stations .  every single adult wearing a hat     evacuees  that was it .  sent out from the big cities so   s they wouldn   t get bombed  it said .      what year   s this .     he said .   the boy looked at him sideways .      you   re a spy  incha     he said  standing up .     you don   t know anyfink about nuffink .  you ain   t american    cos i seen    em on the pictures .  if you   re   n american  where   s your gun .         don   t be daft   americans don   t all have guns     said wobbler .     lots of them don   t have guns .  well   some don   t  anyway .         our ron said there was something in the paper about german parachuters landing disguised as nuns     said the boy  backing away .     seems to me you could   ve been a parachuter  if it was a big parachute .         all right  i   m english     said wobbler .      oh  yeah .  who   s the prime minster  then .      wobbler hesitated .      i don   t think we   ve done that at school     he said .      you don   t get no lessons in knowing about winston churchill     said the boy dismissively .      hah  you   re just trying to mess me around     said wobbler .        cos i know for a fact we   ve never had a black prime minister .         you don   t know nuffink     said the boy  grabbing his battered suitcase .     and you   re fat .         i don   t have to stand here listening to you     said wobbler  heading off down the road .      spy spy spy     said the boy .      oh  shut up .         an    you wobble .  i saw that g  ring on the newsreels .  you look jus    like him .  an    you   re dressed up all funny .  spy spy spy .      wobbler sighed .  he was fairly used to this  only not so much these days because once he   d just been fat and now he was big and fat .      and you   re stupid     he said .     but at least i could get slimmer .      biting sarcasm didn   t work .      spy spy spy .  nasty nasty nazi .      wobbler tried walking faster .      i   m goin    to tell mrs .  density an    she can telephone our ron and he can come an    arrest you .     shouted the boy  jumping along behind him .   wobbler tried walking faster still .      he   s got a gun  our ron .      a man went by slowly on his bike .      he   s a spy     said the boy  pointing at wobbler .     i   m arresting him for our ron .      the man just grinned at wobbler and pedaled onward .      our ron says you spies send morse code messages to nazi submarines by flashing lights     said the boy .      we   re twenty miles from the sea     said wobbler  who   d almost broken into a run .      you could stand on something high .  nyah nyah nyah .  spy spy spy .          it was just plain stupid  thought bigmac as he watched the two plumes of steam in front of him .   what kind of idiots built a car without power steering or synchromesh gears and put in brakes apparently operated by string .  he was practically doing the world a favor by taking the car off the road .   not just off the road  in fact  but over the sidewalk and across a flower bed and into the alderman bowler memorial horse trough .   the plumes of steam were quite pretty  really .  there were little rainbows in them .      well  now     said a voice  as someone opened a car door     what do we have here .         i think i banged my head     said bigmac .   a large hand encircled his arm and pulled him out of the car .  bigmac looked up into two round faces that had    policeman    written all over them .  there was room for quite a lot of things to be written all over them .  they were very large faces .      that is dr .  roberts   s car     they said     and you  my lad  are in for it .  what   s your name .         simon wrigley     mumbled bigmac .     ms .  partridge knows all about me    .         she does  does she .  and who   s she .      bigmac blinked at the two faces  which miraculously flowed together and became one .   he   d quite liked ms .  partridge .  she was nasty .  the two social workers he   d had before had made out that he was soft  whereas ms .  partridge made it clear that if she had her way  bigmac would have been strangled at birth .  you could respect someone like that .  they didn   t make you feel like some kind of a useless nerd .   something prodded at his memory .      when is this .     he said  rubbing his head .      you can start by telling me where you live       the policeman leaned closer .  there was something about bigmac that bothered him .      what do you mean  when is this .     he said .      what year .      the policeman had fairly fixed ideas about what should happen to car thieves  but they usually knew what year it was .      it   s          he said  and straightened up .  his eyes narrowed .      who   s the captain of the england cricket team .     he said .   bigmac blinked .      what .  how should i know .         who won the boat race last year .         what boat race .      the policeman looked again .      and what   s that on your belt .      bigmac blinked again and looked down .      i didn   t swipe it     he said quickly .     it   s only a transistor  anyway .         what   s that wire going into your ear .         don   t be daft .  it   s only the earphone        the policeman   s hand landed on his shoulder with the kind of thud that suggested it wasn   t going to let go in a hurry .      you come along with me  fritz     he said .     i wasn   t born yesterday .      bigmac   s brain drifted into focus .  he looked at the uniform  and at the crowd behind it  and it began to dawn on him that he was all alone and a long  long way from home .      i wasn   t born yesterday either     he said .     does that help .          johnny  kirsty  and yo less sat in a little garden .  as far as johnny could tell  it was where part of the ring road and a traffic island were going to be one day .  now it contained a bench and some geraniums .      they   ll blow up paradise street tonight     said johnny .      where   s that .     said yo less .      here .  it   s where the sports center was   will be  i mean .         never heard of it .         yes .  i did say .  it got blown up .  and you know the funny thing about it .         there   s something funny about it .     said kirsty .      it was by accident .  the germans had meant to bomb the big freight yard at slate .  but they got a bit lost and the weather turned bad and they saw the railway yards here and dropped all their bombs and went home .  everyone was in bed because the air raid sirens didn   t go off in time .         all right  all right  i know  you   ve told me before  and all about adolf and stalin .  it   s very sad  but you shouldn   t get worked up about it     said kirsty .     it   s history .  that sort of thing happens in history .         aren   t you listening .  it hasn   t happened yet .  this is now .  it   s going to happen tonight .      they stared at the geraniums .      why haven   t we gone back yet .     said kirsty .     we   ve been here ages .         how should i know .     said johnny .     maybe the farther you go  the longer you stay .         and we just happened to go to somewhere you know all about     said yo less .     that   s a bit strange  in my opinion .      it had worried johnny  too .  everything felt real  but maybe he   d just gone mad and taken everyone else with him .      i don   t want to stay here  that   s definite     said yo less .     being little black sambo wasn   t my idea of a full life .      johnny stood up and grasped the handles of the cart .      i   m going to see paradise street     he said .      that   s a very bad idea     said kirsty .     i told you  anything you do affects the future .         i   m only going to have a look .         oh yes .  i find that very hard to believe  actually .         she   s right     said yo less  trying to keep up .     you shouldn   t mess around with time .  i read this book where a man went right back in time and trod on   on a dinosaur  and changed the whole future .         a dinosaur .     said kirsty .      i think it was a dinosaur .  maybe they had small ones .         huh .  or he was a very big man  perhaps     said kirsty .   the cart bumped off the sidewalk  rattled across the road  and clanked up the sidewalk on the other side .      what   re you going to do .     said kirsty .     knock on people   s doors and say     excuse me  some bombers are going to bomb this street tonight    .         why not .         because they   ll lock you up  that   s why     said yo less .      right     said kirsty .     it   ll be just like the man who trod on yo less   s dinosaur .         it may have been some sort of insect  now i come to think of it     said yo less .     anyway  there   s nothing you can do .  it   s already happened  otherwise how come you know about it .  you can   t mess up history .      the cart stopped so quickly that they ran into the back of johnny .      why does everyone always talk like that .     he said .     it   s stupid .  you would really watch someone get run over by a car because that   s what was supposed to happen  would you .  everything we do changes the future  all the time .  so we ought to do what   s right .         don   t shout   people are looking at us     said kirsty .   the cart bumped over the curb and started to bounce on some cobbles .  they were already out of the town center .   and there was paradise street .   it wasn   t very long .  there were only ten terraced houses on either side  and some of them were boarded up .  the far end was a pair of double wooden gates to a factory .  they   d once been painted green  but time and the weather had turned the color into a sort of mossy gray .   someone had chalked a set of goalposts on the doors  and half a dozen small boys in knee length shorts were kicking a ball about .   johnny watched them as they scuffled and perpetrated fouls that would have gladdened the heart of any soccer manager .   about halfway along the street a young man was repairing a motorcycle .  tools lay on a piece of sacking on the pavement .  the ball emerged from a complicated tackle  hit the wrenches  and almost knocked the bike over .      turn it up  you little devils     said the man  pushing the ball away .      you never said anything about children     said kirsty  so quietly that johnny nearly didn   t hear her .   johnny shrugged .      it   s all going to get blown up .     said yo less .   johnny nodded .      there wasn   t very much detail in the local paper     he said .     they didn   t used to put very much in  in case the enemy read it .  it all had to do with something they called the war effort .  you know   not wanting to let the enemy know you   d been hurt .  there was a photo of a lady with her thumb up  saying    blackbury can take it  mister hitler .     but there was hardly anything else about the raid until a couple of years afterward .         you mean the government hushed it up .     said kirsty .      makes sense  i suppose     said yo less gloomily .     i mean  you don   t want to say to the enemy     hey  you missed your target  have another go .         the ball slammed against the factory gates  rattling them .  there didn   t seem to be any teams .  the ball just went everywhere  surrounded by a mob of small boys .      i don   t see what we could do     said kirsty .  her voice sounded uneasy now .      what .  just now you were telling me i shouldn   t do anything     said johnny .      it   s different when you see people  isn   t it .         yes .         i suppose it wouldn   t work if we just told someone .         they   d say    how do you know .     and then you   d probably get shot as a spy     said yo less .     they used to shoot spies .          heavy mental     the man in the khaki uniform turned bigmac   s transistor radio over and over in his hands .   bigmac watched nervously .  there was a police sergeant in the room  and bigmac was familiar with policemen .  but there was a soldier standing by the door  and he had a gun in a holster .  and the one sitting down looked tired but had a very sharp expression .  bigmac was not the fastest of thinkers  but it had dawned on him that this was unlikely to be the kind of situation where you got let off with a warning .      let   s start again     said the seated soldier  who had introduced himself as captain harris .     your name is    .      bigmac hesitated .  he wanted to say     you get ms .  partridge  she   ll sort it all out  it   s not my fault  she says i   m socially dysfunctional     but there was an expression on the captain   s face that suggested that this might be a very unfortunate move .      simon wrigley .         and you say you are fourteen years old and live in      captain harris glanced at his notes      the joshua che n   clement    block     which is near here  you say .         you can see it easily     said bigmac  trying to be helpful .     or you could  if it was here .      the captain and the police sergeant glanced at each other .      it   s not here .     said the captain .      yes .  i don   t know why     said bigmac .      tell me again what heavy mental is     the captain said .      they   re a neopunk thrash band     said bigmac .      a music band .         er  yes .         and we would have heard them on the radio  perhaps .         i shouldn   t think so     said bigmac .     their last single was    i   m going to rip off your head and spit down the hole .               rip off your head          said the policeman  who was taking notes .            and spit down the hole        said bigmac helpfully .      this watch of yours with the numbers on it     said the captain .     i see it   s got little buttons  too .  what happens if i press them .      the policeman tried to move away a little .      the one on the left lights it up so you can see it in the dark     said bigmac .      really .  and why would you want to do that .         when you wake up in the night and want to know what time it is .     bigmac suggested  after some deep thought .      i see .  and the other button .         oh  that   s to tell you what time it is in another country .      everyone suddenly seemed very interested .      what other country .     said the captain sharply .      it   s stuck on singapore     said bigmac .   the captain laid it down very carefully .  the sergeant wrote out a label and tied it to the watch strap .  then the captain picked up bigmac   s jacket .      what is this made of .     he said .      i dunno .  some kind of plastic     said bigmac .     they sell them down at the market .      the captain pulled it this way and that .      how is it made .         ah  i know that     said bigmac .     i read about it .  you mix some chemicals together  and you get plastic .  easy .         in camouflage colors     said the captain .   bigmac licked his lips .  he was sure that he was in deep trouble  so there was no sense in pretending .      that   s just to make you look tough     he said .      tough .  i see     said the captain  and his eyes didn   t give away whether he really saw or not .  he held up the back of the jacket and pointed to two words done rather badly in pen .      what exactly are blackbury skins .     he said .      er .  that   s me and bazza and skazz .  er .  skinheads .  a   kind of gang           gang     said the captain .      er .  yes .         skinheads .         er   the haircut     said bigmac .      looks like an ordinary military haircut to me     said the sergeant .      and these     said the captain  pointing to the swastikas on either side of the name .     gang badges  are they .  also to make you look   tough .         er   it   s just   you know   adolf hitler and that     said bigmac .   all the men were staring at him .      it   s just decoration     said bigmac .   the captain put the coat down very slowly .      it   s nothing to get excited about     said bigmac .     where i come from  you can buy badges and things down the market  you can get gestapo knives           that   s enough .     said the captain .     now listen to me .  you   ll make it easier on yourself if you tell me the truth right now .  i want your name  the names of your contacts   everything .  a unit is coming from headquarters and they aren   t as patient as i am  do you understand .      he stood up and started to put bigmac   s labeled belongings into a box .      hey  that   s my stuff       mumbled bigmac .      lock him up .         you can   t lock me up just for some old car           we can for spying     said captain harris .     oh  yes  we can .      he strode out of the room .      spying .     said bigmac .     me .         are you one of them hitler youths .     said the sergeant conversationally .     i saw you lot on the newsreel .  waving all them torches .  nasty pieces of work  i thought .  like boy scouts gone bad .         i haven   t spied for anyone .     shouted bigmac .     i don   t know how to spy .  i don   t even like germany .  my brother got sent home from munich for attacking one of their soccer fans with a scaffolding pole even though it wasn   t his fault .      such rock solid evidence of anti germanic feeling did not seem to impress the sergeant .      you can get shot  you know     he said     for the first offense .      the door was still open .  bigmac could hear noises in the corridor .  someone was talking on the phone  somewhere in the distance .   bigmac wasn   t an athlete .  if there was an olympic sick note event  he would have been on the british team .  he would   ve won the     meter i   ve got asthma  the half marathon lurk in the changing rooms  and the freestyle got to go to the doctor .   but his boots dug into the floor and he rose out of his chair like a missile going off .  his feet barely touched the tabletop .  he went past the policeman   s shoulder with his legs already making running motions .  fear gave him superhuman acceleration .  ms .  partridge might make cutting remarks  but she wasn   t allowed to use bullets however much she wanted to .   bigmac landed in the doorway  turned at random  put his head down  and charged .  it was a hard head .  it hit someone around belt level .  there was a shout and a crash .   he saw another gap and headed for it .  there was another crash  and the sound of a telephone smashing on the floor .  someone yelled at him to halt or they   d fire .   bigmac didn   t stop to find out what   d happened .  he just hoped that a pair of     s doc martens that had been practically bought legally by his brother off a man with a truck full of them were much better for dodging and running than huge police boots .   whoever had been shouting stop or they   d fire   fired .   there was a crack and a clang somewhere ahead of bigmac  but he turned down a corridor  ran under the outstretched arms of another policeman  and sped out into a yard .   a policeman was standing next to a jurassic bicycle  a huge machine that looked as if it were made of drain pipes welded together .   bigmac went past him in a blur  grabbed the handle bars  swung onto the saddle  and rammed his feet onto the pedals .         ere  what   re you doin           the policeman   s voice faded behind him .   the bike swung out into the lane behind the station .   it was a cobbled street .  the saddle was solid leather .  bigmac   s trousers were very thin .   no wonder everyone was very depressed  he thought  trying to cycle standing up .          nyah nyah nyah .  spy spy spy .         shut up .     said wobbler .     why don   t you run away to london .         ain   t gonna run away to london now     said the boy .        s lots more fun catchin    spies here .      they were back in the heart of the town now .  the boy trailed behind wobbler  pointing him out to passersby .  admittedly  no one seemed to be about to arrest him  but he was getting some odd looks .      my brother ron   s a policeman     said the boy .     he   ll come up from london and shoot you with his gun .         go away .         shan   t .          opposite the entrance to paradise street was a small church .  it was a nonconformist chapel  according to yo less .  it had a shut up  wet sunday look .  a couple of elderly evergreen trees on either side of the door looked as though it   d take a shovel just to get the soot off their needles .   the three of them sat on the steps  watching the street .  a woman had come out and was industriously scrubbing her doorstep .      did this chapel get hit .     said kirsty .      you mean will .  i don   t think so .         pity .         it   s still here   i mean  in          said yo less .     only it   s just used as a social hall .  you know  for keep fit classes and stuff .  i know     cos i come here for morris dance practice every wednesday .  will  i mean .         you .     said kirsty .     you do morris dancing .  with sticks and hankies and stuff .  you .         there   s something wrong .     said yo less coldly .      well   no   no  of course not   but   it   s just an unusual interest for someone of   your        yo less let her squirm for a bit and then said     height .     he dropped the word like a weight .  kirsty shut her mouth .      yes     she said .   another woman appeared  next door to the one scrubbing her front doorstep  and started scrubbing her doorstep .      what are we going to do .     said kirsty .      i   m thinking     said yo less .   somewhere in the distance a bell went off  and kept on going off .      i   m thinking  too     said johnny .     i   m thinking  we haven   t seen bigmac for ages .         good     said kirsty .      he might be in some trouble  i mean     said johnny .      what do you mean  might be .     said yo less .      and we haven   t seen wobbler  either     said johnny .      oh  you know wobbler .  he   s probably hiding somewhere .      another woman opened her door on the other side of the street and entered the doorstep scrubbing competition .   kirsty straightened up .      why   re we acting so miserable .     she said .     we   re nineties people .  we should be able to think of something .  we could   we could           we could phone adolf hitler     yo less suggested .     can   t remember his phone number  sorry  but information in germany   re bound to know .      johnny stared glumly at the shopping cart .  he hadn   t expected time travel to be this hard .  he thought of all those wasted lessons when they could have been telling him what to do if some madwoman left him a cart full of time .  school never taught you anything that was useful in real life .  there probably wasn   t a single textbook that told you what to do if it turned out you were living next door to elvis presley .   he looked down the length of paradise street and felt time streaming past him .  yo less and kirsty faded away .  he could feel them there  though  as insubstantial as dreams  as the light faded from the sky and the soccer players went indoors and the wind got up and the clouds rolled in from the southwest and the town went to sleep and the bombers came out of the east and fire rained down on the houses and the allotments and the people and the goalposts chalked on the wall and all the nice  clean  white doorsteps    .       captain harris turned bigmac   s watch over .      amazing     he said .     and it says    made in japan .            fiendishly cunning     said the police sergeant .   the captain picked up the radio .      japanese again     he said .     why .  why put it on the back .  see here .     made in japan .            i thought it was all rice     said the sergeant .     that   s what my dad said .  he was out there .      captain harris fiddled one of the tiny headphones into his ear and moved a switch .  he listened to the hiss that was due to be replaced by radio blackbury in forty eight years    time  and nodded .      it   s doing something     he said .  his thumb touched the wave change switch  and he blinked .      it   s the home service     he said .     clear as a bell .         we could have the back off it in no time     said the sergeant .      no     said captain harris .     this has got to go to the ministry .  the men in white coats can have a look at it .  how can you get valves to fit in this .  where   s the aerial .         very small feet     said the sergeant .      sorry  sergeant .         that   s what my dad said .  japanese .  the women .  very small feet  he said .  so maybe they   ve got small hands  too .  just a thought .     the sergeant tried to extend his line of technological speculation .     good for making small things .  you know .  like ships in bottles .      the captain put the tiny radio back in the box .      i   ve seen people do them     said the sergeant  still anxious to be of assistance .     you get a bottle  then you get a lot of very thin thread           he   s the best actor i   ve ever seen  i know that     said captain harris .     you could really think he was just a stupid boy .  but this stuff   i just can   t believe it .  it   s all very   odd .         we   ve got every man out after him     said the sergeant .     and the inspector has called out the army from west underton .  we   ll have him in no time .      the captain sealed the box with sticky tape .      i want this guarded     he said .      we   ll keep an eye on it in the main office .         no .  i want it secure .         well  there   s an empty cell .  actually there   s someone in it  but i   ll soon have    em out .         more secure than that .      the sergeant scratched an ear .      there   s the lost property cupboard     he said .     but there   s important stuff in it           lost property cupboard .  haven   t you got a safe .         no .         what   d happen if the crown jewels were found in the gutter  then .         we   d put    em in the lost property cupboard     said the sergeant promptly .     and then ring up the king .  if his name was in them  of course .  look  it   s a good thick door and there   s only one key and i   ve got it .         all right  take out what   s in there and put it in your cell and put the box in the cupboard     said the captain .      chief inspector won   t like that .  very important stuff  lost property .         tell him we can cooperate in a very friendly fashion now or if he prefers he can take a call from the chief constable in two minutes     said captain harris  putting his hand on the phone .     one way or the other  hmm .      the sergeant looked worried .     you serious about this  sir .     he said .      oh  yes .         that stuff   s not going to go off bang or anything  is it .         i   m not sure .  i don   t think so .      five minutes later the sergeant walked down to the cells with his arms full of the contents of the cupboard  and a put upon expression on his face .  he put the objects on a bench in the corridor and fished out his keys .  then he pulled aside the hatch in a cell door .      you all right  old girl .         that   s what you think .  talk about a blue pencil .  you can tell he   s a lad  can   t yer  mister shadwell .         yes  yes     said the sergeant  opening the door .   the old lady sat on the bed .  she was so short that her feet swung several inches above the floor .  and there was a cat on her lap .  it growled when it saw the sergeant   a slow  rising growl that suggested that if there was any attempt to pick the cat up  it was all going to end in claws .   the sergeant had long ago stopped worrying about how the cat could get into the cells .  it happened every time .  there wasn   t room via the windows and it certainly couldn   t have got in through the door  but every night the old lady was in the cells  the cat would be in there  too  in the morning .      finished your breakfast  have you .         millennium hand and shrimp     said mrs .  tachyon happily .      good .  then you just come along with me .  it   s a nice day outside     said the sergeant .      beam me up  scotty     said mrs .  tachyon  standing up and following him obediently .  the sergeant shook his head sadly .   she trailed behind him into the station yard where  under a bit of canvas the sergeant had thrown over it the night before  there was a wire cart loaded down with bags .   mrs .  tachyon looked at it .      no one swiped anything .     she said .   she was like that  the sergeant thought .  mad as a hatter most of the time  and then suddenly a sentence   d come out at you like a razor blade in cotton candy .      now then  old love  as if anyone   d touch that lot     he said  as kindly as possible .      points win prizes .  hats .      the sergeant reached under the cart and produced a pair of boots .      these belonged to my mum     he said .     she was going to throw    em out  but i said  there   s still some good leather on them        mrs .  tachyon snatched them out of his hand .  in seconds they were somewhere in the pile of bags on the cart .      it   s a small step for a man     said mrs .  tachyon .      yes  they   re size sixes     said the sergeant .      ah  bisto .  it   s a great life if yer don   t weaken  but of course they   ve put a bridge there now .      the sergeant looked down at the cart .      dunno where you get this stuff from     he said .     what   re these bags made of  love .  looks like rubber or something .         obbly obbly ob .  weeeed .     said mrs .  tachyon .     i told them  but no one listens to a teapot .  fab .      the sergeant sighed  put his hand in his pocket  and produced a sixpence .      get yourself a cup of tea and a bun     he said .      hats .  that   s what you think     said mrs .  tachyon  taking it .      don   t mention it .      the sergeant headed back into the police station .   he was used to mrs .  tachyon .  when nights were cold  you   d sometimes hear a milk bottle smash on the step outside .  this was technically a crime  and it meant that mrs .  tachyon was looking for somewhere warm for the night .   not on every cold night  though .  that was a puzzler  and no mistake .  last winter it had been very nippy indeed for quite a long time and the lads had got a bit worried .  it came as quite a relief when they   d heard the crash of breaking glass and the cry of    i told    em .  that   s what you think .     mrs .  tachyon came and went  and no one knew where she came from  and you never found out where she   d gone    .   beam me up  snotty .  mad as a hatter  of course .   but   strange  too .  like  after you   d given her something  you ended up feeling as if she   d done you a favor .   he heard the rattle of the cart behind him  and then a sudden silence .   he turned around .  the cart  and mrs .  tachyon  had gone .       johnny felt the hereness of here .  it   d happen here  not in some far off country full of odd names and foreign people with thick mustaches shouting slogans .   it   d happen here  where there were public libraries and pedestrian crossings and people who watched soccer .   bombs would come crashing through roofs and ceilings and down to the cellars  and turn the world white .   and it would happen  because as yo less said  it had happened .  it was going to have happened  and he couldn   t possibly stop it  because if he did find some way of stopping it  then he wouldn   t know about it happening  would he .   maybe mrs .  tachyon collected time .  johnny felt  in a way that he couldn   t quite put into words  that time wasn   t just something that was on clocks and calendars but lived in people   s heads  too .  and if that meant you had to think like this  no wonder she sounded mad .      are you all right .     said a voice a long way away .   miraculously  the rubble became houses again  the light came up  the ball rattled against the goal in the warm afternoon air .   kirsty waved a hand in front of his face .      are you okay .         i was just   thinking     said johnny .      i hate it when you switch off like that .         sorry .      johnny stood up .      we didn   t come back here by accident     he said .     i was thinking a lot about tonight  and we ended up coming here just in time .  i don   t know why .  but we   ve got to do something  even if there   s nothing we can do .  so i   m going to        a bicycle came around the corner .  it was bouncing up and down on the cobbles and the skinny figure riding it was a mere blur .  it clanked to a halt in front of them .   they stared at the cyclist .  he was shaking so much  he looked slightly out of focus .      bigmac .         ur ur ur       shuddered bigmac .      how many fingers am i holding up .     said kirsty .      ur ur ur n n nineteen .  h h hide the bike .         why .     said kirsty .      i didn   t do anything .         ah     said yo less knowingly .     it   s like that  is it .      he picked up the bike and wheeled it into the sooty shrubs .      like what .     said kirsty  looking bewildered .      bigmac always never does anything     said johnny .      that   s right     said yo less .     there can   t be anyone in the whole universe who   s got into so much trouble for things he didn   t do in places he wasn   t at that weren   t his fault .         th th they shot at me .         wow .     said yo less .     you must   ve not done anything really big this time .         th there was th this c car        the ringing johnny had heard before started again  somewhere behind the buildings .      th that   s a police car .     said bigmac .     i tried to give them the slip down harold wilson drive and   it wasn   t there .  and one of them shot at me .  with an actual gun .  soldiers aren   t supposed to shoot people .      they dragged the trembling bigmac into the horrible bushes .  kirsty gave him her raincoat to stop him shivering .      all right  game over .  i said game over .     he moaned .     let   s pack it in  all right .  let   s go home .         i think we should try to tell people about the bombs     johnny said .     someone might listen .         and if they ask how do you know  you   ll say you   re from       will you .         maybe you could   you know   write a note     said yo less .     slip it into someone   s letter box .         oh  yes .     said kirsty hotly .     what should we write .     go for a long walk    perhaps .  or    wear a very hard hat    .      she stopped when she saw johnny   s expression .      sorry     she said .     i didn   t mean that .         wobbler .     said yo less .   they turned .  wobbler was toiling along the street .  it took some effort for wobbler to manage a run  but when he did so  there was also something terribly unstoppable about him .   he spotted them  and changed direction .      am i glad to see you     he panted .     let   s get out of here .  some loony kid chased me all the way down the hill .  he kept shouting out that i was a spy .         did he try to shoot you .     said bigmac .      he threw stones .         hah .  i got shot at .     said bigmac with a sort of pride .      all right     said kirsty .     we   re all here .  let   s go .         you know i don   t know how .     said johnny .   the bags lay there in the cart .  there were the words shop at tesco   s on a piece of metal on the front of the wire .  probably mr .  tesco just owned a tiny grocery shop or something back here  johnny thought wildly .  or hadn   t been born yet .      it   s your mind that works it     said kirsty .     it must be .  you go where you   re thinking .         oh  come on     said yo less .     that   s like magic .      johnny stared at the cart again .     i could   try     he said .   a police car went by  a street away .      let   s get somewhere more hidden     said yo less .      good idea     muttered bigmac .   a cinder path went around the back of the little church  to an area with trash cans and a heap of dead flowers .  there was a small green door .  it opened easily .      in those   in these days  they didn   t lock churches     said yo less .      but there   s silver candlesticks and stuff  isn   t there .     said bigmac .     anyone could walk right in and swipe    em .         don   t     said johnny .   they manhandled the cart into a back room .  it contained a tea urn on a trestle table  a pile of battered hymn books  and not much else except the smell of old embroidery  furniture polish  and stale air  which is known as the odor of sanctity .  there was no sign of any silver candlesticks anywhere        bigmac .  shut that cupboard .     said yo less .      i was only looking .      johnny stared at the sacks .  all right  he thought .  let   s say they   re full of time .  it   s a daft idea .  after all  they   re quite small sacks     on the other hand  how much space does time take up .   perhaps it   s compressed   folded up    .   mrs .  tachyon collects time like other old ladies collect string .   this is daft .   but     there was a deep  rumbling sound .  guilty had sat up in the cart and was purring happily .   johnny took a sack and held it carefully by the neck .  it felt warm  and he was sure it moved slightly under his grip .      this probably won   t work     he said .      should we hold on to the cart .     said yo less .      i don   t think so .  i don   t know .  look  are you all sure .  i really don   t know what i   m doing .         yes  but you   ve never really known what you   re doing  have you .     said kirsty .      that   s right     said yo less .     so you   ve had a lot of practice .      johnny shut his eyes and tried to think of        .   the thought crept into his mind from somewhere outside .  it   s not a time  it   s a place .   it   s a place where the model of the space shuttle on the ceiling hangs by a bit of red yarn because you ran out of black thread .   and the model   s got streaks of glue on it because you always get it wrong somewhere .   it   s a place where your mum just smokes a lot and looks out the window .   it   s a place where your granddad watches tv all day .   it   s where you want to be .   his mind began to go fuzzy at the edges .  he thought of the thomas the tank engine wallpaper and the mr .  men lamp  until they were so close he could almost taste them .  he could hear the place where granddad had hung the wallpaper wrong so that there was an engine that was half thomas and half james .  it hung like a beacon in his head .   he opened his eyes .  the images were still around him  the others looked like ghosts .  they were staring at him .   he opened the bag  just a fraction .       wobbler swallowed .      er       he said .   he turned around .  and then  just in case  he looked behind the table .      er   guys .  johnny .  bigmac .  yo less .     he swallowed again  but sometimes you just had to face up to unpleasant facts  and so he bravely said     er   kirsty .      no one answered .  there was no one there to answer .   he was all alone with the tea urn .      hey  i was even holding on .     he said .     oi .  i   m still here .  very funny  ha ha  now joke over  all right .  guys .  johnny .  you   ve left me behind .  all right .  it worked  yes .  joke over  ha ha ha  all right .  please .      he opened the door and looked out into the shadowy yard .      i know you   re only doing this to tease me  well  it hasn   t worked     he moaned .   then he went back and sat on a bench with his hands on his lap .   after a while he fished out a grubby paper handkerchief and blew his nose .  he was about to throw it away when he stopped and glared at it .  it was probably the only paper handkerchief in the world .      i can see you peering out at me     he said  but his heart wasn   t in it .     you   re going to jump out any minute  i know .  well  it   s not working .     cos i   m not worried  see .  let   s all go home and get a burger  eh .  good idea  eh .  tell you what  i   ve got some money  i don   t mind buyin       em  eh .  hey .  or we could go down to the chinese and get takeout        he stopped  and looked exactly like someone who   d realized that it was going to be a long  long time before there were any bean sprouts in this town .  or burgers  come to that .  all there probably was to eat was meat and fish and stuff .      all right  fair enough  you can come out now    .      a fly stirred on the windowsill  and started to bang itself absentmindedly on the glass .      look  it   s not funny anym   more  all right .      there was a movement of air behind him  and a definite sensation that  where there had been no one  there was now someone .   wobbler turned around  a huge relieved grin on his face .      ha  i bet you thought you   d got me going   what .          the over   s    keep fit class was in full wheeze .  the tutor had long ago given up expecting everyone to keep up  so she just pressed on in the hope that people would do what they could manage and  if possible  not actually die while on the premises .      and bend and bend and bend and   do the best you can  miss windex   step and step and   what .      she blinked .   johnny looked around .   the keep fit class  after ten minutes of aerobics  were not the most observant people .  one or two of them actually made space for the newcomers .   the tutor hesitated .  she   d been brought up to believe in a healthy mind in a healthy body  and  since she was pretty sure she had a healthy body  it was not possible  she reasoned  that a group of people and an overloaded shopping cart could have suddenly appeared at the back of the old church hall .  they must have just come in  she reasoned .  admittedly  there was no actual door there  but people certainly didn   t just appear out of thin air .      where are we .     kirsty hissed .      same place     whispered yo less .     different time .      even some of the slower fitness fans had caught up by now .  the whole class had stopped and turned around and were watching them with interest .      well  say something .     said kirsty .     everyone   s looking .         er   is this pottery .     said johnny .      what .     said the tutor .      we   re looking for beginners    pottery     said johnny .  it was a wild stab  but every hall and hut and spare room in blackbury seemed to have its time filled up with people doing weird hobbies or industriously learning russian .   a small light went on behind the tutor   s eyes .  she grabbed at the familiar words like a singer snatching a microphone .      that   s thursdays     she said .     in the red cross hall .         oh .  is it .  tch .  we   re always getting it wrong     said johnny .      and after we   ve lugged all this clay up here  too     said yo less .     that   s a nuisance  isn   t it  bigmac .         don   t look at me     said bigmac .     they shot at me .      the tutor was staring from one to the other .      er .  yes .  well  it can get pretty nasty in beginners    pottery     said johnny .     come on  everyone .      they all grabbed hold of the cart .  tracksuited figures limped politely out of the way as it squeaked its way across the floor  bumped down the step  and landed in the damp yard outside .   johnny pushed the door shut behind them and listened for a moment .         well  then   bend and stretch and wheeze and bend        he straightened up .  it was amazing what you could get away with .  ten legged aliens would be immediately accepted in blackbury if they were bright enough to ask the way to the post office and complain about the weather .  people had a way of just not seeing anything that common sense said they shouldn   t see .      i bet something   s gone wrong     said bigmac .      er       said yo less .      no  this has got to be the     s     said kirsty .     it   s the only period in history when you wouldn   t be burned at the stake for wearing a green and purple tracksuit  isn   t it .      the bulk of the sports center loomed opposite them .  five minutes ago  thought johnny  five of my minutes ago  that was a street .  get your head around that .      er       said yo less again .      they shot at me     said bigmac .     a real bullet .  i heard it hit the actual wall .         er       said yo less .      oh  what   s the matter with you .     said kirsty .      er   where   s wobbler .      they looked around .      oh  no       said johnny .   they were wobblerless .      i ain   t going back .     said bigmac  backing away .     not to get shot at .         he wouldn   t have wandered off again  would he .     said kirsty .      no     said johnny .     he must still be there .         look  get a grip  will you .     said kirsty .     you said the church doesn   t get hit .  he   s okay .         yes   but he   s okay in      .         s   posing something goes wrong .     said bigmac .     he didn   t come back this time  s   posing we go back and all get stuck .  i   ll get shot .         you think you   ve got problems .     said yo less .     i   d have to learn to play the banjo .         will you all stop panicking and think for a moment .     said kirsty .     this is time travel .  he   s always going to be there  whenever we go back .  of course we ought to go and get him .  but we don   t have to rush .      of course  it was true .  he   d always be there  thought johnny .  they could go back in ten years    time and he   d still be there .  just like something on a tape   you could play it  and fast forward  and rewind  and it would always be there .  and later that night  the bombs would land in paradise street   and that night would always be there .  forever .  every second  always there .  like little fossils .   kirsty hauled the cart away and pushed it down the steps toward the pavement .      his mum    n    dad   ll worry     said yo less uncertainly .      no  they won   t     said kirsty .     because we can bring him back to right here .         really .  why can   t we see us doing it  then .     said yo less .     you mean any minute we   re just going to pop up with wobbler and say    hi  us  here   s wobbler  see you later    .         oh  good grief     said kirsty     i can   t think about that .  you can   t think about time travel with a logical mind .      yo less turned and looked at johnny   s face .      oh  no     he said     he   s off again    .      everything   s there waiting  johnny thought .  that   s the thing about time .  it doesn   t matter how long it takes to build a time machine .  we could all die out and evolution could start again with moles or something  it could take millions of years  but sooner or later someone will find out how to do it .  it might not even be a machine .  it might just be a way of understanding what time is  like everyone was scared of lightning and then one day someone said  look  you can store it in little bottles and then it was just electricity .  but it wouldn   t actually matter  because once you   d worked out how to use it  everything would be there .  if someone ever finds a way of traveling in time  ever  in the entire history of the universe  then they could be here today .   and then he thought of the bombers  nosing through the clouds over the houses and the soccer players and all those clean doorsteps    .      uh .     he said .      you all right .     said yo less .      let   s get a drink  at least     said kirsty  shoving the cart firmly toward the town center .   and then she stopped .   johnny hadn   t often seen her shocked .  kirsty normally dealt with the terrible and the unexpected by getting angry with it .  but now she stopped  and went pale .      oh  no       she said .   the road from the old church led down the hill toward traffic lights at the bottom .   an overloaded shopping cart  with a boy and a girl clinging to it  was hurtling down the other road .   as they watched  it heeled over like a yacht tacking against the wind  turned a full ninety degrees  and plunged into the parking lot of the neil armstrong shopping mall .   a long black car followed it .   he   d forgotten all about the car .  maybe there were secret societies .  maybe there were men in black in long black cars who said things like    the truth is out there     and came and found you if you got your hand trapped in the occult .   johnny could see a map in his head .  but it was a map of time .   they   d moved in time at his house .  but yo less was right  you probably could move in time like a train on a track  so you flipped over onto another track just a little bit farther along .  you moved in space  really .   and he   d done it again  when he   d thought they were going to die at the traffic lights .  and the black car had vanished   because it didn   t exist in this time .  he definitely hadn   t seen it when he   d looked behind him .   they   d come back to a time when it existed .   the car pulled to a halt outside the mall .   a feeling of absolute certainty stole over johnny .  he knew the answer .  later on  with any luck  he   d find out what the question was  but right now he was sure of the answer .   forget about secret societies .  forget about time police .  policemen had to have nice logical minds  and to deal with time you needed a mind like mrs .  tachyon   s .   but there was someone else who   d know where they   d be today  wasn   t there .      because   supposing we didn   t go back .  supposing   maybe we went back and did things wrong .   he started to run .   johnny dodged across the road .  a car hooted at him .   across in the parking lot  a man in black  with black sunglasses and a peaked black hat  got out of the car and hurried into the mall .   johnny leaped over the low wall into the parking lot and weaved between shoppers and their carts        and panted to a halt in front of the car .   it had stopped right in front of the entrance  where no one was ever allowed to park .   in the bright sunlight it looked even blacker than johnny remembered .  its engine ticked occasionally as it cooled down .  on the hood was a silver ornament .   it looked very much like a hamburger .   if he squinted  johnny could just make out a figure in the rear seat  a mere shadow behind the darkness of the glass .   he ran around and snatched at the handle of the back door  yanking it open .      all right .  i know you   re in there .  who are you  really .      most of the figure was in deep shade  but there was a pair of hands visible  resting on a black cane with a silver head .   then the figure moved .  it unfolded slowly  and became a large man in a coat that was half coat  half cloak .  he emerged carefully  making sure both feet were firmly on the ground before easing the rest of his body out of the car .   he was quite tall  tall enough to be big rather than fat .  he wore a large black hat and had a short  silvery beard .   he smiled at johnny  and nodded at the others as they hurried up .      who am i .     he said .     well  now   why don   t you guess .  you were always good at this sort of thing .      johnny looked at him  and then at the car  and then back up the hill to where the old church was just visible .      i think       he said .      yes .     said the old man .     yes .  go on .         i think that   i mean  i don   t know   but i know i   m going to know   i mean  i think i know why you   ve come to find us    .         yes .      johnny swallowed .     but we were       he began .   the old man patted him on the shoulder .      call me sir john     he said .       trousers of time     there were differences in the mall .  one big difference  certainly .  the burger bar had changed .  there were different shaped paper hats  and the color scheme was blue and white instead of red and yellow .   the old man led the way .      who is he .     hissed kirsty .      you   ll laugh if i tell you .  this is time travel .  i   m still trying to work out the rules .      sir john sat down heavily in a seat  motioned them to sit down as well  and then did the second worst thing anyone could do in a fast food restaurant .   he snapped his fingers at a waitress .   all the staff were watching them anxiously .      young lady     said sir john  wheezing slightly     these people will have whatever they want .  i will have a glass of water .  thank you .         yes  sir john     said the waitress  and hurried away .      you   re not s   posed to do that     said bigmac hoarsely .     you   re s   posed to line up .         no  you   re supposed to line up     said sir john .     i don   t have to .         have you always been called sir john .     said johnny .   the man winked at him .      you know  don   t you .     he said .     you   ve worked it out .  you   re right .  names are easily changed  especially in wartime .  i thought it might be better .  i got the knighthood in      for services to making huge amounts of money .      the waitress hurried back with the water  and then produced a notebook and looked expectantly at them all with the bright  brittle smile of someone who is expecting to be sacked at any moment .      i   ll have   well  i   ll have everything     said yo less .      me too     said bigmac .      cheeseburger .     said johnny .      chili beanburger     said kirsty .     and i want to know what   s going on  okay .      sir john beamed at her in a slightly distracting way .  then he nodded at the waitress .      make me one with everything     he said slowly and carefully  as if quoting something he   d heard a long time ago     because i want to become a muslim .         a buddhist     said yo less  without thinking .     you always muck up the punchl       then his mouth dropped open .      do i .     said wobbler .          well   i hung around for a while and you didn   t come back     said wobbler .     and then           but we did .  i mean  we will .     said kirsty .      this is where it gets difficult     said wobbler patiently .     johnny knows .  supposing you didn   t go back .  supposing you were scared to  or you found that you couldn   t .  the possibility exists  and that means the future forks off in two different ways .  in one you went back  in one you didn   t .  now you   ve ended up in the future where you didn   t go back .  i   ve been here since      .  don   t try to think too hard about this  because it   ll make your brain hurt .      anyway   first i stayed with mr .  and mrs .  seeley     he continued .     i   d met them that first day .  their son was away in the navy  and everyone thought i was an evacuee who was a bit daft  and what with one thing and another  there   s too much to worry about in a big war for people to ask too many questions about one fat boy .  they were very nice people .  they sort of   adopted me  i suppose  because their son got torpedoed .  but i moved away after a few years .         why .     said kirsty .      i didn   t want to meet my own parents or anything like that     said wobbler .  he still seemed out of breath .     history is full of patches as it is  without causing any more trouble  eh .  changing my name wasn   t hard  either .  in a war   well  records go missing  people get killed  everything gets shaken up .  a person can duck down and pop up somewhere else as someone else .  i was in the army for a few years  after the war .         you .     said bigmac .      oh  everyone had to be .  national service  it was called .  out in berlin .  and then i came back and had to make a living .  would you like another milkshake .  i personally wouldn   t  if i were you .  i know how they   re made .         you could   ve invented computers .     said bigmac .      really .  you think so .     the old man laughed .     who   d have listened to a boy who hadn   t even been to university .  besides   well  look at this        he picked up a plastic fork and tapped it on the table .      see this .     he said .     we throw away millions of them every day .  after five minutes    use they   re in the trash  right .         yes  of course     said kirsty .  behind wobbler  the staff were watching nervously  like monks in some quiet monastery somewhere who   ve just had saint peter drop in for tea .      a hundred years ago it   d have been a marvel .  and now we throw them away without a second thought .  so   how do you make one .         well   you get some oil  and   i think there   s something about it in a book i   ve got           right     said wobbler  leaning back .     you don   t know .  i don   t know  either .         but i wouldn   t bother with that .  i   d write science fiction     said kirsty .     moon landings and stuff .         you probably could     said wobbler .  a tired expression crossed his face  and he started to pat the pockets of his coat as if looking for something .     but i   ve never had much of a way with words  i   m afraid .  no .  i opened a hamburger bar .      johnny looked around  and then started to grin .      that   s right     said wobbler .     in      .  i knew it all  you see .  thick shakes  double smashers with cheese   n egg  paper hats for the staff  red sauce in those little round plastic bottles that look like tomatoes   oh  yes .  i had three bars in the first year  and ten the year after that .  there   s thousands  now .  other people just couldn   t keep up .  i knew what would work  you see .  birthday treats for the kids  the willie wobbler clown           willie wobbler .     said kirsty .      sorry .  they were more innocent times     said wobbler .     and then i started   other things .  soft toilet paper  for a start .  honestly  the stuff they had back in the     s you could use as roofing felt .  and when that was going well  i started to listen to people .  people with bright ideas .  like    i think i could make a tape recorder really small so that people could carry it around     and i   d say     that might just catch on  you know  here   s some money to get started .     or    you know  i think i know a way of making a machine to record television signals on tape so that people could watch them later     and i   d say     amazing .  whatever will they think of next .  here   s some money  why don   t we form a company and build some .  and while we   re about it  why don   t we see if movies can be put on these tape thingies too .            that   s dishonest     said kirsty .     that   s cheating .         i don   t see why     said wobbler .     people were amazed that i   d listen to them  because everyone else thought they were crazy .  i made money  but so did they .         are you a millionaire .     said bigmac .      oh  no .  i was a millionaire back in      .  i   m a billionaire now  i think .     he snapped his fingers again .  the chauffeur in black  who had silently appeared behind them  stepped forward .      i am a billionaire  aren   t i  hickson .         yes  sir john .  many times .         thought so .  and i think i own some island somewhere .  what was it called now   tasmania  i think .      wobbler patted his pockets again and finally brought out a slim silver case .  he flicked it open and took out two white pills  which he swallowed .  he grimaced and sipped from his glass of water .      you haven   t touched your one with everything     said johnny  watching him .      oh  i asked for it just to make the point     said wobbler .     i   m not allowed to eat them .  good heavens .  i have a diet .  no sodium  no cholesterol  low starch  no sugar .     he sighed .     even a glass of water is probably too exciting .      the manager of the burger bar had at last plucked up the courage to approach the table .      sir john .     he said .     this is a such an honor           yes  yes  thank you  please go away  i   m talking to my friends       wobbler stopped  and smiled evilly .     fries all right  bigmac .  properly crisp .     he said .     what about that milkshake  yo less .  right sort of texture  is it .      the boys glanced up at the manager  who suddenly looked like a man praying to the god of everyone who has to work while wearing a name badge saying    my name is keith .         er   they   re fine     said bigmac .      great     said yo less .   keith gave them a relieved grin .      they   re always good     said yo less .      i expect     said bigmac     that they   ll go on being good .      keith nodded hurriedly .      we   re gen   rally in most saturdays     added bigmac helpfully .     if you want us to make sure .         thank you  keith  you may go     said wobbler .  he winked at bigmac as the man almost ran away .      i know i shouldn   t do it     he said     but it   s about the only fun i get these days .         why did you come here .     asked johnny quietly .      you know  i couldn   t resist doing a little checking     said wobbler  ignoring him .     i thought it might be   interesting   to watch myself growing up .  not interfering  of course .     he stopped smiling .     and then i found i wasn   t born .  i   d never been born .  nor was my father .  my mother lived in london and was married to someone else .  that   s one thing about money .  you can buy any amount of private detectives .         that   s nonsense     said kirsty .     you   re alive .         oh  yes     said wobbler .     i was born .  in another time .  in the leg of the trousers of time that we were all born in .  and then i went back in time with you all  and   something went wrong .  i   m not sure what .  so   i had to come back the long way .  you could say i had to walk home .         i   m sure that   s not logical     said kirsty .   wobbler shrugged .     i don   t think time is all that logical     he said .     it bends itself around humans .  it   s probably full of loose ends .  whoever said it shouldn   t be .  sometimes loose ends are necessary .  if they weren   t  spaghetti would be merely an embarrassing experience .     he chuckled .     spoke to a lot of scientists about this .  damn fools .  idiots .  time   s in our heads .  any fool can see that           you   re ill  aren   t you .     said johnny .      is it obvious .         you keep taking pills  and your breathing doesn   t sound right .      wobbler smiled again .  but this time there was no humor in it .      i   m suffering from life     he said .     however  i   m nearly cured .         look     said kirsty  in the voice of one who is trying to be reasonable against the odds     we weren   t going to leave you there .  we were going to go back .  we will go back .         good     said wobbler .      you don   t mind .  because surely  if we do  you won   t exist  will you .         oh  i will .  somewhere     said wobbler .      that   s right     said johnny .     everything that happens   stays happened .  somewhere .  there   s lots of times side by side .         you always were a bit of an odd thinker     said wobbler .     i remember that .  an imagination so big  it   s outside your head .  now   what was the other thing .  oh  yes .  i think i have to give you this .      the chauffeur stepped forward .      er   sir john  you know the board did want        there was a blur in the air .  wobbler   s silver headed cane hit the table so hard that bigmac   s fries flew into the air .  the crack echoed around the restaurant .      goddamnit  man  i   m paying you  and you will do what i say .  the board can wait .  i   m not dead yet .  i didn   t get where i am today by listening to a lot of lawyers whining .  i   m having some time off .  go away .      wobbler reached into his jacket and took out an envelope .  he handed it to johnny .      i   m not telling you to go back     he said .     i   ve got no right .  i   ve had a pretty good life  one way and the other           but     said johnny .  through the glass doors of the mall he could see a car and four motorcycles pull up .      i   m sorry .     said wobbler .      the next word you were going to say was    but        said johnny .  men were hurrying up the steps .      oh  yes .  but       wobbler leaned forward and began speaking quickly .     if you go back  i   ve written a letter to   well  you   ll know what to do with it .  i know i really shouldn   t do it  but who could pass up an opportunity like this .      he stood up  or at least attempted to .  hickson rushed up as wobbler caught the edge of his chair  but was waved away .      i never had any children     said wobbler .     never got married .  don   t know why  really .  it just didn   t seem right .      he leaned heavily on his stick and turned back to them .      i want to be young again     he said .     somewhere .         we were going to go back     said johnny .     honestly .         good .  but  you see   it   s not just a case of going back .  it   s going back and doing the right things .      and then he was gone  walking heavily toward the men with the suits  who closed in behind him .   bigmac was staring so much that a long rivulet of mustard  tomato sauce  special chili relish  and vivid green chutney had dripped out of his burger and down his sleeve without him noticing .      wow     said yo less under his breath .     will we be like that one day .         what .  old .  probably     said johnny .      i just can   t get my head around old wobbler being old     said bigmac  sucking at his sleeve .      we   ve got to go and get him     said johnny .     we can   t let him get           rich .     said yo less .     i don   t think we can do anything about the    old    bit .         if we bring him back  then he   the old one   won   t exist here     said kirsty .      no  he   ll exist in this here  but not in the other here .  i don   t think he   ll be existing anywhere for very long anyway     said johnny .     come on .         what   s in the envelope .     said kirsty as they left .   johnny was surprised .  usually she   d say something like    let   s see what   s in this  then     while snatching it out of his hand .      it   s for wobbler     said johnny .      he   s written a letter to himself .  what   s he say .         how do i know .  i don   t open other people   s letters .      johnny shoved the envelope into his inside pocket .      the keep fit club should have finished by now     he said .     come on .         wait     said kirsty .     if we   re going back to       let   s go prepared this time  shall we .         yeah     said bigmac .     armed .         no .  properly dressed  i mean .             every little girl           it was an hour later .  they met behind the church  in the damp little yard where they   d left the cart .      all right     said kristy .     where did you get that outfit  johnny .         granddad   s got loads of stuff in the attic .  these are his old soccer shorts .  and he always wears old pullovers  so i thought that was probably okay too .  and i   ve got my project stuff in this box in case it helps .  it   s genuine     s .  it   s what they carried gas masks in .         oh  is that what they are .     said bigmac .     i thought people had rather big walkmans .         at least take the cap off   you look like an idiot     said kirsty .     what   s this  yo less .         me and bigmac went along to that theater shop in wallace street     said yo less .     what do you think .     he added uncertainly .   he shuffled around nervously .  he was wearing a broad brimmed hat  shoes with soles like two bumper cars parked side by side  and tight trousers .  at least  what could be seen of the trousers looked tight .      is that an overcoat .     said johnny critically .      it   s called a drape jacket     said yo less .      bright red     said kristy .     yes  i can see no one will notice you at all .  and those trousers   you must have had to grease your feet to get them on .         it looks a bit   stylish     said johnny .     you know   jazzy .         the man in the shop said it   s about right for the period     said yo less defensively .      you look like you   re about to play the saxophone     said johnny .     i mean   well  i   ve never seen you looking so   you know   cool .         that   s why it   s a disguise     said yo less .   kristy turned to bigmac and sighed .      bigmac  why is it i get this feeling you   ve missed the point .         i told him     said yo less .     but he wouldn   t listen .         the man said they wore this in          said bigmac defensively .      yes  but don   t you think that people might notice it   s a german uniform .      bigmac looked panicky .      is it .  i thought yo less was trying to scare me .  i thought they had all swastikas and stuff .         that   s the gestapo .  you   re dressed up like an ordinary german soldier .         i can   t help it   it   s the only one they had left .  it was this or chain mail .         at least leave the jacket and helmet off  all right .  then it   ll probably look like any other uniform .         why   re you wearing that fur coat  kirsty .     said johnny .     you always say that wearing the skins of dead animals is murder .         yeah  but she only says it to old ladies in fur coats     muttered bigmac under his breath .     bet she never says it to hell   s angels in leather jackets .         i took some care     said kirsty  ignoring him .  she adjusted her hat and shoulder bag .     this is pretty accurate .         what  even the shoulders .         yes .  shoulders were being worn wide .         do you have to go through doors sideways .     said yo less .      let   s get on with it  shall we .         what   s worrying me is when old wobb   i mean  old old wobbler   said we   ve got to do the right things to bring him back     said yo less .     what things .         we   ll have to find out     said johnny .     he didn   t say it was easy .         come on     said bigmac  opening the door .     i miss old wobbler .         why .     said kirsty .         cos i don   t throw straight .      the keep fit people had long ago staggered home .  johnny shoved the cart into the middle of the floor and stared at the sacks .  guilty was still asleep on a couple of them .      er       said yo less .     this isn   t magic  is it .         i don   t think so     said johnny .     it   s probably just very  very  very strange science .         oh  good     said yo less .     er   what   s the difference .         who cares .     said kirsty .     get on with it .      guilty started to purr .   johnny picked up a bag .  it seemed to wriggle in his grasp .  with great care  he loosened the string .   and concentrated .   it was easier this time .  before  he   d just been dragged along like a cork in a current .  this time he knew where he was going .  he could feel the time .   minds moved in time all the time .  all the sacks did was let your body come too  just like mrs .  tachyon had said .   years spiraled into the bag like water down a plug hole .  time sucked out of the room .   and then there were the pews  and the scent of highly polished holiness .   and wobbler  turning around with his mouth open .      what    .         it   s all right  it   s us     said johnny .      are you all right .     said yo less .   wobbler might not have been the winner of the all europe uptake speed trials  but an expression of deep suspicion spread across his face as he looked at them .      what   s up .     he said .     you   re all looking at me as if i   d gone weird .  and what   re you all dressed up for .  why   s bigmac wearing a german uniform .         see .     said yo less triumphantly .     i said so  and does anyone listen .         we   ve just come back to fetch you     said johnny .     there   s no problem .         that   s right .  no problem at all     said yo less .     everything   s fine .         yeah  fine .  everything   s fine     said bigmac .     er   you   re not feeling   old  are you .         what .  after five minutes .     said wobbler .      i   ve brung you something     said bigmac .  he took a square  flat shape from his pocket .  it was rather battered  but it was nevertheless the only styrofoam box currently existing on the planet .   it was a bigwob   one with everything .      did you swipe that .     said yo less .      well  the old bloke said he wasn   t going to eat it     said bigmac .     so it   d only get chucked away  all right .  it   s not stealing if it   d only get chucked away .  anyway  it is his  isn   t it  because           you   re not going to eat that  are you .     said kirsty quickly .     it   s cold and greasy and it   s been in bigmac   s pocket  for heaven   s sake .      wobbler lifted out the bun .      i could eat it even if a giraffe   d licked it     he said  and bit into the cold bread .     hey  this isn   t bad .  whose is it .     he looked at the face printed on the box .     who   s the old fart with the beard .         just some old fart     said johnny .      yeah  we don   t know anything about him at all     said bigmac .   wobbler gave them a suspicious look .      what   s going on here .     he said .      look  i can   t explain now     said johnny .     you   re   stuck here .  er .  apparently  er  something   s gone wrong .  er .  there   s been a snag .         what kind of snag .         er .  quite a big one .      wobbler stopped eating .  it was that serious .      how big .     he said .      er .  you   re not going to be born   er .      wobbler stared at him .  then he stared at the half eaten burger .      am i eating this burger .  are these my teeth marks .     he demanded .      look  it   s perfectly simple     said kirsty .     you   re alive here  yes  but when we first came back  something must have happened that changed history .  everything anyone does changes history .  so there   s two histories .  you were born in one  but things have been changed and when we got back it was into a different history  where you weren   t .  all we have to do is put things back the way they should be  and then everything will be all right .         hah .  you haven   t got a shelf of star trek videos as well  have you .     said wobbler .   kirsty looked as though someone had hit her .      well  er  i don   t  er  what .     she said .     er   one or two   a few   not many   so what  anyway .  i hardly ever look at them .         hey     said yo less  brightening up     have you got that one where a mysterious force           just shut up .  just shut up right now .  just because the program happens to be an accurate reflection of late twentieth century social concerns  actually  it doesn   t mean you can go around scaring people just because they   ve been taking an academic interest .         have you got a star trek uniform .     said yo less .   kirsty started to go red .      if any of you tell anybody else  there   ll be big trouble     said kirsty .     i mean it .      johnny opened the door of the church .  outside  wednesday afternoon was turning into wednesday evening .  it was raining gently .  he took a deep breath of      air .  it smelled of coal and pickles and jam  with a hint of hot rubber .  people were making things .  all those chimneys     no one made anything in blackbury in      .  there was a factory that put together computers  and some big warehouses  and the department of road signs regional headquarters .  people just moved things around  or added up numbers .      so i watch some science fiction films     said a plaintive voice behind him .     at least i do it in a spirit of intelligent deconstruction .  i don   t just sit there saying    cor  lasers  brilliant .            no one said you did     said yo less  managing to sound infuriatingly reasonable .      you   re not going to let me forget this  are you .     said kirsty .      won   t mention it ever again     said yo less .      if we do  may we be pulled apart by wild vegans     said bigmac  smirking .      no  vegans are the people who don   t eat animal products     said yo less .     you mean vulcans .  vulcans are the ones with green blood           will you lot shut up .  here   s me not even being born and you   re goin    on about daft aliens .     said wobbler .      what did we do here that changed the future .     asked johnny  turning around .      practically everything  i suppose     said kirsty .     and bigmac left all his stuff at the police station .         they shot at me           let   s face it     said yo less     anything we do changes the future .  maybe we bumped into someone so he was five seconds late crossing the road and got hit by a car or something .  like treading on a dinosaur .  any little thing changes the whole of history .         that   s daft     said bigmac .     i mean  rivers still flow the same way no matter how the little fish swim .         er       said wobbler .     there was this   kid        he said it in the slow  plonking tones of someone who is afraid that he might have come up with an important piece of evidence .      what kid .     said johnny .      just some kid     said wobbler .     he was running away from home or something .  to home  i mean .  all long shorts and boogers up the nose .         what do you mean  running to home .         oh  he was goin    on about being evacuated here and being fed up and running off back to london .  but he followed me back into town throwing stones at me    cos he said i was a spy .  he   s probably still outside     s   matter of fact .  he ran off down that road there .         paradise street .     said johnny .      what about it .     asked wobbler  looking worried .      it   s going to be bombed tonight     said kirsty .     johnny   s got a thing about it .         hah  can   t see any germans wanting to bomb him   he was practically on their side     said wobbler .      are you sure it was paradise street .     said johnny .     are you sure .  did you have any relatives there .  grandparents .  great grandparents .         how should i know .  that was ages ago .      johnny took a deep breath .     it   s right now .         i   i   i don   t know .  one of my granddads lives in spain and the other one died before i was born .         how .     said kirsty .      fell off a motorbike  i think .  in      .     wobbler brightened up .     see .  so that   s all right .         oh  wobbler  wobbler  it   s not all right .     said johnny .     get it into your head .  where did he live .      wobbler was trembling  as he always did when life was getting too exciting .      i dunno .  london  i think .  my dad said he came up here in the war .  and then later on he came back on a visit and met my grandma .  er .  er .         go on .  go on .     said johnny .      er .  er .     wobbler stuttered .      how old was he when he died .     said yo less .      er .  forty  my dad said .  er .  he   d bought the bike for his birthday .         so he   s      johnny subtracted in his head      ten now .         er .  er .         you don   t think he was that boy  do you .     said yo less .      oh  yes     said wobbler  finally giving up panic for anger .     i should have asked him  should i .     hello  are you going to be my granddad .  ps  don   t buy a motorbike    .      johnny fished in his gas mask box and pulled out a crumpled folder stuffed with bits of paper .      did he mention any names .     he said  flicking through the pages .      er .  er .  someone called mrs .  density .     said wobbler  desperation throwing up a memory .      number eleven     said johnny  pulling out a photocopy of a newspaper clipping .     lived there with her daughter gladys .  i got all the names for my project .         my gran   s name was gladys .     said wobbler .     you mean  because he didn   t run off back to london  he   s going to die tonight and i   m not going to be born .         could be     said yo less .      what   ll happen to me .         you   ll just have to stay here     said johnny .      no way .  this is the olden days .  it   s awful .  i went past a cinema and it   s all old movies .  in black and white .  and there was this cafe and you know what they   d got chalked on a board in front .     meat and two veg    .  what kind of food is that .  even hong kong henry   s takeout tells you what kind of meat .  everyone dresses like someone out of eastern europe .  i   d go round the bend here .         my granddad always goes on about how they used to have so much fun when he was a kid even though they didn   t have anything     said bigmac .      yes  but everyone   s granddad says that     said kirsty .     it   s compulsory .  it   s like where they say     fifty pence for a chocolate bar .  when i was young  you could get one and still have change out of sixpence .            i think they had fun     said johnny     because they didn   t know they didn   t have anything .         well  i know     said wobbler .     i know about food that   s more than two colors  and stereo systems  and decent music and   and all kinds of stuff .  i want to go home .      they all looked at johnny .      you got us into this     said yo less .      me .         it   s your imagination     said kirsty .     it   s too big for your head  just like sir j       she stopped .     just like i   ve always said     she corrected herself     and it drags everyone else along with it .  i don   t know how  but it does .  you got all worked up about paradise street  and now here we are .         you said it didn   t make any difference if the street got bombed or not     said johnny .     you said it was just history .         i don   t want to be history .     moaned wobbler .      all right  you win     said kirsty .     what do you want us to do .      johnny shuffled the papers .      well   what i found out for my project was that   there was a big storm  you see .  the weather got very bad .  and the bombers must   ve seen blackbury and dropped their bombs anyway and turned around .  that used to happen .  there was   there is an air raid siren .  it was supposed to go off if bombers were near     he said .     only it didn   t .         why not .      the folder shut with a snap .      let   s start by finding out     said johnny .       it was on a pole on a roof in the high street .  it didn   t look very big .      that   s all it is .     said yo less .     looks like a giant yo yo .         that   s an air raid siren all right     said kirsty .     i saw a picture in a book .         how   d they work .  set off by radar or something .         i   m sure that   s not been invented yet     said johnny .      well  how then .         maybe there   s a switch somewhere .         it   d be somewhere safe  then     said yo less .     somewhere where people wouldn   t be able to set it off for a laugh .      their joint gaze traveled down the pole  across the roof  down the wall  past the blue lamp  and stopped when it met the words     police station .         oh  dear     said yo less .   they sat down on a bench by a civic flower bed  opposite the door .  a policeman came out and stood in the damp air  watching them back .      it   s a good job we left bigmac to guard the cart     said yo less .      yes     said johnny .     he   s always been allergic to policemen .      kirsty sighed .     honestly  you boys haven   t got a clue .      she stood up  crossed the road  and began to talk to the policeman .  they could hear the conversation .  it went like this      excuse me  officer        he gave her a friendly smile .      yes  little lady .  out in your mum   s clothes  are you .      kirsty   s eyes narrowed .      oh  dear     said johnny under his breath .      what   s the matter .     said yo less .      well  you know you and    sambo    .  that   s kirsty and words like    little lady .            i was just wondering     said the little lady  through clenched teeth     how that big siren works .         oh  i shouldn   t worry your head about that  love     said the policeman .     it   s very complicated .  you wouldn   t understand .         look for something to hide behind     said johnny .     like another planet .      then his mouth dropped open as kirsty won a medal .      it   s just that i get so worried     she said  and managed a simper  or what she probably thought was a simper .     i   m sure mr .  hitler   s bombers are going to come one night and the siren won   t go off .  i can   t get to sleep for worrying .      the policeman laid a hand on the shoulder of the girl who had left blackbury karate club because no boy would dare come within two yards of her .      oh  we can   t have that  love     he said .  he pointed .     see up there on blackdown .  well  mr .  hodder and his very brave men are up there every night  keeping a lookout .  if any planes come near here tonight  he   ll ring the station in a couple of shakes  don   t you worry .         but supposing the phone doesn   t work .         oh  then he   ll be down here on his bike in no time .         bike .  a bike .  that   s all .         it   s a motorbike     said the policeman  giving her the nervous looks everyone eventually gave kirsty .   she just stared at him .      it   s a blackbury phantom     he added still further  in a tone of voice that suggested this should impress even a girl .      oh .  really .  oh  that   s a relief     said kirsty .     i feel a lot better for knowing that .  really .         that   s right .  there   s nothing for you to worry about  love     said the policeman happily .      i   ll just go off and play with my dolls  i expect     said kirsty .      that   s a good idea .  have a tea party     said the policeman  who apparently didn   t know withering scorn when he heard it .   kirsty crossed the road and sat down on the seat .     yes  i expect i should have a party with all my dollies     she said  glaring at the flowers .   yo less looked at johnny over her head .      what .     he said .      did you hear what that ridiculous policeman said .     said kirsty .     honestly  it   s obvious that the stupid man thinks that just because i   m female  i   ve got the brains of a baby .  i mean  good grief .  imagine living in a time when people could even think like that without being prosecuted .         imagine living in a time when a bomb could come through your ceiling     said johnny .      mind you  my father said he lived in the shadow of the atomic bomb all through the sixties     said kirsty .     i think that was why he wore flares .  hah .  dollies .  pink dresses and pink ribbons .     don   t worry your head about that  girlie .     this is the dark ages .      yo less patted her on the arm .      he didn   t mean it   you know  nastily     he said .     it   s just how he was brought up .  you people can   t expect us to rewrite history  you know        kirsty frowned at him .      is that sarcasm .     she said .      who .  me .     said yo less innocently .      all right  all right  you   ve made your point .  what   s so special about a blackbury phantom  anyway .         they used to make them here     said johnny .     they were quite famous  i think .  granddad used to have one .      they raised their eyes to the dark shape of blackdown .  it had loomed over the town even back in       but then it had a tv mast .      that   s it .     said kirsty .     men just sitting on hills and listening .         well  blackbury wasn   t very important     said johnny .     we made jam and pickles and rubber boots and that was about it .         i wonder what   s going to go wrong tonight     said yo less .      we could climb up there and find out     said johnny .     let   s go and get the others           hang on     said kirsty .     think  will you .  how do you know we might not cause what   s going to go wrong tonight .      johnny hesitated .  for a moment he looked like a statue .  then he said     no .  if we start thinking like that  we   ll never do anything .         we   ve already messed up the future once .  everything we do affects the future .         it always has .  it always will .  so what .  let   s get the others .          running into time     there was no question of using the roads  not with the police still looking for bigmac  who with a wardrobe of costumes to chose from had chosen to go back in time wearing a german soldier   s uniform .   they   d have to use the fields and footpaths .  which meant        we   ll have to leave the cart     said yo less .     we can shove it in the bushes here .         that means we   ll be stuck here if anything goes wrong .     said bigmac .      well  i   m not lugging it through mud and stuff .         what if someone finds it .         there   s guilty     said kirsty .     he   s better than a guard dog .      the cat that was better than a guard dog opened one eye and yawned .  it was true .  no one would want to be bitten by that mouth .  it would be like being savaged by a plague laboratory .   then he curled into a more comfortable ball .      yes  but it belongs to mrs .  tachyon     said johnny weakly .      hey  we   re not thinking sensibly   again     said kirsty .     all we have to do is go back to       go up to blackdown on the bus  then come back in time again and we   ll be up there           no .     shouted wobbler .   his face was bright red with terror .      i   m not staying here by myself again .  i   m stuck here  remember .  supposing you don   t come back .         of course we   ll come back     said johnny .     we came back this time  didn   t we .         yes  but supposing you don   t .  supposing you get run over by a truck or something .  what   ll happen to me .      johnny thought about the long envelope in his inside pocket .  yo less and bigmac were looking at their feet .  even kirsty was looking away .      here     said wobbler suspiciously .     this is time travel  right .  do you know something horrible .         we don   t know anything     said bigmac .      absolutely right     said kirsty .      what  us .  we don   t know a thing     said johnny miserably .      especially about burgers     said bigmac .   kirsty groaned .     bigmac .      wobbler glared at them .      oh  yes     he muttered .     it   s    scare ole wobbler    time again  right .  well  i   m going to stay with the cart  right .  it   s not going anywhere without me  right .      he stared from one to the other  daring them to disagree .      all right  i   ll stay with you     said bigmac .     i   ll probably only get shot anyway  if i go anywhere .         what   re you going to do up on blackdown  anyway .     said wobbler .     find this mr .  hodder and tell him to listen really carefully .  wash out his ears .  eat plenty of carrots .         they   re for good eyesight     said yo less helpfully .     my granny said they used to believe carrots helped you see in           who cares .         i don   t know what we can do     said johnny .     but   something must have gone wrong  right .  maybe the message didn   t get through .  we   ll have to make sure it does .         look     said kirsty .   the sun had already set  leaving an afterglow in the sky .  and there were clouds over blackdown .  dark clouds .      thunderstorm     she said .     they always start up there .      there was a growl in the distance .       blackbury was a lot smaller once they were in the hills .  a lot of it wasn   t there at all .      wouldn   t it be great if we could tell everyone what they   re going to do wrong     said johnny  when they paused for breath .      no one   d listen     said yo less .     supposing someone turned up in      and said they were from      and started telling everyone what to do .  they   d get arrested  wouldn   t they .      johnny looked ahead of them .  the sunset sky lurked behind bars of angry cloud .      the listeners   ll be up at the tumps     said kirsty .     there   s an old windmill up there .  it was some kind of lookout post during the war .  is  i mean .         why didn   t you say so before .     said johnny .      it   s different when it   s now .      the tumps were five mounds on top of the down .  they grew heather and wortleberries .  it was said that dead kings were buried there in the days when your enemy was at arm   s length rather than ten thousand feet above your head .   the clouds were getting lower .  it was going to be one of those blackbury storms  a sort of angry fog that hugged the hills .      you know what i   m thinking .     said kirsty .      telephone lines     said johnny .     they go out in thunderstorms .         right .         but the policeman said there was a motorbike     said yo less .      starts first time  does it .     said johnny .     i remember my granddad said that before you were qualified to ride a blackbury phantom  you had to learn to push it fifty yards  cursing all the way .  he said they were great bikes when they got started .         how long is it till   you know   the bombs .         about an hour .      which means they   re already on the way  johnny thought .  men have walked out onto airfields and loaded bombs onto planes with names like dorniers and heinkels .  and other men have sat around in front of a big map of england  only it   d be in german  and there   d be crayon marks around slate .  blackbury probably wasn   t even on the map .  and then they   d get up and walk out and get into the planes and take off .  and men on the planes would get out their maps and draw lines on them  lines that crossed at slate .  your mission for tonight  bomb the freight yard at slate .   and then the roar filled his ears .  the drone of the engines came up through his legs .  he could taste the oil and the sweat and the stale rubber smell of the oxygen mask .  his body shook with the throb of the engines and also with the thump of distant explosions .  one was very close and the whole aircraft seemed to slide sideways .  and he knew what the mission for tonight was .  your mission for tonight is to get home safely .  it always was .   another explosion shook the plane  and someone grabbed him .      what .         it   s weird when you do that .     shouted kirsty above the thunder .     come on .  it   s dangerous out here .  haven   t you got enough sense to get out of the rain .         it   s starting to happen     johnny whispered  while the storm broke around him .      what is .         the future .      he blinked as the rain started to plaster his hair against his head .  he could feel time stretching out around him .  he could feel its slow movement as it carried forward all those gray bombs and those white doorsteps  pulling them together like bubbles being swirled around a whirlpool .  they were all carried along by it .  you couldn   t break out of it because you were part of it .  you couldn   t steer a train .      we   d better get him under cover .     shouted yo less as lightning hit something a little way off .     he doesn   t look well at all .      they staggered on  occasionally lurking under a wind bent tree to get their breath back .   there was a windmill among the tumps .  it had been built on one of the mounds  although the sails had long gone .  yo less and kirsty put their arms around johnny and ran through the soaking heather until they reached it and climbed the steps .   yo less hammered on the door .  it opened a fraction .      good lord .     said a voice .  it sounded like the voice of a young man .     what   re you .  a circus .         you   ve got to let us in .     said kirsty .     he   s ill .         can   t do that     said the voice .     not allowed  see .         do we look like spies .     shouted yo less .      please .     said kirsty .   the door started to close  and then stopped .      well   all right     said the voice  as unseen hands pulled the door open .     but mr .  hodder says to stand where we can see you  okay .  come on in .         it   s happening     said johnny  who still had his eyes closed .     the telephone won   t work .         what   s he going on about .         can you try the telephone .     said kirsty .      why .  what   s wrong with it .     said the boy .     we tested it out at the beginning of the shift just now .  has anyone been mucking about with it .      there was an older man sitting at a table .  he gave them a suspicious look  which lingered for a while on yo less .      i reckon you   d better try the station     he said .     i don   t like the sound of all this .  seems altogether a bit suspicious to me .      the first man reached out toward the phone .   there was a sound outside as lightning struck somewhere close .  it wasn   t a zzzippp   it was almost a gentle silken hiss  as the sky was cut in half .   then the phone exploded .  bits of bakelite and copper clattered off the walls .   kirsty   s hand flew to her head .      my hair stood on end .         so did mine     said yo less .     and that doesn   t often happen  believe me     he added .      lightning hit the wire     said johnny .     i knew that .  not just here .  other stations on the hills  too .  and now he   ll have trouble with the motorbike .         what   s he going on about .         you   ve got a motorbike  haven   t you .     said kirsty .      so what .         good grief  man  you   ve lost your telephone .  aren   t you supposed to do something about that .      the men looked at each other .  girls weren   t supposed to shout like kirsty .      tom  nip down to dr .  atkinson   s and use his phone and tell the station ours has exploded     said mr .  hodder  not taking his eyes off the three .     tell them about these kids  too .         it won   t start     said johnny .     it   s the carburetor  i think .  that   always gives trouble .      the one called tom looked at him sideways .  there was a change in the air .  up until now the men had just been suspicious .  now they were uneasy  too .      how did you know that .     he said .   johnny opened his mouth .  and shut it again .   he couldn   t tell them about the feel of the time around him .  he felt that if he could only focus his eyes properly  he could even see it .  the past and future were there  just around some kind of corner  bound up to the ever traveling now by a billion connections .  he felt that he could almost reach out and point  not there or over there or up there but there  at right angles to everywhere else .      they   re on their way     he said .     they   ll be here in half an hour .         what will .  what   s he going on about .         blackbury   s going to be bombed tonight     said kirsty .  thunder rolled again .      we think     said yo less .      five planes     said johnny .   he opened his eyes .  everything overlapped like a scene in a kaleidoscope .  everyone was staring at him  but they were surrounded by something like fog .  when they moved  images followed them like some kind of special effect .      it   s the storm and the clouds     he managed to say .     they think they   re going to slate but they   ll drop their bombs over blackbury .         oh  yes .  and how d   you know this  then .  they told you  did they .         listen  you stupid man     said kirsty .     we   re not spies .  why would we tell you if we were .      mr .  hodder pulled open the door .      i   m going down to use the doctor   s phone     he said .     then maybe we can sort out what   s going on .         what about the bombers .     said kirsty .   the older man looked out .  the thunder had rolled away to the northeast  and there was no sound but the hiss of the rain .      what bombers .     he said  and shut the door behind him .   johnny sat down with his head in his hands  blinking his eyes again to shut out the flickering images .      you lot   d better get out     said tom .     it   s against the rules  having people in here    .      johnny blinked .  there were more bombers in front of his eyes  and they didn   t go away .   he scrabbled at the playing cards on the table .      what   re these for .     he said urgently .     playing cards with bombers on them .         eh .  what .  oh   that   s for learning aircraft recognition     said tom  who   d been careful to keep the table between him and johnny .     you plays cards with    em and you sort of picks up the shapes  like .         you learn subliminally .     said kirsty .      oh  no  you learn from playing with these here cards     said tom desperately .  outside  there was the sound of someone trying to start a motorbike .   johnny stood up .      all right     he said .     i can prove it .  the next card   the next card you show me   the next card        images filled his eyes .  if this is how mrs .  tachyon sees the world  he thought  no wonder she never seems all there   because she   s everywhere .   outside  there was the sound of someone trying even harder to start a motorbike .      the next card   will be the five of diamonds .         i don   t see why i should have to play games       the man glanced nervously at kirsty  who had that effect on people .      scared .     she said .   he grabbed a card at random and held it up .      it   s the five of diamonds all right     said yo less .   johnny nodded .     the next one   the next one   the next one will be the knave of hearts .      it was .   outside  there was the sound of someone trying very hard to start a motorbike and swearing .      it   s a trick     said the man .     one of you messed around with the pack .         shuffle them all you like     said johnny .     and the next one you show me will be   the ten of clubs .         how did you do that .     said yo less  as the boy turned the card over and stared at it .      er       it had felt like memory  he told himself .     i remembered seeing it     said johnny .      you remembered seeing it before you actually saw it .     said kirsty .   outside  there was the sound of someone trying very hard to start a motorbike and swearing even harder .      er   yes .         oh  wow     she said .     precognition .  you   re probably a natural medium .         er  i   m a size eleven     said johnny  but they weren   t listening .   kirsty had turned to tom .      you see .     she said .     now do you believe us .         i don   t like this .  this isn   t right     he said .     anyway   anyway  there   s no phone        the door burst open .      all right .     roared mr .  hodder .     what did you kids do to my bike .         it   s the carburetor     said johnny .     i told you .         here  arthur  you ought to listen to this  this boy knows things        kirsty glanced at her watch .      twenty minutes     she said .     it   s more than two miles down to the town .  even if we ran i   m not sure we could do it .         what   re you talking about now .     said mr .  hodder .      there must be some kind of code     said kirsty .     if you have to ring up and tell them to sound the siren  what do you say .         don   t tell them .     snapped mr .  hodder .         this is station bd         said johnny  his eyes looking unfocused .      how did you know that .  did he tell you .  did you tell them .         no  arthur .         come on     said kirsty  hurrying toward the door .     i got a county medal in athletics .      she elbowed the older man aside .   the thunder was growling away in the east .  the storm had settled down to a steady  gray rain .      we   ll never make it     said yo less .      i thought you people were good at running     said kirsty  stepping out .      people of my height  you mean .         you were right     said the young man  as johnny was dragged out into the night .     this is station bd  .         i know     said johnny .     i remembered you just telling me .      he staggered and grabbed at yo less to stay upright .  the world was spinning around him .  he hadn   t felt like this since that business with the cider at christmas .  the voices around him seemed to be muffled  and he couldn   t be sure whether they were really there  or voices he was remembering  or words that hadn   t even been spoken yet .   he felt that his mind was being shaken loose in time  and it was only still here because his body was a huge great anchor .      it   s downhill all the way     said kirsty  and sped off .  yo less followed her .   far away  down in the town  a church clock began to strike eleven .   johnny tried to lumber into a run  but the ground kept shifting under his feet .   why are we doing this .  he thought .  we know it happened  i   ve got a copy of the paper in my pocket  the bombs will land and the siren won   t go off .   you can   t steer a train .   that   s what you think  said a voice in his head    .   he wished he   d been better at this .  he wished he   d been a hero .   from up ahead  he heard yo less   s desperate cry .      i   ve tripped over a sheep .  i   ve tripped over a sheep .      the lights of blackbury spread out below them .  there weren   t many of them   the occasional smudge from a car  the tiny gleam from a window where the moths had got at the blackout curtain .   a wind had followed the storm .  streamers of cloud blew across the sky .  here and there a star shone through .   they ran on .  yo less ran into another sheep in the blackness .   there was the crunch of heavy boots on the road behind them and tom caught up to them .      if you   re wrong  there   s going to be big trouble .     he panted .      what if we   re right .     said kirsty .      i hope you   re wrong .      thunder rumbled again  but the four runners plunged on in a bubble of desperate silence .   they were leaving the moor behind .  there were hedges on either side of the road now .   tom   s boots skidded to a halt .      listen .      they stopped .  there was the grumbling of the thunder and the hiss of the rain .   and  behind the noises of the weather  a faint and distant droning .   gravel flew up as the young man started to run again .  he   d been moving fast before  but now he flew down the road .   a large house loomed up against the night .  he leaped over the fence  pounded across the lawn  and started to hammer on the front door .      open up .  open up .  it   s an emergency .      johnny and the others reached the gate .  the droning was louder now .   we could have done something  johnny thought .  i could have done something .  i could   ve   well  there must have been something .  we thought it would be so easy .  just because we   re from the future .  what do we know about anything .  and now the bombers are nearly here and there   s nothing we can do .      come on .  open up .      yo less found a gate and hurried through it .  there was a splash in the darkness .      i think i   ve stepped into some sort of pond     said a damp voice .   tom stepped away from the house and groped on the ground for something .      maybe i can smash a window     he mumbled .      er   it   s quite deep     said yo less damply .     and i   m caught up on some kind of fountain thing    .      glass tinkled .  tom reached through the window beside the door .  there was a click  and the door opened .   they heard him trip over something inside  and then a weak light went on .  another click and        this phone   s dead too .  the lightning must   ve got the exchange .         where   s the next house .     asked kirsty  as tom hurtled down the path .      not till roberts road .      they ran after him  yo less squelching slightly .   the drone was much louder now .  johnny could hear it above the sound of his own breath .   someone must notice it in the town  he thought .  it fills the whole sky .   without saying anything  they all began to run faster     and  at last  the siren began to wail .   but the clouds were parting and the moon shone through and there were shadows nosing through the rags of cloud and johnny could feel the unseen shapes turning over and over as they drifted toward the ground .   first there was the allotment  and then the pickle factory  and then paradise street exploded gently  like a row of roses opening .  the petals were orange tinged with black and unfolded one after another  as the bombs fell along the street .   then the sounds arrived .  they weren   t bangs but crunches  punches  great wads of noise hammered into the head .   finally they died away  leaving only a distant crackling and the rising sound of a fire bell .      oh  no .     said kirsty .   tom had stopped .  he stood and stared at the distant flames .      the phone wasn   t working     he whispered .     i tried to get here but the phone wasn   t working .         we   re time travelers .     said yo less .     this isn   t supposed to happen .      johnny swayed slightly .  the feeling was like flu  but much worse .  he felt as if he were outside his own body  watching himself .   it was the hereness of here  the nowness of now    .  people survived by not paying any attention to feelings like this .  if you stopped  and opened your head to them  the world would roll over you like a tank    .   paradise street was always going to be bombed .  it was being bombed .  it would have been bombed .  tonight was a fossil in time .  it was a thing .  somewhere  it would always have happened .  you couldn   t steer a train .   that   s what you think    .   somewhere     flames flickered over the housetops .  more bells were ringing .      the bike wouldn   t start .     mumbled tom .     the phone wouldn   t work .  there was a storm .  i tried to get down here in time .  how could it have been my fault .      somewhere     johnny felt it again   the sense that he could reach out and go in directions not found on any map or compass but only on a clock .  it poured up from inside him until he felt that it was leaking out of his fingers .  he hadn   t got the cart or the bags but   maybe he could remember how it felt    .      we   ve got time     he said .      are you mad .     said kirsty .      are you going to come or not .     said johnny .      where .      johnny took her hand  and reached out for yo less with his other hand .   then he nodded toward tom  who was still staring at the flames .      grab him  too     he said .     we   ll need him when we get there .         where .      johnny tried to grin .      trust me     he said .     someone has to .      he started to walk .  tom was dragged along with them like a sleepwalker .      faster     said johnny .     or we   ll never get there .         look  the bombs have fallen     said kirsty wearily .     it   s happened .         right .  it had to     said johnny .     otherwise we couldn   t get there before it did .  faster .  run .      he pushed forward  dragging them after him .      i suppose we might be able to   help     panted yo less .     i know   first aid .         first aid .     said kirsty .     you saw the explosions .      beside her  the young man suddenly seemed to wake up .  he stared at the fire in the town and lurched forward .  and then they were all running  all trying to keep up  all causing the others to go faster .   and there was the road  in that direction .   johnny took it .   the dark landscape lit up in shades of gray  like a very old film .  the sky went from black to an inky purple .  and everything around them looked cold  like crystal  all the leaves and bushes glittering as if they were covered in frost .   he couldn   t feel cold .  he couldn   t feel anything .   johnny ran .  the road under his feet was sticky  as though he was trying to sprint in molasses .   and the air filled with the noise he   d last heard from the bags  a great whispering rush of sound  like a million radio stations slightly out of tune .   beside him yo less tried to say something  but no words came out .  he pointed with his free hand  instead .   blackbury lay ahead of them .  it wasn   t the town he knew in       and it wasn   t the one from      either .  it glowed .   johnny had never seen the northern lights .  he   d read about them  though .  the book said that on very cold nights sometimes the lights would come marching down from the north pole  hanging in the sky like curtains of frozen blue fire .   that was how the town looked .  it gleamed  as cold as starlight on a winter night .   he risked a glance behind .   there  the sky was red  a deep crimson that brightened to a ruby glow at its center .   and he knew that if he stopped running  it would all end .  the road would be a road again  the sky would be the sky   but if he just kept going in this direction     he forced his legs to move onward  pedaling in slow motion through the thick  cold  silent air .  the town got closer  brighter .   now the others were pulling on his arms .  kirsty was trying to shout too  but there was no sound here except the roar of all the tiny noises .   he snatched at their fingers  trying to hold on    .   and then the blue rushed toward him and met the red coming the other way and he was toppling forward onto the road .   he heard kirsty say     i   m covered in ice .      johnny pushed himself to his feet and stared at his own arms .  ice crackled and fell off his sleeves as he moved .   yo less looked white .  frost steamed off his face .      what did we do .  what did we do .     said kirsty .      listen  will you .     said yo less .     listen .      there was a whirring somewhere in the darkness  and a clock began to strike .   johnny listened .  they were on the edge of town .  there was no traffic in the dark streets .  but there were no fires  either .  there was the muffled sound of laughter from a nearby pub  and the chink of glasses .   the clock went on striking .  the last note died away .  a cat yowled .      eleven o   clock .     said kirsty .     but we heard eleven o   clock when we   were   on the downs    .      she turned and stared at johnny .      you took us back in time .         not   back  i think     said johnny .     i think   behind .  outside .  around .  across .  i don   t know .      tom had managed to get to his knees .  what they could see of his face in the dusky light said that here was a man to whom too much had happened  and whose brain was floating loose .      we   ve got seven minutes     said johnny .      huh .     said tom .      to get them to sound the siren .     shouted kirsty .      huh .  the bombs   i saw the fires   it wasn   t my fault  the phone           they didn   t .  but they will .  unless you do something .  right now .  on your feet right now .     shouted kirsty .   no one could resist a voice like that .  it went right through the brain and gave its commands directly to the muscles .  tom rose like an elevator .      good .  now come on .      the police station was at the end of the street .  they reached the door in a group and fought one another to get through it .   there was an office inside  with a counter running across it to separate the public from the forces of law and order .  a policeman was standing behind it .  he had been writing in a large book  but now he was looking up with his mouth open .      hello  tom     he said .     what   s going on .         you   ve got to sound the siren .     said johnny .      right now .     said kirsty .   the sergeant looked from one to the other and then at yo less  where his gaze lingered for a while .  then he turned and glanced at a man in military uniform who was sitting writing at a desk in the office .  the sergeant was the sort of man who liked an audience if he thought he was going to be funny .      oh  yes .     he said .     and why should i do that  then .         they   re right  sergeant     said tom .     you   ve got to do it .  we   ran all the way .         what  off the down .     said the sergeant .     that   s two miles  that is .  sounds a bit fishy to me  young man .  been round the back of the pub again  have you .  hah   remember that dornier     bomber you heard last week .     he turned and smirked at the officer again .     a truck on the slate road  that was .      kirsty   s patience  which in any case was only visible with special scientific equipment  came to an end .      don   t you patronize us  you ridiculous buffoon .     she screamed .   the sergeant went red and took a deep breath .  then it was let out suddenly .      hey  where do you think you   re going .      tom had scrambled over the desk .  the soldier stood up but was pushed out of the way .   the young man reached the switch and pulled it down .       you want fries with that .      wobbler and bigmac skulked behind the church .      they   ve been gone a long time     said bigmac .      it   s a long way up there     said wobbler .      i bet something   s happened .  they   ve been shot or something .         huh  i thought you liked guns     said wobbler .      i don   t mind guns .  i don   t like bullets     said bigmac .     and i don   t want to get stuck here with you .         we   ve got the time cart     said wobbler .     but do you know how to work it .  i reckon you   ve got to be half mental like johnny to work it .  i don   t want to end up fighting romans or something .         you won   t     said bigmac .   he froze as he realized what he   d said .  wobbler homed in .      what do you mean  stuck here with you .  what does happen if i don   t go home .     he said .     you lot went back to      .  i wasn   t there  right .         oh  you don   t want to know any stuff like that     said bigmac .      oh  yeah .             you come in here and act cheeky       the sergeant began .      be quiet .     snapped captain harris  standing up .     why doesn   t your siren work .         we tests it every tuesday and friday  reg   lar       said the sergeant .      there   s a hole in the ceiling     said yo less .   tom stood looking at the switch .  he was certain he   d done his bit .  he wasn   t sure how  but he   d done it .  and things that should be happening next weren   t happening .      it wasn   t my fault     he mumbled .      your man fired a gun     said the sergeant .     we never did know where the bullet went .         we know now     said the captain grimly .     it   s hit a wire somewhere .         there   s got to be some other way     said johnny .     it mustn   t end like this .  not after everything .  look .      he pulled a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and held it up .      what   s that .     said the captain .      it   s tomorrow   s newspaper     said johnny .     if the siren doesn   t go off .      the captain stared at it .      oh  trying to pull our leg  eh .     said the police sergeant nervously .   the captain turned his eyes from the paper to johnny   s wrist .  he grabbed it .      where did you get this watch .     he snapped .     i   ve seen one like it before .  where do you come from  boy .         here     said johnny .     sort of .  but not   now .      there was a moment   s silence .  then the captain nodded at the sergeant .      ring up the local newspaper  will you .     he said .     it   s a morning paper  isn   t it .  someone should still be there .         you   re not seriously           please do it .      seconds ticked by as the policeman huddled over the big black phone .  he muttered a few words .      i   ve got mr .  stickers  the chief compositor     he said .     he says they   re just clearing the front page and what do we want .      the captain glanced at the paper  and sniffed at it .      fish .  never mind   is there an advertisement for johnson   s cocoa in the bottom left hand corner of the page .  don   t stare .  ask him .      there was some mumbling .      he says yes  but        the captain turned the page over .      on page two  is there a single column story headed    fined    d for bike offense    .  on the crossword  is one down    bird of stone  we hear    with three letters .  next to an advertisement for plant   s brushless shaving creams .  ask him .      the sergeant glared at him but spoke to the distant stickers .      roc     said kirsty  in an absentminded way .   the captain raised an eyebrow .      it   s a mythical bird  i think     said yo less in the same hypnotized voice .     spelled like    rock    but without a k .     we hear    means it sounds the same .         he says yes     said the sergeant .     he says           thank you .  tell him to be ready in case   no  let   s not be hasty   just thank him .      there was a click when the sergeant put the phone down .   then the captain said     do you know how long we   ve got .         three minutes     said johnny .      can we get on the roof  sergeant .     said the captain .      dunno  but           is there some other siren in the town .         there   s a dirty old wind up thing we used to use  but           where is it .         it   s under the bench in the lost property cupboard  but        there was a leathery noise and suddenly the captain was holding a pistol .      you can argue with me afterward     he said .     you can report me to whomever you like .  but right now you can give me the keys or unlock the blasted cupboard  or i   ll shoot the lock off .  and i   ve always wanted to try that  believe me .         you don   t believe these kids  do           sergeant .      in a sudden panic  the sergeant fumbled in his pockets and trotted across the room .      you do believe us .     said kirsty .      i   m not sure     said the captain  as the sergeant dragged out something big and heavy .     thank you  sergeant .  let   s get it outside .  no .  i   m not sure at all  young lady .  but i might believe that watch .  besides   if i   m wrong  then all that will happen is that i   ll look foolish  and i daresay the sergeant will give you all a thick ear .  if i   m right  then   this won   t happen .     he waved the paper .      i   think so     said johnny .     i don   t even know if any of this will happen            bigmac was on the floor with wobbler on top of him .  wobbler might not know how to fight  but he did know how to weigh .      get off .     said bigmac  flailing around .  trying vicious street fight punches on wobbler was like hitting a pillow .      i   m still alive in       aren   t i .     said wobbler .        cos i   ve been born  right .  so even if i never time travel back  i ought to still be alive in       right .  i bet you know something about me .         no  no  we never met you .         i   m alive  then .  you do know something  right .         get off  i can   t breathe .         come on  tell me .         you   re not supposed to know what   s going to happen .         who says .  who says .      there was a yowl behind him .  wobbler turned his head .  bigmac looked up .   guilty the cat stretched lazily  yawned  and hopped down off the bags .  he padded confidently alongside the mossy wall  moving in his lurching diagonal fashion  and disappeared around the building .      where   s it going .     said wobbler .      how should i know .  get off   f me .      the boys followed the cat  who didn   t seem at all bothered by their presence .   he stopped at the church door and lay down with his front paws outstretched .      first time i   ve seen him go away from the cart     said bigmac .   and then they heard it .   nothing .   the faint noises of the town didn   t stop .  there was the sound of a piano from a pub somewhere .  a door opened  and there was laughter .  a car went by slowly  in the distance .  but suddenly the sounds were coming from a long way off  as if there was some sort of thick invisible wall .      you know those bombs       said wobbler  not taking his eyes off the cat .      what bombs .     said bigmac .      the bombs johnny   s been going on about .         yeah .     said bigmac .      can you remember what time he said .  it was pretty soon  i think .         brilliant .  i   ve never seen anywhere bombed     said bigmac .   guilty started to purr  very loudly .      er   you know my sister lives in canada     said wobbler  in a worried voice .      what about her .  what   s she got to do with anything .         well   she sent me a postcard once .  there   s this cliff there  right  where the indians used to drive herds of buffalo over to kill them    .         isn   t geography wonderful .         yeah  only   there was this indian  right  and he wondered what the drive would look like from underneath   and that   s why it   s called head bashed in jump .  really .      they both turned and looked at the chapel .      this is still here in          said bigmac .     i mean  it   s not going to get bombed    .         yeah  but don   t you think it   d be better to be sort of behind it        the wail of a siren rose and fell .   there were faint noises in paradise street .  someone must have moved a blackout curtain  because light showed for a moment .  someone else shouted  in a back garden somewhere .      great .     said bigmac .     all we need is popcorn .         but it   s going to happen to real people .     said wobbler  aware that real people could include him .      no     cos the siren   s gone off .  they   ll all be down their bomb shelters .  that   s the whole point .  anyway  it   d happen anyway  right .  it   s history  okay .  it   d be like going back to      and watching the battle of   whatever it was .  it   s not often you get to see an entire pickled onion factory blow up  either .      people were certainly moving .  wobbler could hear them in the night .  a sound from this end of the street was exactly like someone walking into a tin bath in the darkness .   and then        listen     said bigmac uncertainly .   guilty sat up and looked alert .   there was a faint droning noise in the east .      brilliant     said bigmac .   wobbler edged toward the side of the church .      this isn   t television     he mumbled .   the droning got closer .      wish i   d brought my camera     said bigmac .   a door opened .  an avenue of yellow light spilled out into the night and a small figure dashed along it and came to a halt in the middle of the street .   it shouted     our ron   ll get you .      the drone filled the sky .   bigmac and wobbler started running together .  they cleared the churchyard steps in one jump and pounded toward the boy  who was dancing around waving a fist at the sky .   the aircraft were right overhead .   bigmac got to him first and lifted him off his feet .  then he skidded on the cobbles as he turned and headed back toward the church .   they were halfway there when they heard the whistling .   they were at the top of the steps when the first bomb hit the allotments .   they were jumping behind the wall when the second and third bombs hit the pickle factory .   they were landing on the grass as the bombs marched up the street and filled the air with a noise so loud it couldn   t be heard and a light so white it came right through the eyelids  and then the roar picked up the ground and shook it like a blanket .   that was the worst part  wobbler said later .  and it was hard to find the worst part because all the others were so bad .  but the ground should be the ground  there  solid  dependably under you .  it shouldn   t drop away and then come back up and hit you so hard .   then there was a sound like a swarm of angry bees .   and then there was just the clink of collapsing brickwork and the crackle of fires .   wobbler raised his head very slowly .      ugh     he said .   there were no leaves on the trees behind them .  and the trunks sparkled .   he got up very slowly and reached out .   it was glass .  bits of glass studded the whole trunk of the tree .  there were no leaves anymore .  just glass .   beside him  bigmac got to his feet like someone in a dream .   a frying pan had hit the church door so hard that it had been driven in halfway  like a very domesticated martial arts weapon .  a stone doorstep had smashed a chunk out of the brickwork .   and everywhere there was glass  crunching underfoot like permanent hail .  it glittered on the walls  reflecting the fires in the ruins .  there seemed far too much to be from just a few house windows .   and then it began to rain .   first it rained vinegar .   and then it rained pickles .   there was red liquid all over bigmac .  he licked a finger and then held it up .      tomato sauce .      a gherkin bounced off wobbler   s head .   bigmac started to laugh .  people can start laughing for all sorts of reasons .  but sometimes they laugh because  against all expectations  they   re still alive and have a mouth left to laugh with .      you       he tried to say     you   you   you want fries with that .      it was the funniest thing wobbler had ever heard .  right now it was the funniest thing anyone had ever said anywhere .  he laughed until the tears ran down his face and mingled with the mustard pickle .   from somewhere in the shadows by the wall a small voice said        ere  did anyone get any shrapnel .      bigmac started to laugh on top of the laugh he was already laughing  which caused a sound like a boiler trying not to burst .      what  what  what   s shrapnel anyway .     he managed to say .      it   s   it   s   it   s bits of bomb .         you want fries with that .     said bigmac  and almost collapsed with laughing .   the siren sang out again .  but this time it wasn   t the rising and falling wail but one long tone  which eventually died away .      they   re coming back .     said wobbler .  the laughter drained out of him as though a trapdoor had been opened .      nah  that   s the all clear     said the voice by the wall .     don   t you know nuffin    .      wobbler   s grandfather stood up and looked down the length of what had once been paradise street .      cor .     he said  obviously impressed .   there wasn   t a whole house left standing .  roofs had gone  windows had blown out .  half of the buildings had simply vanished into rubble  which spilled across the street .   bells rang in the distance .  two fire engines skidded to a halt right outside the church .  an ambulance pulled up behind them .      you want       bigmac began .      shut up  will you .     said wobbler .   there were fires everywhere .  big fires  little fires .  the pickle factory was well alight and smelled like the biggest fish and chip shop in the world .   people were running from every direction .  some of them were pulling at the rubble .  there was a lot of shouting .      i suppose everyone   would   ve got out  right .     said wobbler .     they would have got out  wouldn   t they .          the siren   s wail slowed to a growl and then a clicking noise  and then stopped .   johnny felt as though his feet weren   t exactly on the ground .  if he were any lighter  he   d float away .      they must have got out .  they had nearly a whole minute     he said .   the sergeant had already headed toward paradise street .  the three of them had been left with tom and the captain  who was watching johnny thoughtfully .   things pattered onto the roof of the police station and bounced down into the street .  yo less picked one up .      pickled onions .     he said .   they could see the flames over the rooftops .      so       said the captain .     you were right .  a bit of an adventure  yes .  and this is where i say     well done  chums     isn   t it .         he walked to the yard door and shut it .  then he turned .      i can   t let you go     he said .     you must know that .  you were with that other boy  weren   t you .  the one with the strange devices .      there seemed no point in denying it .      yes     said johnny .      i think you might know a lot of things .  things that we need .  and we certainly need them .  perhaps you know that .     he sighed .     i don   t like this .  you may have saved some lives tonight .  but it   s possible that you could save a lot more .  do you understand .         we won   t tell you anything     said kirsty .      just name  rank  and serial number  eh .     said the captain .      supposing we   did know things     said johnny .     it wouldn   t do you any good .  and those things won   t help  either .  they won   t make the war better  they   ll just make it different .  everything happens somewhere .         right now  i think we   d settle for different .  we   ve got some very clever men     said the captain .      please  captain .     it was tom .      yes .         they didn   t have to do all this  sir .  i mean  they came and told us about the bombing  didn   t they .  and   i don   t know how they got me down here  sir  but they did .     s not right to put them in prison  sir .         oh  not prison     said the captain .     a country house somewhere .  three square meals a day .  and lots of people who   ll want to talk to them .      kirsty burst into tears .      now  no one   s going to hurt you  little girl     said the captain .  he moved over and put his arm around her shaking shoulders .   johnny and yo less looked at each other and took a few steps backward .      it   s all right     said the captain .     we just need to know some things  that   s all .  things that may be going to happen .         well  one thing       sobbed kirsty     one thing   one thing that   s going to happen is   one thing is           yes .     said the captain .   kirsty reached out and took his hand .  then her leg shot out and she pivoted  hauling on the man   s arm .  he somersaulted over her shoulder and landed on his back on the cobbles .  even as he tried to struggle upright  she was spinning around again  and caught him full in the chest with a foot .  he slumped backward .   kirsty straightened her hat and nodded at the others .      chauvinist .  honestly  it   s like being back with the dinosaurs .  shall we go .     she said .   tom backed away .      where do girls learn to do that .     he said .      at school     said johnny .     you   d be amazed .      kirsty reached down and took the captain   s pistol .      oh  no     said yo less .     not guns .  you can get into real trouble with guns .         i happen to be the under eighteen county champion     said kirsty  unloading the gun .     but i   m not intending to use it .  i just don   t want him to get excited .     she threw the pistol behind some trash cans .     now  are we going  or what .      johnny looked around at tom .      sorry about this     he said .     can you  er  explain things to him when he wakes up .         i wouldn   t know how to start .  i don   t know what happened myself .         good     said kirsty firmly .      i mean  did i run down here or not .     said tom .     i thought i saw the bombing but   i must   ve imagined it  because it didn   t happen until after we got here .         it was probably the excitement     said yo less .      the mind plays strange tricks     said kirsty .   they both glared at johnny .      don   t look at me     he said .     i don   t know anything about anything .          up another leg     what bigmac said afterward was that he   d never intended to help .  it had been like watching a film until he   d seen people scrabbling at the wreckage .  then he   d stepped through the screen .   firemen were pouring water on the flames .  people were pulling at fallen timbers  or moving gingerly through each stricken house  calling out names   in a strange  polite way  in the circumstances .      yoo hoo  mr .  johnson .         excuse me  mrs .  density  are you there .         mrs .  williams .  anyone .      and wobbler said afterward that he could remember three things .  one was the strange metallic clinking sound bricks make as piles of them slide around .  one was the smell of wet burned wood .  and one was the bed .  the blast had taken off the roof and half the walls of a house but there was a double bed hanging out over the road .  it even still had the sheets on it .  it creaked up and down in the wind .   the two boys scrambled over the sliding rubble until they reached a back garden .  glass and bricks covered everything .   an elderly man wearing a nightshirt tucked into his trousers was standing and staring at the wreckage on his garden .      well  that   s my potatoes gone     he said .     it was late frost last year  and now this .         still     said bigmac in a mad cheerful voice     you   ve got a nice crop of pickled cucumbers .         can   t abide    em .  pickles give me gas .      fences had been laid flat .  sheds had been lifted up and dealt like cards across the gardens .   and  as though the all clear had been the last trumpet  people were rising out of the ground .          i just hope the others are still there     said kirsty as they ran through the streets .      what do you think .     said yo less .      sorry .         i mean  maybe they   re sitting quietly waiting for us or they   ve got into some kind of trouble .  bets .      kirsty slowed down .      hang on a minute     she said .     there   s something i   ve got to know .  johnny .         yes .     he said .  he   d been dreading this moment .  kirsty asked such penetrating questions .      what did we do .  back there .  i saw the bombs drop .  and i   m a very good observer .  but we got down to the police station before it happened .  so either i   m mad   and i   m not mad   or we           ran through time     said yo less .      look  it was just a direction     said johnny .     i just saw the way to go    .      kirsty rolled her eyes .     can you do it again .         i   don   t think so .  i can   t remember how i did it .         he was probably in a state of heightened awareness     said yo less .     i   ve read about them .         what   drugs .     said kirsty suspiciously .      me .  i don   t even like coffee .     said johnny .  the world had always seemed so strange in any case that he   d never dared try anything that   d make it even weirder .      but it   s an amazing talent .  think of the things you        johnny shook his head .  he could remember seeing the way  and he could remember the feelings  but he couldn   t remember the how .  it was as if he were looking at his memories behind thick amber glass .      come on     he said  and started running again .      but       kirsty began .      i can   t do it again     said johnny .     it   ll never be the right time again .          bigmac and wobbler weren   t in trouble  if only because there had been so much trouble just recently that there was  for a while  no more to get into .      this is an air raid shelter .     said bigmac .     i thought they were all   you know  steel and stuff .  big doors that go hiss .  lights flashing on and off .  you know .     he heaved on one end of a shed that had smashed into the air raid shelter belonging to no .    .     not just some corrugated iron and dirt with lettuces growing on top .      wobbler had rescued a shovel from the ruin of someone   s greenhouse  and used it to heave bricks out of the way .  the shelter door opened and a middle aged woman staggered out .   she was wearing a floral apron over a nightdress  and holding a goldfish bowl with two fish in it .  a small girl was clinging to her skirts .      where   s michael .     the woman shouted .     where is he .  has anyone seen him .  i turned my back for two seconds to grab adolf and stalin  and he was out the door like a           kid in a green sweater .     said wobbler .     got glasses .  ears like the world cup .  he   s looking for shrapnel .         he   s safe .     she sagged with relief .     i don   t know what i   d have told his mother .         you all right .     said bigmac .     i   m afraid your house is a bit   flatter than it was    .      mrs .  density looked at what was left of no .    .      oh  well .  worse things happen at sea     she said vaguely .      do they .     said bigmac  mystified .      it   s just a blessing we weren   t in it     said mrs .  density .   there was a clink of brickwork and a fireman slid down the debris toward them .      all right  mrs .  density .     he said .     i reckon you   re the last one .  fancy a nice cup of tea .         oh  hello  bill     she said .      who   re these lads  then .     said the fireman .      we   were just helping out     said wobbler     were you .  oh .  right .  well  come away out of it  the pair of you .  we reckon there   s an unexploded one at number twelve .     the fireman stared at bigmac   s clothes for a moment and then shrugged .  he gently took the goldfish bowl from mrs .  density and put his other arm around her shoulders .      a nice cup of tea and a blanket     he said .     just the thing  eh .  come along  luv .      the boys watched them slide and scramble through the fallen bricks .      you get bombed and they give you a cup of tea .     said bigmac .      i s   pose it   s better than getting bombed and never ever getting one again     said wobbler .     anyway  there           eeeeyyyyooooowwwwmmmm .     screamed a voice behind them .   they turned .  wobbler   s grandfather was standing on a pile of bricks and looked like a small devil in the light of the fires .  he was covered in soot  and was waving something through the air and making airplane noises .      that looks like       bigmac began .      it   s a bit off   f a bomb .     said the boy .     nearly the whole tail fin .  i don   t know anyone who   s got nearly a whole tail fin .      he zoomed the twisted metal through the air again .      er   kid .     said wobbler .   the boy lowered the fin .      you know about   motorbikes .     said wobbler .      oh  no     said bigmac .     you can   t tell him anything about           you just shut up .     said wobbler .     you   ve got a granddad .         yes  but there has to be a warder there when i go an    see him .      wobbler looked back at the boy .      dangerous things  motorbikes     he said .      i   m going to have a big one when i grow up     said his grandfather .     with rockets on it  an    machine guns and everythin    .  eeeyyyooowwmmmm .         oh  i wouldn   t do that if i were you     said wobbler  in the special dumb voice for talking to children .     you don   t want to go crashing it  do you .         oh  i won   t crash     said his grandfather confidently .      mrs .  density   s daughter   s a nice little girl  isn   t she     said wobbler desperately .      she   s all smelly and horrible .  eeeeeyyoowwmmm .  anyway  you   re fat  mister .      he ran down the far side of the heap .  they saw his shadow darting between the firemen  and heard the occasional    voommmm .         come on     said bigmac .     let   s get back to the church .  the man said they thought there was an unexploded bomb           he just didn   t want to listen .     said wobbler .     i would   ve listened .         yeah  sure     said bigmac .      well  i would .         sure .  come on .         i could   ve helped him if only he   d listened .  i know stuff .  why won   t he listen .  i could make life a lot easier for him .         all right  i believe you .  now let   s go  shall we .          they reached the church just as johnny and the others came running up the street .      everyone all right .     said kirsty .     why are you covered in soot  you two .         we   ve been rescuing people     said wobbler proudly .     well  sort of .      they looked at the wreck of paradise street .  people were standing around in small groups and sitting on the ruins .  some ladies in official looking hats had set up a table with a tea urn on it .  there were still a few small fires  however  and the occasional crash and tinkle as a high altitude cocktail onion fell back to earth in a coating of ice .   johnny stared .      everyone got out  johnny     said wobbler  watching him carefully .      i know .         the siren was just in time .         i know .      behind him  johnny heard kirsty say     i hope they get counseling .         we found out about that     said bigmac   s voice .     they get a nice cup of tea and told to cheer up because it could be worse .         that   s all .         well   there   s cookies  too .      johnny watched the street .  the firelight almost made it look cheerful .   and his mind   s eye saw the other street .  it was here  too  happening at the same time .  there were the same fires and the same piles of rubble and the same fire engines .  but there were no people   except the ones carrying stretchers .   we   re in a new time  he thought .   everything you do changes everything .  and every time you move in time  you arrive in a time a little bit different to the one you left .  what you do doesn   t change the future  just a future .   there   s millions of places when the bombs killed everyone in paradise street .   but it didn   t happen here .   the ghostly images faded away as the other time veered off into its own future .      johnny .     said yo less .     we   d better get out of here .         yeah  no point in staying     said bigmac .   johnny turned .      okay     he said .      are we going by cart or are we going to   walk .     said kirsty .   johnny shook his head .      cart     he said .   it was waiting where they   d left it .  but there was no sign of guilty .      oh  no .     said kirsty .     we   re not going to look for a cat .         he went to watch the bombing     said wobbler .     don   t know what happened to him after that .      johnny gripped the handle of the cart .  the bags creaked in the darkness .      don   t worry about the cat     he said .     cats find their own way home .          the golden threads club occupied the old church on friday mornings .  sometimes there was a folksinger  or entertainment from local schools  if this couldn   t be avoided .  mainly there was tea and a chat .   this was usually about how things were worse now than they had ever been  especially those golden days when you could buy practically anything for sixpence and still have change .   there was a change in the air and five figures appeared .   the golden threaders watched them suspiciously  in case they broke into    the streets of london .     they also noted that they were under thirty years old  and therefore almost certainly criminals .  for one thing  they   d apparently stolen a shopping cart .  and one of them was black .      er       said johnny .      is this the theater group .     said kirsty .  the others were astonished at her quick thinking .     oh  no  wrong church hall  very sorry .      they edged toward the door  pushing the cart .  the threaders watched them owlishly  teacups cooling in their hands .   wobbler opened the door and ushered the others through it .      don   t forget  one of them was black     said yo less as he stepped out .  he rolled his eyes sarcastically and waved his hands in the air .     we   s goin    to de carnivaaal .          some other now        the air outside smelled of      .  kirsty looked at her watch .      ten thirty on saturday morning     she said .     not bad .         er  your watch is at ten thirty on saturday morning     said johnny .     that doesn   t mean we are .         good point .         but i think we are  anyway .  this all looks right .         looks fine to me     said wobbler .      we   ve been out all night     said yo less .     my mum   ll go berserk .         tell her you stayed at my place and the phone was broken     said wobbler .      i don   t like lying .         are you going to tell her the truth .      yo less thought for a few agonized seconds .     your phone was broken  right .         yeah  and i   ll tell my mum i was staying at your place     said wobbler .      i shouldn   t think my granddad   s noticed i   m not in     said johnny .     he always drops off in front of the telly .         my parents have a very modern outlook     said kirsty .      my brother doesn   t mind where i am so long as the police don   t come around     said bigmac .   before time traveling to any extent  johnny thought  you should always get your alibi sorted out .   he stared at the place where paradise street had been .  it was still the sports center .  that hadn   t changed .  but paradise street was still there  underneath .  not underground .  just   somewhere else .  another fossil .      did we change anything .     said kirsty .      well  i   m back     said wobbler .     and that   s good enough for me .         but those people are alive when they ought to   ve been dead       kirsty began  and stopped when she saw johnny   s expression .     all right  not exactly ought  but you know what i mean .  one of them might   ve invented the z bomb or something .         what   s the z bomb .     said bigmac .      how should i know .  it wasn   t invented when we left .         someone in paradise street invented a bomb .     said johnny .      well  all right  not a bomb .  something else that   d change history .  any little thing .  and you know we left all bigmac   s stuff in the police station .         ahem .      yo less removed his hat and produced a watch and a walkman .      the sergeant was so flustered  he forgot to lock the cupboard after he got the siren out     said yo less .     so i nipped in .         did you get the jacket .         chucked it in a trash can .         that was mine     said bigmac reproachfully .      well  maybe that   s all right     kirsty conceded reluctantly .     but there   s bound to be some other changes .  we   d better find out pretty fast .         we   d better have a bath  too     said wobbler .      your hands have got blood on them     said johnny .   wobbler looked down vaguely .      oh  yeah .  well   we were pulling at smashed up walls and things     he said .     you know   in case there was anyone trapped    .         you should   ve seen him grab his granddad .     said bigmac .     it was brilliant .      wobbler looked proud .       they met up an hour later in the mall .  the burger bar was back to the way it had always been .  no one said anything about it  but from the way he sighed occasionally  it was clear that bigmac was thinking of free burgers every week for the rest of his life .   that jogged johnny   s memory .      oh   yes     said johnny to wobbler .     er .  we   ve got this letter   for you    .      he pulled it out .  it was crumpled  and covered in vinegar and sooty fingerprints .      er  it   s for you     he repeated .     someone   asked us to give it to you .         yeah  someone     said yo less .      we don   t know who he was     said bigmac .     a completely mysterious person .  so it   s no use you asking us questions .      wobbler gave them a suspicious look and ripped open the envelope .      go on  what   s he say .     said bigmac .      who .     said wobbler .      y   this mysterious person     said bigmac .      dumb stuff     said wobbler .     read it yourself .      johnny took the paper that had been in the envelope .  it contained a list  numbered from one to ten .            eat healthy food in moderation        he read .           an hour   s exercise every day is essential .     invest money wisely in a mixture of              what   s the point of all this junk .  it   s the sort of thing granddads say     said wobbler .     why   d anyone want to tell me that .  you   d have to be some kind of loony to go around telling people that .  this was one of those religious blokes that hang around in the mall  right .  huh .  i thought it might be something important .      bigmac glanced at the burger bar again and sighed deeply .      there have been changes     said kirsty .     clark street isn   t clark street anymore .  i noticed when i went past .  it   s evershott street .         that   s frightening     said bigmac .      oooeeeoooee   a street name was mysteriously changed           i thought it was always evershott street     said yo less .      me too     said wobbler .      and that shop over there   that used to sell cards and things .  now it   s a jeweler   s     said kirsty insistently .   the boys craned around to look at it .      it   s always been a jeweler   s  hasn   t it .     said wobbler .  he yawned .      well  you   re an unobservant bunch  i       kirsty began .      hold on     said johnny .     how did you get all those cuts on your hands  wobbler .  you too  bigmac .         well  er  i   er       wobbler   s eyes glazed .      we   were messing around     said bigmac .     weren   t we .         yeah .  messing around .  somewhere .         don   t you remember    .     kirsty began .      forget about it     said johnny .     come on  kirsty  we   ve got to go .         where to .         visiting time .  we   ve got to see mrs .  tachyon .      kirsty waved a hand frantically at the other three .      but they don   t seem to           it doesn   t matter .  come on .             they can   t just forget .     said kirsty as they hurried out of the mall .     they can   t just think     oh  it was all a dream    .         i think it   s all sort of healing over     said johnny .     didn   t you see it happening back in      .  tom didn   t really believe anything that had happened .  i bet by now   i mean  a few hours after   i bet they   re remembering   i mean  they remembered   something different .  he ran all the way and got there just in time .  everyone was a bit shocked because of the bombing .  something like that .  people have to forget what really happened because   well  it didn   t happen .  not here .         we can remember what really happened     said kirsty .      perhaps that   s because you   re hyperintelligent and i   m megastupid     said johnny .      oh  i wouldn   t say that     said kirsty .     you   re being a bit unfair .         oh .  good .         i meant i wouldn   t go so far as to say    hyper .     just    very .     why do we have to see mrs .  tachyon .         someone ought to .  she   s a time bag lady     said johnny .     i think it   s all the same to her .  around the corner or       they   re all just directions to her .  she goes where she likes .         she   s mad .      they   d reached the hospital steps .  johnny trudged up them .   she probably is mad  he thought .  or eccentric  anyway .  i mean  if she went to a specialist and he showed her all those cards and ink blots  she   d just swipe them or something .   yes .  eccentric .  but she wouldn   t do things like dropping bombs on paradise street .  you have to be sane to think of things like that .  she   s totally round the bend .  but perhaps she gets a better view from there .   it was quite a cheerful thought  in the circumstances .       mrs .  tachyon had gone .  the ward nurse seemed quite angry about it .      do you know anything about this .     she demanded .      us .     said kirsty .     we   ve just come in .  know about what .      mrs .  tachyon had gone to the lavatory .  she   d locked herself in .  and in the end they   d had to get someone to take the lock off  in case she   d fallen down in there .   she wasn   t in there at all .   they were three floors up and the window was too small even for someone as skinny as mrs .  tachyon to climb through .      was there any toilet paper .     said johnny .   the nurse gave him a look of deep suspicion .      the whole roll   s gone     she said .   johnny nodded .  that sounded like mrs .  tachyon .      and the headphones have vanished     said the nurse .     do you know about any of this .  you   ve been visiting her .         that   s only been because it   s  you know  like a project     said kirsty defensively .   there was the sound of sensible shoes behind them .  they turned out to belong to ms .  partridge  the social worker .      i   ve phoned the police     she said .      why .     said johnny .      well  she   oh  it   s you .  well  she   needs help .  not that they were any help .  they said she always turns up .      johnny sighed .  mrs .  tachyon  he suspected  never needed help .  if she wanted help  she just took it .  if she needed a hospital  she went where there was one .  she could be anywhere now .      must have slipped out when no one was looking     said ms .  partridge .      she couldn   t     said the nurse stoutly .     we can see the door from here .  we   re very careful about that sort of thing .         then she must have vanished into thin air .     said ms .  partridge .   kirsty sidled closer to johnny while they argued  and said  out of the corner of her mouth     where did you leave the cart .         behind our garage     said johnny .      d   you think she   s taken it .         yes     said johnny happily .       johnny was quiet on the bus home .  they   d gone to the library and he   d wangled a photocopy of the local paper for the day after the raid .   there was a picture of people looking very cheerful in the ruins of paradise street .  of course  things were pretty faded now  but there was mrs .  density with her goldfish bowl  and wobbler   s grandfather with his bit of bomb  and just behind them  grinning and holding his thumb up  you could just make out wobbler .  it hadn   t been a good photo to start with and it hadn   t improved with age and he had soot all over his face  but if you knew it was wobbler  you could see it was him all right .   they   re all forgetting except me  he thought .  i bet even if i showed them the paper  they   d say     oh yes  that bloke looks like wobbler  so what .      because   they live here .  they   ve always lived here .  in a way .   when you travel in time  it really happens  but it   s like a little loop in a tape .  you go around the loop and then carry on from where you were before .  and everything that   s changed turns out to be history .      you   ve gone very quiet     said kirsty .      i was just thinking     said johnny .     i was thinking that if i showed the others this piece from the paper  they   d say  oh  yeah  that looks like ole wobbler  so what .      kirsty leaned across .      oh  yes     she said .     well .  it does look like wobbler .  so what .      johnny stared out the window .      i mean     he said     it   s wobbler in the paper .  remember .         remember what .         well   yesterday .      she wrinkled her forehead .      didn   t we go to some sort of party .      johnny   s heart sank .   it all settles down  he thought .  that   s what   s so horrible about time travel .  you come back to a different place .  you come back to the place where you didn   t go in the first place  and it   s not your place .   because here was where no one died in paradise street .  so here   s where i didn   t want to go back .  so i didn   t .  so they didn   t  either .  when the newspaper picture was taken  we were back there  but now that we   re back here  we never went .  so they don   t remember because here there   s nothing to remember .  here  we did something else .  hung on .  hung around .   here i   m remembering things that never happened .      it   s your stop     said kirsty .     are you all right .         no     said johnny  and got off the bus .   it was raining heavily  but he went and checked to see if the cart was where he   d left it .  it wasn   t .  on the other hand  maybe it had never been there at all .   when he went up to his bedroom  he could hear the rain drumming on the roof .  he   d vaguely hoped that he might have been a different person in this world  but there it all was  the same bedroom  the same mess  the same space shuttle on its bit of red yarn .  the same stuff for the project all over the table .   he sat on his bed and watched the rain for a while .  he could feel the shadows in the air  hovering around the corners of the room .   he   d lost mrs .  tachyon   s paper somewhere .  that would have been proof .  but no one else would believe it .   he could remember it all   the rain on the moor  the thunderstorm  the sting on his whole body when they   d run through time   and it hadn   t happened .  not exactly .  normal  dull  boring  everyday life had just poured right in again .   johnny went through his pockets .  if only there were something    .   his fingers touched a piece of cardboard    .   the sound of australian accents from downstairs suggested that his granddad was in .  he trailed downstairs and into the little front room .      granddad .         yes .     said his grandfather  who was watching cobbers .      you know the war           yes .         you know you said that before you went in the army  you were a sort of aircraft spotter           got a medal for it     said his grandfather .  he picked up the remote control and switched off the set  which never usually happened .     showed it to you  didn   t i .  must   ve done .         don   t think so     said johnny  as diplomatically as possible .  before  his grandfather had always told him not to go on about things .   his grandfather reached down beside his chair .  there was an old wickerwork sewing box there  which had belonged to johnny   s grandmother .  it hadn   t been used for thread and needles for a long time  though .  it was full of old newspaper cuttings  keys that didn   t fit any door in the house  stamps for one halfpenny in old money  and all the other stuff that accumulates in odd corners of a house that has been lived in for a long time .  finally  after much grunting  he produced a small wooden box and opened it .      they said they never knew how i done it     he said proudly .     but mr .  hodder and captain harris spoke up for me .  oh  yes .  had to be possible  they said  otherwise i couldn   t   ve done it  could i .  the phones   d got hit by lightning and the bike wouldn   t start no matter what he yelled  so i had to run all the way down into the town .  so they had to give it to me    cos they spoke up .      johnny turned the silver medal over in his hands .  there was a yellowing bit of paper with it  badly typed by someone who hadn   t changed the ribbon on his typewriter for years .         gallant action          he read           ensuring the safety of the people of blackbury    .            some men from the olympics came to see me after the war     said his grandfather .     but i told them i didn   t want any .         how did you do it .     said johnny .      they said someone   s watch must   ve been wrong     said granddad .     i don   t know about that .  i just ran for it .     s all a bit of a blur now  tell you the truth    .      johnny put the medal back in the box .  beside it  held together with an elastic band  was a grubby pack of cards .   he took them out and removed the band .   they had aircraft on them .   johnny reached into his pocket and took out the five of clubs .  it was a lot less worn  but there was no doubt that it was part of the pack .  he slipped it under the band and put the pack back in the box .   granddad and johnny sat and looked at one another for a moment .  there was no sound but the rain and the ticking of the mantelpiece clock .   johnny felt the time drip around them  thick as amber    .   then granddad blinked  picked up the remote control  and aimed it at the tv .      anyway  we   ve all passed a lot of water under the bridge since those days     he said  and that was that .   the doorbell rang .   johnny trooped out into the hall .   the bell rang again  urgently .   johnny opened the door .      oh     he said gloomily .     hello  kirsty .      rain had plastered her hair to her head .      i ran back from the next stop     she said .      oh .  why .      she held up a pickled onion .      i found it in my pocket .  and   i remembered .  we did go back .         not back     said johnny .     it   s more like there .     the elation rose up inside him like a big pink cloud .     come on in .         everything .  even the pickles .         good .         i thought i ought to tell you .         right .         do you think mrs .  tachyon will ever find her cat .      johnny nodded .      wherever he is     he said .       the sergeant and the soldier picked themselves up off the ground and staggered toward the wreckage where the house had been .      that poor old biddy .  that poor old biddy .     said the sergeant .      d   you think she might   ve got out in time .     said the soldier .      that poor old biddy .         she was sort of close to the wall     moaned the soldier hopefully .      the house isn   t there anymore .  what do you think .      they scrambled through the damp ruins of paradise street .      oh god  there   s going to be hell to pay for this    .         you   re telling me .  you shouldn   t   ve left it unguarded .  that poor old biddy .         d   you know how much sleep we   ve had this past week .  do you .  and we lost corporal williams over in slate .  we knocked off for five minutes in the middle of the night  that   s all .      a crater lay in front of them .  something bubbled in the bottom .      she got any relatives .     said the soldier .      no .  no one .  been here ages .  my dad says he remembers seeing her about sometimes when he was a lad     said the sergeant .   he removed his helmet .      poor old biddy     he said .      that   s what you think .  dinner dinner dinner dinner        they turned .  a skinny figure  wearing an old coat over a nightdress  and a woolly hat  ran along the road  expertly steering a wire cart between the mounds of rubble .         dinner dinner        the sergeant stared at the soldier .     how did she do that .         search me .            dinner dinner batman .      some way away  guilty ambled in his sideways fashion through the back streets .   he   d had an interesting morning hunting through the remains of paradise street  and had passed some quality time during the afternoon in the ruins of the pickle factory  where there were mice  some of them fried .  it had been a good day .   around him  blackbury went back to sleep .   there was still a terrible smell of vinegar everywhere .   by some miracle of preservation  a large jar of pickled beets had been blown all the way across the town and landed  unbroken and unnoticed  in a civic flower bed  from whence it had bounced into the gutter .   guilty waited by it  washing himself .   after a while he looked up as a familiar squeaking sound came around the corner and stopped .  a hand wearing a woolly glove with the fingers cut out reached down and picked up the jar .  there was a series of complicated unscrewing noises  and then a sound like   well  like someone eating pickled beets until the juice ran down their chin .      ah     said a voice  which then belched .     that   s the stuff to give the troops .  bromide .  that   s what you think .  laugh .  i nearly brought a tractor .      guilty hopped up onto the cart .   mrs .  tachyon reached up and adjusted the headphones under her bobble hat .   she scratched at a surgical dressing .  dratted thing .  she   d have to get someone to take it off her  but she knew a decent nurse over in      .   then she scrabbled in her pockets and fished out the sixpence the sergeant had given her .  she remembered him giving it to her .  mrs .  tachyon remembered everything  and had long ago given up wondering whether the things she remembered had already happened or not .  take life as it was going to come was her motto .  and if it didn   t come  go and fetch it .   the past and the future were all the same  but you could get a good feed off of a sixpence  if you knew the right way to do it .   she squinted at it in the gray light of dawn .   it was a bit old and grubby  but the date was quite clear .  it said       .      tea and buns .  that   s what you think  mr .  copper .      and she went back to      and spent it on fish and chips .  and still had change .       about the author     terry
