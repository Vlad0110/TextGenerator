opera        the village coquettes  about the year       when the earliest of the sketches by boz were appearing in print  a young composer named john hullah set to music a portion of an opera called the gondolier  which he thought might prove successful on the stage .  twelve months later hullah became acquainted with charles dickens  whose name was then unknown to those outside his own immediate circle  and it occurred to him that he and  boz  might combine their forces by converting the gondolier into a popular play .  dickens  who always entertained a passion for the theatre  entered into the project at once  and informed hullah that he had a little unpublished story by him which he thought would dramatise well  even better than the gondolier notion  confessing that he would rather deal with familiar english scenes than with the unfamiliar venetian environment of the play favoured by hullah .  the title of the gondolier was consequently abandoned  and a novel subject found and put forward as the village coquettes  a comic opera of which songs  duets  and concerted pieces were to form constituent parts .  dickens  of course  became responsible for the libretto and hullah for the music  and when completed the little play was offered to  and accepted by  braham  the lessee of the st .  james s theatre  who expressed an earnest desire to be the first to introduce  boz  to the public as a dramatic writer .  a favourite comedian of that day  john pritt harley  after reading the words of the opera prior to its representation  declared it was  a sure card   and felt so confident of its success that he offered to wager ten pounds that it would run fifty nights .   an assurance which at once decided braham to produce it .   the village coquettes  described on the title page of the printed copies as  a comic opera  in two acts   was played for the first time on december          with braham and harley in the cast .  in his preface to the play  published contemporaneously by richard bentley  and dedicated to harley  dickens explained that  the libretto of an opera must be  to a certain extent  a mere vehicle for the music   and that  it is scarcely fair or reasonable to judge it by those strict rules of criticism which would be justly applicable to a five act tragedy or a finished comedy .   there is no doubt that the merits of the play were based upon the songs set to hullah s music rather than upon the play itself  and it is said that harley s reputation as a vocalist was established by his able rendering of them .   the village coquettes enjoyed a run of nineteen nights in london during the season  and was then transferred to edinburgh  where it was performed under the management of mr .  ramsay  a friend of sir walter scott .  sala  as a boy of ten  witnessed its first representation in london  and ever retained a vivid impression of the event  while especial interest appertains to the fact that a copy of the play became the means of first bringing dickens into personal communication with john forster  his life long friend and biographer .  it is more than probable that  boz  felt a little elated by the reception accorded by the public to the  dramatic bantling   but as time progressed he realised that the somewhat unfavourable comments of the critics were not entirely devoid of truth .  indeed  when in      it was proposed to revive the play  he expressed a hope that it might be allowed  to sink into its native obscurity .    i did it   he explained   in a fit of damnable good nature long ago  for hullah  who wrote some very pretty music to it .  i just put down for everybody what everybody at the st .  james s theatre wanted to say and do  and what they could say and do best  and i have been most sincerely repentant ever since .   the novelist confessed that both the operetta and a little farce called the strange gentleman  the latter written as  a practical joke  for the st .  james s theatre about the same time  were done  without the least consideration or regard to reputation   he also declared that he  wouldn t repeat them for a thousand pounds apiece   and devoutly wished these early dramatic efforts to be forgotten .  a propos of this  the late frederick locker lampson has recorded that when he asked dickens  about a year before the great writer s death  whether he possessed a copy of the village coquettes  his reply was   no  and if i knew it was in my house  and if i could not get rid of it in any other way  i would burn the wing of the house where it was .    although  perhaps  not of a high order of merit  the village coquettes is not without bibliographical interest  and may be regarded as a musical and literary curiosity .  copies of the first edition of the little play are now seldom met with  and whenever a perfect impression comes into the market it commands a good price  even as much as l   or l     indeed  a particularly fine copy was sold at sotheby s in      for twenty five pounds .  in      the words of the opera were reprinted in facsimile by richard bentley  for which a frontispiece was etched by f .  w .  pailthorpe a year later .   the village coquettes  round  hail to the merry autumn days  when yellow corn fields shine  far brighter than the costly cup that holds the monarch s wine .  hail to the merry harvest time  the gayest of the year  the time of rich and bounteous crops  rejoicing  and good cheer .    tis pleasant on a fine spring morn to see the buds expand   tis pleasant in the summer time to view the teeming land   tis pleasant on a winter s night to crouch around the blaze    but what are joys like these  my boys  to autumn s merry days .   then hail to merry autumn days  when yellow corn fields shine  far brighter than the costly cup that holds the monarch s wine .  and hail to merry harvest time  the gayest of the year  the time of rich and bounteous crops  rejoicing  and good cheer .   lucy s song  love is not a feeling to pass away  like the balmy breath of a summer day  it is not  it cannot be  laid aside  it is not a thing to forget or hide .  it clings to the heart  ah  woe is me .  as the ivy clings to the old oak tree .   love is not a passion of earthly mould  as a thirst for honour  or fame  or gold  for when all these wishes have died away  the deep strong love of a brighter day  though nourished in secret  consumes the more  as the slow rust eats to the iron s core .   squire norton s song  that very wise head  old aesop  said  the bow should be sometimes loose  keep it tight for ever  the string you sever    let s turn his old moral to use .  the world forget  and let us yet  the glass our spirits buoying  revel to night in those moments bright which make life worth enjoying .  the cares of the day  old moralists say  are quite enough to perplex one  then drive to day s sorrow away till to morrow  and then put it off till the next one .  chorus  the cares of the day  etc .   some plodding old crones  the heartless drones .  appeal to my cool reflection  and ask me whether such nights can ever charm sober recollection .  yes  yes .  i cry  i ll grieve and die  when those i love forsake me  but while friends so dear surround me here  let care  if he can  o ertake me .  chorus  the cares of the day  etc .   george edmunds  song  autumn leaves  autumn leaves  lie strewn around me here  autumn leaves  autumn leaves  how sad  how cold  how drear .  how like the hopes of childhood s day  thick clust ring on the bough .  how like those hopes in their decay   how faded are they now .  autumn leaves  autumn leaves  lie strewn around me here  autumn leaves  autumn leaves  how sad  how cold  how drear .   wither d leaves  wither d leaves  that fly before the gale  withered leaves  withered leaves  ye tell a mournful tale  of love once true  and friends once kind  and happy moments fled  dispersed by every breath of wind  forgotten  changed  or dead .  autumn leaves  autumn leaves  lie strewn around me here .  autumn leaves  autumn leaves  how sad  how cold  how drear .   rose s song  some folks who have grown old and sour  say love does nothing but annoy .  the fact is  they have had their hour  so envy what they can t enjoy .  i like the glance  i like the sigh   that does of ardent passion tell .  if some folks were as young as i  i m sure they d like it quite as well .   old maiden aunts so hate the men  so well know how wives are harried  it makes them sad  not jealous  when they see their poor dear nieces married .  all men are fair and false  they know  and with deep sighs they assail  em  it s so long since they tried men  though  i rather think their mem ries fail  em .   duet  flam and rose   flam .   tis true i m caressed by the witty  the envy of all the fine beaux  the pet of the court and the city  but still  i m the lover of rose .   rose .  country sweethearts  oh  how i despise .  and oh .  how delighted i am to

couple for ever  mr .  flam and his beautiful rose .   squire norton s song  the child and the old man sat alone in the quiet  peaceful shade of the old green boughs  that had richly grown in the deep  thick forest glade .  it was a soft and pleasant sound  that rustling of the oak  and the gentle breeze played lightly round  as thus the fair boy spoke      dear father  what can honour be  of which i hear men rave .  field  cell and cloister  land and sea  the tempest and the grave    it lives in all   tis sought in each   tis never heard or seen  now tell me  father  i beseech  what can this honour mean .     it is a name  a name  my child    it lived in other days  when men were rude  their passions wild  their sport  thick battle frays .  when  in armour bright  the warrior bold knelt to his lady s eyes  beneath the abbey pavement old that warrior s dust now lies .    the iron hearts of that old day have mouldered in the grave  and chivalry has passed away  with knights so true and brave  the honour  which to them was life  throbs in no bosom now  it only gilds the gambler s strife  or decks the worthless vow .    duet  the squire and lucy   squire .  in rich and lofty station

flow rs and all is life around .   in summer day  the fragrant hay most sweetly scents the breeze  and all is still  save murm ring rill  or sound of humming bees .   old autumn comes   with trusty gun in quest of birds we roam  unerring aim  we mark the game  and proudly bear it home .   a winter s night has its delight  well warmed to bed we go  a winter s day  we re blithe and gay  snipe shooting in the snow .   a country life  without the strife and noisy din of town  is all i need  i take no heed of splendour or renown .   and when i die  oh  let me lie where trees above me wave  let wild plants bloom around my tomb  my quiet country grave .   young benson s song  my fair home is no longer mine  from its roof tree i m driven away .  alas .  who will tend the old vine  which i planted in infancy s day .  the garden  the beautiful flowers  the oak with its branches on high  dear friends of my happiest hours  among thee i long hoped to die .  the briar  the moss  and the bramble  along the green paths will run wild  the paths where i once used to ramble  an innocent  light hearted child .   duet  the squire and edmunds   squire .  listen  though i do not fear you  listen to me  ere we part .   edmunds .  list to you .  yes  i will hear you .   squire .  yours alone is lucy s heart  i swear it  by that heav n above me .   edmunds .  what .  can i believe my ears .  could i hope that she still loves me .   squire .  banish all these doubts and fears  if a love were e er worth gaining  if love were ever fond and true  no disguise or passion feigning  such is her young love for you .   squire .  listen  though i do not fear you  listen to me  ere we part .   edmunds .  list to you .  yes  i will hear you  mine alone is her young heart .   lucy s song  how beautiful at eventide to see the twilight shadows pale  steal o er the landscape  far and wide  o er stream and meadow  mound and dale .  how soft is nature s calm repose when ev ning skies their cool dews weep  the gentlest wind more gently blows  as if to soothe her in her sleep .  the gay morn breaks  mists roll away  all nature awakes to glorious day .  in my breast alone dark shadows remain  the peace it has known it can never regain .   chorus  join the dance  with step as light as ev ry heart should be to night  music  shake the lofty dome  in honour of our harvest home .   join the dance  and banish care  all are young  and gay  and fair  even age has youthful grown  in honour of our harvest home .   join the dance  bright faces beam  sweet lips smile  and dark eyes gleam  all these charms have hither come  in honour of our harvest home .   join the dance  with step as light  as ev ry heart should be to night  music shake the lofty dome in honour of our harvest home .   quintet  no light bound of stag or timid hare  o er the ground where startled herds repair  do we prize so high  or hold so dear  as the eyes that light our pleasures here .   no cool breeze that gently plays by night  o er calm seas  whose waters glisten bright  no soft moan that sighs across the lea  harvest home  is half so sweet as thee .              lyric from  the lamplighter   a farce        the lamplighter  in      dickens agreed to prepare a little play for macready  the famous actor  then the manager of drury lane theatre .  it was called the lamplighter  and when completed the author read aloud the  unfortunate little farce   as he subsequently termed it  in the greenroom of the theatre .  although the play went through rehearsal  it was never presented before an audience  for the actors would not agree about it  and  at macready s suggestion  dickens consented to withdraw it  declaring that he had  no other feeling of disappointment connected with this matter  but that which arose from the failure in attempting to serve his friend .  the manuscript of the play  not in dickens s handwriting  reposes in the forster library at the victoria and albert museum  and in      it was printed for the first time  in the form of a pamphlet  of which only two hundred and fifty copies were issued .   when rejected by macready as unsuitable for stage presentation  the lamplighter was adapted by dickens to another purpose  that is to say  he converted it into a tale called the lamplighter s story  for publication in the pic nic papers  issued in      for the benefit of the widow of macrone  dickens s first publisher  who died in great poverty .  between the farce and the story there are but slight differences .  the duet of two verses  sung by tom and betsy to the air of  the young may moon   cannot of course be regarded as a remarkable composition  but it served its purpose sufficiently well  and for that reason deserves recognition .   duet from  the lamplighter   air   the young may moon   tom .  there comes a new moon twelve times a year .   betsy .  and when there is none  all is dark and drear .   tom .  in which i espy    betsy .  and so  too  do i    both .  a resemblance to womankind very clear    both .  there comes a new moon twelve times a year  and when there is none  all is dark and drear .   tom .  in which i espy    betsy .  and so do i    both .  a resemblance to womankind very clear .   second verse .   tom .  she changes  she s fickle  she drives men mad .   betsy .  she comes to bring light  and leaves them sad .   tom .  so restless wild    betsy .  but so sweetly wild    both .  that no better companion could be had .   both .  there comes a new moon twelve times a year  and when there is none  all is dark and drear .   tom .  in which i espy    betsy .  and so do i    both .  a resemblance to womankind very clear .              songs from  the pickwick papers         i .   the ivy green  the ivy green  this famous ballad of three verses  from the sixth chapter of pickwick  is perhaps the most acceptable of all dickens s poetical efforts .  it was originally set to music  at dickens s request  by his brother in law  henry burnett  a professional vocalist  who  by the way  was the admitted prototype of nicholas nickleby .  mr .  burnett sang the ballad scores of times in the presence of literary men and artists  and it proved an especial favourite with landor .   the ivy green  was not written for pickwick  mr .  burnett assured me  but on its being so much admired the author said it should go into a monthly number  and it did .  the most popular setting is undoubtedly that of henry russell  who has recorded that he received  as his fee  the magnificent sum of ten shillings .  the ballad  in this form  went into many editions  and the sales must have amounted to tens of thousands .   the ivy green  oh  a dainty plant is the ivy green  that creepeth o er ruins old .  of right choice food are his meals  i ween  in his cell so lone and cold .  the wall must be crumbled  the stone decayed  to pleasure his dainty whim  and the mouldering dust that years have made is a merry meal for him .  creeping where no life is seen  a rare old plant is the ivy green .   fast he stealeth on  though he wears no wings  and a staunch old heart has he .  how closely he twineth  how tight he clings  to his friend the huge oak tree .  and slily he traileth along the ground  and his leaves he gently waves  as he joyously hugs and crawleth round the rich mould of dead men s graves .  creeping where grim death hath been  a rare old plant is the ivy green .   whole ages have fled and their works decayed  and nations have scattered been  but the stout old ivy shall never fade  from its hale and hearty green .  the brave old plant  in its lonely days  shall fatten upon the past  for the stateliest building man can raise is the ivy s food at last .  creeping on  where time has been  a rare old plant is the ivy green .   ii .   a christmas carol  a christmas carol  the five stanzas bearing the above title will be found in the twenty eighth chapter of pickwick  where they are introduced as the song which that hospitable old soul  mr .  wardle  sung appropriately   in a good  round  sturdy voice   before the pickwickians and others assembled on christmas eve at manor farm .  the  carol   shortly after its appearance in pickwick  was set to music to the air of  old king cole   and published in the book of british song  new edition   with an illustration drawn by  alfred crowquill   i . e .   a .  h .  forrester .   a christmas carol  i care not for spring  on his fickle wing let the blossoms and buds be borne  he woos them amain with his treacherous rain  and he scatters them ere the morn .  an inconstant elf  he knows not himself nor his own changing mind an hour  he ll smile in your face  and  with wry grimace  he ll wither your youngest flower .   let the summer sun to his bright home run  he shall never be sought by me  when he s dimmed by a cloud i can laugh aloud  and care not how sulky he be .  for his darling child is the madness wild that sports in fierce fever s train  and when love is too strong  it don t last long  as many have found to their pain .   a mild harvest night  by the tranquil light of the modest and gentle moon  has a far sweeter sheen  for me  i ween  than the broad and unblushing noon .  but every leaf awakens my grief  as it lieth beneath the tree  so let autumn air be never so fair  it by no means agrees with me .   but my song i troll out  for christmas stout  the hearty  the true  and the bold  a bumper i drain  and with might and main give three cheers for this christmas old .  we ll usher him in with a merry din that shall gladden his joyous heart  and we ll keep him up  while there s bite or sup  and in fellowship good  we ll part .   in his fine honest pride  he scorns to hide one jot of his hard weather scars  they re no disgrace  for there s much the same trace on the cheeks of our bravest tars .  then again i sing  till the roof doth ring  and it echoes from wall to wall   to the stout old wight  fair welcome to night  as the king of the seasons all .   iii .   gabriel grub s song  gabriel grub s song  the sexton s melancholy dirge  in the twenty ninth chapter of pickwick  seems a little incongruous in a humorous work .  the sentiment  however  thoroughly accords with the philosophic gravedigger s gruesome occupation .   the story of the goblins who stole a sexton  is one of several short tales  chiefly of a dismal character  introduced into pickwick  they were doubtless written prior to the conception of pickwick  each being probably intended for independent publication  and in a manner similar to the  boz  sketches .  for some reason these stories were not so published  and dickens evidently saw a favourable opportunity of utilising his unused manuscripts by inserting them in the pickwick papers .   gabriel grub s song  brave lodgings for one  brave lodgings for one  a few feet of cold earth  when life is done  a stone at the head  a stone at the feet  a rich  juicy meal for the worms to eat  rank grass over head  and damp clay around  brave lodgings for one  these  in holy ground .   iv .   romance  romance  it will be remembered that while sam weller and his coaching friends refreshed themselves at the little public house opposite the insolvent court in portugal street  lincoln s inn fields  prior to sam joining mr .  pickwick in the fleet  that faithful body servant was persuaded to  oblige the company  with a song .   raly  gentlemen   said sam   i m not wery much in the habit o  singin  vithout the instrument  but anythin  for a quiet life  as the man said ven he took the sitivation at the light house .     with this prelude  mr .  samuel weller burst at once into the following wild and beautiful legend  which  under the impression that it is not generally known  we take the liberty of quoting .  we would beg to call particular attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and fourth lines  which not only enables the singer to take breath at those points  but greatly assists the metre .   the pickwick papers  chapter xliii .   at the conclusion of the performance the mottled faced gentleman contended that the song was  personal to the cloth   and demanded the name of the bishop s coachman  whose cowardice he regarded as a reflection upon coachmen in general .  sam replied that his name was not known  as  he hadn t got his card in his pocket   whereupon the mottled faced gentleman declared the statement to be untrue  stoutly maintaining that the said coachman did not run away  but  died game  game as pheasants   and he would  hear nothin  said to the contrairey .    even in the vernacular  observes mr .  percy fitzgerald    this master of words  charles dickens  could be artistic  and it may fairly be asserted that mr .  weller s song to the coachmen is superior to anything of the kind that has appeared since .   the two stanzas have been set to music  as a humorous part song  by sir frederick bridge  mus .  doc .   m . v . o .   the organist of westminster abbey  who informs me that it was written some years since  to celebrate a festive gathering in honour of dr .  turpin   .    secretary of the college of organists .   it has had a very great success   says sir frederick   and is sung much in the north of england at competitions of choirs .  it is for men s voices .  the humour of the words never fails to make a great hit  and i hope the music does no harm .   the bishop s coach  is set to a bit of old plain chant  and i introduce a fugue at the words  sure as eggs is

political squibs from  the examiner        i .   the fine old english gentleman  political squibs from  the examiner         in august      dickens contributed anonymously to the examiner  then edited by forster  three political squibs  which were signed w .   and were intended to help the liberals in fighting their opponents .  these squibs were entitled respectively  the fine old english gentleman  to be said or sung at all conservative dinners     the quack doctor s proclamation   and  subjects for painters  after peter pindar  .   concerning those productions  forster says   i doubt if he ever enjoyed anything more than the power of thus taking part occasionally  unknown to outsiders  in the sharp conflict the press was waging at the time .   in all probability he contributed other political rhymes to the pages of the examiner as events prompted  if so  they are buried beyond easy reach of identification .   writing to forster at this time  dickens said   by jove  how radical i am getting .  i wax stronger and stronger in the true principles every day .   .  .  .  he would  observes forster  sometimes even talk  in moments of sudden indignation at the political outlook   of carrying off himself and his household gods  like coriolanus  to a world elsewhere .   this was the period of the tory interregnum  with sir robert peel at the head of affairs .   the fine old english gentleman  new version   to be said or sung at all conservative dinners   i ll sing you a new ballad  and i ll warrant it first rate  of the days of that old gentleman who had that old estate  when they spent the public money at a bountiful old rate on ev ry mistress  pimp  and scamp  at ev ry noble gate  in the fine old english tory times  soon may they come again .   the good old laws were garnished well with gibbets  whips  and chains  with fine old english penalties  and fine old english pains  with rebel heads  and seas of blood once hot in rebel veins  for all these things were requisite to guard the rich old gains of the fine old english tory times  soon may they come again .   this brave old code  like argus  had a hundred watchful eyes  and ev ry english peasant had his good old english spies  to tempt his starving discontent with fine old english lies  then call the good old yeomanry to stop his peevish cries  in the fine old english tory times  soon may they come again .   the good old times for cutting throats that cried out in their need  the good old times for hunting men who held their fathers  creed  the good old times when william pitt  as all good men agreed  came down direct from paradise at more than railroad speed .  .  .  .  oh the fine old english tory times  when will they come again .   in those rare days  the press was seldom known to snarl or bark  but sweetly sang of men in pow r  like any tuneful lark  grave judges  too  to all their evil deeds were in the dark  and not a man in twenty score knew how to make his mark .  oh the fine old english tory times  soon may they come again .   those were the days for taxes  and for war s infernal din  for scarcity of bread  that fine old dowagers might win  for shutting men of letters up  through iron bars to grin  because they didn t think the prince was altogether thin  in the fine old english tory times  soon may they come again .   but tolerance  though slow in flight  is strong wing d in the main  that night must come on these fine days  in course of time was plain  the pure old spirit struggled  but its struggles were in vain  a nation s grip was on it  and it died in choking pain  with the fine old english tory days  all of the olden time .   the bright old day now dawns again  the cry runs through the land  in england there shall be dear bread  in ireland  sword and brand  and poverty  and ignorance  shall swell the rich and grand  so  rally round the rulers with the gentle iron hand  of the fine old english tory days  hail to the coming time .   w .

       prologue to  the patrician s daughter   the patrician s daughter was the title bestowed upon a play  in the tragic vein  by a then unknown writer  j .  westland marston  it being his maiden effort in dramatic authorship .  dickens took great interest in the young man and indicated a desire to promote the welfare of his production by composing some introductory lines .  to macready he wrote   the more i think of marston s play  the more sure i feel that a prologue to the purpose would help it materially  and almost decide the fate of any ticklish point on the first night .  now i have an idea  not easily explainable in writing  but told in five words  that would take the prologue out of the conventional dress of prologues  quite .  get the curtain up with a dash  and begin the play with a sledge hammer blow .  if  on consideration  you should agree with me  i will write the prologue  heartily .   happily for the author  his little tragedy was the first new play of the season  and it thus attracted greater attention .  its initial representation took place at drury lane theatre on december           and the fact that dickens s dignified and vigorous lines were recited by macready  the leading actor of his day  undoubtedly gave prestige to this performance  but the play  although it made a sensation for the moment  did not enjoy a long run  its motive being for some reason misunderstood .  as explained by the editors of the letters of charles dickens  it was  to a certain extent  an experiment in testing the effect of a tragedy of modern times and in modern dress  the novelist s prologue being intended to show that there need be no incongruity between plain clothes of the nineteenth century and high tragedy .   the patrician s daughter  a tragedy in five acts  appeared in pamphlet form during the year prior to its being placed upon the boards .  the prologue was printed for the first time in the sunday times  december           and then in the theatrical journal and stranger s guide  december          .  by the kind permission of miss hogarth  the lines are here reproduced from the revised and only correct version in the letters of charles dickens .   in the preface to the second edition of the play         the author thus acknowledges his indebtedness to dickens for the prologue  which  however  does not appear in the book   how shall i thank mr .  dickens for the spontaneous kindness which has furnished me with so excellent a letter of introduction to the audience .  the simplest acknowledgment is perhaps the best  since the least i might say would exceed his estimate of the obligation  while the most i could say would fail to express mine .    prologue to  the patrician s daughter    spoken by mr .  macready   no tale of streaming plumes and harness bright dwells on the poet s maiden harp to night  no trumpet s clamour and no battle s fire breathes in the trembling accents of his lyre  enough for him  if in his lowly strain he wakes one household echo not in vain  enough for him  if in his boldest word the beating heart of man be dimly heard .   its solemn music which  like strains that sigh through charmed gardens  all who hearing die  its solemn music he does not pursue to distant ages out of human view  nor listen to its wild and mournful chime in the dead caverns on the shore of time  but musing with a calm and steady gaze before the crackling flames of living days  he hears it whisper through the busy roar of what shall be and what has been before .  awake the present .  shall no scene display the tragic passion of the passing day .  is it with man  as with some meaner things  that out of death his single purpose springs .  can his eventful life no moral teach until he be  for aye  beyond its reach .  obscurely shall he suffer  act  and fade  dubb d noble only by the sexton s spade .  awake the present .  though the steel clad age find life alone within its storied page  iron is worn  at heart  by many still   the tyrant custom binds the serf like will  if the sharp rack  and screw  and chain be gone  these later days have tortures of their own  the guiltless writhe  while guilt is stretch d in sleep  and virtue lies  too often  dungeon deep .  awake the present .  what the past has sown be in its harvest garner d  reap d  and grown .   how pride breeds pride  and wrong engenders wrong  read in the volume truth has held so long  assured that where life s flowers freshest blow  the sharpest thorns and keenest briars grow  how social usage has the pow r to change good thoughts to evil  in its highest range to cramp the noble soul  and turn to ruth the kindling impulse of our glorious youth  crushing the spirit in its house of clay  learn from the lessons of the present day .  not light its import and not poor its mien  yourselves the actors  and your homes the scene .              a word in season from the  keepsake         a word in season  the keepsake  one of the many fashionable annuals published during the early years of queen victoria s reign  had for its editor in      the  gorgeous  countess of blessington  the reigning beauty who held court at gore house  kensington  where many political  artistic  and literary celebrities forgathered  bulwer lytton  disraeli  dickens  ainsworth  d orsay  and the rest .  her ladyship  through her personal charm and natural gifts  succeeded in securing the services of eminent authors for the aristocratic publication  even dickens could not resist her appeal  and in a letter to forster  dated july       he wrote   i have heard  as you have  from lady blessington  for whose behalf i have this morning penned the lines i send you herewith .  but i have only done so to excuse myself  for i have not the least idea of their suiting her  and i hope she will send them back to you for the examiner .   lady blessington  however  decided to retain the thoughtful little poem  which was referred to in the london review  twenty three years later  as  a graceful and sweet apologue  reminding one of the manner of hood .   the theme of the poem  which forster describes as  a clever and pointed parable in verse   was afterwards satirised in chadband  bleak house   and in the idea of religious conversion through the agency of  moral pocket handkerchiefs .    a word in season  they have a superstition in the east  that allah  written on a piece of paper  is better unction than can come of priest  of rolling incense  and of lighted taper  holding  that any scrap which bears that name  in any characters  its front imprest on  shall help the finder through the purging flame  and give his toasted feet a place to rest on .   accordingly  they make a mighty fuss with ev ry wretched tract and fierce oration  and hoard the leaves  for they are not  like us  a highly civilized and thinking nation  and  always stooping in the miry ways  to look for matter of this earthy leaven  they seldom  in their dust exploring days  have any leisure to look up to heaven .   so have i known a country on the earth  where darkness sat upon the living waters  and brutal ignorance  and toil  and dearth were the hard portion of its sons and daughters  and yet  where they who should have ope d the door of charity and light  for all men s finding  squabbled for words upon the altar floor  and rent the book  in struggles for the binding .   the gentlest man among these pious turks  god s living image ruthlessly defaces  their best high churchman  with no faith in works  bowstrings the virtues in the market

             verses from the  daily news         i .   the british lion  verses from the  daily news         the daily news  it will be remembered  was founded in january      by charles dickens  who officiated as its first editor .  he soon sickened of the mechanical drudgery appertaining to the position  and resigned his editorial functions the following month .  from january   st to march  nd he contributed to its columns a series of  travelling sketches   afterwards reprinted in volume form as pictures from italy .  he also availed himself of the opportunity afforded him  by his association with that newspaper  of once more taking up the cudgels against the tories  and  as in the case of the examiner  his attack was conveyed through the medium of some doggerel verses .  these were entitled  the british lion  a new song  but an old story   to be sung to the tune of  the great sea snake .   they bore the signature of  catnach   the famous ballad singer  and were printed in the daily news of january          .   three weeks later some verses of a totally different character appeared in the columns of the daily news  signed in full  charles dickens .   one lucy simpkins  of bremhill  or bremble   a parish in wiltshire  had just previously addressed a night meeting of the wives of agricultural labourers in that county  in support of a petition for free trade  and her vigorous speech on that occasion inspired dickens to write  the hymn of the wiltshire labourers   thus offering an earnest protest against oppression .  concerning the  hymn   a writer in a recent issue of christmas bells observes   it breathes in every line the teaching of the sermon on the mount  the love of the all father  the redemption by his son  and that love to god and man on which hang all the law and the prophets .    the british lion  a new song  but an old story  tune   the great sea snake   oh  p r aps you may have heard  and if not  i ll sing of the british lion free  that was

don t he wag his tail .    now  the principal keeper of this poor old beast  wan humbug was his name  would once ev ry day stir him up  at least   and wasn t that a game .  for he hadn t a tooth  and he hadn t a claw  in that  struggle  so  sublime   and  however sharp they touch d him on the raw  he couldn t come up to time .   and this  you will observe  was the reason why wan humbug  on weak grounds  was forced to make believe that he heard his cry in all unlikely sounds .  so  there wasn t a bleat from an essex calf  or a duke  or a lordling slim  but he said  with a wery triumphant

example  in a letter to maclise  the artist  which began with a parody of byron s lines to thomas moore     my foot is in the house  my bath is on the sea  and  before i take a souse  here s a single note to thee .    a more remarkable instance of his propensity to indulge in parody of this kind is to be found in a letter addressed to mark lemon in the spring of      .  the novelist was then enjoying a holiday with his wife and daughters at brighton  whence he wrote to lemon  who had been ill   pressing him to pay them a visit .  after commanding him to  get a clean pocket handkerchief

collins composed two powerful dramas for representation at dickens s residence  tavistock house  a portion of which had been already adapted for private theatricals  the rooms so converted being described in the bills as  the smallest theatre in the world .   the first of these plays was called the lighthouse  and the initial performance took place on june          .  dickens not only wrote the prologue and  the song of the wreck   but signally distinguished himself by enacting the part of aaron gurnock  a lighthouse keeper  his clever impersonation recalling frederick lemaitre  the only actor he ever tried to take as a model .   with regard to  the song of the wreck   dickens evidently intended to bestow upon it a different title  for  in a letter addressed to wilkie collins during the preparation of the play  he said   i have written a little ballad for mary   the story of the ship s carpenter and the little boy  in the shipwreck .    the song was rendered by his eldest daughter  mary  who assumed the role of phoebe in the play   it was set to the music composed by george linley for miss charlotte young s pretty ballad   little nell   of which dickens became very fond  and which his daughter had been in the habit of singing to him constantly since her childhood .  dr .  a .  w .  ward  master of peter house  cambridge university  refers to  the song of the

and thus among them  left alone  they found one helpless child .   ii  a seaman rough  to shipwreck bred  stood out from all the rest  and gently laid the lonely head upon his honest breast .  and travelling o er the desert wide it was a solemn joy  to see them  ever side by side  the sailor and the boy .   iii  in famine  sickness  hunger  thirst  the two were still but one  until the strong man droop d the first and felt his labours done .  then to a trusty friend he spake   across the desert wide  o take this poor boy for my sake .   and kiss d the child and died .   iv  toiling along

written by wilkie collins for the tavistock house theatre was first acted there in january       and subsequently at the gallery of illustration in the presence of queen victoria and the royal family .  as in the case of the lighthouse  the play had the advantage of a prologue in rhyme by charles dickens  who again electrified his audiences by marvellous acting  the character of richard wardour  a young naval officer  being selected by him for representation .   the prologue was recited at tavistock house by john forster  and at the public performances of the play by dickens himself .   it is not generally known that a by no means inconsiderable portion of the drama was composed by dickens  as testified by the original manuscripts of the play and of the prompt book  which contain numerous additions and corrections in his handwriting .  these manuscripts  by the way  realised l    at sotheby s in      .   the main idea of a tale of two cities was conceived by dickens when performing in the frozen deep .   a strong desire was upon me then   he writes in the preface to the story   to embody it in my own person  and i traced out in my fancy the state of mind of which it would necessitate the presentation to an observant spectator  with particular care and interest .  as the idea became familiar to me  it gradually shaped itself into its present form .  throughout its execution  it has had complete possession of me  i have so far verified what is done and suffered in these pages  as that i have certainly done and suffered it all myself .    prologue to  the frozen deep    curtain rises  mists and darkness  soft music throughout .    one savage footprint on the lonely shore where one man listen d to the surge s roar  not all the winds that stir the mighty sea can ever ruffle in the memory .  if such its interest and thrall  o then pause on the footprints of heroic men  making a garden of the desert wide where parry conquer d death and franklin died .   to that white region where the lost lie low  wrapt in their mantles of eternal snow    unvisited by change  nothing to mock those statues sculptured in the icy rock  we pray your company  that hearts as true  though nothings of the air  may live for you  nor only yet that on our little glass a faint reflection of those wilds may pass  but that the secrets of the vast profound within us  an exploring hand may sound  testing the region of the ice bound soul  seeking the passage at its northern pole  softening the horrors of its wintry sleep  melting the surface of that  frozen deep .    vanish  ye mists .  but ere this gloom departs  and to the union of three sister arts we give a winter evening  good to know that in the charms of such another show  that in the fiction of a friendly play  the arctic sailors  too  put gloom away  forgot their long night  saw no starry dome  hail d the warm sun  and were again at home .   vanish  ye mists .  not yet do we repair to the still country of the piercing air  but seek  before we cross the troubled seas  an english hearth and devon s waving trees .              a child s hymn from  the wreck of the golden mary         a child s hymn  the christmas number of household words for      is especially noteworthy as containing the hymn of five verses which dickens contributed to the second chapter .  this made a highly favourable impression  and a certain clergyman  the rev .  r .  h .  davies  was induced to express to the editor of household words his gratitude to the author of these lines for having thus conveyed to innumerable readers such true religious sentiments .  in acknowledging the receipt of the letter  dickens observed that such a mark of approval was none the less gratifying to him because he was himself the author of the hymn .   there cannot be many men  i believe   he added   who have a more humble veneration for the new testament  or a more profound conviction of its all sufficiency  than i have .  if i am ever  as you tell me i am  mistaken on this subject  it is because i discountenance all obtrusive professions of and tradings in religion  as one of the main causes why real christianity has been retarded in this world  and because my observation of life induces me to hold in unspeakable dread and horror those unseemly squabbles about the letter which drive the spirit out of hundreds of thousands .

keep .   my sins are heavy  but thy mercy far outweighs them every one  down before thy cross i cast them  trusting in thy help alone .   keep me through this night of peril underneath its boundless shade  take me to thy rest  i pray thee  when my pilgrimage is made .   none shall measure out thy patience by the span of human thought  none shall bound the tender mercies which thy holy son has bought .   pardon all my past transgressions  give me strength for days to come  guide and guard me with thy blessing till thy angels bid me home .   edinburgh  printed by t .  and a .  constable
