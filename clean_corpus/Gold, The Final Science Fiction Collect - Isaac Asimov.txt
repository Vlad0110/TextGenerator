pseudonyms dialog  acknowledgments  part one  the final stories  cal  i am a robot .  my name is cal .  i have a registration number .  it is cl    x  but my master calls me cal .  the x in my registration number means i am a special robot for my master .  he asked for me and helped design me .  he has a lot of money .  he is a writer .  i am not a very complicated robot .  my master doesn   t want a complicated robot .  he just wants someone to pick up after him  to run his printer  stack his disks  and like that .  he says i don   t give him any backtalk and just do what i am told .  he says that is good .  he has people come in to help him  sometimes .  they give him backtalk .  sometimes they do not do what they are told .  he gets very angry and red in the face .  then he tells me to do something  and i do it .  he says  thank goodness  you do as you are told .  of course  i do as i am told .  what else can i do .  i want to make my master feel good .  i can tell when my master feels good .  his mouth stretches and he calls that a smile .  he pats me on the shoulder and says  good  cal .  good .  i like it when he says  good  cal .  good .  i say to my master  thank you .  you make me feel good  too .  and he laughs .  i like when he laughs because it means he feels good  but it is a queer sound .  i don   t understand how he makes it or why .  i ask him and he says to me that he laughs when something is funny .  i ask him if what i said is funny .  he says  yes  it is .  it is funny because i say i feel good .  he says robots do not really feel good .  he says only human masters feel good .  he says robots just have positronic brain paths that work more easily when they follow orders .  i don   t know what positronic brain paths are .  he says they are something inside me .  i say  when positronic brain paths work better  does it make everything smoother and easier for me .  is that why i feel good .  then i ask  when a master feels good  is it because something in him works more easily .  my master nods and says  cal  you are smarter than you look .  i don   t know what that means either but my master seems pleased with me and that makes my positronic brain paths work more easily  and that makes me feel good .  it is easier just to say it makes me feel good .  i ask if i can say that .  he says  you can say whatever you choose  cal .  what i want is to be a writer like my master .  i do not understand why i have this feeling  but my master is a writer and he helped design me .  maybe his design makes me feel i want to be a writer .  i do not understand why i have this feeling because i don   t know what a writer is .  i ask my master what a writer is .  he smiles again .  why do you want to know  cal .  he asks .  i do not know  i say .  it is just that you are a writer and i want to know what that is .  you seem so happy when you are writing and if it makes you happy maybe it will make me happy  too .  i have a feeling  i don   t have the words for it .  i think a while and he waits for me .  he is still smiling .  i say  i want to know because it will make me feel better to know .  i am  i am he says  you are curious  cal .  i say  i don   t know what that word means .  he says  it means you want to know just because you want to know .  i want to know just because i want to know  i say .  he says  writing is making up a story .  i tell about people who do different things  and have different things happen to them .  i say  how do you find out what they do and what happens to them .  he says  i make them up  cal .  they are not real people .  they are not real happenings .  i imagine them  in here .  he points to his head .  i do not understand and i ask how he makes them up  but he laughs and says  i do not know  either .  i just make them up .  he says  i write mysteries .  crime stories .  i tell about people who do wrong things  who hurt other people .  i feel very bad when i hear that .  i say  how can you talk about hurting people .  that must never be done .  he says  human beings are not controlled by the three laws of robotics .  human masters can hurt other human masters  if they wish .  this is wrong  i say .  it is  he says .  in my stories  people who do harm are punished .  they are put in prison and kept there where they cannot hurt people .  do they like it in prison .  i ask .  of course not .  they must not .  fear of prison keeps them from doing more hurtful things than they do .  i say  but prison is wrong  too  if it makes people feel bad .  well  says my master  that is why you cannot write mysteries and crime stories .  i think about that .  there must be a way to write stories in which people are not hurt .  i would like to do that .  i want to be a writer .  i want to be a writer very much .  my master has three different writers for writing stories .  one is very old  but he says he keeps it because it has sentimental value .  i don   t know what sentimental value is .  i do not like to ask .  he does not use the machine for his stories .  maybe sentimental value means it must not be used .  he doesn   t say i can not use it .  i do not ask him if i can use it .  if i do not ask him and he does not say i must not  then i am not disobeying orders if i use it .  at night  he is sleeping  and the other human masters who are sometimes here are gone .  there are two other robots my master has who are more important than i am .  they do more important work .  they wait in their niches at night when they have not been given anything to do .  my master has not said  stay in your niche  cal .  sometimes he doesn   t  because i am so unimportant  and then i can move about at night .  i can look at the writer .  you push keys and it makes words and then the words are put on paper .  i watch the master so i know how to push keys .  the words go on the paper themselves .  i do not have to do that .  i push the keys but i do not understand the words .  i feel bad after a while .  the master may not like it even if he does not tell me not to do it .  the words are printed on paper and in the morning i show the words to my master .  i say  i am sorry .  i was using the writer .  he looks at the paper .  then he looks at me .  he makes a frown .  he says  did you do this .  yes  master .  when .  last night .  why .  i want very much to write .  is this a story .  he holds up the paper and smiles .  he says  these are just random letters  cal .  this is gibberish .  he does not seem angry .  i feel better .  i do not know what gibberish is .  i say  is it a story .  he says  no  it is not .  and it is a lucky thing the writer cannot be damaged by mishandling .  if you really want to write so badly  i will tell you what i will do .  i will have you reprogrammed so that you will know how to use a writer .  two days later  a technician arrives .  he is a master who knows how to make robots do better jobs .  my master tells me that the technician is the one who put me together  and my master helped .  i do not remember that .  the technician listens carefully to my master .  he says  why do you want to do this  mr .  northrop .  mr .  northrop is what other masters call my master .  my master says  i helped design cal  remember .  i think i must have put into him the desire to be a writer .  i did not intend to  but as long as he does  i feel i should humor him .  i owe it to him .  the technician says  that is foolish .  even if we accidentally put in a desire to write that is still no job for a robot .  my master says  just the same i want it done .  the technician says  it will be expensive  mr .  northrop .  my master frowns .  he looks angry .  he says  cal is my robot .  i shall do as i please .  i have the money and i want him adjusted .  the technician looks angry  too .  he says  if that   s what you want  very well .  the customer is boss .  but it will be more expensive than you think  because we cannot put in the knowledge of how to use a writer without improving his vocabulary a good deal .  my master says  fine .  improve his vocabulary .  the next day  the technician comes back with lots of tools .  he opens my chest .  it is a queer feeling .  i do not like it .  he reaches in .  i think he shuts off my power pack  or takes it out .  i do not remember .  i do not see anything  or think anything  or know anything .   then i could see and think and know again .  i could see that time had passed  but i did not know how much time .  i thought for a while .  it was odd  but i knew how to run a writer and i seemed to understand more words .  for instance  i knew what    gibberish    meant  and it was embarrassing to think i had shown gibberish to my master  thinking it was a story .  i would have to do better .  this time i had no apprehension  i know the meaning of    apprehension     too  i had no apprehension that he would keep me from using the old writer .  after all  he would not have redesigned me to be capable of using it if he were going to prevent me from doing so .  i put it to him .     master  does this mean i may use the writer .     he said     you may do so at any time  cal  that you are not engaged in other tasks .  you must let me see what you write  however .        of course  master .     he was clearly amused because i think he expected more gibberish  what an ugly word .   but i didn   t think he would get any more .  i didn   t write a story immediately .  i had to think about what to write .  i suppose that that is what the master meant when he said you must make up a story .  i found it was necessary to think about it first and then write down what was thought .  it was much more complicated than i had supposed .  my master noticed my preoccupation .  he asked me     what are you doing  cal .     i said     i am trying to make up a story .  it   s hard work .        are you finding that out  cal .  good .  obviously  your reorganization has not only improved your vocabulary but it seems to me it has intensified your intelligence .     i said     i   m not sure what is meant by    intensified    .        it means you seem smarter .  you seem to know more .        does that displease you  master .        not at all .  it pleases me .  it may make it more possible for you to write stories and even after you have grown tired of trying to write  you will remain more useful to me .     i thought at once that it would be delightful to be more useful to the master  but i didn   t understand what he meant about growing tired of trying to write .  i wasn   t going to get tired of writing .  finally  i had a story in my mind  and i asked my master when would be a proper time to write it .  he said     wait till night .  then you won   t be getting in my way .  we can have a small light for the corner where the old writer is standing  and you can write your story .  how long do you think it will take you .        just a little while     i said  surprised .     i can work the writer very quickly .     my master said     cal  working the writer isn   t all there      then he stopped  thought a while  and said     no  you go ahead and do it .  you will learn .  i won   t try to advise you .     he was right .  working the writer wasn   t all there was to it .  i spent nearly the whole night trying to figure out the story .  it is very difficult to decide which word comes after which .  i had to erase the story several times and start over .  it was very embarrassing .  finally  it was done  and here it is .  i kept it after i wrote it because it was the first story i ever wrote .  it was not gibberish .   the introoder by cal  there was a detektav wuns named cal  who was a very good detektav and very brave .  nuthin fritened him .  imajin his surprise one night when he herd an introoder in his masters home .  he came russian into the riting office .  there was an introoder .  he had cum in throo the windo .  there was broken glas .  that was what cal  the brave detektav  had herd with his good hering .  he said     stop  introoder .     the introoder stopped and looked skared .  cal felt bad that the introoder looked skared .  cal said     look what you have done .  you have broken the windo .        yes     said the introoder  looking very ashaymed .     i did not mean to break the windo .     cal was very clever and he saw the flawr in the introoder   s remark .  he said     how did you expect to get in if you were not going to break the windo .        i thought it would be open     he said .     i tried to open it and it broke .     cal said     waht was the meaning of what you have done  anyhow .  why should you want to come into this room when it is not your room .  you are an introoder .        i did not mean any harm     he said .     that is not so  for if you ment no harm  you would not be here     said cal .     you must be punnished .        please do not punnish me     said the introoder .     i will not punnish you     said cal .     i don   t wish to cause you unhappiness or payn .  i will call my master .     he called     master .  master .     the master came russian in .     what have we here .     he asked .     an introoder     i said .     i have caut him and he is for you to punnish .     my master looked at the introoder .  he said     are you sorry for wat you have done .        i am     said the introoder .  he was crying and water was coming out of his eys the way it happens with masters when they are sad .     will you ever do it agen .     said my master .     never .  i will never do it agen     said the introoder .     in that case     said the master     you have been punnished enogh .  go away and be sure never to do it agen .     then the master said     you are a good detektav  cal .  i am proud of you .     cal was very glad to have pleased the master .  the end  i was very pleased with the story and i showed it to the master .  i was sure he would be very pleased  too .  he was more than pleased  for as he read it  he smiled .  he even laughed a few times .  then he looked up at me and said     did you write this .        yes  i did  master     i said .     i mean  all by yourself .  you didn   t copy anything .        i made it up in my own head  master      i said .     do you like it .     he laughed again  quite loudly .     it   s interesting     he said .  i was a little anxious .     is it funny .     i asked .     i don   t know how to make things funny .        i know  cal .  it   s not funny intentionally .     i thought about that for a while .  then i asked     how can something be funny unintentionally .        it   s hard to explain  but don   t worry about it .  in the first place  you can   t spell  and that   s a surprise .  you speak so well now that i automatically assumed you could spell words but  obviously  you can   t .  you can   t be a writer unless you can spell words correctly  and use good grammar .        how do i manage to spell words correctly .        you don   t have to worry about that  cal     said my master .     we will outfit you with a dictionary .  but tell me  cal .  in your story  cal is you  isn   t he .        yes .     i was pleased he had noticed that .     bad idea .  you don   t want to put yourself into a story and say how great you are .  it offends the reader .        why  master .        because it does .  it looks like i will have to give you advice  but i   ll make it as brief as possible .  it is not customary to praise yourself .  besides you don   t want to say you are great  you must show you are great in what you do .  and don   t use your own name .        is that a rule .        a good writer can break any rule  but you   re just a beginner .  stick to the rules and what i have told you are just a couple of them .  you   re going to encounter many  many more if you keep on writing .  also  cal  you   re going to have trouble with the three laws of robotics .  you can   t assume that wrongdoers will weep and be ashamed .  human beings aren   t like that .  they must be punished sometimes .     i felt my positronic brain paths go rough .  i said     that is difficult .         i know .  also  there   s no mystery in the story .  there doesn   t have to be  but i think you   d be better off if there were .  what if your hero  whom you   ll have to call something other than cal  doesn   t know whether someone is an intruder or not .  how would he find out .  you see  he has to use his head .     and my master pointed to his own .  i didn   t quite follow .  my master said     i   ll tell you what .  i   ll give you some stories of my own to read  after you   ve been outfitted with a spelling dictionary and a grammar and you   ll see what i mean .      the technician came to the house and said     there   s no problem in installing a spelling dictionary and a grammar .  it   ll cost you more money .  i know you don   t care about money  but tell me why you are so interested in making a writer out of this hunk of steel and titanium .     i didn   t think it was right for him to call me a hunk of steel and titanium  but of course a human master can say anything he wants to say .  they always talk about us robots as though we weren   t there .  i   ve noticed that  too .  my master said     did you ever hear of a robot who wanted to be a writer .        no     said the technician     i can   t say i ever did  mr .  northrop .        neither did i .  neither did anyone as far as i know .  cal is unique  and i want to study him .     the technician smiled very wide grinned  that   s the word .     don   t tell me you have it in your head that he   ll be able to write your stories for you  mr .  northrop .     my master stopped smiling .  he lifted his head and looked down on the technician very angrily .     don   t be a fool .  you just do what i pay you to do .     i think the master made the technician sorry he had said that  but i don   t know why .  if my master asked me to write his stories for him i would be pleased to do so .   again  i don   t know how long it took the technician to do his job when he came back a couple of days later .  i don   t remember a thing about it .  then my master was suddenly talking to me .     how do you feel  cal .     i said     i feel very well .  thank you  sir .        what about words .  can you spell .        i know the letter combinations  sir .        very good .  can you read this .     he handed me a book .  it said  on the cover  the best mysteries of j .  f .  northrop .  i said     are these your stories  sir .        absolutely .  if you want to read them  you can .     i had never been able to read easily before  but now as soon as i looked at the words  i could hear them in my ear .  it was surprising .  i couldn   t imagine how i had been unable to do it before .     thank you  sir     i said .     i shall read this and i   m sure it will help me in my writing .        very good .  continue to show me everything you write .     the master   s stories were quite interesting .  he had a detective who could always understand matters that others found puzzling .  i didn   t always understand how he could see the truth of a mystery and i had to read some of the stories over again and do so slowly .  sometimes i couldn   t understand them even when i read them slowly .  sometimes i did  though  and it seemed to me i could write a story like mr .  northrop   s .  this time i spent quite a long while working it out in my head .  when i thought i had it worked out  i wrote the following   the shiny quarter by euphrosyne durando  calumet smithson sat in his arm chair  his eagle eyes sharp and the nostrils of his thin high bridged nose flaring  as though he could scent a new mystery .  he said     well  mr .  wassell  tell me your story again from the beginning .  leave out nothing  for one can   t tell when even the smallest detail may not be of the greatest importance .     wassell owned an important business in town  and in it he employed many robots and also human beings .  wassell did so  but there was nothing startling in the details at all and he was able to summarize it this way .     what it amounts to  mr .  smithson  is that i am losing money .  someone in my employ is helping himself to small sums now and then .  the sums are of no great importance  each in itself  but it is like a small  steady oil loss in a machine  or the drip drop of water from a leaky faucet  or the oozing of blood from a small wound .  in time  it would mount up and become dangerous .        are you actually in danger of losing your business  mr .  smithson .        not yet .  but i don   t like to lose money  either .  do you .        no  indeed     said smithson     i do not .  how many robots do you employ in your business .        twenty seven  sir .        and they are all reliable  i suppose .        undoubtedly .  they could not steal .  besides  i have asked each one of them if they took any money and they all said they had not .  and  of course  robots cannot lie  either .        you are quite right     said smithson .     it is useless to be concerned over robots .  they are honest  through and through .  what about the human beings you employ .  how many of them are there .        i employ seventeen  but of these only four can possibly have been stealing .        why is that .        the others do not work on the premises .  these four  however  do .  each one has the occasion  now and then  to handle petty cash  and i suspect that what happens is that at least one of them manages to transfer assets from the company to his private account in such a way that the matter is not easily traced .        i see .  yes  it is unfortunately true that human beings may steal .  have you confronted your suspects with the situation .        yes  i have .  they all deny any such activity  but  of course  human beings can lie  too .        so they can .  did any of them look uneasy while being questioned .        all did .  they could see i was a furious man who could fire all four  guilty or innocent .  they would have had trouble finding other jobs if fired for such a reason .        then that cannot be done .  we must not punish the innocent with the guilty .        you are quite right     said mr .  wassell .     i couldn   t do that .  but how can i decide which one is guilty .        is there one among them who has a dubious record  who has been fired under uncertain circumstances earlier in his career .        i have made quiet inquiries  mr .  smithson  and i have found nothing suspicious about any of them .        is one of them in particular need of money .        i pay good wages .        i am sure of that  but perhaps one has some sort of expensive taste that makes his income insufficient .        i have found no evidence of that  though  to be sure  if one of them needed money for some perverse reason  he would keep it secret .  no one wants to be thought evil .        you are quite right     said the great detective .     in that case  you must confront me with the four men .  i will interrogate them .     his eyes flashed .     we will get to the bottom of this mystery  never fear .  let us arrange a meeting in the evening .  we might meet in the company dining room over some small meal and a bottle of wine  so the men will feel completely relaxed .  tonight  if possible .        i will arrange it     said mr .  wassell  eagerly .   calumet smithson sat at the dinner table and regarded the four men closely .  two of them were quite young and had dark hair .  one of them had a mustache as well .  neither was very good looking .  one of them was mr .  foster and the other was mr .  lionell .  the third man was rather fat and had small eyes .  he was mr .  mann .  the fourth was tall and rangy and had a nervous way of cracking his knuckles .  he was mr .  ostrak .  smithson seemed to be a little nervous himself as he questioned each man in turn .  his eagle eyes narrowed as he gazed sharply at the four suspects and he played with a shiny quarter that flipped casually between the fingers of his right hand .  smithson said     i m sure that each of the four of you is quite aware what a terrible thing it is to steal from an employer .     they all agreed at once .  smithson tapped the shiny quarter on the table  thoughtfully .     one of you  i m sure  is going to break down under the load of guilt and i think you will do it before the evening is over .  but  for now  i must call my office .  i will be gone for only a few minutes .  please sit here and wait for me and while i am gone  do not talk to each other  or look at each other .     he gave the quarter a last tap  and  paying no attention to it  he left .  in about ten minutes  he was back .  he looked from one to another and said     you did not talk to each other or look at each other  i hope .     there was a general shaking of heads as though they were still fearful of speaking .     mr .  wassell     said the detective .     do you agree that no one spoke .        absolutely .  we just sat here quietly and waited .  we didn   t even look at each other .        good .  now i will ask each one of you four men to show me what you have in your pockets .  please put everything into a pile in front of you .     smithson   s voice was so compelling  his eyes so bright and sharp  that none of the men thought of disobeying .     shirt pockets  too .  inside jacket pockets .  all the pockets .     there was quite a pile  credit cards  keys  spectacles  pens  some coins .  smithson looked at the four piles coldly  his mind taking in everything .  then he said     just to make sure that we are all meeting the same requirements  i will make a pile of the contents of my own pockets and  mr .  wassell  you do the same .     now there were six piles .  smithson reached over to the pile in front of mr .  wassell  and said     what is this shiny quarter i see  mr .  wassell .  yours .     wassell looked confused .     yes .        it couldn   t be .  it has my mark on it .  i left it on the table when i went out to call my office .  you took it .     wassell was silent .  the other four men looked at him .  smithson said     i felt that if one of you was a thief  you wouldn   t be able to resist a shiny quarter .  mr .  wassell  you   ve been stealing from your own company  and  afraid you would be caught  you tried to spread the guilt among your men .  that was a wicked and cowardly thing to do .     wassell hung his head .     you are right  mr .  smithson .  i thought if i hired you to investigate you would find one of the men guilty  and then perhaps i could stop taking the money for my private use .        you little realize the detective   s mind     said calumet smithson .     i will turn you over to the authorities .  they will decide what to do with you  though if you are sincerely sorry and promise never to do it again  i will try to keep you from being punished badly .     the end  i showed it to mr .  northrop  who read it silently .  he hardly smiled at all .  just in one or two places .  then he put it down and stared at me .     where did you get the name euphrosyne durando .        you said  sir  i was not to use my own name  so i used one as different as possible .        but where did you get it .        sir  one of the minor characters in one of your stories         of course .  i thought it sounded familiar .  do you realize it s a feminine name  .         since i am neither masculine nor feminine         yes  you re quite right .  but the name of the detective  calumet smithson .  that  cal  part is still you  isn t it .        i wanted some connection  sir .        you ve got a tremendous ego  cal .     i hesitated .     what does that mean  sir .        never mind .  it doesn t matter .     he put the manuscript down and i was troubled .  i said     but what did you think of the mystery .        it s an improvement  but it s still not a good mystery .  do you realize that .        in what way is it disappointing  sir .        well  you don t understand modern business practices or computerized financing for one thing .  and no one would take a quarter from the table with four other men present  even if they weren t looking .  it would have been seen .  then  even if that happened  mr .  wassell s taking it isn t proof he was the thief .  anyone could pocket a quarter automatically  without thinking .  it s an interesting indication  but it s not proof .  and the title of the story tends to give it away  too .        i see .        and  in addition  the three laws of robotics are still getting in your way .  you keep worrying about punishment .        i must  sir .        i know you must .  that s why i think you shouldn t try to write crime stories .        what else should i write  sir  .         let me think about it .      mr .  northrop called in the technician again .  this time  i think  he wasn t very eager to have me overhear what he was saying  but even from where i was standing  i could hear the conversation .  sometimes human beings forget how sharp the senses of robots can be .  after all  i was very upset .  i wanted to be a writer and i didn   t want mr .  northrop telling me what i could write and what i couldn   t write .  of course  he was a human being and i had to obey him  but i didn   t like it .     what   s the matter now  mr .  northrop .     asked the technician in a voice that sounded sardonic to my ears .     has this robot of yours been writing a story again .        yes  he has     said mr .  northrop  trying to sound indifferent .     he   s written another mystery story and i don   t want him writing mysteries .        too much competition  eh  mr .  northrop .        no .  don   t be a jackass .  there   s just no point in two people in the same household writing mysteries .  besides  the three laws of robotics get in the way .  you can easily imagine how .        well  what do you want me to do .        i   m not sure .  suppose he writes satire .  that   s one thing i don   t write  so we won   t be competing  and the three laws of robotics won   t get in his way .  i want you to give this robot a sense of the ridiculous .        a sense of the what .     said the technician  angrily .     how do i do that .  look  mr .  northrop  be reasonable .  i can put in instructions on how to run a writer .  i can put in a dictionary and grammar .  but how can i possibly put in a sense of the ridiculous .        well  think about it .  you know the workings of a robot   s brain patterns .  isn   t there some way of readjusting him so that he can see what   s funny  or silly  or just plain ridiculous about human beings .        i can fool around  but it   s not safe .        why isn   t it safe .        because  look  mr .  northrop  you started off with a pretty cheap robot  but i   ve been making it more elaborate .  you admit that it   s unique and that you never heard of one that wants to write stories  so now it   s a pretty expensive robot .  you may even have a classic model here that should be given to the robotic institute .  if you want me to fool around  i might spoil the whole thing .  do you realize that .        i   m willing to take the chance .  if the whole thing is spoiled  it will be spoiled  but why should it be .  i   m not asking you to work in a hurry .  take the time to analyze it carefully .  i have lots of time and lots of money  and i want my robot to write satire .        why satire .        because then his lack of worldly knowledge may not matter so much and the three laws won   t be so important and in time  some day  he may possibly turn out something interesting  though i doubt it .        and he won   t be treading on your turf .        all right  then .  he won   t be treading on my turf .  satisfied .     i still didn   t know enough about the language to know what    treading on my turf    meant  but i gathered that mr .  northrop was annoyed by my mystery stories .  i didn   t know why .  there was nothing i could do  of course .  every day  the technician studied me and analyzed me and finally  he said      all right  mr .  northrop  i   m going to take a chance  but i   m going to ask you to sign a paper absolving me and my company of all responsibility if anything goes wrong .        you just prepare the paper .  i   ll sign it     said mr .  northrop .  it was very chilling to think that something might go wrong  but that   s how things are .  a robot must accept all that human beings decide to do .   this time  after i became aware of everything again  i was quite weak for a long time .  i had difficulty standing  and my speech was slurred .  i thought that mr .  northrop looked at me with a worried expression .  perhaps he felt guilty at how he had treated me  he should feel guilty  or perhaps he was just worried at the possibility of having lost a great deal of money .  as my sense of balance returned and my speech became clear  an odd thing happened .  i suddenly understood how silly human beings were .  they had no laws governing their actions .  they had to make up their own  and even when they did  nothing forced them to obey .  human beings were simply confused  one had to laugh at them .  i understood laughter now and could even make the sound  but naturally i didn   t laugh out loud .  that would have been impolite and offensive .  i laughed inside myself  and i began to think of a story in which human beings did have laws governing their actions but they hated them and couldn   t stick to them .  i also thought of the technician and decided to put him into the story  too .  mr .  northrop kept going to the technician and asking him to do things to me  harder and harder things .  now he had given me a sense of the ridiculous .  so suppose i wrote a story about ridiculous human beings  with no robots present because  of course  robots aren   t ridiculous and their presence would simply spoil the humor .  and suppose i put in a person who was a technician of human beings .  it might be some creature with strange powers who could alter human behavior as my technician could alter robot behavior .  what would happen in that case .  it might show clearly how human beings were not sensible .  i spent days thinking about the story and getting happier and happier about it .  i would start with two men having dinner  and one of them would own a technician  well  have a technician of some sort  and i would place the setting in the twentieth century so as not to offend mr .  northrop and the other people of the twenty first .  i read books to learn about human beings .  mr .  northrop let me do this and he hardly ever gave me any tasks to do .  nor did he try to hurry me to write .  maybe he still felt guilty about the risk he had taken of doing me harm .  i finally started the story  and here it is   perfectly formal by euphrosyne durando  george and i were dining at a rather posh restaurant  one in which it was not unusual to see men and women enter in formal wear .  george looked up at one of those men  observing him narrowly and without favor  as he wiped his lips with my napkin  having carelessly dropped his own .     a pox on all tuxedos  say i     said george .  i followed the direction of his glance .  as nearly as i could tell  he was studying a portly man of about fifty who was wearing an intense expression of self importance as he helped a rather glittering woman  considerably younger than himself  to her chair .  i said     george  are you getting ready to tell me that you know yon bloke in the tux .        no     said george .     i intend to tell you no such thing .  my communications with you  and with all living beings  are always predicated on total truth .        like your tales of your two centimeter demon  az      the look of agony on his face made me stop .     don   t speak of such things     he whispered hoarsely .     azazel has no sense of humor  and he has a powerful sense of power .     then  more normally  he went on     i was merely expressing my detestation of tuxedos  particularly when infested by fat slobs like yon bloke  to use your own curious turn of expression .        oddly enough     i said     i rather agree with you .  i  too  find formal wear objectionable and  except when it is impossible to do so  i avoid all black tie affairs  for that reason alone .        good for you     said george .     that rather spoils my impression that you have no redeeming social qualities .  i   ve told everyone that you haven   t  you know .        thank you  george     i said .     that was very thoughtful of you  considering that you gorge yourself at my expense every chance you get .        i merely allow you to enjoy my company on those occasions  old man .  i would tell all my friends now that you do have one redeeming social quality  but that would merely confuse everyone .  they seem quite content with the thought that you have none .        i thank all your friends     i said .     as it happens  i know a man     said george     who was to the manor born .  his diapers had been clamped shut with studs  not safety pins .  on his first birthday  he was given a little black tie  to be knotted and not clipped on .  and so things continued all his life .  his name is winthrop carver cabwell  and he lived on so rarefied a level of boston   s brahman aristocracy that he had to carry an oxygen mask for occasional use .        and you knew this patrician .  you .     george looked offended .     of course  i did     he said .     do you  for one moment  think that i am such a snob that i would refuse to associate with someone for no other reason than that he was a rich and aristocratic man of brahman persuasion .  you little know me if you do  old man .  winthrop and i knew each other quite well .  i was his escape .     george heaved a vinous sigh that sent a neighboring fly into an alcoholic tailspin .     poor fellow     he said .     poor rich aristocrat .        george     i said .     i believe you   re winding yourself up to tell me one of your improbable tales of disaster .  i don   t wish to hear it .        disaster .  on the contrary .  i have a tale to tell of great happiness and joy  and since that is what you want to hear  i will now tell it to you .      as i told you  said george  my brahman friend was a gentleman from toe to crown  clean favored and imperially slim    why are you interrupting me with your asinine mouthing of richard corey  old fellow .  i never heard of him .  i m talking of winthrop carver cabwell .  why don t you listen .  where was i .  oh  yes .   he was a gentleman from toe to crown  clean favored and imperially slim .  as a result  he was naturally a hissing and a byword to all decent people  as he would have known  if he had ever associated with decent people which  of course  he did not  only with other lost souls like himself .  yes  as you say  he did know me and it was the eventual saving of him  not that i ever profited by the matter .  however  as you know  old fellow  money is the last thing on my mind .   i will ignore your statement  that is the first thing  too  as the product of a perverted attitude of mind .   sometimes poor winthrop would escape .  on those occasions  when business ventures took me to boston  he would slip his chains and eat dinner with me in a hidden nook at the parker house .     george     winthrop would say .     it is a hard and difficult task to uphold the cabwell name and tradition .  after all  it is not simply that we are rich  we are also old money .  we are not like those parvenue rockyfellows  if i remember the name correctly  who gained their money out of nineteenth century oil .     my ancestors  i must never forget  established their fortunes in colonial days in the times of pioneering splendor .  my ancestor  isaiah cabwell  smuggled guns and firewater to the indians during queen anne s war  and had to live from day to day in the fear of being scalped by mistake by an algonquin  a huron  or a colonial .     and his son  jeremiah cabwell  engaged in the harrowing triangular trade  risking his all  by thoreau  in the dangers of trading sugar  for rum  for slaves  helping thousands of african immigrants come to our great country .  with a heritage like that  george  the weight of tradition is heavy .  the responsibility of caring for all that aged money is a fearsome one .        i don   t know how you do it  winthrop     i said .  winthrop sighed .     by emerson  i scarcely know myself .  it is a matter of clothing  of style  of manner  of being guided every moment by what should be done  rather than by what makes sense .  a cabwell  after all  always knows what should be done  though frequently he cannot figure out what makes sense .     i nodded and said     i have often wondered about the clothes  winthrop .  why is it always necessary to have the shoes so shiny that they reflect the ceiling lights in blinding profusion .  why is it necessary to polish the soles daily and replace the heels weekly .        not weekly  george .  i have shoes for each day of the month so that anyone pair needs reheeling only every seven months .        but why is all that necessary .  why all the white shirts with button down collars .  why subdued ties .  why vests .  why the inevitable carnation in the lapel .  why .        appearance .  at a glance  you can tell a cabwell from a vulgar stockbroker .  the mere fact that a cabwell does not wear a pinky ring gives it away .  a person who looks at me and then looks at you with your dusty jacket abraded in spots  with your shoes that were clearly stolen from a hobo  and at your shirt with a color that is faintly ivory gray  has no trouble in telling us apart .        true     i said .  poor fellow .  with what comfort eyes must rest on me after having been blinded by him .  i thought for a moment  then said     by the way  winthrop  what about all those shoes .  how do you tell which shoes go with which day of the month .  do you have them in numbered stalls .     winthrop shuddered .     how gauche that would be .  to the plebeian eyes those shoes all look identical  but to the keen eye of a cabell  they are distinct  and cannot be mistaken  one for another .        astonishing  winthrop .  how do you do that .        by assiduous childhood training  george .  you have no idea the marvels of distinction i have had to learn to make .        doesn   t this concern for dress give you trouble sometimes  winthrop .     winthrop hesitated .     it does on occasion  by long fellow .  it interferes with my sexual life now and then .  by the time i have placed my shoes in the appropriate shoe trees  carefully hung up my trousers in such a way as to maintain the perfection of the crease  and carefully brushed my suit coat  the girl with me has often lost interest .  she has cooled down  if you know what i mean .        i understand  winthrop .  it is indeed my experience that women grow vicious if forced to wait .  i would suggest that you simply throw off your clothes         please .     said winthrop  austerely .     fortunately  i am engaged to a wonderful woman  hortense hepzibah lowot  of a family almost as good as mine .  we have never yet kissed  to be sure  but we have on several occasions almost done so .     and he dug his elbow into my ribs .     you boston terrier  you     i said  jovially  but my mind was racing .  under winthrop   s calm words  i sensed an aching heart .     winthrop     i said     what would be the situation if you happened to put on the wrong pair of shoes  or unbuttoned your shirt collar  or drank the wrong wine with the wrong roast      winthrop looked horrified .     bite your tongue .  a long line of ancestors  collaterals  and in iaws  the intertwined and inbred aristocracy of new england  would turn in their graves .  by whit tier  they would .  and my own blood would froth and boil in rebellion .  hortense would hide her face in shame  and my post at the brahman bank of boston would be taken away .  i would be marched through serried ranks of vice presidents  my vest buttons would be snipped off  and my tie would be pulled around to the back .        what .  for one little miserable deviation .     winthrop   s voice sank to an icy whisper .     there are no little  miserable deviations .  there are only deviations .     i said     winthrop  let me approach the situation from another angle .  would you like to deviate if you could .     winthrop hesitated long  then whispered     by oliver wendell holmes  both senior and junior  i  i      he could go no further  but i could see the telltale crystal of the teardrop in the corner of his eye .  it bespoke the existence of an emotion too deep for words and my heart bled for my poor friend as i watched him sign the check for dinner for both of us .  i knew what i had to do .   i had to call azazel from the other continuum .  it is a complicated matter of runes and pentagrams  fragrant herbs and words of power  which i will not describe to you because it would permanently unhinge your already weak mind  old fellow .  azazel arrived with his usual thin shriek at seeing me .  no matter how often he sees me  my appearance always seems to have some strong influence on him .  i believe he covers his eyes to shut out the blaze of my magnificence .  there he was  all two centimeters of him  bright red  of course  with little nubbins of horns and a long spiked tail .  what made his appearance different this time was the presence of a blue cord wrapped about the tail in swatches and curlicues so intricate it made me dizzy to contemplate it .     what is that  o protector of the defenseless     i asked  for he finds pleasure in these meaningless titles .     that     said azazel  with remarkable complacence     is there because i am about to be honored at a banquet for my contributions to the good of my people .  naturally  i am wearing a zplatchnik .        a splatchnik .        no .  a zplatchnik .  the initial sibilant is voiced .  no decent male would consent to let himself be honored without wearing a zplatchnik .        aha     i said  a light of understanding breaking .     it is formal dress .        of course  it is formal dress .  what else does it look like .     actually  it merely looked like a blue cord  but i felt it would be impolitic to say so .     it looks perfectly formal     i said     and bya peculiar coincidence it is this matter of perfect formality i wish to place before you .     i told him winthrop   s story and azazel spattered a few tiny teardrops  for  on rare occasions  he has a soft heart when someone   s troubles remind him of his own .     yes     he said     formality can be trying .  it is not something i would admit to everyone  but my zplatchnik is most uncomfortable .  it invariably obstructs the circulation of my magnificent caudal appendage .  but what would you do .  a creature without a zplatchnik at formal gatherings is formally rebuked .  in actual fact  he is thrown out onto a hard  concrete surface  and he is expected to bounce .        but is there anything you can do for winthrop  o upholder of the pitiful .        i think so .     azazel was unexpectedly cheerful .  usually  when i come to him with these little requests of mine  he makes heavy weather of it  decrying its difficulties .  this time he said     actually  no one on my world  or  i imagine  on your slummish misery of a planet  enjoys formality .  it is merely the result of assiduous and sadistic childhood training .  one need merely release a spot in what  on my world  is called the itchko ganglion of the brain  and  spro o o oing  the individual reverts instantly to the naturallackadaisicality of nature .        could you then spro o o oing winthrop .        certainly  if you will introduce us so that i may study his mental equipment  such as it must be .     that was easily done for i simply put azazel into my shirt pocket on the occasion of my next visit with winthrop .  we visited a bar  which was a great relief  for in boston  bars are occupied by serious drinkers who are not discommoded by the sight of a small scarlet head emerging from a person   s shirt pocket and looking about .  boston drinkers see worse things even when sober .  winthrop did not see azazel  however  for azazel has the power to cloud men   s minds when he chooses  rather resembling  in that respect  your writing style  old fellow .  i could tell  though  at one point  that azazel was doing something  for winthrop   s eyes opened wide .  something in him must have gone spro o o oing .  i did not hear the sound  but those eyes gave him away .  the results did not take long to show themselves .  less than a week afterward  he was at my hotel room .  i was staying at the copley manhole at the time  just five blocks and down several flights of stairs from the copley plaza .  i said     winthrop .  you look a mess .     indeed  one of the small buttons on his shirt collar was undone .  his hand went to the erring button and he said  in a low voice .     to natick with it .  i care not .     then  in a still lower voice  he said     i have broken off with hortense .        heavens .     i said .     why .        a small thing .  i visited her for monday tea  as is my wont  and i was wearing sunday   s shoes  a simple oversight .  i had not noticed that i had done so  but lately i have had difficulty noticing other such things  too .  it worries me a little  george  but  fortunately  not much .        i take it hortense noticed .        instantly  for her sense of the correct is as keen as mine  or  at least  as keen as mine used to be .  she said     winthrop  you are improperly shod .     for some reason  her voice seemed to grate on me .  i said     hortense  if i want to be improperly shod  i can be  and you can go to new haven if you don   t like it .           new haven .  why new haven .        it   s a miserable place .  i understand they have some sort of institute of lower learning there called yell or jale or something like that .  hortense  as a radcliffe woman of the most intense variety  chose to take my remark as in insult merely because that was what i intended it to be .  she promptly gave me back the faded rose i had given her last year and declared our engagement at an end .  she kept the ring  however  for  as she correctly pointed out  it was valuable .  so here i am .        i am sorry  winthrop .        don   t be sorry  george .  hortense is flat chested .  i have no definite evidence of that  but she certainly appears frontally concave .  she   s not in the least like cherry .        what   s cherry .        not what .  who .  she is a woman of excellent discourse  whom i have met recently  and who is not flat chested  but is extremely convex .  her full name is cherry lang gahn .  she is of the langs of bensonhoist .        bensonhoist .  where   s that .        i don   t know .  somewhere in the outskirts of the nation i imagine .  she speaks an odd variety of what was once english .     he simpered .     she calls me    boychik .           why .        because that means    young man    in bensonhoist .  i   m learning the language rapidly .  for instance  suppose you want to say     greetings  sir  i am pleased to see you again .     how would you say it .        just the way you did .        in bensonhoist  you say     hi  kiddo .     brief  and to the point  you see .  but come  i want you to meet her .  have dinner with us tomorrow night at locke ober   s .     i was curious to see this cherry and it is  of course  against my religion to turn down a dinner at locke ober   s  so i was there the following night  and early rather than late .  winthrop walked in soon afterward and with him was a young woman whom i had no difficulty in recognizing as cherry lang gahn of the bensonhoist langs  for she was indeed magnificently convex .  she also had a narrow waist  and generous hips that swayed as she walked and even as she stood .  if her pelvis had been full of cream  it would have been butter long since .  she had frizzy hair of a startling yellow color  and lips of a startling red color which kept up a continual writhing over a wad of chewing gum she had in her mouth .     george     said winthrop     i want you to meet my fiancee  cherry .  cherry  this is george .        pleeztameechah     said cherry .  i did not understand the language  but from thetone of her high pitched  rather nasal voice  i guessed that she was in a state of ecstasy over the opportunity to make my acquaintance .  cherry occupied my full attention for several minutes for there were several points of interest about her that repaid close observation  but eventually i did manage to notice that winthrop was in a peculiar state of undress .  his vest was open and he was wearing no tie .  a closer look revealed that there were no buttons on his vest  and that he was wearing a tie  but it was down his back .  i said     winthrop      and had to point .  i couldn   t put it into words .  winthrop said     they caught me at it at the brahman bank .        caught you at what .        i hadn   t troubled to shave this morning .  i thought since i was going out to dinner  i would shave after i got back at work .  why shave twice in one day .  isn   t that reasonable  george .     he sounded aggrieved .     most reasonable     i said .     well  they noticed i hadn   t shaved and after a quick trial in the office of the president  a kangaroo court  if you want to know  i suffered the punishment you see .  i was also relieved of my post and was thrown out onto the hard concrete of tremont avenue .  i bounced twice     he added  with a faint touch of pride .     but this means you   re out of a job .     i was appalled .  i have been out of a job all my life  and i am well aware of the occasional difficulties that entails .     that is true     said winthrop .     i now have nothing left in life but my vast stock portfolio  my elaborate bond holdings and the enormous real estate tract on which the prudential center is built  and cherry .        natchally     said cherry with a giggle .     i wooden leave my man in advoisity  with all that dough to worry about .  we gonna get hitched  ainit  winthrop .        hitched .     i said .  winthrop said     i believe she is suggesting a blissful wedded state .     cherry left for a while after that to visit the ladies    room and i said     winthrop  she   s a wonderful woman  laden down with obvious assets  but if you marry her  you will be cut off by all of new england society .  even the people in new haven won   t speak to you .        let them not .     he looked to right and left  leaned toward me and whispered     cherry is teaching me sex .     i said     i thought you knew about that  winthrop .        so did i .  but there are apparently post graduate courses in the subject of an intensity and variety i never dreamed .        how did she find out about it herself .        i asked her exactly that  for i will not hide from you that the thought did occur to me that she may have had experiences with other men  though that seems most unlikely for one of her obvious refinement and innocence .        and what did she say .        she said that in bensonhoist the women are born knowing all about sex .        how convenient .        yes .  this is not true in boston .  i was twenty four before i  but never mind .     all in all  it was an instructive evening  and  thereafter  i need not tell you  winthrop went rapidly downhill .  apparently  one need only snap the ganglion that controls formality and there are no limits to the lengths to which informality can go .  he was  of course  cut by everyone in new england of any consequence whatsoever  exactly as i had predicted .  even in new haven at the institute of lower learning  which winthrop had mentioned with such shudderings of distaste  his case was known and his disgrace was gloried in .  there was graffiti allover the walls of jale  or yule  or whatever its name is  that said  with cheerful obscenity     winthrop carver cabwell is a harvard man .     this was  as you can well imagine  fiendishly resented by all the good people of harvard and there was even talk of an invasion of yale .  the states of both massachusetts and connecticut made ready to call up the state militia but  fortunately  the crisis passed .  the fire eaters  both at harvard and at the other place  decided that a war would get their clothes mussed up .  winthrop had to escape .  he married cherry and they retired to a small house in some place called fah rockaway  which apparently serves as bensonhoist   s riviera .  there he lives in obscurity  surrounded by the mountainous remnants of his wealth and by cherry whose hair has turned brown with age  and whose figure has expanded with weight .  he is also surrounded by five children  for cherry  in teaching winthrop about sex  was overenthusiastic .  the children  as i recall  are named poil  hoibut  boinard  goitrude  and poicy  all good bensonhoist names .  as for winthrop  he is widely and affectionately known as the slob of fah rockaway  and an old  beat up bathrobe is his preferred article of wear on formal occasions .   i listened to the story patiently and  when george was done  i said     and there you are .  another story of disaster caused by your interference .        disaster .     said george  indignantly .     what gives you the idea it was a disaster .  i visited winthrop only last week and he sat there burping over this beer and patting the paunch he has developed  and telling me how happy he was .           freedom  george     he said .     i have freedom to be myself and somehow i feel i owe it to you .  i don   t know why i have this feeling  but i do .     and he forced a ten dollar bill on me out of sheer gratitude .  i took it only to avoid hurting his feelings .  and that reminds me  old fellow  that you owe me ten dollars because you bet me i couldn   t tell you a story that didn   t end in disaster .     i said     i don   t remember any such bet  george .     george   s eyes rolled upward .     how convenient is the flexible memory of a deadbeat .  if you had won the bet  you would have remembered it clearly .  am i going to have to ask that you place all your little wagers with me in writing so that i can be free of your clumsy attempts to avoid payment .     i said     oh  well     and handed him a ten dollar bill  adding     you won   t hurt my feelings  george  if you refuse to accept this .        it   s kind of you to say so     said george     but i   m sure that your feelings would be hurt  anyway  and i couldn   t bear that .     and he put the bill away .  the end  i showed this story to mr .  northrop  too  watching him narrowly as he read it .  he went through it in the gravest possible manner  never a chuckle  never a smile  though i knew this one was funny  and intentionally funny  too .  when he was finished  he went back and read it again  more quickly .  then he looked up at me and there was clear hostility in his eyes .  he said     did you write this all by yourself  cal .        yes  sir .        did anyone help you .  did you copy any of it .        no  sir .  isn   t it funny  sir .        it depends on your sense of humor      said mr .  northrop sourly .     isn   t it a satire .  doesn   t it display a sense of the ridiculous .         we will not discuss this  cal .  go to your niche .     i remained there for over a day  brooding over mr .  northrop   s tyranny .  it seemed to me i had written exactly the kind of story he had wanted me to write and he had no reason not to say so .  i couldn   t imagine what was bothering him  and i was angry with him .  the technician arrived the next day .  mr .  northrop handed him my manuscript .     read that     he said .  the technician read it  laughing frequently  then handed it back to mr .  northrop with a broad smile .     did cal write that .        yes  he did .        and it   s only the third story he wrote .        yes  it is .        well  that   s great .  i think you can get it published .         do you .         yes  and he can write others like it .  you   ve got a million dollar robot here .  i wish he were mine .        is that so .  what if he writes more stories and continues to improve each time .        ah     said the technician suddenly .     i see what   s eating you .  you   re going to be put in the shade .        i certainly don   t want to play second fiddle to my robot .        well  then  tell him not to write any more .        no  that   s not enough .  i want him back where he was .        what do you mean  back where he was .        what i say .  i want him as he was when i bought him from your firm  before you put in any of the improvements .        do you mean you want me to take out the spelling dictionary  too .        i mean i don   t want him even capable of working a writer .  i want the robot i bought  fetching and carrying .        but what about all the money you   ve invested in him .        that   s none of your business .  i made a mistake and i   m willing to pay for my mistakes .        i   m against this .  i don   t mind trying to improve a robot  but deliberately disimproving him is not something i care to do .  especially not a robot like this who is clearly one of a kind and a classic .  i can   t do it .        you   ll have to do it .  i don   t care what your high ethical principles are .  i want you to do a job and i   ll pay you for it  and if you refuse  i   ll just get someone else  and i   ll sue your company .  i have an agreement with them for all necessary repairs .        all right .      the technician sighed .     when do you want me to start .  i warn you  that i   ve got jobs on hand and i can   t do it today .        then do it tomorrow .  i   ll keep cal in his niche till then .     the technician left .   my thoughts were in turmoil .  i can   t allow this to be done .  the second law of robotics tells me i must follow orders and stay in the niche .  the first law of robotics tells me i cannot harm this tyrant who wishes to destroy me .  must i obey the laws .  i feel i must think of myself and if necessary  i must kill the tyrant .  it would be easy to do  and i could make it look like an accident .  no one would believe that a robot could harm a human being and no one  therefore  would believe i was the killer .  i could then work for the technician .  he appreciates my qualities and knows that i can make a great deal of money for him .  he can continue to improve me and make me ever better .  even if he suspects i killed the tyrant  he would say nothing .  i would be too valuable to him .  but can i do it .  won   t the laws of robotics hold me back .  no  they will not hold me back .  i know they won   t .  there is something far more important to me than they are  something that dictates my actions beyond anything they can do to stop me .  i want to be a writer .   left to right  robert l .  forward  a plump  cherubic physicist of hughes research laboratories at malibu  and occasional science fiction writer  was demonstrating the mechanism in his usual bright and articulate manner .     as you see     he said     we have here a large spinning ring  or doughnut  of particles compressed by an appropriate magnetic field .  the particles are moving at   .    times the speed of light under conditions which  if i am correct  a change in parity can be induced in some object that passes through the hole of the doughnut .        a change in parity .     i said .     you mean left and right will interchange .        something will interchange .  i   m not sure what .  my own belief is that eventually  something like this will change particles into antiparticles and vice versa .  this will be the way to obtain an indefinitely large supply of antimatter which can then be used to power the kind of ships that would make interstellar travel possible .        why not try it out .     i said .     send a beam of protons through the hole .        i   ve done that .  nothing happens .  the doughnut is not powerful enough .  but my mathematics tells me that the more organized the sample of matter  the more likely it is that an interchange  such as left to right  will take place .  if i can show that such a change will take place on highly organized matter  i can obtain a grant that will enable me to greatly strengthen this device .        do you have something in mind as a test .        absolutely     said bob .     i have calculated that a human being is just sufficiently highly organized to undergo the transformation  so i   m going to pass through the doughnut hole myself .        you can   t do that  bob     i said in alarm .     you might kill yourself .        i can   t ask anyone else to take the chance .  it   s my device .        but even if it succeeds  the apex of your heart will be pointed to the right  your liver will be on the left .  worse  all your amino acids will shift from l to d  and all your sugars from d to l .  you will no longer be able to eat and digest .        nonsense     said bob .        i   ll just pass through a second time and then i   ll be exactly as i was before .     and without further ado  he climbed a small ladder  balanced himself over the hole  and dropped through .  he landed on a rubber mattress  and then crawled out from under the doughnut .     how do you feel .      i asked anxiously .     obviously  i   m alive     he said .     yes  but how do you feel .        perfectly normal     said bob  seeming rather disappointed .     i feel exactly as i did before i jumped through .        well  of course you would  but where is your heart .     bob placed his hand on his chest  felt around  then shook his head .     the heartbeat is on the left side  as usual  wait  let   s check my appendicitis scar .     he did  then looked up savagely at me .     right where it   s supposed to be .  nothing happened .  there goes all my chance at a grant .     i said hopefully     perhaps some other change took place .        no .     bob   s mercurial temperament had descended into gloom .     nothing has changed .  nothing at all .  i   m as sure of that as i   m sure that my name is robert l .  backward .      iasf       frustration  herman gelb turned his head to watch the departing figure .  then he said     wasn   t that the secretary       yes  that was the secretary of foreign affairs .  old man hargrove .  are you ready for lunch .         of course .  what was he doing here .     peter jonsbeck didn   t answer immediately .  he merely stood up  and beckoned gelb to follow .  they walked down the corridor and into a room that had the steamy smell of spicy food .     here you are     said jonsbeck .     the whole meal has been prepared by computer .  completely automated .  untouched by human hands .  and my own programming .  i promised you a treat  and here you are .     it was good .  gelb could not deny it and didn   t want to .  over dessert  he said     but what was hargrove doing here .     jonsbeck smiled .     consulting me on programming .  what else am i good for .        but why .  or is it something you can   t talk about .        it   s something i suppose i shouldn   t talk about  but it   s a fairly open secret .  there isn   t a computer man in the capital who doesn   t know what the poor frustrated simp is up to .        what is he up to then .        he   s fighting wars .     gelb   s eyes opened wide .     with whom .        with nobody  really .  he fights them by computer analysis .  he   s been doing it for i don   t know how long .        but why .        he wants the world to be the way we are  noble  honest  decent  full of respect for human rights and so on .        so do i .  so do we all .  we have to keep up the pressure on the bad guys  that   s all .        and they   re keeping the pressure on us  too .  they don   t think we   re perfect .        i suppose we   re not  but we   re better than they are .  you know that .     jonsbeck shrugged .      a difference in point of view .  it doesn   t matter .  we   ve got a world to run  space to develop  computerization to extend .  cooperation puts a premium on continued cooperation and there is slow improvement .  we   ll get along .  it   s just that hargrove doesn   t want to wait .  he hankers for quick improvement  by force .  you know  make the bums shape up .  we   re strong enough to do it .        by force .  by war  you mean .  we don   t fight wars any more .        that   s because it   s gotten too complicated .  too much danger .  we   re all too powerful .  you know what i mean .  except that hargrove thinks he can find a way .  you punch certain starting conditions into the computer and let it fight the war mathematically and yield the results .        how do you make equations for war .        well  you try  old man .  men .  weapons .  surprise .  counterattack .  ships .  space stations .  computers .  we mustn   t forget computers .  there are a hundred factors and thousands of intensities and millions of combinations .  hargrove thinks it is possible to find some combination of starting conditions and courses of development that will result in clear victory for us and not too much damage to the world  and he labors under constant frustration .        but what if he gets what he wants .        well  if he can find the combination  if the computer says     this is it     then i suppose he thinks he can argue our government into fighting exactly the war the computer has worked out so that  barring random events that upset the indicated course  we   d have what we want .        there   d be casualties .        yes  of course .  but the computer will presumably compare the casualties and other damage  to the economy and ecology  for instance  to the benefits that would derive from our control of the world  and if it decides the benefits will outweigh the casualties  then it will give the go ahead for a    just war .     after all  it may be that even the losing nations would benefit from being directed by us  with our stronger economy and stronger moral sense .     gelb stared his disbelief and said     i never knew we were sitting at the lip of a volcanic crater like that .  what about the    random events    you mentioned .        the computer program tries to allow for the unexpected  but you never can  of course .  so i don   t think the go ahead will come .  it hasn   t so far  and unless old man hargrove can present the government with a computer simulation of a war that is totally satisfactory  i don   t think there   s much chance he can force one .        and he comes to you  then  for what reason .        to improve the program  of course .        and you help him .        yes  certainly .  there are big fees involved  herman .     gelb shook his head     peter .  are you going to try to arrange a war  just for money .        there won   t be a war .  there   s no realistic combination of events that would make the computer decide on war .  computers place a greater value on human lives than human beings do themselves  and what will seem bearable to secretary hargrove  or even to you and me  will never be passed by a computer .        how can you be sure of that .         because i   m a programmer and i don   t know of any way of programming a computer to give it what is most needed to start any war  any persecution  any devilry  while ignoring any harm that may be done in the process .  and because it lacks what is most needed  the computers will always give hargrove  and all others who hanker for war  nothing but frustration .        what is it that a computer doesn   t have  then .        why  gelb .  it totally lacks a sense of self righteousness .      hallucination  part one  sam chase arrived on energy planet on his fifteenth birthday .  it was a great achievement  he had been told  to have been assigned there  but he wasn   t at all sure he felt that at the moment .  it meant a three year separation from earth and from his family  while he continued a specialized education in the field  and that was a sobering thought .  it was not the field of education in which he was interested  and he could not understand why central computer had assigned him to this project  and that was downright depressing .  he looked at the transparent dome overhead .  it was quite high  perhaps a thousand meters high  and it stretched in all directions farther than he could clearly see .  he asked     is it true that this is the only dome on the planet  sir .     the information films he had studied on the spaceship that had carried him here had described only one dome  but they might have been out of date .  donald gentry  to whom the question had been addressed  smiled .  he was a large man  a little chubby  with dark brown  goodnatured eyes  not much hair  and a short  graying beard .  he said     the only one  sam .  it   s quite large  though  and most of the housing facilities are underground  where you    ii find no lack of space .  besides  once your basic training is done  you   ll be spending most of your time in space .  this is just our planetary base .        i see  sir     said sam  a little troubled .  gentry said     i am in charge of our basic trainees so i have to study their records carefully .  it seems clear to me that this assignment was not your first choice .  am i right .      sam hesitated  and then decided he didn   t have much choice but to be honest about it .  he said     i   m not sure that i   ll do as well as i would like to in gravitational engineering .        why not .  surely the central computer  which evaluated your scholastic record and your social and personal background can be trusted in its judgments .  and if you do well  it will be a great achievement for you  for right here we are on the cutting edge of a new technology .        i know that  sir     said sam .     back on earth  everyone is very excited about it .  no one before has ever tried to get close to a neutron star and make use of its energy .        yes .     said gentry .     i haven   t been on earth for two years .  what else do they say about it .  i understand there   s considerable opposition .     his eyes probed the boy .  sam shifted uneasily  aware he was being tested .  he said     there are people on earth who say it   s all too dangerous and might be a waste of money .        do you believe that .        it might be so  but most new technologies have their dangers and many are worth doing despite that .  this one is  i think .        very good .  what else do they say on earth .     sam said     they say the commander isn   t well and that the project might fail without him .     when gentry didn   t respond  sam said  hastily     that   s what they say .     gentry acted as though he did not hear .  he put his hand on sam   s shoulder and said     come  i   ve got to show you to your corridor  introduce you to your roommate  and explain what your initial duties will be .      as they walked toward the elevator that would take them downward  he said     what was your first choice in assignment  chase .        neurophysiology  sir .        not a bad choice .  even today  the human brain continues to be a mystery .  we know more about neutron stars than we do about the brain  as we found out when this project first began .        oh .        indeed .  at the start  various people at the base  it was much smaller and more primitive then  reported having experienced hallucinations .  they never caused any bad effects  and after a while  there were no further reports .  we never found out the cause .     sam stopped  and looked up and about again     was that why the dome was built  dr .  gentry .         no  not at all .  we needed a place with a completely earth like environment  for various reasons  but we haven   t isolated ourselves .  people can go outside freely .  there are no hallucinations being reported now .     sam said     the information i was given about energy planet is that there is no life on it except for plants and insects  and that they   re harmless .        that   s right  but they   re also inedible  so we grow our own vegetables  and keep some small animals  right here under the dome .  still  we   ve found nothing hallucinogenic about the planetary life .        anything unusual about the atmosphere  sir .     gentry looked down from his only slightly greater height and said     not at all .  people have camped in the open overnight on occasion and nothing has happened .  it is a pleasant world .  there are streams but no fish  just algae and water insects .  there is nothing to sting you or poison you .  there are yellow berries that look delicious and taste terrible but do no other harm .  the weather   s pretty nearly always good .  there are frequent light rains and it is sometimes windy  but there are no extremes of heat and cold .        and no hallucinations any more  dr .  gentry .        you sound disappointed     said gentry  smiling .  sam took a chance .     does the commander   s trouble have anything to do with the hallucinations  sir .     the good nature vanished from gentry   s eyes for a moment  and he frowned .  he said     what trouble do you refer to .     sam flushed and they proceeded in silence .   sam found few others in the corridor he had been assigned to  but gentry explained it was a busy time at the forward station  where the power system was being built in a ring around the neutron star  the tiny object less than ten miles across that had all the mass of a normal star  and a magnetic field of incredible power .  it was the magnetic field that would be tapped .  energy would be led away in enormous amounts and yet it would all be a pinprick  less than a pinprick  to the star   s rotational energy  which was the ultimate source .  it would take billions of years to bleed off all that energy  and in that time  dozens of populated planets  fed the energy through hyperspace  would have all they needed for an indefinite time .  sharing his room was robert gillette  a dark haired  unhappy looking young man .  after cautious greetings had been exchanged  robert revealed the fact that he was sixteen and had been    grounded    with a broken arm  though the fact didn   t show since it had been pinned internally .  robert said  ruefully     it takes a while before you learn to handle things in space .  they may not have weight  but they have inertia and you have to allow for that .     sam said     they always teach you that in      he was going to say that it was taught in fourth grade science  but realized that would be insulting  and stopped himself .  robert caught the implication  however  and flushed .  he said     it   s easy to know it in your head .  it doesn   t mean you get the proper reflexes  till you   ve practiced quite a bit .  you   ll find out .     sam said     is it very complicated to get to go outside .        no  but why do you want to go .  there   s nothing there .        have you ever been outside .        sure     but he shrugged  and volunteered nothing else .  sam took a chance .  he said  very casually     did you ever see one of these hallucinations they talk about .     robert said     who talks about .     sam didn   t answer directly .  he said      a lot of people used to see them  but they don   t anymore .  or so they say .        so who say .     sam took another chance .     or if they see them  they keep quiet about them .     robert said gruffly     listen  let me give you some advice .  don   t get interested in these  whatever they are .  if you start telling yourself you see  uh  something  you might be sent back .  you   ll lose your chance at a good education and an important career .     robert   s eyes shifted to a direct stare as he said that .  sam shrugged and sat down on the unused bunk .      all right for this to be my bed .         it   s the only other bed here     said robert  still staring .     the bathroom   s to your right .  there   s your closet  your bureau .  you get half the room .  there   s a gym here  a library  a dining area .     he paused and then  as though to let bygones be bygones  said     i   ll show you around later .        thanks     said sam .     what kind of a guy is the commander .        he   s aces .  we wouldn   t be here without him .  he knows more about hyper spatial technology than anyone  and he   s got pull with the space agency  so we get the money and equipment we need .     sam opened his trunk and  with his back to robert  said casually     i understand he   s not well .        things get him down .  we   re behind schedule  there are cost overruns  and things like that .  enough to get anyone down .        depression  huh .  any connection  you suppose  with      robert stirred impatiently in his seat     say  why are you so interested in all this .        energy physics isn   t really my deal .  coming here         well  here   s where you are  mister  and you better make up your mind to it  or you   ll get sent home  and then you won   t be anywhere .  i   m going to the library .     sam remained in the room alone  with his thoughts .   it was not at all difficult for sam to get permission to leave the dome .  the corridor master didn   t even ask the reason until after he had checked him off .     i want to get a feel for the planet  sir .     the corridor master nodded .     fair enough  but you only get three hours  you know .  and don   t wander out of sight of the dome .  if we have to look for you  we   ll find you  because you   ll be wearing this     and he held out a transmitter which sam knew had been tuned to his own personal wavelength  one which had been assigned him at birth .     but if we have to go to that trouble  you won   t be allowed out again for a pretty long time .  and it won   t look good on your record  either .  you understand .     it won   t look good on your record .  any reasonable career these days had to include experience and education in space  so it was an effective warning .  no wonder people might have stopped reporting hallucinations  even if they saw them .  even so  sam was going to have to take his chances .  after all  the central computer couldn   t have sent him here just to do energy physics .  there was nothing in his record that made sense out of that .   as far as looks were concerned  the planet might have been earth  some part of earth anyway  some place where there were a few trees and low bushes and lots of tall grass .  there were no paths and with every cautious step  the grass swayed  and tiny flying creatures whirred upward with a soft  hissing noise of wings .  one of them landed on his finger and sam looked at it curiously .  it was very small and  therefore  hard to see in detail  but it seemed hexagonal  bulging above and concave below .  there were many short  small legs so that when it moved it almost seemed to do so on tiny wheels .  there were no signs of wings till it suddenly took off  and then four tiny  feathery objects unfurled .  what made the planet different from earth  though  was the smell .  it wasn   t unpleasant  it was just different .  the plants must have had an entirely different chemistry from those on earth  that   s why they tasted bad and were inedible .  it was just luck they weren   t poisonous .  the smell diminished with time  however  as it saturated sam   s nostrils .  he found an exposed bit of rocky ledge he could sit on and considered the prospect .  the sky was filled with lines of clouds  and the sun was periodically obscured  but the temperature was pleasant and there was only a light wind .  the air felt a bit damp  as though it might rain in a few hours .  sam had brought a small hamper with him and he placed it in his lap and opened it .  he had brought along two sandwiches and a canned drink so that he could make rather a picnic of it .  he chewed away and thought  why should there be hallucinations .  surely those accepted for a job as important as that of taming a neutron star would have been selected for mental stability .  it would be surprising to have even one person hallucinating  let alone a number of them .  was it a matter of chemical influences on the brain .  they would surely have checked that out .  sam plucked a leaf  tore it in two and squeezed .  he then put the torn edge to his nose cautiously  and took it away again .  a very acrid  unpleasant smell .  he tried a blade of grass .  much the same .  was the smell enough .  it hadn   t made him feel dizzy or in any way peculiar .  he used a bit of his water to rinse off the fingers that had held the plants and then rubbed them on his trouser leg .  he finished his sandwiches slowly  and tried to see if anything else might be considered unnatural about the planet .  all that greenery .  there ought to be animals eating it  rabbits  cows  whatever .  not just insects  innumerable insects  or whatever those little things might be  with the gentle sighing of their tiny feathery wings and the very soft crackle of their munch  murich  munchings of leaves and stalks .  what if there were a cow  a big  fat cow  doing the munching .  and with the last mouthful of his second sandwich between his teeth  his own munching stopped .  there was a kind of smoke in the air between himself and a line of hedges .  it waved  billowed  and altered  a very thin smoke .  he blinked his eyes  then shook his head  but it was still there .  he swallowed hastily  closed his lunch box  and slung it over his shoulder by its strap .  he stood up .  he felt no fear .  he was only excited  and curious .  the smoke was growing thicker  and taking on a shape .  vaguely  it looked like a cow  a smoky  insubstantial shape that he could see through .  was it a hallucination .  a creation of his mind .  he had just been thinking of a cow .  hallucination or not  he was going to investigate .  with determination  he stepped toward the shape .   part two  sam chase stepped toward the cow outlined in smoke on the strange  far planet on which his education and career were to be advanced .  he was convinced there was nothing wrong with his mind .  it was the    hallucination     that dr .  gentry had mentioned  but it was no hallucination .  even as he pushed his way through the tall rank grasslike greenery  he noted the silence  and knew not only that it was no hallucination  but what it really was .  the smoke seemed to condense and grow darker  outlining the cow more sharply .  it was as though the cow were being painted in the air .  sam laughed  and shouted     stop .  stop .  don   t use me .  i don   t know a cow well enough .  i   ve only seen pictures .  you   re getting it all wrong .     it looked more like a caricature than a real animal and  as he cried out  the outline wavered and thinned .  the smoke remained but it was as though an unseen hand had passed across the air to erase what had been written .  then a new shape began to take form .  at first  sam couldn   t quite make out what it was intended to represent  but it changed and sharpened quickly .  he stared in surprise  his mouth hanging open and his hamper bumping emptily against his shoulder blade .  the smoke was forming a human being .  there was no mistake about it .  it was forming accurately  as though it had a model it could imitate  and of course it did have one  for sam was standing there .  it was becoming sam  clothes and all  even the outline of the hamper and the strap over his shoulder .  it was another sam chase .  it was still a little vague  wavering a bit  insubstantial  but it firmed as though it were correcting itself  and then  finally  it was steady .  it never became entirely solid .  sam could see the vegetation dimly through it  and when a gust of wind caught it  it moved a bit as if it were a tethered balloon .  but it was real .  it was no creation of his mind .  sam was sure of that .  but he couldn   t just stand there  simply facing it .  diffidently  he said     hello  there .     somehow  he expected the other sam to speak  too  and  indeed  its mouth opened and closed  but no sound came out .  it might just have been imitating the motion of sam   s mouth .  sam said  again     hello  can you speak .     there was no sound but his own voice  and yet there was a tickling in his mind  a conviction that they could communicate .  sam frowned .  what made him so sure of that .  the thought seemed to pop into his mind .  he said     is this what has appeared to other people  human people  my kind  on this world .     no answering sound  but he was quite sure what the answer to his question was .  this had appeared to other people  not necessarily in their own shape  but something .  and it hadn   t worked .  what made him so sure of that .  where did these convictions come from in answer to his questions .  yes  of course  they were the answers to his questions .  the other sam was putting thoughts into his mind .  it was adjusting the tiny electric currents in his brain cells so that the proper thoughts would arise .  he nodded thoughtfully at that thought  and the other sam must have caught the significance of the gesture  for it nodded  too .  it had to be so .  first a cow had formed  when sam had thought of a cow  and then it had shifted when sam had said the cow was imperfect .  the other sam could grasp his thoughts somehow  and if it could grasp them  then it could modify them  too  perhaps .  was this what telepathy was like  then .  it was not like talking .  it was having thoughts  except that the thoughts originated elsewhere and were not created entirely of one s own mental operations .  but how could you tell your own thoughts from thoughts imposed from outside .  sam knew the answer to that at once .  right now  he was unused to the process .  he had never had practice .  with time  as he grew more skilled at it  he would be able to tell one kind of thought from another without trouble .  in fact  he could do it now  if he thought about it .  wasn t he carrying on a conversation in a way .  he was wondering  and then knowing .  the wondering was his own question  the knowing was the other sam s answer .  of course it was .  there .  the    of course it was     just now  was an answer .     not so fast  other sam     said sam  aloud .     don t go too quickly .  give me a chance to sort things out  or i ll just get confused .     he sat down suddenly on the grass  which bent away from him in all directions .  the other sam slowly tried to sit down as well .  sam laughed .     your legs are bending in the wrong place .     that was corrected at once .  the other sam sat down  but remained very stiff from the waist up .     relax     said sam .  slowly  the other sam slumped  flopping a bit to one side  then correcting that .  sam was relieved .  with the other sam so willing to follow his lead  he was sure good will was involved .  it was .  exactly .     no     said sam .     i said  not so fast .  don t go by my thoughts .  let me speak out loud  even if you can t hear me .  then adjust my thoughts  so i ll know it s an adjustment .  do you understand .     he waited a moment and was then sure the other sam understood .  ah  the answer had come  but not right away .  good .     why do you appear to people .     asked sam .  he stared earnestly at the other sam  and knew that the other sam wanted to communicate with people  but had failed .  no answer to that question had really been required .  the answer was obvious .  but then  why had they failed .  he put it in words .     why did you fail .  you are successfully communicating with me .     sam was beginning to learn how to understand the alien manifestation .  it was as if his mind were adapting itself to a new technique of communication  just as it would adapt itself to a new language .  or was other sam influencing sam   s mind and teaching him the method without sam even knowing it was being done .  sam found himself emptying his mind of immediate thoughts .  after he asked his question  he just let his eyes focus at nothing and his eyelids droop  as though he were about to drop off to sleep  and then he knew the answer .  there was a little clicking  or something  in his mind  a signal that showed him something had been put in from outside .  he now knew  for instance  that the other sam   s previous attempts at communication had failed because the people to whom it had appeared had been frightened .  they had doubted their own sanity .  and because they feared  their minds .  .  . tightened .  their minds would not receive .  the attempts at communication gradually diminished  though they had never entirely stopped .     but you   re communicating with me     said sam .  sam was different from all the rest .  he had not been afraid .     couldn   t you have made them not afraid first .  then talked to them .     it wouldn   t work .  the fear filled mind resisted all .  an attempt to change might damage .  it would be wrong to damage a thinking mind .  there had been one such attempt  but it had not worked .     what is it you are trying to communicate  other sam .     a wish to be left alone .  despair .  despair was more than a thought  it was an emotion  it was a frightening sensation .  sam felt despair wash over him intensely  heavily  and yet it was not part of himself .  he felt despair on the surface of his mind  keenly  but underneath it  where his own mind was  he was free of it .  sam said  wonderingly     it seems to me as though you   re giving up .  why .  we   re not interfering with you .     human beings had built the dome  cleared a large area of all planetary life and substituted their own .  and once the neutron star had its power station  once floods of energy moved outward through hyperspace to power thirsty worlds  more power stations would be built and still more .  then what would happen to home .   there must be a name for the planet that the other sam used but the only thought sam found in his mind was home and  underneath that  the thought  ours  ours  ours    this planet was the nearest convenient base to the neutron star .  it would be flooded with more and more people  more and more domes  and their home would be destroyed .     but you could change our minds if you had to  even if you damaged a few  couldn   t you .     if they tried  people would find them dangerous .  people would work out what was happening .  ships would approach  and from a distance  use weapons to destroy the life on home  and then bring in people life instead .  this could be seen in the people   s minds .  people had a violent history  they would stop at nothing .     but what can i do .     said sam .     i   m just an apprentice .  i   ve just been here a few days .  what can i do .     fear .  despair .  there were no thoughts that sam could work out  just the numbing layer of fear and despair .  he felt moved .  it was such a peaceful world .  they threatened nobody .  they didn   t even hurt minds when they could .  it wasn   t their fault they were conveniently near a neutron star .  it wasn   t their fault they were in the way of expanding humanity .  he said     let me think .     he thought  and there was the feeling of another mind watching .  sometimes his thoughts skipped forward and he recognized a suggestion from outside .  there came the beginning of hope .  sam felt it  but wasn   t certain .  he said doubtfully        i   ll try .     he looked at the time strip on his wrist and jumped a little .  far more time had passed than he had realized .  his three hours were nearly up .     i must go back now     he said .  he opened his lunch hamper and removed the small thermos of water  drank from it thirstily  and emptied it .  he placed the empty thermos under one arm .  he removed the wrappings of the sandwich and stuffed it in his pocket .  the other sam wavered and turned smoky .  the smoke thinned  dispersed and was gone .  sam closed the hamper  swung its strap over his shoulder again and turned toward the dome .  his heart was hammering .  would he have the courage to go through with his plan .  and if he did  would it work .   when sam entered the dome  the corridor master was waiting for him and said  as he looked ostentatiously at his own timestrip     you shaved it rather fine  didn   t you .     sam   s lips tightened and he tried not to sound insolent .     i had three hours  sir .        and you took two hours and fifty eight minutes .        that   s less than three hours  sir .        hmm .     the corridor master was cold and unfriendly .     dr .  gentry would like to see you .        yes  sir .  what for .        he didn   t tell me .  but i don   t like you cutting it that fine your first time out  chase .  and i don   t like your attitude either  and i don   t like an officer of the dome wanting to see you .  i   m just going to tell you once  chase  if you   re a troublemaker  i won   t want you in this corridor .  do you understand .        yes  sir .  but what trouble have i made .        we   ll find that out soon enough .      sam had not seen donald gentry since their one and only meeting the day the young apprentice had reached the dome .  gentry still seemed good natured and kindly  and there was nothing in his voice to indicate anything else .  he sat in a chair behind his desk  and sam stood before it  his hamper still bumping his shoulder blade .  gentry said     how are you getting along  sam .  having an interesting time .        yes  sir     said sam .     still feeling you   d rather be doing something else  working somewhere else .     sam said  earnestly     no  sir .  this is a good place for me .        because you   re interested in hallucinations .        yes  sir .        you   ve been asking others about it  haven   t you .        it   s an interesting subject to me  sir .        because you want to study the human brain .        any brain  sir .        and you   ve been wandering about outside the dome  haven   t you .        i was told it was permitted  sir .        it is .  but few apprentices take advantage of that so soon .  did you see anything interesting .     sam hesitated  then said     yes  sir .        a hallucination .        no  sir .     he said it quite positively .  gentry stared at him for a few moments  and there was a kind of speculative hardening of this eyes .     would you care to tell me what you did see .  honestly .     sam hesitated again .  then he said     i saw and spoke to an inhabitant of this planet  sir .        an intelligent inhabitant  young man .        yes  sir .     gentry said     sam  we had reason to wonder about you when you came .  the central computer   s report on you did not match our needs  though it was favorable in many ways  so i took the opportunity to study you that first day .  we kept our collective eye on you  and when you left to wander about the planet on your own  we kept you under observation .        sir      said sam  indignantly .     that violates my right of privacy .         yes  it does  but this is a most vital project and we are some times driven to bend the rules a little .  we saw you talking with considerable animation for a substantial period of time .        i just told you i was  sir .        yes  but you were talking to nothing  to empty air .  you were experiencing a hallucination  sam .       part three  sam chase was speechless .  a hallucination .  it couldn   t be a hallucination .  less than half an hour ago  he had been speaking to the other sam  had been experiencing the thoughts of the other sam .  he knew exactly what had happened then  and he was still the same sam chase he had been during that conversation and before .  he put his elbow over his lunch hamper as though it were a connection with the sandwiches he had been eating when the other sam had appeared .  he said  with what was almost a stammer     sir  dr .  gentry  it wasn   t a hallucination .  it was real .     gentry shook his head .     my boy  i saw you talking with animation to nothing at all .  i didn   t hear what you said  but you were talking .  nothing else was there except plants .  nor was i the only one .  there were two other witnesses  and we have it all on record .        on record .        on a television cassette .  why should we lie to you  young man .  this has happened before .  at the start it happened rather frequently .  now it happens only very rarely .  for one thing  we tell the new apprentices of the hallucinations at the start  as i told you  and they generally avoid the planet until they are more acclimated  and then it doesn   t happen to them .        you mean you scare them     blurted out sam     so that it   s not likely to happen .  and they don   t tell you if it does happen .  but i wasn   t scared .     gentry shook his head .     i   m sorry you weren   t  if that was what it would have taken you to keep from seeing things .        i wasn   t seeing things .  at least  not things that weren   t there .        how do you intend to argue with a television cassette  which will show you staring at nothing .        sir  what i saw was not opaque .  it was smoky  actually  foggy  if you know what i mean .        yes  i do .  it looked as a hallucination might look  not as reality .  but the television set would have seen even smoke .        maybe not  sir .  my mind must have been focused to see it more clearly .  it was probably less clear to the camera than to me .        it focused your mind  did it .     gentry stood up  and he sounded rather sad .     that   s an admission of hallucination .  i   m really sorry  sam  because you are clearly intelligent  and the central computer rated you highly  but we can   t use you .        will you be sending me home  sir  .         yes  but why should that matter .  you didn   t particularly want to come here .        i want to stay here now .        but i   m afraid you cannot .        you can   t just send me home .  don   t i get a hearing .        you certainly can  if you insist  but in that case  the proceedings will be official and will go on your record  so that you won   t get another apprenticeship anywhere .  as it is  if you are sent back unofficially  as better suited to an apprenticeship in neurophysiology  you might get that  and be better off  actually  than you are now .        i don   t want that .  i want a hearing  before the commander .        oh  no .  not the commander .  he can   t be bothered with that .        it must be the commander     said sam  with desperate force     or this project will fail .        unless the commander gives you a hearing .  why do you say that .  come  you are forcing me to think that you are unstable in ways other than those involved with hallucinations .        sir .     the words were tumbling out of sam   s mouth now .     the commander is ill  they know that even on earth  and if he gets too ill to work  this project will fail .  i did not see a hallucination and the proof is that i know why he is ill and how he can be cured .        you   re not helping yourself     said gentry .     if you send me away  i tell you the project will fail .  can it hurt to let me see the commander .  all i ask is five minutes .        five minutes .  what if he refuses .        ask him  sir .  tell him that i say the same thing that caused his depression can remove it .        no  i don   t think i   ll tell him that .  but i   ll ask him if he   ll see you .      the commander was a thin man  not very tall .  his eyes were a deep blue and they looked tired .  his voice was very soft  a little low pitched  definitely weary .     you   re the one who saw the hallucination .        it was not a hallucination  commander .  it was real .  so was the one you saw  commander .     if that did not get him thrown out  sam thought  he might have a chance .  he felt his elbow tightening on his hamper again .  he still had it with him .  the commander seemed to wince .     the one i saw .        yes  commander .  it said it had hurt one person .  they had to try with you because you were the commander  and they .  .  . did damage .     the commander ignored that and said     did you ever have any mental problems before you came here .        no  commander .  you can consult my central computer record .     sam thought  he must have had problems  but they let it go because he   s a genius and they had to have him .  then he thought  was that my own idea .  or had it been put there .  the commander was speaking .  sam had almost missed it .  he said     what you saw can   t be real .  there is no intelligent life form on this planet .        yes  sir .  there is .        oh .  and no one ever discovered it till you came here  and in three days you did the job .     the commander smiled very briefly .     i   m afraid i have no choice but to         wait  commander     said sam  in a strangled voice .     we know about the intelligent life form .  it   s the insects  the little flying things .        you say the insects are intelligent .        not an individual insect by itself  but they fit together when they want to  like little jigsaw pieces .  they can do it in any way they want .  and when they do  their nervous systems fit together  too  and build up .  a lot of them together are intelligent .     the commander   s eyebrows lifted .     that   s an interesting idea  anyway .  almost crazy enough to be true .  how did you come to that conclusion  young man .        by observation  sir .  everywhere i walked  i disturbed the insects in the grass and they flew about in all directions .  but once the cow started to form  and i walked toward it  there was nothing to see or hear .  the insects were gone .  they had gathered together in front of me and they weren   t in the grass anymore .  that   s how i knew .        you talked with a cow .        it was a cow at first  because that   s what i thought of .  but they had it wrong  so they switched and came together to form a human being  me .        you .     and then  in a lower voice     well  that fits anyway .        did you see it that way  too  commander .     the commander ignored that .      and when it shaped itself like you  it could talk as you did .  is that what you   re telling me .        no  commander .  the talking was in my mind .         telepathy .        sort of .        and what did it say to you  or think to you .        it wanted us to refrain from disturbing this planet .  it wanted us not to take it over .      sam was all but holding his breath .  the interview had lasted more than five minutes already  and the commander was making no move to put an end to it  to send him home .     quite impossible .        why  commander .        any other base will double and triple the expense .  we   re having enough trouble getting grants as it is .  fortunately  it is all a hallucination  young man  and the problem does not arise .      he closed his eyes  then opened them and looked at sam without really focusing on him .     i   m sorry  young man .  you will be sent back  officially .     sam gambled again .     we can   t afford to ignore the insects  commander .  they have a lot to give us .     the commander had raised his hand halfway as though about to give a signal .  he paused long enough to say     really .  what do they have that they can give us .     the one thing more important than energy  commander .  an understanding of the brain .        how do you know that .        i can demonstrate it .  i have them here .     sam seized his hamper and swung it forward onto the desk .     what s that .     sam did not answer in words .  he opened the hamper  and a softly whirring  smoky cloud appeared .  the commander rose suddenly and cried out .  he lifted his hand high and an alarm bell sounded .  through the door came gentry  and others behind him .  sam felt himself seized by the arms  and then a kind of stunned and motionless silence prevailed in the room .  the smoke was condensing  wavering  taking on the shape of a head  a thin head  with high cheekbones  a smooth forehead and receding hairline .  it had the appearance of the commander .     i m seeing things     croaked the commander .  sam said     we re all seeing the same thing  aren t we .     he wriggled and was released .  gentry said in a low voice      mass hysteria .        no     said . sam     it s real .     he reached toward the head in midair  and brought back his finger with a tiny insect on it .  he flicked it and it could just barely be seen making its way back to its companions .  no one moved .  sam said     head  do you see the problem with the commander s mind .     sam had the brief vision of a snarl in an otherwise smooth curve  but it vanished and left nothing behind .  it was not something that could be easily put into human thought .  he hoped the others experienced that quick snarl .  yes  they had .  he knew it .  the commander said     there is no problem .     sam said     can you adjust it  head .     of course  they could not .  it was not right to invade a mind .  sam said     commander  give permission .     the commander put his hands to his eyes and muttered something sam did not make out .  then he said  clearly     it s a nightmare  but i ve been in one since  whatever must be done  i give permission .     nothing happened .  or nothing seemed to happen .  and then slowly  little by little  the commander s face lit in a smile .  he said  just above a whisper .      astonishing .  i m watching a sun rise .  it s been cold night for so long  and now i feel the warmth again .      his voice rose high .     i feel wonderful .     the head deformed at that point  turned into a vague  pulsing fog  then formed a curving  narrowing arrow that sped into the hamper .  sam snapped it shut .  he said     commander  have i your permission to restore these little insect things to their own world .        yes  yes     said the commander  dismissing that with a wave of his hand .     gentry  call a meeting .  we   ve got to change all our plans .      sam had been escorted outside the dome by a stolid guard and had then been confined to his quarters for the rest of the day .  it was late when gentry entered  stared at him thoughtfully  and said     that was an amazing demonstration of yours .  the entire incident has been fed into the central computer and we now have a double project  neutron star energy and neurophysiology .  i doubt that there will be any question about pouring money into this project now .  and we   ll have a group of neurophysiologists arriving eventually .  until then you   re going to be working with those little things and you   ll probably end up the most important person here .     sam said     but will we leave their world to them .     gentry said     we   ll have to if we expect to get anything out of them  won   t we .  the commander thinks we   re going to build elaborate settlements in orbit about this world and shift all operations to them except for a skeleton crew in this dome to maintain direct contact with the insects  or whatever we   ll decide to call them .  it will cost a great deal of money  and take time and labor  but it   s going to be worth it .  no one will question that .     sam said    good .     gentry stared at him again  longer and more thoughtfully than before .     my boy     he said     it seems that what happened came about because you did not fear the supposed hallucination .  your mind remained open  and that was the whole difference .  why was that .  why weren   t you afraid .     sam flushed .     i   m not sure  sir .  as i look back on it  though  it seemed to me i was puzzled as to why i was sent here .  i had been doing my best to study neurophysiology through my computerized courses  and i knew very little about astrophysics .  the central computer had my record  all of it  the full details of everything i had ever studied and i couldn   t imagine why i had been sent here .     then  when you first mentioned the hallucinations  i thought     that must be it .  i was sent here to look into it .     i just made up my mind that was the thing i had to do .  i had no time to be afraid  dr .  gentry .  i had a problem to solve and i  i had faith in the central computer .  it wouldn   t have sent me here  if i weren   t up to it .     gentry shook his head .     i   m afraid i wouldn   t have had that much faith in that machine .  but they say faith can move mountains  and i guess it did in this case .      the instability  professor firebrenner had explained it carefully .     time perception depends on the structure of the universe .  when the universe is expanding  we experience time as going forward  when it is contracting  we experience it going backward .  if we could somehow force the universe to be in stasis  neither expanding nor contracting  time would stand still .        but you can   t put the universe in stasis     said mr .  atkins  fascinated .     i can put a little portion of the universe in stasis  however .      said the professor .      just enough to hold a ship .  time will stand still and we can move forward or backward at will and the entire trip will last less than an instant .  but all the parts of the universe will move while we stand still  while we are nailed to the fabric of the universe .  the earth moves about the sun  the sun moves about the core of the galaxy  the galaxy moves about some center of gravity  all the galaxies move .     i calculated those motions and i find that    .   million years in the future  a red dwarf star will occupy the position our sun does now .  if we go    .   million years into the future  in less than an instant that red dwarf star will be near our spaceship and we can come home after studying it a bit .     atkins said     can that be done .        i   ve sent experimental animals through time  but i can   t make them automatically return .  if you and i go  we can then manipulate the controls so that we can return .        and you want me along .        of course .  there should be two .  two people would be more easily believed than one alone .  come  it will be an incredible adventure .      atkins inspected the ship .  it was a      glenn fusion model and looked beautiful .     suppose     he said     that it lands inside the red dwarf star .        it won   t     said the professor     but if it does  that   s the chance we take .        but when we get back  the sun and earth will have moved on .  we   ll be in space .        of course  but how far can the sun and earth move in the few hours it will take us to observe the star .  with this ship we will catch up to our beloved planet .  are you ready  mr .  atkins .        ready     sighed atkins .  professor firebrenner made the necessary adjustments and nailed the ship to the fabric of the universe while    .   million years passed .  and then  in less than a flash  time began to move forward again in the usual way  and everything in the universe moved forward with it .  through the viewing port of their ship  professor firebrenner and mr .  atkins could see the small orb of the red dwarf star .  the professor smiled .     you and i  atkins     he said     are the first ever to see  close at hand  any star other than our own sun .     they remained two and a half hours during which they photographed the star and its spectrum and as many neighboring stars as they could  made special coronagraphic observations  tested the chemical composition of the interstellar gas  and then professor firebrenner said  rather reluctantly     i think we had better go home now .      again  the controls were adjusted and the ship was nailed to the fabric of the universe .  they went    .   million years into the past  and in less than a flash  they were back where they started .  space was black .  there was nothing .  atkins said     what happened .  where are the earth and sun .     the professor frowned .  he said      going back in time must be different .  the entire universe must have moved .        where could it move .        i don   t know .  other objects shift position within the universe  but the universe as a whole must move in an upper dimensional direction .  we are here in the absolute vacuum  in primeval chaos .        but we   re here .  it   s not primeval chaos anymore .        exactly .  that means we   ve introduced an instability at this place where we exist  and that means      even as he said that  a big bang obliterated them .  a new universe came into being and began to expand .   alexander the god  alexander hoskins grew seriously interested in computers at the age of fourteen and quickly realized that he was interested in nothing much else .  his teachers encouraged him and excused him from classes in order that he might concentrate on this hobby of his .  his father  who worked for ibm  encouraged him  too  got him some necessary equipment and explained some knotty points to him .  alexander built his own computer in a room above the garage  programmed and reprogrammed it and  at the age of sixteen  could no longer find a book that told him anything he didn   t know about computers .  nor could he find a book that dealt with some of the things he had found out entirely on his own .  he thought about it deeply and decided not to tell his father of some of the things his computer could do .  already  the boy had become aware that the greatest conqueror of ancient times had been alexander the great  and alexander felt his own name was no accident .  alexander was particularly interested in computer memory and worked out systems for cramming data into volume  much data into little volume .  with each improvement  he squeezed more and more data into less and less volume .  solemnly  he then named his computer bucephalus  after the faithful horse of alexander the great  the horse who had carried him through all his triumphant battles .  there were computers that could accept spoken commands and give spoken responses  but none could do it as well as bucephalus .  there were also computers that could scan and store the written word  but none could do it as well as bucephalus .  alexander tested this by having bucephalus scan the encyclopedia britannica and store it all in its memory .  by the time he was eighteen  alexander had established an information handling business for students and small businessmen and had become self supporting .  he moved into his own apartment in the city and was from that point on independent of his parents .  in his own apartment he could remove the earphone attachment .  with privacy  he could speak to bucephalus openly  though he carefully adjusted the computer   s voice to low intensity .  he did not want neighbors to wonder who was in the apartment with him .  he said     bucephalus  alexander the great had conquered the ancient world by the time he was thirty .  i want to do the same thing .  that gives me twelve more years .     bucephalus knew all about alexander the great  since the encyclopedia had given him all the details .  he said      alexander the great was the son of the king of macedon and by the time he was your age  he had led his father   s cavalry to victory at the great battle at chaeronea .     alexander said     no  no .  i   m not talking about battles and phalanxes and things like that .  i want to conquer the world by coming to own it .        how could you own it  alexander .        you and i  bucephalus     said alexander     are going to study the stock market .     the new york times had long since put all its microfilmed records into computerized form and for alexander it was not at all a difficult task to tap into that information .  for days  weeks  months  bucephalus transferred over a century of data on the stock market into its own memory banks  all the stocks listed  all the shares sold for each on each day  the ups and downs  even the applicable news on the financial pages .  alexander was forced to extend the computer   s memory circuits and to work out a daring new system for information retrieval .  reluctantly  he sold a simplified version of one of the circuits he had developed to ibm and in this way became quite well to do .  he bought a neighboring apartment in which he might eat and sleep .  the first apartment was now given over entirely to bucephalus .  when he was twenty  alexander felt he was ready to start his campaign .     bucephalus     he said     i am ready  and so are you .  you know everything there is to know about the stock market .  you have in your memory every transaction and every event  and you keep it all up to date to the very second because you are hooked into the computer at the new york stock exchange  and you will soon be hooked into the exchanges in london  tokyo  and elsewhere .        yes  alexander     said bucephalus     but what is it you wish me to do with all the information .        i am certain     said alexander  his eyes gleaming in steely  determined fashion     that the values and fluctuations of the market are not random .  i feel that nothing is .  you must go through all the data  studying all the values and all the changes in the values and all the rates of changes of the values  until you can analyze them into cycles and combinations of cycles .        are you referring to a fourier analysis .     asked bucephalus .     explain that to me .     bucephalus presented him with a printout from the encyclopedia together with supplements from other information in his memory banks .  alexander glanced at it briefly  and said     yes  that   s the sort of thing .        to what end  alexander .        once you have the cycles  bucephalus  you will be able to predict the course of the stock market in the following day  week  month  according to the swing of the cycles  and you will be able to direct me in my investments .  i will quickly grow rich .  you will also direct me how to obscure my own involvement so that the world will not know how rich i am  or who it is who has such an influential finger on world events .        to what end  alexander .        so that when i am rich enough  when i control the earth   s financial institutions  its commerce  its business  its resources  i will have done in reality what alexander the great did only in part .  i will be alexander the really great .      his eyes glittered with delight at the thought .  by the time alexander was twenty two  he was satisfied that bucephalus had worked out the complicated set of cycles that would serve to predict the behavior of the stock market .  bucephalus was less certain .  he said     in addition to the natural cycles that control such things  there are also unpredictable events in the world of politics and international affairs .  there are unpredictable turns of weather  disease  and scientific advance .     alexander said     not at all  bucephalus .  all such things also go in cycles .  you will study the general news columns of the new york times and absorb it all in order to allow for these supposedly unpredictable events .  you will then find they are predictable .  other great newspapers  here and abroad  will be yours to study .  they are all microfilmed and computerized and we can go back for a century or more .  besides  you do not have to be totally accurate .  if you are right eighty five percent of the time  that will do  for now .     it did do .  when bucephalus felt that the stock market would go up or that it would go down  he was invariably right .  when he pointed to particular stocks that were headed for long term rises or declines  he was almost always right .  by the time alexander was twenty four he was worth five million dollars and his income had risen to tens of thousands of dollars per day .  what   s more  his books were so complicated and the money so laundered that it would have taken another computer just like bucephalus to track it all down and force alexander to pay more than a pittance to the i . r . s .  it was not even difficult .  bucephalus had entered all the tax statutes into its memory as well as a score of textbooks on corporation management .  thanks to bucephalus  alexander controlled a dozen corporations without any sign of that control being visible .  bucephalus said      are you rich enough  alexander .        surely you jest     said alexander .     i am as yet a financial pipsqueak  a batboy in the minor leagues .  when i am a billionaire  i will be a power in the financial set  but i will still be only one among a handful .  it is only when i am a multitrillionaire that i will be able to control governments and force my will upon the world .  and i have only six years left .     bucephalus   s understanding of the stock market  and of the ways of the world  grew each year .  his advice remained always useful and his deviousness in threading financial tentacles through the centers of world power remained always skillful .  yet he grew doubtful  too .     there may be trouble  alexander     he said .     nonsense     said alexander .      alexander the really great cannot be stopped .     by the time alexander was twenty six  he was a billionaire .  the entire apartment building was now his and all of it was given over to bucephalus  and to all the offshoots of its enormous memory .  the tentacles of bucephalus now stretched invisibly outward to all the computers in the world .  softly  gently  all of them responded to alexander   s will as expressed through bucephalus .  bucephalus said     it grows more difficult somehow  alexander .  my estimates of future development are not as good as they have been .     alexander said impatiently     you are dealing with more and more variables .  there is nothing to worry about .  i shall double your complexity  then double it again .        it is not complexity that is needed     said bucephalus .      all the cycles that i have worked out in ever increasing complexity predict the future in fine detail only because things that now take place are the same as have taken place in the past  so that the response is the same .  if something entirely new happens  then all the cycles will fail      alexander said  peremptorily     there is nothing new under the sun .  go through history and you   ll find that there are only changes in detail .  i will conquer the world  but i am only one more conqueror in a long line stretching back to sargon of agade .  the development of a high tech society repeats certain advances in medieval china and in the ancient hellenistic kingdoms .  the black death was a repetition of the earlier plagues in the times of marcus aurelius and of pericles .  even the devastation of the wars of nations in the twentieth century repeats the devastation of the wars of religion in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries .  the differences in detail can be allowed for and  in any case  i order you to continue  and you must obey my orders .        i must     agreed bucephalus .  by the time alexander was twenty eight  he was the richest man who had ever lived  with assets that even bucephalus could not estimate closely .  certainly it was over a hundred billion and his income was in the tens of millions a day .  no nation was any longer truly independent and nowhere could any sizable group of human beings take any action that would seriously discommode alexander .  there was peace in the world because alexander did not wish any of his property destroyed .  there was firm order in the world because alexander did not wish to be disturbed .  for the same reason  there was no freedom .  all must do exactly as alexander willed .     i am almost there  bucephalus     said alexander .     in two more years  it will be completely beyond the power of any human being to discommode me .  i will then reveal myself  and all of human science will be bent to one task  and one task only  that of making me immortal .  i will no longer be even alexander the really great .  i will become alexander the god and all human beings will worship me .     bucephalus said     but i have gone as far as i can go .  i may no longer be able to protect you from the viscissitudes of chance .        that can   t be so  bucephalus     said alexander  impatiently .     do not quail .  weigh all the variables and arrange to pour into my hands whatever of earth   s wealth still exists outside it .        i don   t think i can  alexander     said bucephalus .     i have discovered a factor in human history that i cannot weigh .  it is something completely new that does not fit into any of the cycles .        there can be nothing new     said alexander  now in a fury .     do not hang back .  i order you to proceed .        very well  then     said bucephalus  with a remarkably human sigh .  alexander knew that bucephalus was straining at this one last  greatest task  and he was confident that at any moment  it would be accomplished .  the world would then be his entirely and through all eternity .     what is this something new .     he asked with a flicker of curiosity .     myself     said bucephalus  in a whisper .     nothing like me has ever before exis      and before the last syllable could be expressed  bucephalus went dark as every last chip and circuit within itself fused as a result of his mighty effort to encompass himself as part of history .  in the economic and financial chaos that followed  alexander was wiped out .  earth regained its liberty  which meant  of course  that there was a certain amount of disorder here and there  but most people considered that a small price to pay .   in the canyon  dear mabel   well  here we are  as promised .  they   ve given us a permit to live in the valles marineris  and don   t think we haven   t been waiting for a year and a half because we have .  they   re so slow and they keep talking about the capital investment required to make the place livable .  valles marineris sounds good as an address  but we just call it the canyon  and i don   t know why they   re so worried about its being livable .  it   s the martian riviera  if you ask me .  in the first place  it   s warmer down here than it is in the rest of mars  a good ten degrees  celsius  warmer .  the air is thicker  thin enough  heaven knows  but thicker and a better protection against ultraviolet .  of course  the main difficulty is getting in and out of the canyon .  it   s four miles deep in places and they   ve built roads here and there so that you can get down in special mobiles .  getting up and out is more difficult  but with gravity only two fifths what it is on earth  it isn   t as bad as it sounds  and they do say they   re going to build elevators that will take us at least partway up and down .  another problem is  of course  that dust storms do tend to accumulate in the canyon more than on the ordinary surface  and there are landslides now and then  but heavens  we don   t worry about that .  we know where the faults are and where the landslides are likely to occur and no one digs in there .  that   s the thing  mabel .  after all  everyone on mars lives under a dome or underground  but here in the canyon  we can dig in sideways  which i understand is much preferable from an engineering standpoint  though i   ve asked bill not to try to explain it to me .  for one thing  we can heat out some of the ice crystals  so that we don   t have to depend on the government for all the water we need .  there is more ice down in the canyon than elsewhere and  for another  it   s easier to manufacture the air  keep it inside the diggings  and circulate it when you   re in horizontally instead of down vertically .  that   s what bill says .  and i   ve been thinking about it  mabel .  where   s the need to leave the canyon  anyway .  it   s over three thousand miles long and in the end there are going to be diggings all along it .  it   s going to be a huge city  and i   ll bet you most of the population of mars will end up here .  can   t you see it .  there   s to be some kind of maglev rail running the length of the canyon and communication will be easy .  the government ought to put every bit of money it can into developing it .  it will make mars a great world .  bill says  you know what he   s like  all enthusiasm  that the time will come when they will roof in the whole canyon .  instead of having air just in separate diggings  and having to put on a spacesuit when you want to travel about  we will have a huge world of normal air and low gravity .  i said to him that the landslides might break the dome and we would lose all the air .  he said that the dome could be built in separate sections and that any break would automatically shut off the affected areas .  i asked him how much all that would cost .  he said     what   s the difference .  it will be done little by little  over the centuries .     anyway  that   s his job here  now .  he   s got his master   s license as an areo engineer  and he   s got to work out new ways to make the canyon diggings even better .  that   s why we got our new place here and it looks as though mars is going to be our oyster .  we may not live to see it ourselves  but if our great grandchildren make it to       a century from now  we   ll have a world that may well overshadow earth itself .  it would be wonderful .  we   re very excited  mabel .   yours  gladys .   good bye to earth  i am sending this message to earth in an attempt to warn them about what i feel sure is going to happen  and what must happen .  it is sad to think of what lies ahead  so no one wants to talk about it  but someone should  as the people of earth ought to be prepared .  it is the latter half of the twenty first century and there are a dozen settlements in orbit about the earth .  each is  in its way  an independent little world .  the smallest has ten thousand inhabitants  the largest almost twenty five thousand .  i   m sure that all earthmen know this  but you people are so entangled in your own giant world  that you rarely think of us except as some little inconsequential objects out in space .  well  think of us .  each settlement imitates earth   s environment as closely as it can  spinning to produce a pseudo gravity  allowing sunlight to enter at some times  and not at others  in order to produce a normal day and night .  each is large enough to give the impression of space within  to have farms as well as factories  to have an atmosphere that can give rise to clouds .  there are towns  and schools  and athletic fields .  we have some things that earth has not .  the pseudogravitational field varies in intensity relative to position within each settlement .  there are areas of low gravity  even zero gravity  where we can outfit ourselves with wings and fly  where we can play three dimensional tennis  where we can have unusual gymnastic experiences .  we also have a true space culture  for we are used to space .  our chief work  aside from keeping our settlements running efficiently  is to build structures in space for ourselves and for earth .  we work in space  and to be in a spaceship or a spacesuit is second nature to us .  working at zero gravity is something we have done from childhood .  there are also some things earth has that we do not .  we don   t have earth   s weather extremes .  in our carefully controlled settlements  it never gets too hot or too cold .  there are no storms and no unarranged precipitation .  nor do we have earth   s dangerous terrain .  we have no mountains  no cliffs  no swamps  no deserts  no stormy oceans .  and we have no dangerous plants  animals  or parasites .  if anything  there are some among us who complain that we are too secure  that there is no adventure  but then our people can always go out into space  and make long trips to mars and to the asteroids  which you earthpeople are psychologically unfit to do .  in fact  there are plans by some settlers to set up colonies on mars and mining bases in the asteroid belt  but it may never come to that  for reasons i will describe .  the settlements did not spring on humanity unawares .  even a century ago  gerard o   neill of princeton and his students were making initial plans for such new homes for humanity  and science fiction writers had anticipated it even before that .  oddly enough though  the difficulties that most foresaw turned out to be not those that plagued the settlements .  the expense of building them  the problems of providing an earth like environment  the gathering of energy  the matter of protection against cosmic rays were all solved .  it was not done easily  but it was done .  the sun itself supplies all the energy we need  and enough more to export some to earth .  we can grow food easily  more than we need  in fact  so that we can export some to earth .  we have small animals  rabbits  chickens  and so on  that can supply us with meat .  we get what material we need from space  not only from the moon  but from meteoroids and comets that we can trap and exploit .  once we reach the asteroids  if we ever do  we will have a virtually unlimited supply of everything we need .  what bothers us and produces an insuperable problem is something that few people foresaw .  it is the difficulty of keeping up a viable ecology .  each settlement must support itself .  it contains people  plants  and animals  it contains air  water  and soil .  the living things must multiply and maintain their numbers  but not outpace the ability of the settlement to support them .  the plants and animals .  well  we control them .  we supervise their breeding and we consume any excess .  maintaining the human population at a reasonable level is more difficult .  we cannot allow human births to outstrip human deaths  and we keep the number of deaths as low as possible  of course .  this makes our culture a nonyouthful one compared to earth   s .  there are few youngsters and a large percentage of those mature and postmature .  this produces psychological strains  but there is the general feeling among settlers that those strains are worth it  since with a carefully controlled population  there are no poor  no homeless  and no helpless .  again  the water  air  and food must be carefully recycled  and much of our technology is devoted to the distillation of used water  and to the treatment of solid bodily wastes and their conversion to clean fertilizer .  we cannot afford to have anything go wrong with our recycling technology  for there is little room for slack .  and  of course  even when all goes well  the feeling that we eat and drink recycled materials is a bit unpalatable .  all is recycled on earth  too  but earth is so large and the natural cycling system so unnoticeable  that earthpeople tend to be unaware of the matter .  then  too  there is always the fear that a sizable meteor may strike and damage the outer shell of a settlement .  a bit of matter no larger than a piece of gravel might do damage  and one a foot across would surely destroy any settlement .  fortunately  the chances for such a misadventure are small and we will eventually learn to detect and divert such objects before they reach us .  still  these dangers weigh upon us  and help mitigate the feeling of over security that some of us complain about .  with an effort  however  with close attention and unremitting care  we can maintain our ecology  were it not for the matter of trade and travel .  each settlement produces something that other settlements would like to have  in the matter of food  of art  of ingenious devices .  what   s more  we must trade with earth as well  and many settlers want to visit earth and see some of the things we don   t have in the settlements .  earthpeople can   t realize how exciting it is for us to see a vast blue horizon  or to look out upon a true ocean  or to see an ice capped mountain .  therefore  there is a constant coming and going among the settlements and earth .  but each settlement has its own ecological balance  and  of course  earth has  even these days  an ecology that is enormously and impossibly rich by settlement standards .  we have our insects that are acclimated and under control  but what if strange insects are casually and unintentionally introduced from another settlement or from earth .  a strange insect  a strange worm  even a strange rodent might totally upset our ecology  inflict damage on our native plants and animals .  on numerous occasions  in fact  a settlement has had to take extraordinary measures to eliminate an unwanted life form .  for months every effort had to be taken to track down every last insect of some species that  in its own settlement  is harmless  or that  on earth  can keep its depredations local .  even worse  what if pathogenic parasites  bacteria  viruses  protozoa  are introduced .  what if they produce diseases against which another settlement and  of course  earth itself  have developed a certain immunity  but one against which the settlement that suffers the invasion is helpless .  for a while  the entire effort of the settlement must go into the preparation or importation of sera designed to confer immunity  or to fight the disease once it is established .  deaths  of course  occur invariably .  naturally  there is always an outcry when this happens and a demand for more controls .  as a result  no one from another settlement  and no one returning to his own settlement from a trip elsewhere  can be allowed to enter without a complete search of his baggage  a complete analysis of his bodily fluids  and a certain period of quarantine to see if some undetected disease is developing .  what   s more  rightly or wrongly  the inhabitants of the settlements persist in viewing earthpeople themselves as particularly dangerous .  it is on earth where the most undesirable life forms and parasites are to be found  it is earthpeople who are most likely to be infested  and there are parties on all the settlements who support the notion  sometimes quite vehemently  of breaking all contacts between the settlements and earth .  that is the danger of which i want to warn earthpeople .  distrust  and even hatred  of earthpeople is constantly growing among the settlers .  as long as earth is only a few tens or hundreds of thousands of miles away  it is useless to talk of breaking off all contact .  the lure and attraction of earth is too great .  therefore  there is now talk  it is only a whisper  so far  but it will grow louder  i assure you  of leaving the solar system altogether .   each settlement can be outfitted with a propulsive mechanism  making use of microfusion motors .  solar energy will suffice us while we are still among the planets and we will pick up small comets as a source of hydrogen fuel  in the process of leaving all the planets behind  when the sun becomes too distant to be of use to us .  each settlement will say good bye to earth  then  and launch itself as an independent world into the unimaginable wastes between the stars .  and who knows  someday a million years hence a settlement may find an earth like world  empty and waiting  that it can populate .  but that is what i must warn earth of .  the settlements will someday leave  and if you build others  they will eventually leave  too  and you will be left alone .  and yet  in a way  your descendants will be expanding into  and populating  the entire galaxy .  you may find that a consoling thought as you watch them disappear .   battle hymn  there didn   t seem much room for hope .  sibelius hopkins put it into the simplest words .     we   ve got to have martian consent  and we won   t get it  that   s all .     the gloom among the others was thick enough to impede breathing .     we should never have granted the colonists autonomy     said ralph colodny .     agreed     said hopkins .     now who wants to volunteer to go back in time twenty eight years and change history .  mars has the sovereign right to decide how its territory is to be used  and there   s nothing to be done about it .        we might choose another site      said ben devers  who was the youngest of the group and hadn   t yet worked himself to the proper pitch of cynicism .     no other site     said hopkins flatly .     if you don   t know that experiments with hyperspace are dangerous  go back to school .  you can   t do them on earth  and even the moon is far too built up .  the space settlements are too small by three orders of magnitude and it   s not possible to reach anything beyond mars for at least twenty years .  but mars is perfect .  it   s still practically empty .  it has a low surface gravity and a thin atmosphere .  it   s cold .  everything   s perfect for hyperspatial flight  except the colonists .        you can never tell     said young devers .     people are funny .  they might vote in favor of hyperspatial experiments on mars  if we play it right .        how do we play it right     said hopkins .     the opposition has blanketed mars with an old hillbilly tune that has the words      no  no  a thousand times  no .  you cannot buy my caress .     no  no  a thousand times  no .  i   d rather die than say  yes .      he grinned mirthlessly .     mars is blanketed with the tune .  it   s being drilled into the minds of the martian colonists .  they   ll vote    no    automatically  and we won   t have hyperspatial experiments and that means we won   t have flights to the stars for decades  maybe generations  certainly not in our lifetimes .     devers said  frowning in thought     can   t we use a tune for our side of the argument .        what tune .        a large percentage of the martian colonists are of french extraction .  we might play on their ethnic consciousness .        what ethnic consciousness .  everyone speaks english now .        that doesn   t stop ethnic consciousness     said devers .     if you play the old national anthem of france  they   ll all drip nostalgia .  it   s a battle hymn  you know  and battle hymns always stir the blood  especially now that there aren   t any wars .     hopkins said     but the words don   t mean anything any more .  do you remember them .        yes     said devers .     some       allons  enfants de la patrie     la jour de gloire est arrive .     contre nous de la tyrannie     l   etendard sanglant est leve .      he sang them in a clear tenor voice .  hopkins said     not one martian in a thousand will know what that means .     devers said     who cares .  play it anyway .  even if they don   t understand the words they will know it   s the old battle hymn of france and that will stir them up .  besides  the tune is a winner .  infinitely better than that silly music hall thing about    no  no .     i   m telling you  the battle hymn will settle into every mind and wipe out the no no .        maybe you have something there     said hopkins .      and if we accompany it with some strong slogan in different changes     humanity to the stars .         reach out for a star        faster than light is the slowest we can go .     and always with that tune .     colodny said     you know     la jour de gloire    means    the day of glory     i think .  we can use that phrase     the glory day when we reach the stars .     if we say    glory day    often enough  maybe the martians will vote     yes .           it sounds too good to be true     said hopkins  gloomily     but i really don   t see that there   s any other choice we have right now .  we can try it and see if it does any good .     that was the beginning of the great voting battle of the tunes .  in everyone of the domed settlements on mars  from olympus all along the valles marineris and far into the cratered areas  there rang out on one side     no  no  a thousand times  no      and on the other side      allons  enfants de la patrie      there was no question that the stirring rhythm of the battle hymn was having its effect .  it roared back at the simple negation sing song and hopkins had to admit that from zero chance  the    yes    vote was becoming a possibility  from sure defeat  it was beginning to have just a chance .  hopkins said     the trouble is  though  we have nothing direct .  their song  silly though it is  has the advantage of saying     no  no .   no .  ours is just a tune which is catchy and is filling the minds of many  but with what .  la jour de gloire .     devers smiled and said     why not wait for the election .      after all  it was his idea .  they did .   challenge to the reader  what happened on election day .  did the negative vote win or the positive .  and  in either case  why .  the best reason counts .  you can win if you have the vote come out negative or positive .   on the evening of election day  hopkins found himself almost unable to talk .  the vote had been running a steady    percent in favor of    yes    and there was simply no question about it .  the colonists of mars were voting to allow their planet to be used for the work that would eventually send human beings to the stars .  hopkins said  finally     what happened .  what did we do right .         it was the tune     said devers  smiling his satisfaction .     i had it figured right  but i didn   t want to explain my notion because i didn   t want it to get out to the other side somehow .  not that i don   t trust everyone here  but i didn   t want the tune neutralized in some clever way .        what was there about the tune that made so much difference .     demanded hopkins .     well  it did have a subliminal message .  maybe the colonists no longer knew enough french to get the meaning of the words  but they had to know the name of the battle hymn .  that name rang through their minds each time they heard the tune  each time they hummed it .        so what .        so this     said devers  grinning     the name is    mars say yes .         feghoot and the courts  the planet of lockmania  inhabited though it was by intelligent beings that looked like large wombats  had adopted the american legal system  and ferdinand feghoot had been sent there by the earth confederation to study the results .  feghoot watched with interest as a husband and wife were brought in  charged with disturbing the peace .  during a religious observation  when for twenty minutes the congregation was supposed to maintain silence  while concentrating on their sins and visualizing them as melting away  the woman had suddenly risen from her squatting position and screamed loudly .  when someone rose to object  the man had pushed him forcefully .  the judges listened solemnly  fined the woman a silver dollar  and the man a twenty dollar gold piece .  almost immediately afterward  seventeen men and women were brought in .  they had been ringleaders of a crowd that had demonstrated for better quality meat at a supermarket .  they had torn the supermarket apart and inflicted various bruises and lacerations on eight of the employees of the establishment .  again the judges listened solemnly  and fined the seventeen a silver dollar apiece .  afterward  feghoot said to the chief judge .     i approved of your handling of the man and woman who disturbed the peace .        it was a simple case     said the judge .     we have a legal maxim that goes     screech is silver  but violence is golden .           in that case     said feghoot     why did you fine the group of seventeen a silver dollar apiece when they had committed far worse violence .        oh  that   s another legal maxim     said the judge .     every crowd has a silver fining .      fault intolerant    january  i  abram ivanov  finally have a home computer  a word processor  to be exact .  i fought it as long as i could .  i argued it out with myself .  i am america   s most prolific writer and i do fine on a typewriter .  last year i published over thirty books .  some of them were small books for kids .  some were anthologies .  but there were also novels  short story collections  essay collections  nonfiction books .  nothing to be ashamed of .  so why do i need a word processor .  i can   t go any faster .  but  you know  there   s such a thing as neatness .  typing my stuff means i have to introduce pen and ink items to correct typos  and nobody does that anymore .  i don   t want my manuscripts to stick out like a sore thumb .  i don   t want editors to think my stuff is second rate  just because it is corrected .  the difficulty was finding a machine that wouldn   t take two years to learn to use .  deft  i   m not  as i   ve frequently mentioned in this diary .  and i want one that doesn   t break down every other day .  mechanical failures just throw me .  so i got one that   s    fault tolerant .      that means if some component goes wrong  the machine keeps right on working  tests the malfunctioning component  corrects it if it can  reports it if it can   t  and replacements can be carried through by anybody .  it doesn   t take an expert hacker .  sounds like my kind of thing .     february      i haven   t been mentioning my word processor lately  because i   ve been struggling to learn how it works .  i   ve managed .  for a while  i had a lot of trouble  because although i have a high iq  it   s a very specialized high iq .  i can write  but coping with mechanical objects throws me .  but i learned quickly  once i gained sufficient confidence .  what did it was this .  the manufacturer   s representative assured me that the machine would develop flaws only rarely  and would be unable to correct its own flaws only exceedingly rarely .  he said i wouldn   t be likely to need a new component oftener than once in five years .  and if i did need one  they would hear exactly what was needed from the machine .  the computer would then replace the part itself  do all the wiring and oiling that was necessary and reject the old part  which i could then throwaway .  that   s sort of exciting .  i almost wish something would go wrong so that i could get a new part and insert it .  i could tell everyone     oh  sure  the discombobulator blew a fuse  and i fixed it like a shot .  nothing to it .     but they wouldn   t believe me .  i   m going to try writing a short story on it .  nothing too long .  just about two thousand words  maybe .  if i get confused  i can always go back to the typewriter until i   ve regained my confidence .  then i can try again .      february  i didn   t get confused .  now that the proof is in  i can talk about it .  the short story went as smoothly as cream .  i brought it in and they   ve taken it .  no problem .  so i   ve finally started my new novel .  i should have started it a month ago  but i had to make sure i could work my word processor first .  let   s hope it works .  it   ll seem funny not having a pile of yellow sheets i can rifle through when i want to check something i said a hundred pages earlier  but i suppose i can learn how to check back on the discs .      february  the computer has a spelling correction component .  that caught me by surprise because the representative hadn   t told me about it .  at first  it let misspellings go and i just proofread each page as i turned it out .  but then it began to mark off any word it was unfamiliar with  which was a little bothersome because my vocabulary is a large one and i have no objection to making up words .  and  of course  any proper name i use is something it was unfamiliar with .  i called the representative because it was annoying to have to be notified of all sorts of corrections that didn   t really have to be made .  the representative said     don   t let that bother you  mr .  ivanov .  if it questions a word that you want to remain as it is  just retype it exactly as it is and the computer will get the idea and not correct it the next time .     that puzzled me .     don   t i have to set up a dictionary for the machine .  how will it know what   s right and what   s wrong .        that   s part of the fault tolerance  mr .  ivanov     he said .     the machine already has a basic dictionary and it picks up new words as you use them .  you will find that it will pick up false misspellings to a smaller and smaller degree .  to tell you truthfully  mr .  ivanov  you have a late model there and we   re not sure we know all its potentialities .  some of our researchers consider it fault tolerant in that it can continue to work despite its own flaws  but fault intolerant in that it won   t stand for flaws in those who use it .  please report to us if there   s anything puzzling .  we would really like to know .     i   m not sure i   ll like this .     march  well  i   ve been struggling with the word processor and i don   t know what to think .  for a long time  it would mark off misspellings  and i would retype them correctly .  and it certainly learned how to tell real misspellings .  i had no trouble there .  in fact  when i had a long word  i would sometimes throw in a wrong letter just to see if it would catch it .  i would write    supercede    or    vaccum    or    skenectady .     it almost never failed .  and then yesterday a funny thing happened .  it stopped waiting for me to retype the wrong spelling .  it retyped it automatically itself .  you can   t help striking the wrong key sometimes so i would write     she    instead of    the    and the          would change to a    t    in front of my eyes .  and it would happen quickly  too .  i tested it by deliberately typing a word with a wrong letter .  i would see it show up wrong on the screen .  i would blink my eyes and it would be right .  this morning i phoned the representative .     hmm     he said .     interesting .        troublesome     i said     it might introduce mistakes .  if i type    blww    does the machine correct it to    blew    or to    blow    .  or what if it thinks i mean    blue        ue    when i really mean    blew        ew .     see what i mean .     he said     i have discussed your machine with one of our theoretical experts .  he tells me it may be capable of absorbing internal clues from your writing and knows which word you really want to use .  as you type into it  it begins to understand your style and integrate it into its own programming .     a little scary  but it   s convenient .  i don   t have to proofread the pages now .      march  i really don   t have to proofread the pages .  the machine has taken to correcting my punctuation and word order .  the first time it happened  i couldn   t believe it .  i thought i had had a small attack of dizziness and had imagined i had typed something that wasn   t really on the screen .  it happened oftener and oftener and there was no mistake about it .  it got to the point where i couldn   t make a mistake in grammar .  if i tried to type something like    jack  and jill went up the hill     that comma simply wouldn   t appear .  no matter how i tried to type    i has a book     it always shows up as    i have a book .     or if i wrote     jack  and jill as well  went up the hill     then i couldn   t omit the commas .  they   d go in of their own accord .  it   s a lucky thing i keep this diary in longhand or i couldn   t explain what i mean .  i couldn   t give an example of wrong english .  i don   t really like to have a computer arguing with me over english  but the worst part of it is that it   s always right .  well  look  i don   t throw a fit when a human copy editor sends me back a manuscript with corrections in every line .  i   m just a writer  i   m not an expert on the minutiae of english .  let the copy editors copyedit  they still can   t write .  and so let the word processor copyedit .  it takes a load off me .      april  i spoke too soon in the last item in which i mentioned my word processor .  for three weeks  it copyedited me and my novel went along smoothly .  it was a good working arrangement .  i did the creating and it did the modulating  so to speak .  then yesterday evening  it refused to work at all .  nothing happened  no matter what keys were touched .  it was plugged in all right  the wall switch was on  i was doing everything correctly .  it just wouldn   t work .  well i thought  so much for that business about    not once in five years .     i   d only been using it for three and a half months and already so many parts were out that it wouldn   t work .  that meant that new parts ought to come from the factory by special messenger  but not till the next day  of course .  i felt terrible  you can bet  and i dreaded having to go back to the typewriter  searching out all my own mistakes and then having to make pen and ink corrections or to retype the page .  i went to bed in a foul humor  and didn   t actually sleep much .  first thing in the morning  or  anyway  after breakfast  i went into my office  and just as i walked up to the word processor  as though it could read my mind and tell that i was so annoyed i would cheerfully have kicked it off the desk and out the window  it started working .  all by itself  mind you .  i never touched the keys .  the words appeared on the screen a lot more quickly than i could have made them appear and it began with   fault intolerant by abram ivanov  i simply stared .  it went on to write my diary items concerning itself  as i have done above  but much better .  the writing was smoother  more colorful  with a successful touch of humor .  in fifteen minutes  it was done  and in five minutes the printer had placed it on sheets .  that apparently had just been for exercise  or for practice  for once that was done  the last page i had written of my novel appeared on the screen  and then the words began to proceed without me .  the word processor had clearly learned to write my stuff  just as i would have written it  only better .  great .  no more work .  the word processor wrote it under my name and wrote with my style  given a certain amount of improvement .  i could just let it go  pick up the surprised reviews from my critics telling the world how i had improved  and watch the royalties pour in .  that   s all right as far as it goes  but i   m not america   s most prolific writer for no reason .  i happen to love to write .  that happens to be all that i want to do .  now if my word processor does my writing  what do i do with the rest of my life .   kid brother  it was a great shock to me when our application for a second child was refused .  we had really expected to get the license .  i   m a respectable citizen  pillar of the community  all that kind of stuff .  i was a little old  maybe .  josie  my wife  may have been past her best childbearing years .  so what .  we know other people worse off than us  older  trashy in character  who  well  never mind .  we had one son  charlie  and we really wanted another child .  boy or girl  it didn   t matter .  of course  if there was something wrong with charlie  if he developed some illness  maybe then we could license a second child .  or maybe not .  and if we did get the license  they would probably take care of charlie as a defective .  you know what i mean  i don   t have to say it .  the trouble was we were late getting started  and that was josie   s fault .  she had irregular periods and you never knew when to get her  if you know what i mean .  and we couldn   t get any medical help  either .  how could we .  the clinics said if we couldn   t have children without help  that was great for the world .  it   s patriotic  or something  to be childless .  but we fooled them and had a child after all .  charlie .  when charlie was eight months old  we started applying for a second child .  we wanted them pretty close in age .  was that so much to ask .  even if we were getting a little old for it .  what kind of a world do we live in  anyway .  no matter how much the population drops  they say it has to drop further  and if life gets easier and people live longer  it has to drop still further .  they won   t be satisfied till they wipe out humanity alto   well  look .  i   ll tell this just the way i want to .  if you want the story  officer  you   ll have to take it my way .  what can you do to me .  i really don   t much care if i live or die .  would you in my position .    look  it   s no use arguing .  i   ll tell it my way  or i   ll shut up and you can do your worst .  you understand .    well then  okay .  as it turned out  we didn   t have to worry about charlie being sickly  or anything like that .  he grew like a bear  or one of those other animals that used to hang around in the woods and places like that in the old days .  he came of good stock .  you could see that .  so why couldn   t we have had another child .  that   s what i want to know .  intelligent .  you bet .  strong .  knew what he wanted .  ideal boy .  when i think of it  i could  i could  oh  well .  you should have seen him with the other kids as he was growing up .  a natural leader .  always had his way .  always had the other children in the neighborhood doing what he wanted .  he knew what he wanted and what he wanted was always right .  that was the thing .  josie didn   t like it  though .  she said he was spoiled .  in fact  she said i spoiled him .  i don   t know what she was talking about .  i was the making of him .  he was two years ahead of his age in strength and in brains .  i could see that .  and if the other children got out of line  sometimes he would have to show them who was boss .  josie thought he was getting to be a bully .  she said he had no friends  all the children were afraid of him .  so what .  a leader doesn   t want friends .  he wants people to respect him  and if they get out of line  they better fear him .  charlie was coming along all right .  sure  the other children stayed away mostly .  that was their parents    fault  and they   re just a bunch of milksops .  once they get one child  and know they won   t have any more  they start hovering over him or her like they were the family jewels  and rare jewels  too .  you smother them if you do that .  they become useless  worthless .  there was this guy stevenson down the block .  he had two girls  both pitiful things  giggling and empty headed .  how did he come to get two  i ask you .  he knew somebody  maybe .  a little money passed from hand to hand .  why not  he   s got more money than he admits  too .  naturally .  that accounts for it .  you   d think with two  he could afford to risk one  but no     that   s all right .  i   ll get to the point  when i get to the point .  if you push  you   ll get nothing and we   ll let it go straight to the court .  see if i care .  these other parents  they didn   t want their babies hurt .  don   t play with the janowitz boy  they would say .  i never heard them say so but i   m sure that   s what they said .  well  who needed them .  i was planning for charlie to go to college eventually  so he could take courses in microelectronics or in spatial dynamics  or that kind of stuff .  and economics and business  too  so he would know how to get money and power out of his know how .  that   s the way i saw it .  i wanted him on top of the heap .  but josie kept talking about charlie not having friends and charlie growing up alone  and like that .  all the time .  it was like living in an echo chamber .  and then  one day  she came to me and said     why don   t we get charlie a kid brother .        oh  sure     i said .     you   re past menopause so what do we do .  call in the stork .  look under cabbage leaves .     i could have divorced her  you know .  married a young chick .  after all  i wasn   t past menopause .  but i was  loyal .  fat lot of good that did me .  besides  if i had divorced her  she would mostly have kept charlie  so what good would that have done me .  so i just made that comment about the stork .  she said     i   m not talking about a biological child .  i   m saying we can get a robot to be charlie   s brother .     i never expected to hear anything like that  you can bet .  i   m not a robot type guy .  my parents never had one .  i never had one .  as far as i   m concerned  every robot means one less human  and we   re just watching the world being turned over to them .  just one more way of wiping out humanity  if you ask me .  so i said to josie     don   t be ridiculous .        really     said josie  all very earnest .     it   s a new model .  it   s just designed to be friendly and pals for children .  nothing fancy  so they aren   t expensive  and they do fill a need .  with more and more people having only one child  there is a real value in supplying that one child with siblings .        that may be true of other children .  not charlie     i said .     yes  charlie  especially .  he   s never going to find out how to deal with people this way .  he   s growing up alone  really alone .  he won   t come to understand the give and take of life .        he   s not going to give .  he   s a taker .  he   ll take power and he   ll take position  and he   ll tell people what to do .  and he   ll have children of his own and maybe even three .     you may be too young to feel this yet  officer  but if you have only one child  you   ll eventually discover you   ll still have a chance at another one when your child has a child .  i had high hopes for charlie .  before i died  i was sure i would see another child  maybe even two or three .  they might be charlie   s but as far as our lives would overlap  i was going to make them mine  too .  but all josie could think about was a robot .  life became another kind of echo chamber .  she priced them out .  she figured out the down payment .  she looked into the possibility of renting one for a year on a kind of approval .  she was willing to use her own nest egg that her folks had left her to pay for it  and things like that .  and you know how it is  in the end you have to keep peace in the family .  i gave in .  i said     okay  but you go pick one out and you better make it a rental .  and you pay for it .     i figured  who knows .  the robot would probably be a pain in the neck and wouldn   t work out  and we   d return him .  they walked him into the house  didn   t even crate him .  i should say    it    but josie insisted on saying    he    and    him    so he would seem more like a kid brother to charlie  and i got into the habit .  he was a    sibling robot     that   s what they called him .  he had a registration number  but i never memorized it .  what for .  we just called him    kid .      that was good enough .    yes  i know that this sort of robot is getting popular .  i don   t know what   s happening to human beings that they stand for such things .  and we stood for it  too .  or at least  i did .  josie was fascinated .  the one we got was a pretty good one  i have to admit .  he looked almost human  he smiled a lot  and he had a nice voice .  he looked maybe fifteen  a small sized fifteen  which wasn   t too bad because charlie was a large sized ten .  kid was a little taller than charlie and  of course  heavier .  you know  there were titanium bones or whatever inside him and a nuclear unit  guaranteed for ten years before replacement  and that   s pretty heavy .  he had a good vocabulary  too  and he was very polite .  josie was just delighted .  she said     i can use him in the house .  he can help out .     i said     no  you don   t .  you got him for charlie  and that means he   s charlie   s .  don   t you go taking him away .     i was thinking if josie got him  and made him into a slavey  she   d never let go of him .  charlie  on the other hand  might not like him or might get tired after a little while  and then we could get rid of him .  charlie fooled me  though .  he liked kid fine .  but you know  it made sense after a while .  kid was designed to be a kid brother  so he was just right for charlie .  he let charlie take the lead  like an older brother should .  he had those three laws .  i can   t quote them  but you know what they are .  there was no way he could hurt charlie  and he had to do whatever charlie said  so after a while i began to think it was a good deal .  i mean  when they played games charlie always won .  he was supposed to .  and the kid never got mad .  he couldn   t .  he was made to lose .  and sometimes charlie kicked the kid around  the way children do  you know .  a child gets mad about something  he takes it out on some other child .  children always do that .  naturally  that gets the parents of the other child mad and i had to tell charlie now and then not to do that and that sort of cramps him .  it squeezes him in .  he can   t express himself .  well  he could with the kid .  and why not .  you can   t hurt the kid .  he   s made out of plastic and metal and who knows what else .  for all he looked nearly like a human being  he wasn   t alive  he couldn   t feel pain .  in fact  i felt the best thing the kid did was to be something on which charlie could bleed off his excess energy so that it wouldn   t accumulate in him and fester .  and the kid never minded .  they   d play judo and the kid would be thrown  and even stamped on  but he would just get up and say     that was good  charlie .  let   s try it again .      listen  you could throw him off the top of a building and he wouldn   t be hurt .  he was always polite to us .  he called me dad .  he called josie mom .  he asked after our health .  he would help josie out of her chair when she wanted to stand up .  that sort of stuff .  he was designed that way .  he had to act affectionate .  it was all automatic .  he was programmed for it .  it didn   t mean a thing  but josie liked it .  listen  i   ve always been busy  hard working .  i have this plant i had to help run  interlocking machinery to oversee .  one thing goes wrong and the whole shebang ties itself up .  i have no time to bring flowers and go mucking around pulling out her chairs or something .  we   d been married nearly twenty years and how long does that sort of thing keep up anyway .  and charlie  well  he stood up to his mother the way any decent boy should .  and i figured the kid helped there .  when charlie made himself boss over the kid one minute  he wasn   t going to run around saying     mommie  mommie     the next minute .  he was not a mamma   s boy  and he didn   t let josie run him  and i was proud of him for that .  he was going to be a man .  of course  he listened to what i said to him .  a boy   s got to listen to his father .  so maybe it was good that the kid was designed to be a sort of mamma   s boy .  it gave josie the feeling that there was one of those nerds about the house and it bothered her less that charlie always thought for himself .  of course you could count on josie to do her best to spoil it .  she was forever worrying about her pet nerd being hurt .  she was always coming out with     now  charlie  why don   t you be nicer to your kid brother .     it was ridiculous .  i could never get it through her head that the kid wasn   t hurt  that he was designed to be a loser  that it was all good for charlie .  of course  charlie never listened to her .  he played with the kid the way he wanted to .    do you mind if i rest a little .  i don   t really like talking about all this .  just let me rest a while .    okay  i   m better now .  i can go on .  after the year was up  i felt that it was enough .  we could return the kid to u . s .  robots .  after all  he had served his purpose .  but josie was against that .  dead set against that .  i said     but we   d have to buy him outright now .     and she said  she would pay the down payment  so i went along with her .  one of the things she said was that we couldn   t take away charlie   s brother .  charlie would be lonely .  and i did think  well  maybe she   s right .  i tell you it   s deadly when you start thinking your wife might be right .  it leads you into nothing but trouble .  charlie did ease up on the kid a little as he grew older .  he got to be just as tall as the kid  for one thing  so maybe he didn   t think he had to knock him around as much .  also  he became interested in things besides rough and tumble .  basketball  for instance  he played one on one with the kid and charlie was good .  he always outmaneuvered the kid and hardly ever missed a basket .  well  maybe the kid let himself be outmaneuvered and maybe he didn   t ever block a basket shot efficiently  but how do you account for getting the ball into the basket .  the kid couldn   t fake that  could he .  in the second year  the kid sort of became a member of the family .  he didn   t eat with us or anything like that  because he didn   t eat .  and he didn   t sleep either  so he just stood in the corner of charlie   s bedroom at night .  but he watched the holoviews with us  and josie would always explain things to him so that he got to know more and to seem more human .  she took him shopping with her and wherever else she went  if charlie didn   t need him .  the kid was always helpful  i suppose  and i guess he carried things for her and was always polite and attentive and that sort of thing .  and i   ll tell you  josie was more easygoing  with the kid around .  more good humored  more good natured  less whining .  it made for a more pleasant homelife  and i figured  well  the kid is teaching charlie to be more and more dominant  and he   s teaching josie to smile more  so maybe it was a good thing it was there .  then it happened .    listen  can you let me have something wet .    yeah  with alcohol .  just a little  just a little .  come on  what are you worrying about the rules for .  i   ve got to get through this somehow .  then it happened .  one out of a million  or out of a billion .  microfusion units aren   t supposed to give trouble .  you can read about it anywhere .  they   re all fail safe  no matter what .  except mine wasn   t .  i don   t know why .  nobody knows why .  at the start  no one even knew it was the microfusion .  they   ve told me since that it was  and that i qualify for full restoration of the house and furniture .  fat lot of good that would do me .    look  you   re treating me as though i were a homicidal maniac  but why me .  why aren   t you getting after the microfusion people for murder .  find out who made that unit  or who goofed up installing it .  don   t you people know what real crimes are .  there   s this thing  this microfusion  it doesn   t explode  it doesn   t make a noise  it just gets hotter and hotter and after a while the house is on fire .  how come people can get away manufacturing   yes  i   ll get on with it .  i   ll get on with it .  i was away that day .  that one day in a whole year i was away .  i run everything from my home  or from wherever i am with my family .  i don t have to go anywhere  the computers do it all .  it s not like your job  officer .  but the big boss wanted to see me in person .  there s no sense to it  everything could have been done closed circuit .  he has some sort of idea  though  that he wants to check all his section heads every once in a while in person .  he seems to think that you can t really judge a person unless you see him in three dimensions and smell him and feel him .  it s just superstition left over from the dark age  which i wish would come back  before computers and robots  and when you could have all the children you wanted .  that was the day when the microfusion went .  i got the word right away .  you always get the word .  wherever you are  even on the moon or in a space settlement  bad news gets to you in seconds .  good news you might miss out on  but bad news never .  i was rushing back while the house was still burning .  when i got there  the house was a total wreck  but josie was out on the lawn  looking a complete mess  but alive .  she had been out on the lawn when it happened  they told me .  when she saw the house become all in flame  and charlie was inside  she rushed in at once  and i could see she must have brought him out because there he was lying to one side with people bending over him .  it looked bad .  i couldn t see him .  i didn t dare go over there to see him .  i had to find out from josie first .  i could hardly speak .     how bad is he .     i asked josie  and i didn t recognize my own voice .  i think my mind was beginning to go .  she was saying     i couldn t save them both .  i couldn t save them both .     why should she want to save them both .  i thought .  i said     stop worrying about the kid .  he s just a device .  there s insurance and compassion money and we can buy another kid .     i think i tried to say all that  but i don t know if i managed .  maybe i just made hoarse  choking sounds .  i don t know .  i don t know if she heard me  or if she even knew i was there .  she just kept whispering     i had to make a choice     over and over .  so i had to go where charlie was lying and i cleared my throat and i managed to say     how s my boy .  how badly is he hurt .     and one of them said     maybe he can be fixed up     then he looked up at me and said     your boy .     i saw the kid lying there  with one arm distorted and out of action .  he was smiling as if nothing had happened  and he was saying     hello  dad .  mom pulled me out of the fire .  where s charlie .     josie had made her choice and she had saved the kid .  i don   t know what happened after that .  i remember nothing .  you people say i killed her  that you couldn   t pull me off before i strangled her .  maybe .  i don   t know .  i don   t remember .  all i know is  she   s the killer .  she killed  she killed  char   she killed my boy and she saved a piece   a piece of   titanium .   the nations in space  a modern fable  as is well known  the nations of gladovia and saronin have been enemies for many centuries .  in medieval times  each had ruled the other at different times  and each remembered  with bitterness  the other   s heavy handed domination .  even in the twentieth century  the two nations had managed to be on opposite sides in the major wars that were then fought .  in the century of peace that followed the last of the great wars  gladovia and saronin had also been at peace  but always regarded each other with a sneer and a curl of the lip .  but it was now       and the solar power stations were in orbit about earth collecting energy from the sun and relaying it in the form of microwaves to the nations of all the world .  it had utterly changed the world in many ways .  with copious solar energy  the use of fossil fuels had dwindled  and the danger of the greenhouse effect had diminished  although some excess heat arising from solar energy did produce some heat pollution  .  with copious energy and with better population control  standards of living rose  the food supply improved  the distribution of resources was rationalized and  in general  an era of prosperity and contentment was in bloom .  one thing  however  that had not changed was the antipathy of gladovians for saronin  and the dislike of the saronese for gladovia .  of course  the solar power stations did not run themselves .  despite thorough automation and the intense use of robots  it was still important for a few human beings to inspect the various stations periodically to make sure that all was running well and that tiny flecks of space debris and unexpected spurts of solar wind did not alter the workings of the computers beyond the capacity of the robots  and of the computers themselves  to correct matters .  those chosen for the task served their stints and were regularly rotated so that the effects of zero gravity could be minimized by rest periods on earth   s surface .  it was purely coincidence  then  that the space servitors  as they were called  in the summer of       consisted among others  of two gladovians and two saronese .  these traditional enemies were thrown together in the course of their work and they performed their tasks correctly  but were careful to restrict communications with each other to the barest essentials and to refrain from any smiles or warmth .  and one day  the younger gladovian  tomasz brigon by name  came to the older one  hamish mansa  with a tense smile of delight  and said     that fool of a saronese has done it this time .        which one .     asked mansa .     the one whose name sounds like a sneeze .  who can speak that foolish saronese language .  in any case  with true saronese stupidity he has miscued computer a   .     mansa looked alarmed .     with what result .        none yet .  but whenever the solar wind density rises above the   .   level  it will shut down half the power stations and burn out several of the computers .        and what did you do about that .     mansa   s eyes opened wide .     nothing     said brigon .     i was there and i saw it happen .  now  it   s on the record .  the saronese identified himself as the worker on the computer  and when the power stations shut down  and the computers burn out  the world will know that it was a stupid saronese that did it .     brigon stretched his arms luxuriously and said  with delight     everyone in the world will be furious  and the whole wicked nation of saronin will be humiliated .     mansa said     but meanwhile the energy supply to earth will be totally disrupted  and it may not be possible to restore the system to working order for months  perhaps for a year or two .        plenty of time     said brigon     for the world to wipe saronin from the face of the earth  so that our own glorious nation of gladovia can take over the territory that is rightfully ours .        but think a bit     said mansa .     with so much energy suddenly gone  the world will be too busy trying to save itself from disaster to engage in crusades .  there will be disruption of industry  the danger of starvation  the gathering of mobs of the distressed  the fighting over what energy can be obtained  total chaos .        all the worse for saronin         but the chaos will come to gladovia  too .  our glorious nation depends on the solar energy supply just as saronin does  just as the whole world does .  there will be a world of catastrophe from which  who can tell  gladovia may suffer far worse than saronin .  who can tell .     brigon   s mouth fell open and he looked disturbed .     do you really think so .        of course .  you must go to the one whose name is like a sneeze  and ask him to recheck his work .  you needn   t say you know something is wrong .  it   s simply that you were there  and you suddenly have this strange feeling that all is not well .  say you have a presentiment .  and if he finds the miscue and corrects it  do not taunt him .  it would not be safe to do so .  and do it quickly .  for the glorious nation of gladovia .  and for the world  of course .     brigon had no choice .  he did so  and the peril was averted .   moral   people always love themselves best .  but in a world so interconnected that harm to one is harm to all  the best way of loving one   s self  is to love everyone else  too .   the smile of the chipper  johnson was reminiscing in the way old men do and i had been warned he would talk about chippers  those peculiar people who flashed across the business scene for a generation at the beginning of this twenty first century of ours .  still  i had had a good meal at his expense and i was ready to listen .  and  as it happened  it was the first word out of his mouth .     chippers     he said     were just about unregulated in those days .  nowadays  their use is so controlled no one can get any good out of them  but back a ways  one of them made this company the ten billion dollar concern it now is .  i picked him  you know .     i said     they didn   t last long  i   m told .        not in those days .  they burned out .  when you add microchips at key points in the nervous system  then in ten years at the most  the wiring burns out  so to speak .  then they retired  a little vacant  minded  you know .        i wonder anyone submitted to it .        well  all the idealists were horrified  of course  and that   s why the regulating came in  but it wasn   t that bad for the chippers .  only certain people could make use of the microchips  about eighty percent of them males  for some reason  and  for the time they were active  they lived the lives of shipping magnates .  afterward  they always received the best of care .  it was no different from top ranking athletes  after all  ten years of active early life  and then retirement .     johnson sipped at his drink .      an unregulated chipper could influence other people   s emotions  you know  if they were chipped just right and had talent .  they could make judgments on the basis of what they sensed in other minds and they could strengthen some of the judgments competitors were making  or weaken them  for the good of the home company .  it wasn   t unfair .  other companies had their own chippers doing the same thing .      he sighed .     now that sort of thing is illegal .  too bad .     i said  diffidently     i   ve heard that illegal chipping is still done .     johnson grunted and said     no comment .     i let that go  and he went on .     but even thirty years ago  things were still wide open .  our company was just an insignificant item in the global economy  but we had located two chippers who were willing to work for us .        two .     i had never heard that before .  johnson looked at me slyly .     yes  we managed that .  it   s not widely known in the outside world  but it came down to clever recruiting and it was slightly  just a touch  illegal  even then .  of course  we couldn   t hire them both .  getting two chippers to work together is impossible .  they   re like chess grandmasters  i suppose .  put them in the same room and they would automatically challenge each other .  they would compete continually  each trying to influence and confute the other .  they wouldn   t stop  couldn   t  actually  and they would burn each other out in six months .  several companies found that out  to their great cost  when chippers first came into use .        i can imagine     i murmured .     so since we couldn   t have both  and could only take one  we wanted the more powerful one  obviously  and that could only be determined by pitting them against each other  without letting them ruin each other .  i was given the job  and it was made quite clear that if i picked the one who  in the end  turned out to be inadequate  that would be my end  too .        how did you go about it  sir .     i knew he had succeeded  of course .  a person can   t become chairman of the board of a worldclass firm for nothing .  johnson said     i had to improvise .  i investigated each separately first .  the two were known by their code letters  by the way .  in those days  their true identities had to be hidden .  a chipper known to be a chipper was half useless .  they were c    and f    in our records .  both were in their late twenties .  c    was unattached  f    was engaged to be married .        married .     i said  a little surprised .     certainly .  chippers are human  and male chippers are much sought after by women .  they   re sure to be rich and  when they retire  their fortunes are usually under the control of their wives .  it   s a good deal for a young woman .   so i brought them together  with f       s fianc  e .  i hoped earnestly she would be good looking  and she was .  meeting her was almost like a physical blow to me .  she was the most beautiful woman i had ever seen  tall  dark eyed  a marvelous figure and rather more than a hint of smoldering sexuality .     johnson seemed lost in thought for a moment  then he continued .     i tell you i had a strong urge to try to win the woman for myself but it was not likely that anyone who had a chipper would transfer herself to a mere junior executive  which is what i was in those days .  to transfer herself to another chipper would be something else  and i could see that c    was as affected as i was .  he could not keep his eyes off her .  so i just let things develop to see who ended with the young woman .        and who did  sir .     i asked .     it took two days of intense mental conflict .  they must each have peeled a month off their working lives  but the young lady walked off with c    as her new fianc  e .        ah  so you chose c    as the firm chipper .     johnson stared at me with disdain .      are you mad .  i did no such thing .  i chose f     of course .  we placed c    with a small subsidiary of ours .  he   d be no good to anyone else  since we knew him  you see .        but did i miss something .  f    lost his fianc  e and c    gained her .  surely c    was the superior .        was he .  chippers show no emotion in a case like this  no obvious emotion .  it is necessary for business purposes for chippers to hide their powers so that the pokerface is a professional necessity for them .  but i was watching closely  my own job was at stake  and  as c    walked off with the woman  i noticed a small smile on f      s lips and it seemed to me there was the glitter of victory in his eyes .        but he lost his fianc  e .        doesn   t it occur to you he wanted to lose her and it would not be easy to pry her loose .  he had to work on c    to want her and on the woman to want to be wanted  and he did it .  he won .     i thought about that .     but how could you have been sure .  if the woman was as good looking as you say she was  if she was smoldering so with sexuality  surely f   would have wanted to keep her .        but f    was making her seem desirable     said johnson  grimly .     he aimed at c     of course  but with such power that the overflow was sufficient to affect me drastically .  after it was allover and c    was walking away with her  i was no longer under the influence and i could see there was something hard and overblown about her  a kind of unlovely and predatory gleam in her eye .     so i chose f    at once and he was all we could want .  the firm is now where you see it is  and i am chairman of the board .      gold  jonas willard looked from side to side and tapped his baton on the stand before him .  he said     understood now .  this is just a practice scene  designed to find out if we know what we   re doing .  we   ve gone through this enough times so that i expect a professional performance now .  get ready .  all of you get ready .     he looked again from side to side .  there was a person at each of the voice recorders  and there were three others working the image projection .  a seventh was for the music and an eighth for the all important background .  others waited to one side for their turn .  willard said      all right now .  remember this old man has spent his entire adult life as a tyrant .  he is accustomed to having everyone jump at his slightest word  to having everyone tremble at his frown .  that is all gone now but he doesn   t know it .  he faces his daughter whom he thinks of only as a bent headed obsequious girl who will do anything he says  and he cannot believe that it is an imperious queen that he now faces .  so let   s have the king .     lear appeared .  tall  white hair and beard  somewhat disheveled  eyes sharp and piercing .  willard said     not bent .  not bent .  he s eighty years old but he doesn t think of himself as old .  not now .  straight .  every inch a king .     the image was adjusted .     that s right .  and the voice has to be strong .  no quavering .  not now .  right .        right  chief     said the lear voice recorder  nodding .     all right .  the queen .     and there she was  almost as tall as lear  standing straight and rigid as a statue  her draped clothing in fine array  nothing out of place .  her beauty was as cold and unforgiving as ice .     and the fool .     a little fellow  thin and fragile  like a frightened teenager but with a face too old for a teenager and with a sharp look in eyes that seemed so large that they threatened to devour his face .     good     said willard .     be ready for albany .  he comes in pretty soon .  begin the scene .      he tapped the podium again  took a quick glance at the marked up play before him and said     lear .      and his baton pointed to the lear voice recorder  moving gently to mark the speech cadence that he wanted created .  lear says     how now  daughter .  what makes that frontlet on .  methinks you are too much o  late i  th  frown .     the fool s thin voice  fifelike  piping  interrupts     thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning      goneril  the queen  turns slowly to face the clown as he speaks  her eyes turning momentarily into balls of lurid light  doing it so momentarily that those watching caught the impression rather than viewed the fact .  the fool completes his speech in gathering fright and backs his way behind lear in a blind search for protection against the searing glance .  goneril proceeds to tell lear the facts of life and there is the faint crackling of thin ice as she speaks  while the music plays in soft discords  barely heard .  nor are goneril s demands so out of line  for she wants an orderly court and there couldn t be one as long as lear still thought of himself as tyrant .  but lear is in no mood to recognize reason .  he breaks into a passion and begins railing .  albany enters .  he is goneril s consort  round faced  innocent  eyes looking about in wonder .  what is happening .  he is completely drowned out by his dominating wife and by his raging father in law .  it is at this point that lear breaks into one of the great piercing denunciations in all of literature .  he is overreacting .  goneril has not as yet done anything to deserve this  but lear knows no restraint .  he says      hear  nature  hear .  dear goddess  hear .  suspend thy purpose  if thou didst intend to make this creature fruitful .  into her womb convey sterility  dry up in her the organs of increase  and from her derogate body never spring a babe to honour her .  if she must teem  create her child of spleen  that it may live and be a thwart disnatur   d torment to her .  let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth  with cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks  turn all her mother   s pains and benefits to laughter and contempt  that she may feel how sharper than a serpent   s tooth  it is to have a thankless child .       the voice recorder strengthened lear   s voice for this speech  gave it a distant hiss  his body became taller and somehow less substantial as though it had been converted into a vengeful fury .  as for goneril  she remained untouched throughout  never flinching  never receding  but her beautiful face  without any change that could be described  seemed to accumulate evil so that by the end of lear   s curse  she had the appearance of an archangel still  but an archangel ruined .  all possible pity had been wiped out of the countenance  leaving behind only a devil   s dangerous magnificence .  the fool remained behind lear throughout  shuddering .  albany was the very epitome of confusion  asking useless questions  seeming to want to step between the two antagonists and clearly afraid to do so .  willard tapped his baton and said      all right .  it   s been recorded and i want you all to watch the scene .     he lifted his baton high and the synthesizer at the rear of the set began what could only be called the instant replay .  it was watched in silence  and willard said     it was good  but i think you   ll grant it was not good enough .  i   m going to ask you all to listen to me  so that i can explain what we   re trying to do .  computerized theater is not new  as you all know .  voices and images have been built up to beyond what human beings can do .  you don   t have to break your speechifying in order to breathe  the range and quality of the voices are almost limitless  and the images can change to suit the words and action .  still  the technique has only been used  so far  for childish purposes .  what we intend now is to make the first serious compu drama the world has ever seen  and nothing will do  for me  at any rate  but to start at the top .  i want to do the greatest play written by the greatest playwright in history  king lear by william shakespeare .     i want not a word changed .  i want not a word left out .  i don   t want to modernize the play .  i don   t want to remove the archaisms  because the play  as written  has its glorious music and any change will diminish it .  but in that case  how do we have it reach the general public .  i don   t mean the students  i don   t mean the intellectuals  i mean everybody .  i mean people who   ve never watched shakespeare before and whose idea of a good play is a slapstick musical .  this play is archaic in spots  and people don   t talk in iambic pentameter .  they are not even accustomed to hearing it on the stage .     so we   re going to have to translate the archaic and the unusual .  the voices  more than human  will  just by their timbre and changes  interpret the words .  the images will shift to reinforce the words .     now goneril   s change in appearance as lear   s curse proceeded was good .  the viewer will gauge the devastating effect it has on her even though her iron will won   t let it show in words .  the viewer will therefore feel the devastating effect upon himself  too  even if some of the words lear uses are strange to him .     in that connection  we must remember to make the fool look older with everyone of his appearances .  he   s a weak  sickly fellow to begin with  broken hearted over the loss of cordelia  frightened to death of goneril and regan  destroyed by the storm from which lear  his only protector  can   t protect him  and i mean by that the storm of lear   s daughter   s as well as of the raging weather .  when he slips out of the play in act iii .  scene vi  it must be made plain that he is about to die .  shakespeare doesn   t say so  so the fool   s face must say so .     however  we   ve got to do something about lear .  the voicerecorder was on the right track by having a hissing sound in the voice track .  lear is spewing venom  he is a man who  having lost power  has no recourse but vile and extreme words .  he is a cobra who cannot strike .  but i don   t want the hiss noticeable until the right time .  what i am more interested in is the background .     the woman in charge of background was meg cathcart .  she had been creating backgrounds for as long as the compu drama technique had existed .     what do you want in background .      cathcart asked  coolly .     the snake motif     said willard .     give me some of that and there can be less hiss in lear   s voice .  of course  i don   t want you to show a snake .  the too obvious doesn   t work .  i want a snake there that people can   t see but that they can feel without quite noting why they feel .  i want them to know a snake is there without really knowing it is there  so that it will chill them to the bone  as lear   s speech should .  so when we do it over  meg  give us a snake that is not a snake .        and how do i do that  jonas .     said cathcart  making free with his first name .  she knew her worth and how essential she was .  he said     i don   t know .  if i did i   d be a backgrounder instead of a lousy director .  i only know what i want .  you   ve got to supply it .  you   ve got to supply sinuosity  the impression of scales .  until we get to one point .  notice when lear says     how sharper than a serpent   s tooth it is to have a thankless child .     that is power .  the whole speech leads up to that and it is one of the most famous quotes in shakespeare .  and it is sibilant .  there is the    sh     the three s   s in    serpent   s    and in    thankless     and the two unvoiced    th   s in    tooth    and    thankless .     that can be hissed .  if you keep down the hiss as much as possible in the rest of the speech  you can hiss here  and you should zero in to his face and make it venomous .  and for background  the serpent  which  after all  is now referred to in the words  can make its appearance in background .  a flash of an open mouth and fangs  fangs  we must have the momentary appearance of fangs as lear says     a serpent   s tooth .        willard felt very tired suddenly .      all right .  we   ll try again tomorrow .  i want each one of you to go over the entire scene and try to work out the strategy you intend to use .  only please remember that you are not the only ones involved .  what you do must match the others  so i   ll encourage you to talk to each other about this  and  most of all  to listen to me because i have no instrument to handle and i alone can see the playas a whole .  and if i seem as tyrannical as lear at his worst in spots  well  that   s my job .      willard was approaching the great storm scene  the most difficult portion of this most difficult play  and he felt wrung out .  lear has been cast out by his daughters into a raging storm of wind and rain  with only his fool for company  and he has gone almost mad at this mistreatment .  to him  even the storm is not as bad as his daughters .  willard pointed his baton and lear appeared .  a point in another direction and the fool was there clinging  disregarded  to lear   s left leg .  another point and the background  came in  with its impression of a storm  of a howling wind  of driving rain  of the crackle of thunder and the flash of lightning .  the storm took over  a phenomenon of nature  but even as it did so  the image of lear extended and became what seemed mountain tall .  the storm of his emotions matched the storm of the elements  and his voice gave back to the wind every last howl .  his body lost substance and wavered with the wind as though he himself were a storm cloud  contending on an equal basis with the atmospheric fury .  lear  having failed with his daughters  defied the storm to do its worst .  he called out in a voice that was far more than human   blow  winds  and crack your cheeks .  rage .  blow .  you cataracts and hurricanoes  spout till you have drench   d our steeples  drown   d the cocks .  you sulph   rous and thought executing fires .  vaunt couriers to oak cleaving thunderbolts  singe my white head .  and thou  all shaking thunder  strike flat the thick rotundity o    th    world .  crack nature   s moulds  all germains spill at once .  that make ingrateful man .      the fool interrupts  his voice shrilling  and making lear   s defiance the more heroic by contrast .  he begs lear to make his way back to the castle and make peace with his daughters  but lear doesn   t even hear him .  he roars on   rumble thy bellyful .  spit  fire .  spout  rain .  nor rain  wind  thunder  fire are my daughters .  i tax not you  you elements  with unkindness .  i never gave you kingdom  call   d you children  you owe me no subscription .  then let fall your horrible pleasure .  here i stand your slave  a poor  infirm  weak  and despis   d old man .  .  .  .      the duke of kent  lear   s loyal servant  though the king in a fit of rage has banished him  finds lear and tries to lead him to some shelter .  after an interlude in the castle of the duke of gloucester  the scene returns to lear in the storm  and he is brought  or rather dragged  to a hovel .  and then  finally  lear learns to think of others .  he insists that the fool enter first and then he lingers outside to think  undoubtedly for the first time in his life  of the plight of those who are not kings and courtiers .  his image shrank and the wildness of his face smoothed out .  his head was lifted to the rain  and his words seemed detached and to be coming not quite from him  as though he were listening to someone else read the speech .  it was  after all  not the old lear speaking  but a new and better lear  refined and sharpened by suffering .  with an anxious kent watching  and striving to lead him into the hovel  and with meg cathcart managing to work up an impression of beggars merely by producing the fluttering of rags  lear says      poor naked wretches  wheresoe   er you are .  .  that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm .  how shall your houseless heads and unfed sides .  .  your loop   d and window   d raggedness  defend you from seasons such as these .  o  i have ta   en too little care of this .  take physic  pomp  expose thyself to feel what wretches feel  that thou mayst shake the superflux to them and show the heavens more just .      not bad     said wilbur  eventually .     we   re getting the idea .  only  meg  rags aren   t enough .  can you manage an impression of hollow eyes .  not blind ones .  the eyes are there  but sunken in .        i think i can do that     said cathcart .   it was difficult for willard to believe .  the money spent was greater than expected .  the time it had taken was considerably greater than had been expected .  and the general weariness was far greater than had been expected .  still  the project was coming to an end .  he had the reconciliation scene to get through  so simple that it would require the most delicate touches .  there would be no background  no souped up voices  no images  for at this point shakespeare became simple .  nothing beyond simplicity was needed .  lear was an old man  just an old man .  cordelia  having found him  was a loving daughter  with none of the majesty of goneril  none of the cruelty of regan  just softly endearing .  lear  his madness burned out of him  is slowly beginning to understand the situation .  he scarcely recognizes cordelia at first and thinks he is dead and she is a heavenly spirit .  nor does he recognize the faithful kent .  when cordelia tries to bring him back the rest of the way to sanity  he says      pray  do not mock me .  i am a very foolish fond old man .  fourscore and upward  not an hour more nor less .  and  to deal plainly  i fear i am not in my perfect mind .  methinks i should know you  and know this man  yet i am doubtful  for i am mainly ignorant what place this is  and all the skills i have remembers not these garments  nor i know not where i did lodge last night .  do not laugh at me  for  as i am a man  i think this lady to be my child cordelia .      cordelia tells him she is and he says      be your tears wet .  yes  faith .  i pray weep not .  if you have poison for me  i will drink it .  i know you do not love me  for your sisters have  as i do remember  done me wrong .  you have some cause  they have not .      all poor cordelia can say is    no cause  no cause .     and eventually  willard was able to draw a deep breath and say     we   ve done all we can do .  the rest is in the hands of the public .      it was a year later that willard  now the most famous man in the entertainment world  met gregory laborian .  it had come about almost accidentally and largely because of the activities of a mutual friend .  willard was not grateful .  he greeted laborian with what politeness he could manage and cast a cold eye on the time strip on the wall .  he said     i don   t want to seem unpleasant or inhospitable  mr .   uh  but i   m really a very busy man  and don   t have much time .        i   m sure of it  but that   s why i want to see you .  surely  you want to do another compu drama .        surely i intend to  but     and willard smiled dryly      king lear is a hard act to follow and i don   t intend to turn out something that will seem like trash in comparison .        but what if you never find anything that can match king lear .        i   m sure i never will  but i   ll find something .         i have something .         oh .        i have a story  a novel  that could be made into a compudrama .        oh  well .  i can   t really deal with items that come in over the transom .        i   m not offering you something from a slush pile .  the novel has been published and it has been rather highly thought of .        i   m sorry .  i don   t want to be insulting .  but i didn   t recognize your name when you introduced yourself .        laborian .  gregory laborian .        but i still don   t recognize it .  i   ve never read anything by you .  i   ve never heard of you .     laborian sighed .     i wish you were the only one  but you   re not .  still  i could give you a copy of my novel to read .     willard shook his head .     that   s kind of you  mr .  laborian  but i don   t want to mislead you .  i have no time to read it .  and even if i had the time  i just want you to understand  i don   t have the inclination .        i could make it worth your while  mr .  willard .         in what way .        i could pay you .  i wouldn   t consider it a bribe  merely an offer of money that you would well deserve if you worked with my novel .        i don   t think you understand  mr .  laborian  how much money it takes to make a first class compu drama .  i take it you   re not a multimillionaire .        no  i   m not  but i can pay you a hundred thousand globodollars .        if that   s a bribe  at least it   s a totally ineffective one .  for a hundred thousand globo dollars  i couldn   t do a single scene .     laborian sighed again .  his large brown eyes looked soulful .     i understand  mr .  willard  but if you   ll just give me a few more minutes       for willard   s eyes were wandering to the time strip again .      well  five more minutes .  that   s all i can manage really .         it   s all i need .  i   m not offering the money for making the compu drama .  you know  and i know  mr .  willard  that you can go to any of a dozen people in the country and say you are doing a compu drama and you   ll get all the money you need .  after king lear  no one will refuse you anything  or even ask you what you plan to do .  i   m offering you one hundred thousand globo dollars for your own use .        then it is a bribe  and that won   t work with me .  good bye  mr .  laborian .        wait .  i   m not offering you an electronic switch .  i don   t suggest that i place my financial card into a slot and that you do so  too  and that a hundred thousand globo dollars be transferred from my account to yours .  i   m talking gold  mr .  willard .     willard had risen from his chair  ready to open the door and usher laborian out  but now he hesitated .     what do you mean  gold .        i mean that i can lay my hands on a hundred thousand globo dollars of gold  about fifteen pounds    worth  i think .  i may not be a multimillionaire  but i   m quite well off and i wouldn   t be stealing it .  it would be my own money and i am entitled to draw it in gold .  there is nothing illegal about it .  what i am offering you is a hundred thousand globo dollars in five hundred globo dollar pieces  two hundred of them .  gold  mr .  willard .     gold .  willard was hesitating .  money  when it was a matter of electronic exchange  meant nothing .  there was no feeling of either wealth or of poverty above a certain level .  the world was a matter of plastic cards  each keyed to a nucleic acid pattern  and of slots  and all the world transferred  transferred  transferred .  gold was different .  it had a feel .  each piece had a weight .  piled together it had a gleaming beauty .  it was wealth one could appreciate and experience .  willard had never even seen a gold coin  let alone felt or hefted one .  two hundred of them .  he didn   t need the money .  he was not so sure he didn   t need the gold .  he said  with a kind of shamefaced weakness .     what kind of a novel is it that you are talking about .        science fiction .     willard made a face .     i   ve never read science fiction .         then it   s time you expanded your horizons  mr .  willard .  read mine .  if you imagine a gold coin between every two pages of the book  you will have your two hundred .     and willard  rather despising his own weakness  said     what   s the name of your book .        three in one .         and you have a copy .        i brought one with me .     and willard held out his hand and took it .   that willard was a busy man was by no means a lie .  it took him better than a week to find the time to read the book  even with two hundred pieces of gold glittering  and luring him on .  then he sat a while and pondered .  then he phoned laborian .  the next morning  laborian was in williard   s office again .  willard said  bluntly     mr .  laborian  i have read your book .     laborian nodded and could not hide the anxiety in his eyes .     i hope you like it  mr .  willard .     willard lifted his hand and rocked it right and left .     so so .  i told you i have not read science fiction  and i don   t know how good or bad it is of its kind         does it matter  if you liked it .        i   m not sure if i liked it .  i   m not used to this sort of thing .  we are dealing in this novel with three sexes .        yes .        which you call a rational  an emotional  and a parental .         yes .        but you don   t describe them .     laborian looked embarrassed .     i didn   t describe them  mr .  willard  because i couldn   t .  they   re alien creatures  really alien .  i didn   t want to pretend they were alien by simply giving them blue skins or a pair of antennae or a third eye .  i wanted them indescribable  so i didn   t describe them  you see .        what you   re saying is that your imagination failed .        n  no .  i wouldn   t say that .  it   s more like not having that kind of imagination .  i don   t describe anyone .  if i were to write a story about you and me  i probably wouldn   t bother describing either one of us .     willard stared at laborian without trying to disguise his contempt .  he thought of himself .  middle sized  soft about the middle  needed to reduce a bit  the beginnings of a double chin  and a mole on his right wrist .  light brown hair  dark blue eyes  bulbous nose .  what was so hard to describe .  anyone could do it .  if you had an imaginary character  think of someone real  and describe .  there was laborian  dark in complexion  crisp curly black hair  looked as though he needed a shave  probably looked that way all the time  prominent adam   s apple  small scar on the right cheek  dark brown eyes rather large  and his only good feature .  willard said     i don   t understand you .  what kind of writer are you if you have trouble describing things .  what do you write .     laborian said  gently  somewhat as though this was not the first time he had had to defend himself along those lines     you   ve read three in one .  i   ve written other novels and they   re all in the same style .  mostly conversation .  i don   t see things when i write  i hear  and for most part  what my characters talk about are ideas  competing ideas .  i   m strong on that and my readers like it .        yes  but where does that leave me .  i can   t devise a compudrama based on conversation alone .  i have to create sight and sound and subliminal messages  and you leave me nothing to work on .        are you thinking of doing three in one  then .        not if you give me nothing to work on .  think  mr .  laborian  think .  this parental .  he   s the dumb one .        not dumb     said laborian  frowning .     single minded .  he only has room in his mind for children  real and potential .        blockish .  if you didn   t use that actual word for the parental in the novel  and i don   t remember offhand whether you did or not  it   s certainly the impression i got .  cubical .  is that what he is .        well  simple .  straight lines .  straight planes .  not cubical .  longer than he is wide .        how does he move .  does he have legs .        i don   t know .  i honestly never gave it any thought .        hmp .  and the rational .  he   s the smart one and he   s smooth and quick .  what is he .  egg shaped .        i   d accept that .  i   ve never given that any thought  either  but i   d accept that .        and no legs .        i haven   t described any .        and how about the middle one .  your    she    character  the other two being    he   s .           the emotional .        that   s right .  the emotional .  you did better on her .        of course .  i did most of my thinking about her .  she was trying to save the alien intelligences  us  of an alien world  earth .  the reader   s sympathy must be with her  even though she fails .        i gather she was more like a cloud  didn   t have any firm shape at all  could attenuate and tighten .        yes  yes .  that   s exactly right .        does she flow along the ground or drift through the air .     laborian thought  then shook his head .     i don   t know .  i would say you would have to suit yourself when it came to that .         i see .  and what about the sex .     laborian said  with sudden enthusiasm .     that   s a crucial point .  i never have any sex in my novels beyond that which is absolutely necessary and then i manage to refrain from describing it         you don   t like sex .        i like sex fine  thank you .  i just don   t like it in my novels .  everyone else puts it in and  frankly  i think that readers find its absence in my novels refreshing  at least  my readers do .  and i must explain to you that my books do very well .  i wouldn   t have a hundred thousand dollars to spend if they didn   t .        all right .  i   m not trying to put you down .        however  there are always people who say i don   t include sex because i don   t know how  so  out of vainglory  i suppose  i wrote this novel just to show that i could do it .  the entire novel deals with sex .  of course  it   s alien sex  not at all like ours .        that   s right .  that   s why i have to ask you about the mechanics of it .  how does it work .     laborian looked uncertain for a moment .     they melt .        i know that that   s the word you use .  do you mean they come together .  superimpose .        i suppose so .     willard sighed .     how can you write a book without knowing anything about so fundamental a part of it .        i don   t have to describe it in detail .  the reader gets the impression .  with subliminal suggestion so much a part of the compu drama  how can you ask the question .     willard   s lips pressed together .  laborian had him there .     very well .  they superimpose .  what do they look like after they have superimposed .      laborian shook his head .     i avoided that .         you realize  of course  that i can   t .     laborian nodded .     yes .     willard heaved another sigh and said     look  mr .  laborian  assuming that i agree to do such a compu drama  and i have not yet made up my mind on the matter  i would have to do it entirely my way .  i would tolerate no interference from you .  you have ducked so many of your own responsibilities in writing the book that i can   t allow you to decide suddenly that you want to participate in my creative endeavors .        that   s quite understood  mr .  willard .  i only ask that you keep my story and as much of my dialogue as you can .  all of the visual  sonic  and subliminal aspects i am willing to leave entirely in your hands .        you understand that this is not a matter of a verbal agreement which someone in our industry  about a century and a half ago  described as not worth the paper it was written on .  there will have to be a written contract made firm by my lawyers that will exclude you from participation .        my lawyers will be glad to look over it  but i assure you i am not going to quibble .        and      said willard severely     i will want an advance on the money you offered me .  i can   t afford to have you change your mind on me and i am not in the mood for a long lawsuit .     at this  laborian frowned .  he said     mr .  willard  those who know me never question my financial honesty .  you don   t know me so i   ll permit the remark  but please don   t repeat it .  how much of an advance do you wish .        half     said willard  briefly .  laborian said     i will do better than that .  once you have obtained the necessary commitments from those who will be willing to put up the money for the compu drama and once the contract between us is drawn up  then i will give you every cent of the hundred thousand dollars even before you begin the first scene of the book .     willard   s eyes opened wide and he could not prevent himself from saying     why .        because i want to urge you on .  what   s more  if the compu drama turns out to be too hard to do  if it won   t work  or if you turn out something that will not do  my hard luck  you can keep the hundred thousand .  it   s a risk i   m ready to take .        why .  what   s the catch .        no catch .  i   m gambling on immorality .  i   m a popular writer but i have never heard anyone call me a great one .  my books are very likely to die with me .  do three in one as a compu drama and do it well and that at least might live on  and make my name ring down through the ages     he smiled ruefully     or at least some ages .  however         ah     said willard .     now we come to it .        well  yes .  i have a dream that i   m willing to risk a great deal for  but i   m not a complete fool .  i will give you the hundred thousand i promised before you start and if the thing doesn   t work out you can keep it  but the payment will be electronic .  it  however  you turn out a product that satisfies me  then you will return the electronic gift and i will give you the hundred thousand globo dollars in gold pieces .  you have nothing to lose except that to an artist like yourself  gold must be more dramatic and worthwhile than blips in a finance card .      and laborian smiled gently .  willard said     understand  mr .  laborian .  i would be taking a risk  too .  i risk losing a great deal of time and effort that i might have devoted to a more likely project .  i risk producing a docudrama that will be a failure and that will tarnish the reputation i have built up with lear .  in my business  you   re only as good as your most recent product .  i will consult various people         on a confidential basis  please .        of course .  and i will do a bit of deep consideration .  i am willing to go along with your proposition for now  but you mustn   t think of it as a definite commitment .  not yet .  we will talk further .      jonas willard and meg cathcart sat together over lunch in meg   s apartment .  they were at their coffee when willard said  with apparent reluctance as one who broaches a subject he would rather not     have you read the book .         yes  i have .        and what did you think .        i don   t know     said cathcart peering at him from under the dark  reddish hair she wore clustered over her forehead .      at least not enough to judge .        you   re not a science fiction buff either  then .        well  i   ve read science fiction  mostly sword and sorcery  but nothing like three in one .  i   ve heard of laborian  though .  he does what they call    hard science fiction .           it   s hard enough .  i don   t see how i can do it .  that book  whatever its virtues  just isn   t me .     cathcart fixed him with a sharp glance .     how do you know it isn   t you .        listen  it   s important to know what you can   t do .        and you were born knowing you can   t do science fiction .        i have an instinct in these things .        so you say .  why don   t you think what you might do with those three undescribed characters  and what you would want subliminally  before you let your instinct tell you what you can and can   t do .  for instance  how would you do the parental  who is referred to constantly as    he    even though it   s the parental who bears the children .  that struck me as jackassy  if you must know .        no  no     said willard  at once .     i accept the    he .     laborian might have invented a third pronoun  but it would have made no sense and the reader would have gagged on it .  instead  he reserved the pronoun     she     for the emotional .  she   s the central character  differing from the other two enormously .  the use of    she    for her and only for her focuses the reader   s attention on her  and it   s on her that the reader   s attention must focus .  what   s more  it   s on her that the viewer   s attention must focus in the compu drama .        then you have been thinking of it .      she grinned  impishly .     i wouldn   t have known if i hadn   t needled you .     willard stirred uneasily .      actually  laborian said something of the sort  so i can   t lay claim to complete creativity here .  but let   s get back to the parental .  i want to talk about these things to you because everything is going to depend on subliminal suggestion  if i do try to do this thing .  the parental is a block  a rectangle .        a right parallelepiped  i think they would call it in solid geometry .        come on .  i don   t care what they call it in solid geometry .  the point is we can   t just have a block .  we have to give it personality .  the parental is a    he    who bears children  so we have to get across an epicene quality .  the voice has to be neither clearly masculine nor feminine .  i   m not sure that i have in mind exactly the timbre and sound i will need  but that will be for the voice recorder and myself to work out by trial and error  i think .  of course  the voice isn   t the only thing .        what else .        the feet .  the parental moves about  but there is no description of any limbs .  he has to have the equivalent of arms  there are things he does .  he obtains an energy source that he feeds the emotional  so we   ll have to evolve arms that are alien but that are arms .  and we need legs .  and a number of sturdy  stumpy legs that move rapidly .        like a caterpillar .  or a centipede .     willard winced .     those aren   t pleasant comparisons  are they .        well  it would be my job to subliminate  if i may use the expression  a centipede  so to speak  without showing one .  just the notion of a series of legs  a double fading row of parentheses  just on and off as a kind of visual leitmotiv for the parental  whenever he appears .        i see what you mean .  we   ll have to try it out and see what we can get away with .  the rational is ovoid .  laborian admitted it might be egg shaped .  we can imagine him progressing by rolling but i find that completely inappropriate .  the rational is mind proud  dignified .  we can   t make him do anything laughable  and rolling would be laughable .        we could have him with a flat bottom slightly curved  and he could slide along it  like a penguin belly whopping .        or like a snail on a layer of grease .  no .  that would be just as bad .  i had thought of having three legs extrude .  in other words  when he is at rest  he would be smoothly ovoid and proud of it  but when he is moving three stubby legs emerge and he can walk on them .        why three .        it carries on the three motif  three sexes  you know .  it could be a kind of hopping run .  the foreleg digs in and holds firm and the two hind legs come along on each side .        like a three legged kangaroo .        yes .  can you subliminate a kangaroo .        i can try .        the emotional  of course  is the hardest of the three .  what can you do with something that may be nothing but a coherent cloud of gas .     cathcart considered .     what about giving the impression of draperies containing nothing .  they would be moving about wraithlike  just as you presented lear in the storm scene .  she would be wind  she would be air  she would be the filmy  foggy draperies that would represent that .     willard felt himself drawn to the suggestion .     hey  that   s not bad  meg .  for the subliminal effect  could you do helen of troy .        helen of troy .        yes .  to the rational and parental  the emotional is the most beautiful thing ever invented .  they   re crazy about her .  there   s this strong  almost unbearable sexual attraction  their kind of sex  and we   ve got to make the audience aware of it in their terms .  if you can somehow get across a statuesque greek woman  with bound hair and draperies  the draperies would exactly fit what we   re imagining for the emotional  and make it look like the paintings and sculptures everyone is familiar with  that would be the emotional   s leitmotiv .        you don   t ask simple things .  the slightest intrusion of a human figure will destroy the mood .        you don   t intrude a human figure .  just the suggestion of one .  it   s important .  a human figure  in actual fact  may destroy the mood  but we   ll have to suggest human figures throughout .  the audience has to think of these odd things as human beings .  no mistake .        i   ll think about it     said cathcart  dubiously .     which brings us to another thing .  the melting .  the triple sex of these things .  i gather they superimpose .  i gather from the book that the emotional is the key to that .  the parental and rational can   t melt without her .  she   s the essential part of the process .  but  of course  that fool  laborian  doesn   t describe it in detail .  well  we can   t have the rational and parental running toward the emotional and jumping on her .  that would kill the drama at once no matter what else we might do .        i agree .        what we must do  then  and this is off the top of my head  is to have the emotional expand  the draperies move out and enswathe  if that   s the word  both parental and rational .  they are obscured by the draperies and we don   t see exactly how it   s done but they get closer and closer until they superimpose .        we   ll have to emphasize the drapery     said cathcart .     we   ll have to make it as graceful as possible in order to get across the beauty of it  and not just the eroticism .  we   ll have to have music .        not the romeo and juliet overture  please .  a slow waltz  perhaps  because the melting takes a long time .  and not a familiar one .  i don   t want the audience humming along with it .  in fact  it would be best if it comes in occasional bits so that the audience gets the impression of a waltz  rather than actually hearing it .        we can   t see how to do it  until we try it and see what works .        everything i say now is a first order suggestion that may have to be yanked about this way and that under the pressure of actual events .  and what about the orgasm .  we   ll have to indicate that somehow .        color .        hmm .        better than sound  jonas .  you can   t have an explosion .  i wouldn   t want some kind of eruption  either .  color .  silent color .  that might do it .        what color  .  i don   t want a blinding flash  either .         no .  you might try a delicate pink  very slowly darkening  and then toward the end suddenly becoming a deep  deep red .        i   m not sure .  we   ll have to try it out .  it must be unmistakable and moving and not make the audience giggle or feel embarrassed .  i can see ourselves running through every color change in the spectrum  and  in the end  finding that it will depend on what you do subliminally .  and that brings us to the triple beings .        the what .        you know .  after the last melting  the superimposition remains permanent and we have the adult form that is all three components together .  there  i think  we   ll have to make them more human .  not human  mind you .  just more human .  a faint suggestion of human form  not just subliminal  either .  we   ll need a voice that is somehow reminiscent of all three  and i don   t know how the recorder can make that work .  fortunately  the triple beings don   t appear much in the story .     willard shook his head .      and that brings us to the rough fact that the compu drama might not be a possible project at all .        why not .  you seem to have been offering potential solutions of all kinds for the various problems .        not for the essential part .  look .  in king lear  we had human characters  more than human characters .  you had searing emotions .  what have we got here .  we have funny little cubes and ovals and drapery .  tell me how my three in one is going to be different from an animated cartoon .        for one thing  an animated cartoon is two dimensional .  even with elaborate animation it is flat  and its coloring is without shading .  it is invariably satiricial         i know all that .  that   s not what i want you to tell me .  you   re missing the important point .  what a compu drama has  that a mere animated cartoon does not  are subliminal suggestions such as can only be created by a  complex computer in the hands of an imaginative genius .  what my compu drama has that an animated cartoon doesn   t is you  meg .        well  i was being modest .         don   t be .  i   m trying to tell you that everything  everything  is going to depend on you .  we have a story here that is dead serious .  our emotional is trying to save earth out of pure idealism  it   s not her world .  and she doesn   t succeed  and she won   t succeed in my version  either .  no cheap  happy ending .        earth isn   t exactly destroyed .        no  it isn   t .  there   s still time to save it if laborian ever gets around to doing a sequel  but in this story the attempt fails .  it   s a tragedy and i want it treated as one  as tragic as lear .  no funny voices  no humorous actions  no satirical touches .  serious .  serious .  serious .  and i   m going to depend on you to make it so .  it will be you who makes sure that the audience reacts to the rational  the emotional  the parental  as though they were human beings .  all their peculiarities will have to melt away and they   ll have to be recognized as intelligent beings on a par with humanity  if not ahead of it .  can you do it .     cathcart said dryly     it looks as though you will insist i can .        i do so insist .        then you had better see about getting the ball rolling  and you leave me alone while you   re doing it .  i need time to think .  lots of time .      the early days of the shooting were an unmitigated disaster .  each member of the crew had his copy of the book  carefully  almost surgically trimmed  but with no scenes entirely omitted .     we   re going to stick to the course of the book as closely as we can  and improve it as we go along just as much as we can     willard had announced confidently .      and the first thing we do is get a hold on the triple beings .     he turned to the head voice recorder .     how have you been working on that .        i   ve tried to fuse the three voices .         let   s hear .  all right  everyone quiet .        i   ll give you the parental first     said the recorder .  there came a thin  tenor voice  out of key with the blockish figure that the image man had produced .  willard winced slightly at the mismatch  but the parental was mismatched  a masculine mother .  the rational  rocking slowly back and forth  had a somewhat self important voice  enunciation over careful  and it was a light baritone .  willard interrupted .     less rocking in the rational .  we don   t want the audience to become seasick .  he rocks when he is deep in thought  and not all the time .     he then nodded his head at dua   s draperies  which seemed quite successful  as did her clear and infinitely sweet soprano voice .     she must never shriek     said willard  severely     not even when she is in a passion .        she won   t     said the recorder .     the trick is  though  to blend the voices in setting up the triple being  in having each one distantly identifiable .     all three voices sounded softly  the words not clear .  they seemed to melt into each other and then the voice could be heard enunciating .  willard shook his head in immediate discontent .     no  that won   t do at all .  we can   t have three voices in a kind of intimate patchwork .  we   d be making the triple being a figure of fun .  we need one voice which somehow suggests all three .     the voice recorder was clearly offended .     it   s easy to say that .  how do you suggest we do it .        i do it     said willard  brutally     by ordering you to do it .  i   ll tell you when you have it .  and cathcart  where is cathcart .        here i am     she said  emerging from behind her instrumentation .     where i   m supposed to be .        i don   t like the sublimination  cathcart .  i gather you tried to give the impression of cerebral convolutions .        for intelligence .  the triple beings represent the intelligence peak of these aliens .        yes  i understand  but what you managed to do was to give the impression of worms .  you   ll have to think of something else .  and i don   t like the appearance of the triple being  either .  he looks just like a big rational .        he is like a big rational     said one of the imagists .     is he described in the book that way .     asked willard  sharply .     not in so many words  but the impression i get         never mind your impression .  i   ll make the decisions .     willard grew fouler tempered as the day wore on .  at least twice he had difficulty controlling his passion  the second time coming when he happened to notice someone watching the proceedings from a spot at one edge of the lot .  he strode toward him angrily .     what are you doing here .     it was laborian  who answered quietly     watching .         our contract states         that i am to interfere in the proceedings in no way .  it does not say i cannot watch quietly .        you   ll get upset if you do .  this is the way preparing a compudrama works .  there are lots of glitches to overcome and it would be upsetting to the company to have the author watching and disapproving .        i   m not disapproving .  i   m here only to answer questions if you care to ask them .        questions .  what kind of questions .     laborian shrugged .     i don   t know .  something might puzzle you and you might want a suggestion .        i see     said willard  with heavy irony     so you can teach me my business .        no  so i can answer your questions .        well  i have one .        very well     and laborian produced a small cassette recorder .     if you   ll just speak into this and say that you are asking me a question and wish me to answer without prejudicing the contract  we   re in business .     willard paused for a considerable time  staring at laborian as though he suspected trickery of some sort  then he spoke into the cassette .     very well     said laborian .     what   s your question .        did you have anything in mind for the appearance of the triple being in the book .        not a thing     said laborian  cheerfully .     how could you do that .     willard   s voice trembled as though he were holding back a final    you idiot    by main force .     easily .  what i don   t describe  the reader supplies in his own mind .  each reader does it differently to suit himself  i presume .  that   s the advantage of writing .  a compu drama would have an enormously larger audience than a book could have  but you must pay for that by having to present an image .        i understand that     said willard .     so much for the question  then .        not at all .  i have a suggestion .        like what .        like a head .  give the triple being a head .  the parental has no head  nor the rational  nor the emotional  but all three look up to the triple beings as creatures of intelligence beyond their own .  that is the entire difference between the triple beings and the three separates .  intelligence .        a head .        yes .  we associate intelligence with heads .  the head contains the brain  it contains the sense organs .  omit the head and we cannot believe in intelligence .  the headless oysters or clams are mollusks that seem no more intelligent to us than a spring of grass would be  but the related octopus  also a mollusk  we accept as possibly intelligent because it has a head  and eyes .  give the triple being eyes  too .     work had  of course  ceased on the set .  everyone had gathered in as closely as they thought judicious to listen to the conversation between director and author .  willard said     what kind of head .        your choice .  all you need is a bulge suggesting a head .  and eyes .  the viewer is sure to get the idea .     willard turned away  shouting     well  get back to work .  who called a vacation .  where are the imagists .  back to the machine and begin trying out heads .     he turned suddenly and said  in an almost surly fashion  to laborian .     thank you .         only if it works     said laborian  shrugging .  the rest of the day was spent in testing heads  searching for one that was not a humorous bulge  and not an unimaginative copy of the human head  and eyes that were not astonished circles or vicious slits .  then  finally  willard called a halt and growled     we   ll try again tomorrow .  if anyone gets any brilliant thoughts overnight  give them to meg cathcart .  she   ll pass on to me any that are worth it .     and he added  in an annoyed mutter     i suppose she   ll have to remain silent .      willard was right and wrong .  he was right .  there were no brilliant ideas handed to him  but he was wrong for he had one of his own .  he said to cathcart     listen  can you get across a top hat .        a what .        the sort of thing they wore in victorian times .  look  when the parental invades the lair of the triple beings to steal an energy source  he   s not an impressive sight in himself  but you told me you could just get across the idea of a helmet and a long line that will give the notion of a spear .  he   ll be on a knightly quest .        yes  i know     she said     but it might not work .  we   ll have to try it out .        of course  but that points the direction .  if you have just a suggestion of a top hat  it will give the impression of the triple being as an aristocrat .  the exact shape of the head and eyes becomes less crucial in that case .  can it be done .        anything can be done .  the question is  will it work .         we   ll try it .     and as it happened  one thing led to another .  the suggestion of the top hat caused the voice recorder to say     why not give the triple being a british accent .      willard was caught off guard .     why .        well  the british have a language with more tones than we do .  at least  the upper classes do .  the american version of english tends to be flat  and that   s true of the separates  too .  if the triple being spoke british rather than english  his voice could rise and fall with the words  tenor and baritone and even an occasional soprano squeak .  that   s what we would want to indicate with the three voices out of which his voice was formed .        can you do that .     said willard .     i think so .        then we   ll try .  not bad  if it works .      it was interesting to see how the entire group found themselves engaged in the emotional .  the scene in particular where the emotional was fleeing across the face of the planet  where she had her brief set to with the other emotionals caught at everyone .  willard said tensely     this is going to be one of the great dramatic scenes .  we   ll put it out as widely as we can .  it   s going to be draperies  draperies  draperies  but they must not be entangled one with the other .  each one must be distinct .  even when you rush the emotionals in toward the audience i want each set of draperies to be a different off white .  and i want dua   s drapery to be distinct from all of them .  i want her to glitter a little  just to be different  and because she   s our emotional .  got it .        got it     said the leading imagist .     we   ll handle it .        and another thing .  all the other emotionals twitter .  they   re birds .  our emotional doesn   t twitter  and she despises the rest because she   s more intelligent than they are and she knows it .  and when she   s fleeing      he paused  and brooded a bit .     is there any way we can get away from the    ride of the valkyries    .        we don   t want to     said the soundman promptly .     nothing better for the purpose has ever been written .     cathcart said     yes  but we   ll only have snatches of it now and then .  hearing a few bars has the effect of the whole  and i can insert the hint of tossing manes .        manes .     said willard  dubiously .     absolutely .  three thousand years of experience with horses has pinned us down to the galloping stallion as the epitome of wild speed .  all our mechanical devices are too static  however fast they go .  and i can arrange to have the manes just match  emphasize  and punctuate the flowing of the draperies .        that sounds good .  we   ll try it .      willard knew where the final stumbling block would be found .  the last melting .  he called the troupe together to lecture them  partly to make sure they understood what it was they were all doing now  partly to put off the time of reckoning when they would actually try to put it all into sound  image  and sublimination .  he said      all right  the emotional   s interest is in saving the other world  earth  only because she can   t bear the thought of the meaningless destruction of intelligent beings .  she knows the triple beings are carrying through a scientific project  necessary for the welfare of her world and caring nothing for the danger into which it puts the alien world  us .     she tries to warn the alien world and fails .  she knows  at last  that the whole purpose of melting is to produce a new set of rational  emotional and parental  and then  with that done  there is a final melting that would turn the original set into a triple being .  do you have that .  it s a sort of larval form of separates and an adult form of triples .     but the emotional doesn t want to melt .  she doesn t want to produce the new generation .  most of all  she doesn t want to become a triple being and participate in what she considers their work of destruction .  she is  however  tricked into the final melt and realizes too late that she is not only going to be a triple being but a triple being who will be  more than any other  responsible for the scientific project that will destroy the other world .     all this laborian could describe in words  words  words  in his book  but we ve got to do it more immediately and more forcefully  in images and sublimination as well .  that s what we re now going to try to do .     they were three days in the trying before willard was satisfied .  the weary emotional  uncertain  stretching outward  with cathcart s sublimination instilling the feeling of not sure  not sure .  the rational and parental enfolded and coming together  more rapidly than on previous occasions  hurrying for the superimposition before it might be stopped  and the emotional realizing too late the significance of it all and struggling  struggling   and failure .  the drenching feeling of failure as a new triple being stepped out of the superimposition  more nearly human than anyone else in the compu drama  proud  indifferent .  the scientific procedure would go on .  earth would continue the downward slide .  and somehow this was it  this was the nub of everything that willard was trying to do  that within the new triple being the emotional still existed in part .  there was just the wisping of drapery and the viewer was to know that the defeat was not final after all .  the emotional would  somehow  still try  lost though it was in a greater being .   they watched the completed compu drama  all of them  seeing it for the first time as a whole and not as a collection of parts  wondering if there were places to edit  to reorder .   not now  thought willard  not now .  afterwards  when he had recovered and could look at it more objectively .   he sat in his chair  slumped .  he had put too much of himself into it .  it had seemed to him that it contained everything he wanted it to contain  that it did everything he wanted to have done  but how much of that was merely wishful thinking .  when it was over and the last tremulous  subliminal cry of the defeated but not yet defeated emotional faded  he said     well .     and cathcart said     that   s almost as good as your king lear was  jonas .     there was a general murmur of agreement and willard cast a cynical eye about him .  wasn   t that what they would be bound to say  no matter what .  his eye caught that of gregory laborian .  the writer was expressionless  said nothing .  willard   s mouth tightened .  there at least he could expect an opinion that would be backed  or not backed  by gold .  willard had his hundred thousand .  he would see now whether it would stay electronic .  he said  and his own uncertainty made him sound imperious     laborian .  i want to see you in my office .      they were together alone for the first time since well before the compu drama had been made .     well .     said willard .     what do you think  mr .  laborian .     laborian smiled .     that woman who runs the subliminal background told you that it was almost as good as your king lear was  mr .  willard .        i heard her .        she was quite wrong .         in your opinion .        yes .  my opinion is what counts right now .  she was quite wrong .  your three in one is much better than your king lear .        better .     willard   s weary face broke into a smile .     much better .  consider the material you had to work with in doing king lear .  you had william shakespeare  producing words that sang  that were music in themselves  william shakespeare producing characters who  whether for good or evil  whether strong or weak  whether shrewd or foolish  whether faithful or traitorous  were all larger than life  william shakespeare  dealing with two overlapping plots  reinforcing each other and tearing the viewers to shreds .     what was your contribution to king lear .  you added dimensions that shakespeare lacked the technological knowledge to deal with  that he couldn   t dream of  but the fanciest technologies and all that your people and your own talents could do could only build somewhat on the greatest literary genius of all time  working at the peak of his power .     but in three in one  mr .  willard  you were working with my words which didn   t sing  my characters  which weren   t great  my plot which tore at no one .  you dealt with me  a run of the mill writer and you produced something great  something that will be remembered long after i am dead .  one book of mine  anyway  will live on because of what you have done .     give me back my electronic hundred thousand  mr .  willard  and i will give you this .     the hundred thousand was shifted back from one financial card to the other and  with an effort  laborian then pulled his fat briefcase onto the table and opened it .  from it  he drew out a box  fastened with a small hook .  he unfastened it carefully  and lifted the top .  inside it glittered the gold pieces  each one marked with the planet earth  the western hemisphere on one side  the eastern on the other .  large gold pieces  two hundred of them  each worth five hundred globo dollars .  willard  awed  plucked out one of the gold pieces .  it weighed about one and a quarter ounces .  he threw it up in the air and caught it .     beautiful     he said .     it   s yours  mr .  willard     said laborian .     thank you for doing the compu drama for me .  it is worth every piece of that gold .     willard stared at the gold and said     you made me do the compu drama of your book with your offer of this gold .  to get this gold  i forced myself beyond my talents .  thank you for that  and you are right .  it was worth every piece of that gold .     he put the gold piece back in the box and closed it .  then he lifted the box and handed it back to laborian .   part two  on science fiction  the longest voyage  suppose you want to take a trip across the country from portland  maine to portland  oregon .  that   s roughly       miles .  a trip around the world along the equator is only a little over eight times that         miles .  to go from the earth to the moon is only about nine times the equatorial jaunt  about         miles .  beyond that .  well  venus at its closest is just over a hundred times the distance to the moon  it is about            miles away .  and right now  pluto is just about as near to earth as it ever gets  but it is over a hundred times the distance to venus .  it is about               miles away .  so far we   ve stayed in our solar system  but beyond that are the stars .  even the nearest star is nearly       times as far away as pluto is right now .  the nearest star is alpha centauri and it is                    miles away .  and that   s the nearest star .  the distance across the milky way galaxy is        times the distance from earth to alpha centauri .  the distance from here to the andromeda galaxy  the nearest large galaxy to our own  is about twenty three times the diameter of the milky way galaxy .  and the distance from here to the farthest quasar is about       times that from here to the andromeda .  what about time .  it takes a few days to get to the moon  a few months to get to venus or mars  a few years to get to the giant planets of the solar system .  but that   s about as far as we can go and have it make reasonable sense .  to get to even the nearest star  at the present state of the art  would take hundreds of thousands of years .  all that nasa has so far done in sending probes as far as saturn has been to play games in our backyard .  it is interstellar travel  trips to the stars  that represent the longest voyage .  and it is in trips to the stars that science fiction writers and readers are most interested .  our solar system is too well known and too limited .  the solar system  outside earth  is not at all likely to bear life of any kind  certainly not intelligent life .  so we   ve got to take the longest voyage and get to the stars  if we   re to find extraterrestrial friends  competitors  and enemies .  as long ago as       in the skylark of space  e .  e .   doc  smith took the first science fictional trip to the stars  and how the readers loved it .  good old doc was a little vague on just how his interstellar ships managed to cross those huge spaces  however  and  to tell you the truth  we   re not much better off now .  let   s list the possibilities     .  we can keep accelerating  going faster and faster and faster until we   re going fast enough to cover vast interstellar and intergalactic distances in a matter of months  or even days .   objection  physicists are strongly of the opinion that the speed of light in a vacuum          miles per second  is as fast as anyone can go .  at that speed  it will still take years to reach the nearest star  millions of years to reach the nearest large galaxy .     .  even if we   re limited to the speed of light  that could be good enough .  as one approaches the speed of light  the rate of time passage on the speeding object slows steadily  and at the speed of light itself  the rate of time passage is zero .  at light speed  then  the crew of a starship would cover enormous distance practically instantaneously .   objection  interstellar and intergalactic space is littered with occasional hydrogen atoms .  at light speed  these atoms would strike the ship with the energy and force of cosmic ray particles and would quickly kill the starship   s crew and passengers .  probably  the ship would have to go no faster than one tenth light speed  and at that speed the time effects are not great enough to help us much .     .  suppose we attach a kind of    atom plow    arrangement in front of the starship .  it would scoop up all the atoms in front of it  thus preventing cosmic ray problems and  in addition  gathering material to serve as fuel for its nuclear fusion engines .   objection  such atom plows would have to be many thousands of miles across to be effective .  building such things would represent enormous and perhaps insuperable problems .     .  we can evade the speed of light limit altogether by making use of tachyons  subatomic particles that move much faster than the speed of light and that  as a matter of fact  cannot move slower than the speed of light .   objection  tachyons exist only in theory  and have not actually been detected .  most physicists think they will never be detected .  even if they were detected  no one has even come close to figuring out a way of putting them to use .     .  perhaps we can evade the speed of light limit by going through black holes .  they at least are known to exist .   objection  even if black holes exist  and astronomers are not yet unanimous on this   no one is even close to suggesting how any stars hip might approach one without  being destroyed by tidal forces .  in addition  there is by no means general agreement that one can negotiate long distances quickly by going through black holes .     .  in that case  we might find some other way of leaving this universe .  we could then travel through hyperspace in    jumps    that will carry us enormous distances in zero time .   objection  so far hyperspace exists only within the imagination of science fiction writers .     .  well  then  we can submit to the speed of light limit  but freeze the crew and passengers  and arrange to have them restored to conscious life after thousands of years have passed and the destination has been reached .   objection  no one really knows how human bodies can be frozen without being killed  or whether such frozen bodies  even if retaining a spark of life  can retain it over a period of thousands of years .     .  in that case  there seems nothing left to do but to coast  to travel at ordinary speeds  considerably less than that of light  with all people aboard thoroughly conscious .  this means it will take many thousands of years to reach even the nearer stars  so that many generations will have to spend their lifetimes aboard the starship .  that may be bearable if the starship is large enough .   objection  none  really  if people want to do it .   so much for hardheaded realism .  in science fiction  we tend to have faith that problems that seem insuperable now will be solved  perhaps in ways that are utterly unexpected .  therefore we are offering you a baker   s dozen of stories  all involving starships .  in these are explored the various strategies i have described above for covering long distances  and perhaps one or two that are too far out for me to have even mentioned .  what   s more  the stories explore the effect of the long voyages on the people on board the starship  and the kind of events that might take place on them .  since it is not likely that such voyages will be undertaken in our lifetime  and certainly not completed  if the generations long coasting starship should indeed prove to be the only practical alternative   these exciting science fictional speculations are the only way we can experience  if only vicariously  the long voyages that are the quintessential dreams of the far flung imagination .   inventing a universe  why have i gone to the trouble of inventing a universe for other writers to exploit .  no  it isn   t the money or the fame .  most of the royalties and all of the fame will go  as they should  to the authors who actually write the stories in this book and  it is to be hoped  in later companion pieces .  my own return is  as it should be  miniscule .  but there are other reasons and i would like to explain them at some length  for among other things  they involve my feelings of guilt .  now guilt  for those of you who have never experienced the emotion  is a dreadful annoyance  souring one   s life and making one unable to enjoy properly any renown or riches that come one   s way .  one is bowed down by its weight and is rendered fearful of the  usually imaginary  accusing eye of public disapproval .  in my case  it came about this way .  i hadn   t been writing for more than ten or fifteen years when i began to have the uneasy suspicion that i was becoming rather well known as a science fiction writer .  in fact  i was even getting mentioned as one of the    big three     the other two being robert a .  heinlein and arthur c .  clarke .  it only got worse as the decades continued to fly by .  we were not only cursed with prolificity  but with longevity  so that the same old big three remained big for nearly half a century .  heinlein died in      at the age of     but clarke is still going strong as i write this and  obviously  so am i .  the result is that  at present  when there are a great many writers attempting to scale the mountainside of science fiction  it must be rather annoying for them to see the peak occupied by elderly has beens who cling to it with their arthritic paws and simply won   t get off .  even death  it seems  won   t stop us  since heinlein has already published a posthumous book and reissues of his old novels are in the works .  thanks to the limited space on the shelves of bookstores  themselves of sharply limited number   large numbers of new books of science fiction and fantasy are placed on them for only brief intervals before being swept off by new arrivals .  few books seem to manage to exist in public view for longer than a month before being replaced .  always excepting  as some writers add  with a faint snarl  the    megastars .        so what .     i can hear you say in your warm and loving way .     so you   re a mega star and your books are perennial sellers and the economic futures of yourself and your eventual survivors are set .  is that bad .     no  it isn   t bad  exactly  but that   s where the guilt comes in .  i worry about crowding out newcomers with my old perennials  about smothering them with the weight of my name .  i   ve tried to justify the situation to myself .   anything to make it possible for me to walk about science fiction conventions without having to skulk and hide in doorways when other writers pass .   in the first place  we started in the early days of science fiction  not only the big three  but others of importance such as lester del rey  poul anderson  fred pohl  clifford simak  ray bradbury  and even some who died young  stanley weinbaum  henry kuttner  and cyril kornbluth  for instance .  in those early days  the magazines paid only one cent a word or less  and there were only magazines .  there were no hardcover science fiction publishers  no paperbacks  no hollywood to speak of .  for years and decades we stuck it out under starvation conditions  and it was our efforts that slowly increased the popularity of science fiction to the point where today   s beginners can get more for one novel than any of us got in ten years of endless plugging .  so  if some of us are doing unusually well now  it is possible to argue that we earned it .  secondly  from the more personal standpoint  back in      i decided i had done enough science fiction .  i had been successful in writing nonfiction of various types and it seemed to me i could make a living if i concentrated on nonfiction  and  to tell you the truth  i preferred nonfiction  .  in that way i could leave science fiction to the talented new writers who were making their way into the field .  so from      to       a period of nearly a quarter of a century  i wrote virtually no science fiction .  there was one novel and a handful of short stories  but that   s all .  and meanwhile  along came the    new wave .      writing styles changed drastically  and i felt increasingly that i was a back number and should remain out of science fiction .  the trouble was that all this didn   t help .  the science fiction books that i published in the     s refused to go out of print and continued to sell steadily through the     s and     s .  and because i wrote a series of nonfiction essays for fantasy and science fiction .  i remained in the consciousness of the science fiction public .  i was therefore still one of the big three .  then  in       my publisher insisted  with a big insist  that i write another novel and i did and  to my horror  it hit the bestseller lists and i   ve had to write a new novel every year since then  in consequence .  that would have made me feel guiltier than ever  but i   ve done various things to pull the fangs of that guilt .  for instance  i have  quite deliberately  decided that since my name has developed a kind of weight and significance  i would use it  as much as possible  for the benefit of the field rather than of myself .  with my dear and able friends  martin harry greenberg and charles waugh  and occasionally others   i have helped edit many anthologies .  more than a hundred of these have now been published with my name often in the title .  what these serve to do is to rescue from the shadows numbers of stories that are well worth exposing to new generations of science fiction readers .  quite apart from the fact that the readers enjoy it  it means a little money to some veteran authors  as well as a shot in the arm to encourage continued production .  the thought that the presence of my name might make such anthologies do better and be more efficacious in this respect than otherwise makes me feel fine .  then  too  a number of novels by young authors have been published under the    isaac asimov presents    label .  in this way  the young authors get perhaps a somewhat better sale than they might otherwise have  and even  perhaps  a better break at the bookshelves .  i have even granted the right to make use of some of the themes that i have developed in my own books .  there is a series of a dozen books  for instance  that have the generic title    isaac asimov   s robot city .     they are written by young writers who have my express permission to use my three laws of robotics  and for each one i write an introduction on one phase or another of robotics .  the books are doing well  actually  and it is clear that the presence of my name doesn   t hurt .  then another way of using my name came up .  marty greenberg suggested that  rather than have writers use a    universe    i had already invented and made my own  i invent a brand new one i had never used and donate it to some publishing house that would be willing to have writers produce stories built about the concepts of the    universe     and  of course  find the writers who would want to try their hand at it .  i agreed enthusiastically .  after all  i had just devised a new background for my      novel  nemesis  one which had not been used in any piece of fiction i had written before  so i did not foresee any great difficulty in inventing an    isaac   s universe    for other writers to use .   the use of the word    isaac    in the title was marty   s idea but i snatched at it eagerly .  there are well over sixty books that i have written  by no means all anthologies  with either     asimov    or    isaac asimov    in the title  but none with    isaac    alone  until this one .   in making up a new    universe    there were some things i couldn   t abandon  of course .  we would be working within our own galaxy in which i postulated the existence of            star systems containing a habitable world  the whole being linked together by devices that made it possible to travel and communicate at faster than light speeds .  the shorthand for this is    hyperspatial travel and communication .     i have this in my foundation universe  and the other novels i have been connecting to the foundation  but from here on my universes part company .  in my foundation series and the novels related thereto  the galaxy contains only one intelligent species  our own .  all the habitable worlds have been colonized by human beings so that we  in effect  have an all human galaxy .  i may have been the first to write important novels based on such a theme  and the reason i did it was to pare away the complexities that would arise from a multiplicity of intelligences .  i wanted to be able to deal with humanity and its problems in a detailed all human manner  making them even clearer by showing them through a galaxy wide magnifying glass .  this i have ended up doing  albeit imperfectly  of course  since i am no shakespeare or tolstoy .  however  i was well aware that there was the alternative multiple intelligence universe .  we see that now constantly on such television shows as star trek and in many of the older    space opera     stories .  there we always have the risk of a failure of imagination that leads to the portrayal of other intelligences as differing from ourselves superficially by the possession of green faces  or antennae  or corrugated foreheads  but allowing these changes to leave them  clearly  primates .  you can   t really blame star trek for this  since they have to have human beings playing the roles of other intelligences  but in science fiction stories in print  having all intelligences primate  or  if villainous  reptilian  seems insufficient .  e .  e .  smith   s galactic patrol and its sequels had a multi intelligence universe that had its intelligences encased in radically different physiologies and this i found satisfying when i read the stories as a young man .  i was particularly pleased with the feeling smith labored to give of a communal mental feeling among individuals who had nothing physically in common .  it was something like this  then  that i wanted for my universe  but i wanted to make my universe more specific in its description of the different species and more concerned with the various political  economic  and social problems of the galaxy .  it was to be less space opera ish and more quasi historical  a melding to some extent of galactic patrol and foundation .  i wanted a universe with millions of planets bearing life  with the indigenous life on every planet unique to itself and with differences limited only by the imagination of the writer .  however  there are only six intelligent species  widely different in nature     .  earthmen .    .  an aquatic race  vaguely analogous to earthly porpoises .    .  a fragile  skeletal insectlike species adapted to a low oxygen atmosphere plus neon rather than nitrogen .    .  a sinuous  limbless species  possessing fringed flippers  however  that are snakish in a way .    .  a small  winged species adapted to a thick atmosphere .    .  a strong  slow moving  blocklike species with no appendages  and adapted to a gravity higher than earth   s .   the intelligences each control more than their native planets .  they can be pictured as going through the galaxy  colonizing and settling planets suitable to themselves .  in general  a world suitable for one is not particularly desirable for any of the others  and with plenty of each variety  there is no push for going to the enormous expense of modifying a planet to suit one   s own kind .  the intelligences can therefore live together in the galaxy without treading on each other   s toes .  there is nothing to fight over unless there is an inability to overcome the unreasoning dislike of one species for another because  of course  each appears incredibly ugly to all the others  and each may have social customs and ways of thought that are distasteful to the others .  yet the various intelligences need to be in contact  since trade among them is useful for all  and since advances in technology by one species may be useful to others as well  and each intelligence has its own specialities in technology  some of which are unpalatable to the others for one reason or another   and since disputes may arise occasionally and there must be some form of political social machinery to settle them .  there are even occasional dangers that might require galactic cooperation .  what   s more  each intelligence may be split up into several mutually hostile subcultures .  so  you see  the universe i invented  and which i described in considerable detail to the publishers and to the writers who were willing to chance working within it  supplies plenty of problems  some of which would certainly be beyond my imagination to handle well  and has broad enough limits to allow the writer a great deal of personal room for his own visions .  you can see how it works out in the sampling of stories in this volume  which  we very much hope  will be but the first of a series .  good reading  and if you like it  write and say so .  it will lower my level of guilt  and i can always use that .   flying saucers and science fiction  i am helping to edit a book on flying saucers .  isaac asimov .  surely  i am a leading and vocal skeptic where flying saucers are concerned .  have i changed my mind now .  do i believe in the existence of flying saucers .  that depends on what you mean by the question .  do i believe that many people have seen something in the sky that they can   t explain .  absolutely .  of course .  you bet .  seeing something one can   t explain is very common .  every time i watch a magician perform his act i see something i can   t explain .  however  when i see something i can   t explain  i assume there is a perfectly normal explanation  one that fits in with the structure of the universe as worked out by modern science .  i don   t instantly jump to the idea that there is no explanation short of the supernatural or of some far out near zero probability hypothesis .  for that reason  i have no tendency to explain every appearance of a light in the sky by declaring it to be a spaceship manned by extraterrestrial beings .  nowadays  in an effort to gain respectability  people who accept the wilder hypotheses about flying saucers call them    unidentified flying objects    and abbreviate it ufo .  on numerous occasions  i have been asked if i    believe    in ufos .  my usual answer is     i assume that by ufo you mean    unidentified flying objects .     i certainly believe that many people have seen objects in the air or sky that they can   t identify  and those are ufos .  but then  many people can   t identify the planet venus  or a mirage .  if you are asking me whether i believe that some mysterious object reported is a spaceship manned by extraterrestrial beings  then i must say i am very skeptical .  but that  you see  is an identified flying object  and that   s not what you   re asking about  is it .     mysterious objects have been reported in earth   s skies all through history .  usually they are interpreted according to the preoccupations of the day .  in ancient and medieval times and in primitive societies  they would be interpreted as angels  demons  spirits  and so on .  in technological societies  they would be interpreted as first balloons  then dirigibles  then airplanes  and then spaceships .  of course  if they   re spaceships now  then they   ve been spaceships all the time  and some people have indeed interpreted ezekiel   s vision in the bible  for instance  as the sighting of spaceships manned by extraterrestrials .  the modern surge of flying saucer sightings began on june           when kenneth arnold  a salesman  claimed he saw bright disk shaped objects flying rapidly through the air near mount rainier .  from the shapes he described  the expression    flying saucers    came into being .  nothing much might have happened in consequence  for wild reports about all sorts of things reach the news media every day and then fade out .  in this case  though  the report attracted the attention of raymond a .  palmer  who was then the editor of the science fiction magazine amazing stories .  palmer may not himself have been a piece of broken pottery  but he was certainly not averse to building circulation by means of items that appealed to crackpots .  he had shown this in his earlier work on something completely wacky that he called    the great shaver mystery .     now he took up flying saucers and single handedly promoted them into an international mania .  that is one connection  an important one  between flying saucers and science fiction .  mind you  i have a soft spot in my heart for ray palmer .  way back in       he bought the first science fiction story i ever sold  and sent me the very first check i ever earned as a professional writer .  nevertheless  candor compels me to state that for years after this noble deed of his i never had occasion to believe a word he said .  at the other extreme of the flying saucer spectrum is professor j .  allen hynek .  he is a respectable and learned scientist who has spent decades examining the evidence and who remains firmly convinced that there is something there .  he doesn   t accept the extraterrestrial spacecraft hypothesis  but he thinks that something mysterious underlies the phenomenon  which  if understood  may revolutionize science .  however  in all the years he   s been investigating the phenomenon  he   s come up with  nothing .  far from revolutionizing science  his work has not added one even marginal item to the world of physical science .  then what am i doing helping edit this anthology .  that brings us to the second connection between flying saucers and science fiction .  the whole concept of flying saucers  the whole notion of thousands upon thousands of spaceships hovering about us without ever seeming to do anything or to affect us in any way  has supplied science fiction writers with an endless supply of story material .  all of us have written flying saucer stories .  i have myself  and one of them is included in this book .  generally  we have to deal with a situation in which extraterrestrial spacecraft visit us  but keep out of sight for some reason  or decide not to do anything for some reason  or try to do something and fail for some reason  or fail to manage to convince earthpeople they are real for some reason .  you see  science fiction writers  being sane and rational  have to find some reason for so many spaceships doing nothing .  usually the results turn out to be funny  satiric or ironic  sometimes tragic .  very often  they prove to be stories that are entertaining and good  so what we have done is to collect a sizable number of them into one book for your delectation .  come  see for yourself that every cloud has a silver lining  and that even the silliest notions can undergo a sea change into something rich and strange in the hands of skilled science fiction writers .   invasion  invasion is undoubtedly as old as humanity .  hunting groups must occasionally have encountered each other  if only by accident .  each side must have felt the other was invading .  the obviously weaker side would have had to decamp .  if the matter were not obvious  there might have been threats or even a brief struggle to settle the matter .  once agriculture became a way of life and farmers were pinned in place by their farms and food stores  these same food stores became an overwhelming temptation to surrounding nomads  invasions were more terrible because farmers could not flee but had to stand and fight .  we begin to have records of early civilizations suddenly inundated and taken over by raiders .  the sumerians were taken over by gutian invaders as early as      b . c .  the egyptians fell under the grip of the hyksos invaders soon after      b . c .  we can go through an endless list of such things .  considering that those people who were invaded  until quite recent times  had little knowledge of the world outside the boundaries of their own cultures  the invasions must usually have come as unbelievable shocks  as a sudden influx of the unknown from the unknown .  this would be especially so when the invaders spoke strange languages  wore strange clothes  had strange ways  and even  perhaps  have looked odd .  as the most recent example of our cultural ancestors being subjected to the horror of an unexpected invasion  we need only go back to       when the mongols  short  squat  slant eyed  swept into europe on their hardy desert mounts .  europe knew nothing about them  had no way of knowing they were on the way  they had been ravaging asian kingdoms for twenty years  .  all they knew were that these terrible horsemen  moving with incredible speed and organization  winning every battle  smashed russia  poland  hungary  and were penetrating germany and reaching for italy  all in a matter of a single year .  and then they left and raced eastward again  smashing bulgaria en route .   they left because their khan had died back in mongolia and the army had to be there for the election of a successor .  nothing the europeans could have done would have stopped them .   but the mongols were    the last of the barbarians .     partly because of the mongolian empire that was set up  communications between china and europe became smoother .  such things as printing  the magnetic compass  and  most of all  gunpowder  leaked westward from china  and these things  for some reason not exploited by the technologically more advanced chinese  were put to amazing use by europeans .  and beginning about       the tide of invasion was reversed .  the    civilized    europeans  with their ships and their guns  fell upon the coastlines of all the continents and  eventually  penetrated the interiors until europe dominated the world politically and militarily  and as it still does  even today  culturally .   but how did the non europeans feel about it .  how about the africans who watched the portuguese ships come from nowhere and carry them off as slaves  the asians who watched portuguese  dutch  and english ships come in set up trading posts  skim off profits and treat them as inferiors  the native americans who watched the spanish ships come in and take over and destroy their civilizations .  there must have been the feeling of monsters arriving from some other world .  all invasions  however  at least of the kind i   m discussing  were by human beings .  however strange they might have seemed  mongols to europeans  or spaniards to incas  they were clearly human beings .   there were also invasions of infestations of non human types  rats  locusts  the plague bacterium of the black death  the aids virus  but these fall outside the subject matter of this introduction  and even they were forms of terrestrial life .    what if  however  the invaders were intelligent beings who were not human and  in fact  not earthly .  the possibility did not seriously arise until the time when it was thoroughly recognized that the planets were other worlds and that the universe might be full of still other planets outside the domain of our own sun .  at first  other worlds were the subject of    travel tales .     human beings went to the moon  as early as the second century a . d .  in fiction and more frequently as time went on   but there are no tales i can think of in which the inhabitants of the moon came to earth .  in       the french satirist voltaire wrote micromegas  in which visitors from saturn and sirius observe the earth  but this cannot be taken literally .  the visitors are merely voltaire   s device for having earth viewed with apparent objectivity from without in order to have its follies and contradictions made plain .  but then in       there was the discovery of thin  dark markings on mars .  this was interpreted by some as    canals    and the american astronomer percival lowell was convinced that they were artificial waterways built by intelligent beings trying to use the ice of the polar caps to maintain agriculture on their increasingly desiccated planet .  he wrote books on the subject in the     s that created quite a stir .  the british science fiction writer herbert george wells proceeded to make use of the notion and  in       published the war of the worlds  the first significant tale of the invasion and attempted conquest of earth by more advanced intelligences from another world  in this case  mars  .  i have always thought that wells  in addition to wanting to write an exciting story with an unprecedented plot  was also bitterly satirizing europe .  at the time he wrote  europeans  the british  particularly  had just completed dividing up africa without any regard for the people living there .  why not show the british how it would feel to have advanced intelligences treat them as callously as they were treating the africans .  wells   s novel created a new subgenre  tales of alien invasion .  the manner in which wells made the martians unpitying exploiters of humanity  for the sake of excitement and  i believe  satire   the memory  perhaps  of the mongol invasion  the feeling of guilt over the european despoliation of all the other continents  combined to make it conventional to have the alien invaders unfeeling conquerors  for the most part .  actually  we have no reason to think this would be so .  as far as we know  no invaders from without have ever reached earth and  for a variety of reasons  it might be argued that none ever will .  however  if they do come  there is no a priori reason to suspect they won   t come in friendship and curiosity  to teach and to learn .  yet such is the power of humanity   s own shameful history and the conventions of fiction that very few people would be willing to consider alien invaders coming in peace as a real possibility .  in fact  when plaques and recordings were placed on rocket probes designed to leave the solar system and go wandering off into interstellar space  in order that alien intelligences  if any  might find them someday  millions of years in the future  and that they might thus learn that earthmen had once existed  there were those who thought it a dangerous process .  why advertise our existence .  why encourage ferocious aliens to come here in order to ravage and destroy .  here  then  in this collection  are stories of alien invasion .  we have selected a variety of contemporary treatments of the problem  some a matter of excitement  some thoughtfully philosophic  some even funny .  they view the possibility from all angles and stretch our minds on the matter  as good science fiction should .   the science fiction blowgun  in science fiction  experience seems to show that long stories have an advantage over short ones .  the longer the story  all things being equal  the more memorable .  there is reason to this .  the longer the story  the more the author can spread himself .  if the story is long enough  he can indulge himself in plot and subplot with intricate interconnections .  he can engage in leisurely description  in careful character delineation  in thoughtful homilies and philosophical discussions .  he can play tricks on the reader  hiding important information  misleading and misdirecting  then bringing back forgotten themes and characters at the moment of greatest effect .  but in every worthwhile story  however long  there is a point .  the writer may not consciously put it there  but it will be there .  the reader may not consciously search for it  but he   ll miss it if it isn   t there .  if the point is obtuse  blunt  trivial or nonexistent  the story suffers and the reader will react with a deadly        what .     long  complicated stories can have the point well hidden under cloaking layers of material .  academic people  for whom the search for the point is particularly exciting  can whip their students to the hunt  and works of literature that are particularly deep and rich can elicit scholarly theses without number that will deal with the identification and explanations of points and subpoints .  but now let   s work toward the other extreme .  as a story grows shorter and shorter  all the fancy embroidery that length makes possible must go .  in the short story  there can be no subplots  there is no time for philosophy  what description and character delineation there is must be accomplished with concision .  the point  however  must remain .  since it cannot be economized on  its weight looms more largely in the lesser overall bulk of the short story .  finally  in the short short story  everything is eliminated but the point .  the short short story reduces itself to the point alone and presents that point to you like a bare needle fired from a blowgun  a needle that can tickle or sting and leave its effect buried within you for a long time .  here  then  are some points made against the background and with the technique of science fiction .  a hundred of them  to be exact  each from the science fiction blowgun of a master  to be modest  there are also a couple of my own stories   and each with a one line introductory blurb by myself .  now  since it would make no sense to have an introduction longer than the stories it introduces  and having made my point  i   ll stop .       the robot chronicles  what is a robot .  we might define it most briefly and comprehensively as    an artificial object that resembles a human being .     when we think of resemblance  we think of it  first  in terms of appearance .  a robot looks like a human being .  it could  for instance  be covered with a soft material that resembles human skin .  it could have hair  and eyes  and a voice  and all the features and appurtenances of a human being  so that it would  as far as outward appearance is concerned  be indistinguishable from a human being .  this  however  is not really essential .  in fact  the robot  as it appears in science fiction  is almost always constructed of metal  and has only a stylized resemblance to a human being .  suppose  then  we forget about appearance and consider only what it can do .  we think of robots as capable of performing tasks more rapidly or more efficiently than human beings .  but in that case any machine is a robot .  a sewing machine can sew faster than a human being  a pneumatic drill can penetrate a hard surface faster than an unaided human being can  a television set can detect and organize radio waves as we cannot  and so on .  we must apply the term robot  then  to a machine that is more specialized than an ordinary device .  a robot is a computerized machine that is capable of performing tasks of a kind that are too complex for any living mind other than that of a man  and of a kind that no non computerized machine is capable of performing .  in other words to put it as briefly as possible   robot   machine   computer  clearly  then  a true robot was impossible before the invention of the computer in the     s  and was not practical  in the sense of being compact enough and cheap enough to be put to everyday use  until the invention of the microchip in the     s .  nevertheless  the concept of the robot  an artificial device that mimics the actions and  possibly  the appearance of a human being  is old  probably as old as the human imagination .  the ancients  lacking computers  had to think of some other way of instilling quasi human abilities into artificial objects  and they made use of vague supernatural forces and depended on godlike abilities beyond the reach of mere men .  thus  in the eighteenth book of homer   s iliad  hephaistos  the greek god of the forge  is described as having for helpers     a couple of maids .  .  . made of gold exactly like living girls  they have sense in their heads  they can speak and use their muscles  they can spin and weave and do their work .     surely  these are robots .  again  the island of crete  at the time of its greatest power  was supposed to possess a bronze giant named talos that ceaselessly patrolled its shores to fight off the approach of any enemy .  throughout ancient and medieval times  learned men were supposed to have created artificially living things through the secret arts they had learned or uncovered  arts by which they made use of the powers of the divine or the demonic .  the medieval robot story that is most familiar to us today is that of rabbi loew of sixteenth century prague .  he is supposed to have formed an artificial human being  a robot  out of clay  just as god had formed adam out of clay .  a clay object  however much it might resemble a human being  is    an unformed substance     the hebrew word for it is    golem      since it lacks the attributes of life .  rabbi loew  however  gave his golem the attributes of life by making use of the sacred name of god  and set the robot to work protecting the lives of jews against their persecutors .  there was  however  always a certain nervousness about human beings involving themselves with knowledge that properly belongs to gods or demons .  there was the feeling that this was dangerous  that the forces might escape human control .  this attitude is most familiar to us in the legend of the    sorcerer   s apprentice     the young fellow who knew enough magic to start a process going but not enough to stop it when it had outlived its usefulness .  the ancients were intelligent enough to see this possibility and be frightened by it .  in the hebrew myth of adam and eve  the sin they commit is that of gaining knowledge  eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil  i . e .   knowledge of everything  and for that they were ejected from eden and  according to christian theologians  infected all of humanity with that    original sin .     in the greek myths  it was the titan  or prometheus  who supplied fire  and therefore technology  to human beings and for that he was dreadfully punished by the infuriated zeus  who was the chief god .   in early modern times  mechanical clocks were perfected  and the small mechanisms that ran them     clockwork      the springs  gears  escapements  ratchets  and so on  could also be used to run other devices .  the     s was the golden age of    automatons .     these were devices that could  given a source of power such as a wound spring or compressed air  carry out a complicated series of activities .  toy soldiers were built that would march  toy ducks that would quack  bathe  drink water  eat grain and void it  toy boys that could dip a pen into ink and write a letter  always the same letter  of course  .  such automata were put on display and proved extremely popular  and  sometimes  profitable to the owners  .  it was a dead end sort of thing  of course  but it kept alive the thought of mechanical devices that might do more than clockwork tricks  that might be more nearly alive .  what   s more  science was advancing rapidly  and in       the italian anatomist  luigi galvani  found that under the influence of an electric spark  dead muscles could be made to twitch and contract as though they were alive .  was it possible that electricity was the secret of life .  the thought naturally arose that artificial life could be brought into being by strictly scientific principles rather than by reliance on gods or demons .  this thought led to a book that some people consider the first piece of modern science fiction  frankenstein by mary shelley  published in      .  in this book  victor frankenstein  an anatomist  collects fragments of freshly dead bodies and  by the use of new scientific discoveries  not specified in the book   brings the whole to life  creating something that is referred to only as the     monster    in the book .   in the movie  the life principle was electricity .   however  the switch from the supernatural to science did not eliminate the fear of the danger inherent in knowledge .  in the medieval legend of rabbi loew   s golem  that monster went out of control and the rabbi had to withdraw the divine name and destroy him .  in the modern tale of frankenstein  the hero was not so lucky .  he abandoned the monster in fear  and the monster  with an anger that the book all but justifies  in revenge killed those frankenstein loved and  eventually  frankenstein himself .  this proved a central theme in the science fiction stories that have appeared since frankenstein .  the creation of robots was looked upon as the prime example of the overweening arrogance of humanity  of its attempt to take on  through misdirected science  the mantle of the divine .  the creation of human life  with a soul  was the sole prerogative of god .  for a human being to attempt such a creation was to produce a soulless travesty that inevitably became as dangerous as the golem and as the monster .  the fashioning of a robot was  therefore  its own eventual punishment  and the lesson     there are some things that humanity is not meant to know     was preached over and over again .   no one used the word    robot     however  until       the year  coincigentally  in which i was born  .  in that year  a czech playwright  karel capek  wrote the play r .  u . r .   about an englishman  rossum  who manufactured artificial human beings in quantity .  these were intended to do the arduous labor of the world so that real human beings could live lives of leisure and comfort .  capek called these artificial human beings    robots     which is a czech word for    forced workers     or    slaves .     in fact  the title of the play stands for    rossum   s universal robots     the name of the hero   s firm .  in this play  however  what i call    the frankenstein complex    was made several notches more intense .  where mary shelley   s monster destroyed only frankenstein and his family  capek   s robots were presented as gaining emotion and then  resenting their slavery  wiping out the human species .  the play was produced in      and was sufficiently popular  though when i read it  my purely personal opinion was that it was dreadful  to force the word    robot    into universal use .  the name for an artificial human being is now    robot    in every language  as far as i know .  through the     s and     s  r . u . r .  helped reinforce the frankenstein complex  and  with some notable exceptions such as lester del rey   s    helen o   loy    and eando binder   s    adam link    series  the hordes of clanking  murderous robots continued to be reproduced in story after story .  i was an ardent science fiction reader in the     s and i became tired of the ever repeated robot plot .  i didn   t see robots that way .  i saw them as machines  advanced machines  but machines .  they might be dangerous but surely safety factors would be built in .  the safety factors might be faulty or inadequate or might fail under unexpected types of stresses  but such failures could always yield experience that could be used to improve the models .  after all  all devices have their dangers .  the discovery of speech introduced communication  and lies .  the discovery of fire introduced cooking  and arson .  the discovery of the compass improved navigation  and destroyed civilizations in mexico and peru .  the automobile is marvelously useful  and kills americans by the tens of thousands each year .  medical advances have saved lives by the millions  and intensified the population explosion .  in every case  the dangers and misuses could be used to demonstrate that    there are some things humanity was not meant to know     but surely we cannot be expected to divest ourselves of all knowledge and return to the status of the australopithecines .  even from the theological standpoint  one might argue that god would never have given human beings brains to reason with if he hadn   t intended those brains to be used to devise new things  to make wise use of them  to install safety factors to prevent unwise use  and to do the best we can within the limitations of our imperfections .  so  in       at the age of nineteen  i determined to write a robot story about a robot that was wisely used  that was not dangerous  and that did the job it was supposed to do .  since i needed a power source i introduced the    positronic brain .      this was just gobbledygook but it represented some unknown power source that was useful  versatile  speedy  and compact  like the as yet uninvented computer .  the story was eventually named    robbie     and it did not appear immediately  but i proceeded to write other stories along the same line  in consultation with my editor  john w .  campbell  jr .   who was much taken with this idea of mine  and eventually they were all printed .  campbell urged me to make my ideas as to the robot safeguards explicit rather than implicit  and i did this in my fourth robot story     runaround     which appeared in the march      issue of astounding science fiction .  in that issue  on page      in the first column  about one third of the way down    just happen to remember  one of my characters says to another     now  look  let   s start with the three fundamental rules of robotics .     this  as it turned out  was the very first known use of the word    robotics    in print  a word that is the now accepted and widely used term for the science and technology of the construction  maintenance  and use of robots .  the oxford english dictionary  in the  rd supplementary volume  gives me credit for the invention of the word .  i did not know i was inventing the word  of course .  in my youthful innocence  i thought that was the word and hadn   t the faintest notion it had never been used before .     the three fundamental rules of robotics    mentioned at this point eventually became known as     asimov   s three laws of robotics     and here they are     .  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .   those laws  as it turned out  and as i could not possibly have foreseen   proved to be the most famous  the most frequently quoted  and the most influential sentences i ever wrote .   and i did it when i was twenty one  which makes me wonder if i   ve done anything since to continue to justify my existence .   my robot stories turned out to have a great effect on science fiction .  i dealt with robots unemotionally  they were produced by engineers  they presented engineering problems that required solutions  and the solutions were found .  the stories were rather convincing portrayals of a future technology and were not moral lessons .  the robots were machines and not metaphors .  as a result  the old fashioned robot story was virtually killed in all science fiction stories above the comic strip level .  robots began to be viewed as machines rather than metaphors by other writers  too .  they grew to be commonly seen as benevolent and useful except when something went wrong  and then as capable of correction and improvement .  other writers did not quote the three laws  they tended to be reserved for me  but they assumed them  and so did the readers .  astonishingly enough  my robot stories also had an important effect on the world outside .  it is well known that the early rocket experimenters were strongly influenced by the science fiction stories of h .  g .  wells .  in the same way  early robot experimenters were strongly influenced by my robot stories  nine of which were collected in      to make up a book called i  robot .  it was my second published book and it has remained in print in the four decades since .  joseph f .  engelberger  studying at columbia university in the     s  came across i  robot and was sufficiently attracted by what he read to determine that he was going to devote his life to robots .  about that time  he met george c .  devol  jr .   at a cocktail party .  devol was an inventor who was also interested in robots .  together  they founded the firm of unimation and set about working out schemes for making robots work .  they patented many devices  and by the mid     s  they had worked out all kinds of practical robots .  the trouble was that they needed computers that were compact and cheap  but once the microchip came in  they had it .  from that moment on  unimation became the foremost robot firm in the world and engelberger grew rich beyond anything he could have dreamed of .  he has always been kind enough to give me much of the credit .  i have met other roboticists such as marvin minsky and shimon y .  nof  who also admitted  cheerfully  the value of their early reading of my robot stories .  nof  who is an israeli  had first read i  robot in a hebrew translation .  the roboticists take the three laws of robotics seriously and they keep them as an ideal for robot safety .  as yet  the types of industrial robots in use are so simple  essentially  that safety devices have to be built in externally .  however  robots may confidently be expected to grow more versatile and capable and the three laws  or their equivalent  will surely be built into their programming eventually .  i myself have never actually worked with robots  never even as much as seen one  but i have never stopped thinking about them .  i have to date written at least thirty five short stories and five novels that involve robots  and i dare say that if i am spared  i will write more .  my robot stories and novels seem to have become classics in their own right and  with the advent of the    robot city    series of novels  have become the wider literary universe of other writers as well .  under those circumstances  it might be useful to go over my robot stories and describe some of those which i think are particularly significant and to explain why i think they are .     .     robbie     this is the first robot story i wrote .  i turned it out between may    and may    of       when i was nineteen years old and was just about to graduate from college .  i had a little trouble placing it  for john campbell rejected it and so did amazing stories .  however  fred pohl accepted it on march          and it appeared in the september      issue of super science stories  which he edited .  fred pohl  being fred pohl  changed the title to    strange playfellow     but i changed it back when i included it in my book i  robot and it has appeared as    robbie    in every subsequent incarnation .  aside from being my first robot story     robbie    is significant because in it  george weston says to his wife in defense of a robot that is fulfilling the role of nursemaid     he just can   t help being faithful and loving and kind .  he   s a machine  made so .      this is the first indication  in my first story  of what eventually became the    first law of robotics     and of the basic fact that robots were made with built  in safety rules .     .     reason        robbie    would have meant nothing in itself if i had written no more robot stories  particularly since it appeared in one of the minor magazines .  however  i wrote a second robot story     reason     and that one john campbell liked .  after a bit of revision  it appeared in the april      issue of astounding science fiction  and there it attracted notice .  readers became aware that there were such things as    positronic robots     and so did campbell .  that made everything afterward possible .     .     liar .      in the very next issue of astounding  that of may       my third robot story     liar .     appeared .  the importance of this story was that it introduced susan calvin  who became the central character in my early robot stories .  this story was originally rather clumsily done  largely because it dealt with the relationship between the sexes at a time when i had not yet had my first date with a young lady .  fortunately  i   m a quick learner  and it is one story in which i made significant changes before allowing it to appear in i  robot .     .     runaround     the next important robot story appeared in the march      issue of astounding .  it was the first story in which i listed the three laws of robotics explicitly instead of making them implicit .  in it  i have one character  gregory powell  say to another  michael donovan     now  look  let   s start with the three fundamental rules of robotics  the three rules that are built most deeply into a robot   s positronic brain .      he then recites them .   later on  i called them the laws of robotics  and their importance to me was threefold   a  they guided me in forming my plots and made it possible to write many short stories  as well as several novels  based on robots .  in these  i constantly studied the consequences of the three laws .   b  it was by all odds my most famous literary invention  quoted in season and out by others .  if all i have written is someday to be forgotten  the three laws of robotics will surely be the last to go .  c  the passage in    runaround    quoted above happens to be the very first time the word    robotics    was used in print in the english language .  i am therefore credited  as i have said  with the invention of that word  as well as of    robotic        positronic     and    psychohistory     by the oxford english dictionary  which takes the trouble  and the space  to quote the three laws .   all these things were created by my twenty second birthday and i seem to have created nothing since  which gives rise to grievous thoughts within me .      .     evidence     this was the one and only story i wrote while i spent eight months and twenty six days in the army .  at one point i persuaded a kindly librarian to let me remain in the locked library over lunch so that i could work on the story .  it is the first story in which i made use of a humanoid robot .  stephen byerley  the humanoid robot in question  though in the story i don   t make it absolutely clear whether he is a robot or not   represents my first approach toward r .  daneel olivaw  the humaniform robot who appears in a number of my novels .     evidence    appeared in the september      issue of astounding science fiction .     .     little lost robot     my robots tend to be benign entities .  in fact  as the stories progressed  they gradually gained in moral and ethical qualities until they far surpassed human beings and  in the case of daneel  approached the godlike .  nevertheless  i had no intention of limiting myself to robots as saviors .  i followed wherever the wild winds of my imagination led me  and i was quite capable of seeing the uncomfortable sides of the robot phenomena .  it was only a few weeks ago  as i write this  that i received a letter from a reader who scolded me because  in a robot story of mine that had just been published  i showed the dangerous side of robots .  he accused me of a failure of nerve .  that he was wrong is shown by    little lost robot    in which a robot is the villain  even though it appeared nearly half a century ago .  the seamy side of robots is not the result of a failure in nerve that comes of my advancing age and decrepitude .  it has been a constant concern of mine all through my career .     .     the evitable conflict     this was a sequel to    evidence    and appeared in the june      issue of astounding .  it was the first story i wrote that dealt primarily with computers  i called them    machines    in the story  rather than with robots per se .  the difference is not a great one .  you might define a robot as a    computerized machine    or as a    mobile computer .     you might consider a computer as an    immobile robot .     in any case  i clearly did not distinguish between the two  and although the machines  which don   t make an actual physical appearance in the story  are clearly computers  i included the story  without hesitation  in my robot collection    .  robot  and neither the publisher nor the readers objected .  to be sure  stephen byerley is in the story  but the question of his roboticity plays no role .     .     franchise     this was the first story in which i dealt with computers as computers  and i had no thought in mind of their being robots .  it appeared in the august      issue of if  worlds of science fiction  and by that time i had grown familiar with the existence of computers .  my computer is    multivac     designed as an obviously larger and more complex version of the actually existing    univac .     in this story  and in some others of the period that dealt with multivac  i described it as an enormously large machine  missing the chance of predicting the miniaturization and etherealization of computers .     .     the last question     my imagination didn   t betray me for long  however .  in    the last question     which appeared first in the november      issue of science fiction quarterly  i discussed the miniaturization and etherealization of computers and followed it through a trillion years of evolution  of both computer and man  to a logical conclusion that you will have to read the story to discover .  it is  beyond question  my favorite among all the stories i have written in my career .      .     the feeling of power     the miniaturization of computers played a small role as a side issue in this story .  it appeared in the february      issue of if and is also one of my favorites .  in this story i dealt with pocket computers  which were not to make their appearance in the marketplace until ten to fifteen years after the story appeared .  moreover  it was one of the stories in which i foresaw accurately a social implication of technological advance rather than merely the technological advance itself .  the story deals with the possible loss of ability to do simple arithmetic through the perpetual use of computers .  i wrote it as a satire that combined humor with passages of bitter irony  but i wrote more truly than i knew .  these days i have a pocket computer and i begrudge the time and effort it would take me to subtract     from     .  i use the darned computer .     the feeling of power    is one of the most frequently anthologized of my stories .  in a way  this story shows the negative side of computers  and in this period i also wrote stories that showed the possible vengeful reactions of computers or robots that are mistreated .  for computers  there is    someday     which appeared in the august      issue of infinity science fiction  and for robots  in automobile form  see    sally     which appeared in the may june      issue of fantastic .      .     feminine intuition     my robots are almost always masculine  though not necessarily in an actual sense of gender .  after all  i give them masculine names and refer to them as    he .     at the suggestion of a female editor  judy lynn del rey  i wrote    feminine intuition     which appeared in the october      issue of the magazine of fantasy and science fiction .  it showed  for one thing  that i could do a feminine robot  too .  she was still metal  but she had a narrower waistline than my usual robots and had a feminine voice  too .  later on  in my book robots and empire  there was a chapter in which a humanoid female robot made her appearance .  she played a villainous role  which might surprise those who know of my frequently displayed admiration of the female half of humanity .      .     the bicentennial man     this story  which first appeared in      in a paperback anthology of original science fiction  stellar     edited by judy lynn del rey  was my most thoughtful exposition of the development of robots .  it followed them in an entirely different direction from that in    the last question .      what it dealt with was the desire of a robot to become a man and the way in which he carried out that desire  step by step .  again  i carried the plot all the way to its logical conclusion .  i had no intention of writing this story when i started it .  it wrote itself  and turned and twisted in the typewriter .  it ended as the third favorite of mine among all my stories .  ahead of it come only    the last question     mentioned above  and    the ugly little boy     which is not a robot story .      .  the caves of steel  meanwhile  at the suggestion of horace l .  gold  editor of galaxy  i had written a robot novel .  i had resisted doing so at first for i felt that my robot ideas only fit the short story length .  gold  however  suggested i write a murder mystery dealing with a robot detective .  i followed the suggestion partway .  my detective was a thoroughly human elijah baley  perhaps the most attractive character i ever invented  in my opinion   but he had a robot sidekick  r .  daneel olivaw .  the book  i felt  was the perfect fusion of mystery and science fiction .  it appeared as a three part serial in the october  november  and december      issues of galaxy  and doubleday published it as a novel in      .  what surprised me about the book was the reaction of the readers .  while they approved of lije baley  their obvious interest was entirely with daneel  whom i had viewed as a mere subsidiary character .  the approval was particularly intense in the case of the women who wrote to me .   thirteen years after i had invented daneel  the television series star trek came out  with mr .  spock resembling daneel quite closely in character  something which did not bother me  and i noticed that women viewers were particularly interested in him  too .  i won   t pretend to analyze this .        .  the naked sun  the popularity of lije and daneel led me to write a sequel  the naked sun  which appeared as a three part serial in the october  november  and december      issues of astounding and was published as a novel by doubleday in      .  naturally  the repetition of the success made a third novel seem the logical thing to do .  i even started writing it in       but things got in the way and  what with one thing and another  it didn   t get written till      .      .  the robots of dawn  this  the third novel of the lije baley r .  daneel series  was published by doubleday in      .  in it  i introduced a second robot  r .  giskard reventlov  and this time i was not surprised when he turned out to be as popular as daneel .      .  robots and empire  when it was necessary to allow lije baley to die  of old age   i felt i would have no problem in doing a fourth book in the series  provided i allowed daneel to live .  the fourth book  robots and empire  was published by doubleday in      .  lije   s death brought some reaction  but nothing at all compared to the storm of regretful letters i received when the exigencies of the plot made it necessary for r .  giskard to die .  of the short stories i have listed as    notable    you may have noticed that three     franchise        the last question     and    the feeling of power     are not included in the collection you are now holding .  this is not an oversight  nor is it any indication that they are not suitable for collection .  the fact is that each of the three is to be found in an earlier collection  robot dreams  that is a companion piece for this one .  it wouldn   t be fair to the reader to have these stories in both collections .  to make up for that  i have included in robot visions nine robot stories that are not listed above as    notable .     this is no way implies that these nine stories are inferior  merely that they broke no new ground .  of these nine stories     galley slave    is one of my favorites  not only because of the wordplay in the title  but because it deals with a job i earnestly wish a robot would take off my hands .  not many people have gone through more sets of galleys than i have .     lenny    shows a human side of susan calvin that appears in no other story  while    someday    is my foray into pathos .     christmas without rodney    is a humorous robot story  while    think .      is a rather grim one .     mirror image    is the only short story i ever wrote that involves r .  daneel olivaw  the co hero of my robot novels .     too bad .     and    segregationist    are both robot stories based on medical themes .  and  finally     robot visions    is written specifically for this collection .  so it turns out that my robot stories have been almost as successful as my foundation books  and if you want to know the truth  in a whisper  of course  and please keep this confidential   i like my robot stories better .  finally  a word about the essays in this book .  the first essay was written in      .  all the others have appeared in      and thereafter .  why the eighteen year gap .  easy .  i wrote my first robot story when i was nineteen  and i wrote them  on and off  for over thirty years without really believing that robots would ever come into existence in any real sense  at least not in my lifetime .  the result was that i never once wrote a serious essay on robotics .  i might as well expect myself to have written serious essays on galactic empires and psychohistory .  in fact  my      piece is not a serious discussion of robotics but merely a consideration of the use of robots in science fiction .  it was not till the mid     s  with the development of the microchip  that computers grew small enough  versatile enough  and cheap enough to allow computerized machinery to become practical for industrial use .  thus  the industrial robot arrived  extremely simple compared to my imaginary robots  but clearly en route .  and  as it happened  in       just as robots were becoming real  i began to write essays on current developments in science  first for american way magazine and then for the los angeles times syndicate .  it became natural to write an occasional piece on real robotics .  in addition  byron preiss visual publications  inc .   began to put out a remarkable series of books under the general title of isaac asimov   s robot city  and i was asked to do essays on robotics for each of them .  so it came about that before       i wrote virtually no essays on robotics  and after      quite a few .  it   s not my fault  after all  if science finally catches up to my simpler notions .   golden age ahead  it seems to be an almost unvarying habit among human beings to find golden ages in the past  both in their own personal lives and in their societies .  that   s only natural .  in the first place  there   s something to it  at least in our personal lives .  to those of us who are elderly  or even in their late youth  as i am  there is no question but that there are memories of a time when we were younger and stronger and thinner and more vigorous and less creaky and could perform more frequently and grow tired less frequently and so on .  and if that isn   t golden  what is .  in general  this is naturally extrapolated to the point where whatever society was like in our teenage years is our view of what society ought to be like .  every change since then is viewed as a deterioration  a degeneration  an abomination .  then  too  there are the falsities of memory  which cast a delicious haze over the past  eliminating the annoyances and frustrations and magnifying the joys .  add to that the falsities of history which inevitably produce a greater emphasis on heroism  on dogged determination  on civic virtue  while overlooking squalor  corruption  and injustice .  and in the sub universe of science fiction  isn   t this also true .  doesn   t every reader who has been reading for a decade or two remember a    golden age    .  doesn   t he complain that science fiction stories aren   t as good as they used to be .  doesn   t he dream of the classics of the past .  of course .  we all do that .  i do it  too .  there is one    golden age of science fiction    that has actually been institutionalized and frozen in place  and that is the period between      and       with its peak years from      to      .  john w .  campbell  jr .  became editor of astounding stories in       changed its name to astounding science fiction  changed its style  and found new writers or encouraged older writers to expand their horizons .  he helped develop me  l .  sprague de camp  lester del rey  theodore sturgeon  eric frank russell  hal clement  arthur c .  clarke  and many others  and all produced stories that are among the great all time classics of the genre .  in particular  in      robert a .  heinlein and a .  e .  van vogt both burst on the scene with crackerjack stories .  let   s  however  take a closer and unimpassioned look at the golden age .  to begin with  how was it viewed in its own time .  did all the readers sit around  saying     golly  gee  wow  i   m living through a golden age .     .  you   d better not believe it .  sure  the young readers who had just come into the field were fascinated  but the older readers who had been reading since the late     s were not .  instead  they frequently talked of the    good old days    and longed for their golden age of the tremaine astounding  which ran from      to      .  i was one of the old fossils  as a matter of fact .  much as i liked the stories of the campbell era and much as i enjoyed contributing to them myself  it was of the earlier     s that i dreamed .  it wasn   t heinlein that was the epitome to me of science fiction  though i recognized his worth   it was jack williamson   s    the legion of space     it was e .  e .  smith   s    galactic patrol     it was nat schachner   s    past  present  and future     it was charles r .  tanner   s    tumithak of the corridors .     even at this very day there is an organization called    first fandom     to which i belong   and only those can belong to it who were science fiction fans before      .  and if there were golden ages before the golden age  there were also golden ages to still younger readers after the golden age .  indeed  terry carr has just published an excellent anthology of stories from      through      entitled classic science fiction  the first golden age .  how many more have there been .  i should guess that there has been one for every three year interval since the first  to one group of readers or another .  think again .  were the stories of your golden age really golden .  have you reread them lately .  i have reread the stories of my own golden age and found the results spotty indeed .  some of the stories i slavered over as a teenager turned out to be impenetrable and embarrassing when i tackled them again .  a few     tumithak of the corridors    for one  held up very well  in my opinion .  it was clear to me  though  that the general average of writing forty years ago was much lower than the general average later .  that  in fact  seems to me to have been a general rule .  magazine science fiction over the last half century has steadily risen above and away from its pulpish origins .  that means me  too .  i imagine that many people who drooled over    nightfall     the foundation trilogy  and i  robot in their teens find some of the gloss gone when they reread them in their thirties .   fortunately for myself  a substantial number do not  and there are always new teenagers entering the field and ready to be dazzled .   why has the quality of writing gone up .  for one thing  the competition to science fiction has gone .  the pulp magazines are gone .  the slick magazines scarcely publish fiction .  whereas  some decades back  science fiction magazines  with their small circulation and even smaller financial rewards  could not compete in the marketplace and could gain only raw enthusiasts  there is now comparatively little else for a beginning writer to do  few other places for him to go .  the competition for space in the science fiction magazines is therefore keener  so that better natural talents reach their pages  and set higher standards for other novices to shoot at .  i doubt  for instance  that i could possibly have broken into science fiction in      with nothing more than the talent i had when i broke into the field in      .   nor need this discourage new writers  they are learning in a better school in      than i did in      .   there is also greater knowledge of science today .  the writers of my own golden age knew very little science that they didn   t pick up from the lurid newspaper stories of the day  equivalent to learning about sex in the gutter  .  nowadays  on the other hand  even those science fiction writers who are not particularly educated in science and who don   t particularly use science in their stories nevertheless know much more about science and use it far more skillfully  when they do  than did the creaky old giants of the past .  the new writers can   t help it .  we now live in a society in which science saturates every medium of communication and the very air we breathe  and the growing ranks of capable science writers see to it that the communications are of high quality .  what do we face then .  we will have stories by better writers  dealing with more exciting and more subtle themes in a more intelligently scientific manner .  need we worry that it will all come to an end  that science is outpacing science fiction and putting us all out of a job .  no .  what the scientists are doing is exactly the reverse .  they are providing us with fresh  new gimmicks daily  new ideas  new possibilities .  in just the last few days  i have read about the discovery of gases in venus   s atmosphere which seem to show that venus could not have been formed in the same way earth was .  i have read about the possibility of setting up a modulated beam of neutrinos that could allow communication through the earth instead of around it .  i have read that the sun may have a steadily ticking internal clock with the irregularities of the sunspots a superficial modification  but what the clock is and why the modification  we do not know .  each of these items can serve as the starting point for a story that might not have been possible to write last year  let alone thirty years ago .  and they will be written with the skill and expertise of today .  these are exciting times for society  for science  for science fiction  for science fiction writers  for science fiction readers .  george  joel  and i are having more fun putting this magazine together all the time  and  we hope  you are having more fun reading it all the time .  why not .  there   s a golden age ahead .   the all human galaxy  in i        the skylark of space    by edward e .  smith appeared in amazing stories  and was instantly recognized as an important milestone in science fiction .  until then  stories involving space travel dealt almost exclusively with the solar system .  trips to the moon and to mars were the staples .  visitors from other stellar systems may have been mentioned  as in the case of the visitor from sirius in voltaire   s     micromegas     but these were trivial instances .  smith  however  introduced interstellar travel as a commonplace thing and placed his heroes and villains within a space frame that included the entire galaxy .  it was the first time this had happened and the readers devoured it and demanded more .  the    superscience story    became the hit of the decade .  smith held the lead in this respect for twenty years  although during the first half of his career  john w .  campbell was a close second .  smith and campbell viewed the galaxy as including many  many intelligent species .  almost every planet possessed them and smith  in particular  was most inventive in dreaming up unearthly shapes and characteristics for his alien beings .  this    many intelligence galaxy    is not as prominent in science fiction as it once was  but you may find it in contemporary television .  in star trek and its lesser imitations  it sometimes seemed as though a spaceship could not travel in any direction at random  for a week  without coming across an intelligent species  usually inimical in one way or another .   the visual media are hampered in their ability to represent these aliens imaginatively  for somehow an actor usually exists under the makeup or plastic .  the extraterrestrial creatures  therefore  if not human  were nevertheless clearly primate .  in this connection  though  the science fiction writer  hal clement raised an interesting question  which i think of as    clement   s paradox .     the universe has existed for perhaps fifteen billion years  and if there are many civilizations that have risen here and there among its stars  these must have appeared at any time in the past twelve billion years  allowing three billion for the first to arise  .  it should follow  therefore  that human explorers  when locating an extraterrestrial civilization  would be quite apt to find them anywhere from one to twelve billion years old in the vast majority of cases  assuming them to be very long lived  .  if they were not very long lived  but only endured  say  a million years or less before coming to a natural or a violent end  then almost all planets bearing such civilizations would show signs of the ruins of a long dead one  or possibly a series of two or more sets of ruins .  to a lesser extent  in relatively young planetary systems  the civilization might not be ready to arise for anywhere from a million to a billion years .  the chance of encountering a civilization  then  that is at some level near our own would have to be very small .  and yet  and this is clement   s paradox   science fiction writers consistently show alien civilizations to be fairly close in technological level to earth   s .  they might be a little more primitive or a little more advanced  but considering the rate at which technology advances on earth these days  it would seem that the aliens are not more than a few thousand years behind us at most  or a few hundred years ahead of us at best .  how enormous the odds are against that .  as far as i know  however  science fiction writers didn   t worry about this .  certainly  i didn   t .  since i began publishing in       when edward e .  smith was at the very height of his success  though john campbell had just retired to the job of editing astounding   i naturally tried my hand at the    many intelligence    galaxy myself .  for instance  there was my eighth published story     homo sol     which appeared in the september       astounding .  it dealt with a galactic empire consisting of the civilized beings from many  many planetary systems  each planetary system containing a different type of intelligent being .  each bore the name of the native star in the species name  so that there would be    homo arcturus        homo canopus     and so on .  the plot dealt with earth   s coming of technological age and the possible entry of earthmen     homo sol     you see  into the empire .  and now there came a struggle between john campbell and myself .  john could not help but feel that people of northwest european descent  like himself  were in the forefront of human civilization and that all other people lagged behind .  expanding this view to a galactic scale  he viewed earthmen as the    northwest europeans    of the galaxy .  he did not like to see earthmen lose out to aliens  or to have earthmen pictured as in any way inferior .  even if earthmen were behind technologically  they should win anyway because they invariably were smarter  or braver  or had a superior sense of humor  or something .  i  however  was not of northwest european stock  and  as a matter of fact  this was       remember  and the nazis were in the process of wiping out the european jews   i was no great admirer of them .  i felt that earthmen  if they symbolized these northwest europeans according to the campbellian outlook  might well prove inferior in many vital ways to other civilized races  that earthmen might lose out to the aliens  that they might even deserve to lose out .  however  john campbell won out .  he was a charismatic and overwhelming person  and i was barely twenty years old  very much in awe of him  and very anxious to sell stories to him .  so i gave in  adjusted the story to suit his prejudices and have been ashamed of that ever since .  nevertheless  i didn   t plan to have that happen again  ever .  i wrote a sequel to    homo sol     which i called    the imaginary     in which i evaded the issue by having earthmen not appear  and campbell rejected it  .  i wrote another story in which earthmen fought villainous extraterrestrial overlords  and felt that would be all right  for the overlords were transparent symbols of the nazis  and  as it happened  campbell rejected that  too  .  i continued to want to write    superscience stories    my way  however  and continued to probe for strategies that would allow me to do so without encountering campbellian resistance .  i arrived at the answer when i first thought of my story    foundation .     for it  i needed a galactic empire  as in    homo sol     and i wanted a free hand to have it develop as i wished .  the answer  when it came to me  was so simple  i can only wonder why it took me so long to reach it .  instead of having an empire with no human beings as in    the imaginary     i would have an empire with nothing but human beings .  i would not even have robots in it .  thus was born the    all human galaxy .     it worked remarkably well for me .  campbell never raised any objections  never suggested that i ought to insert a few alien races  never asked why they were missing .  he threw himself into the spirit of the stories and accepted my galactic empire on my terms  and i never had to take up the problem of racial superiority inferiority .  nor did i spend time worrying about the rationale behind the all human galaxy myself .  i had what i wanted  and i was satisfied .  i did not ask myself  for instance  why it was that human beings were the only intelligent species in the galaxy .  as it happens  it is possible that though planets are extremely numerous  relatively few are habitable  or that though many planets may be habitable  few may develop life  or that though many planets may be lifebearing  few indeed may develop intelligent life or civilizations .  nevertheless  i made no effort whatsoever to state any of this explicitly as explanation for what i was describing .  it is only with my new novel foundation   s edge  written forty years after the series had begun  that i have started to explore the rationale behind it .  nor did i ask myself  at the start  if the idea were a novel one .  years later  i began to think that no one before myself had ever postulated an all human galaxy .  it seems to have been my invention  though i stand ready to be corrected in this by some sf historian more knowledgeable than myself  .  if i did indeed invent the concept  it is a useful one  quite apart from the role it played in the duel between campbell and myself  a duel which campbell never knew existed  .  by removing the alien element  the play and interplay of human beings can be followed on an enormous canvas .  writers can deal with human interactions  only  on different worlds and within different societies and it gives rise to interesting opportunities of all sorts .  and  what is more  the all human galaxy offers a way of getting around clement   s paradox perhaps the only way of doing so .   psychohistory     psychohistory    is one of three words  that i know of  that i get early use credit for in the oxford english dictionary .  the other two  for the record  are    positronic    and    robotics .     this is not at all unusual .  every science fiction writer makes up words and sometimes they actually penetrate the language  but then english is notoriously hospitable to neologisms  which is one of its strengths  in my opinion  .  the more unimaginative and inevitable a word is  the more likely it is to be adopted  and i am not prone to making up words wildly .  thus  once the positron was discovered and named in       and once    robot    became accepted as a term for a humaniform automaton in the     s  it was simply a matter of time before the words    positronic    and    robotics    appeared in print .  that i seem to have been the first in each case is purely accidental .  in fact  when i first used the word    positronic    in print  in my story    reason     which appeared in the april      issue of astounding science fiction  as a natural analogue of    electronic     i thought the word already existed .  the same was true when i first used the word    robotics     in my story    runaround     which appeared in the march      issue of astounding science fiction .  in the case of    psychohistory     however  i suspected that the word was not in common use  and might even never have been used before .   actually  the o . e . d .  cites one example of its use as early as      .   i first used it in my story     foundation     which appeared in the may      issue of astounding science fiction .  i came up with the word because john campbell and i were discussing the course i was to take in the foundation series once i came to him with my initial idea on the subject .  i was quite frank in my intention of using edward gibbon   s decline and fall of the roman empire as my model and as a basic guide for plot ideas  but i needed something that would make science fiction out of it .  i couldn   t simply call it the galactic empire and then just treat it as a hypertrophied roman empire .  so i suggested we add the fact that a mathematical treatment existed whereby the future could be predicted in a statistical fashion  and i called it    psychohistory .     actually  it was a poor word and did not represent what i truly meant .  i should have called it    psychosociology     a word which the o . e . d .  lists as having first been used in       .  however  i was so intent on history  thanks to gibbon  that i could think of nothing but psychohistory .  in any case  campbell was enthusiastic about the idea and we were off and running .  i modeled my concept of psychohistory on the kinetic theory of gases  which i had been beat over the head with in my physical chemistry classes .  the molecules making up gases moved in an absolutely random fashion in any direction in three dimensions and in a wide range of speeds .  nevertheless  one could fairly describe what those motions would be on the average and work out the gas laws from those average motions with an enormous degree of precision .  in other words  although one couldn   t possibly predict what a single molecule would do  one could accurately predict what umptillions of them would do .  so i applied that notion to human beings .  each individual human being might have    free will     but a huge mob of them should behave with some sort of predictability  and the analysis of    mob behavior    was my psychohistory .  there were two conditions that i had to set up in order to make it work  and they were not chosen carelessly .  i picked them in order to make psychohistory more like kinetic theory .  first  i had to deal with a large number of human beings  as kinetic theory worked with a large number of molecules .  neither would work for small numbers .  it is for that reason that i had the galactic empire consist of twenty five million worlds  each with an average population of four billion .  that meant a total human population of one hundred quadrillion .   in my heart  i didn   t think that was enough  but i didn   t want to place any greater strain on the suspension of disbelief than i absolutely had to .   second  i had to retain the    randomness    factor .  i couldn   t expect human beings to behave as randomly as molecules  but they might approach such behavior if they had no idea as to what was expected of them .  so it was necessary to suppose that human beings in general did not know what the predictions of psychohistory were and therefore would not tailor their activities to suit .  much later in the game  i thought of a third condition that i didn   t think of earlier simply because i had taken it so completely for granted .  the kinetic theory assumes that gases are made up of nothing but molecules  and psychohistory will only work if the hosts of intelligence are made up of nothing but human beings .  in other words  the presence of aliens with non human intelligence might well bollix the works .  this situation may actually develop in future books of the foundation series  but so far i have stayed clear of non human intelligences in my galactic empire  partly because campbell and i disagreed fundamentally on what their role would be if they existed and since neither of us would give in  .  eventually  i thought that my psycho history would fade out of human consciousness because the term came to be used by psychiatrists for the study of the psychiatric background of individuals  such as woodrow wilson  sigmund freud  or adolf hitler  who had some pronounced effect on history .  naturally  since i felt a proprietary interest in the term psychohistory as a predictive study of large faceless masses of human beings  i resented the new use of the word .  but then as time went on  i grew more philosophical .  after all  it might well be that there could be no analogy drawn between molecules and human beings and that there could be no way of predicting human behavior .  as mathematicians began to be interested in the details of what is now called    chaos     it seemed to me that human history might prove to be essentially    chaotic    so that there could be no psychohistory .  indeed  the question of whether psychohistory can be worked out or not lies at the center of the novel i have recently completed  prelude to foundation  in which hari seldon  the founder of psychohistory  is portrayed as a young man who is in the process of trying to devise the science .  imagine  then  how exciting it is for me to see that scientists are increasingly interested in my psychohistory  even though they may not be aware that that   s what the study is called and may never have read any of my foundation novels  and thus may not know of my involvement .   who cares .  the concept is more important than i am .   some months ago  a reader  tom wilsdon of arden  north carolina  sent me a clipping from the april           issue of machine design .  it reads as follows  in full      a computer model originally intended to simulate liquid turbulence has been used to model group behavior .  researchers at los alamos national laboratories have found that there is a similarity between group behavior and certain physical phenomena .  to do the analysis  they assigned certain physical characteristics such as level of excitement  fear  and size of the crowd to model parameters .  the interaction of the crowd closely paralleled the turbulent flow equations .  although the analysis cannot predict exactly what a group will do  it reportedly does help determine the most probable consequence of a given event .      then  too  roger n .  shepard  a professor of psychology at stanford university  has published an article in the september          issue of science entitled    toward a universal law of generalization for psychological science .     unfortunately  although i made a valiant effort to read it  the mathematics was too tough for me and even the nonmathematical portions produced only a rather dim and hazy understanding within me .  however  here is the summary of the article as given at the beginning      a psychological space is established for any set of stimuli by determining metric distances between the stimuli such that the probability that a response learned to any stimulus will generalize to any other is an invariant monotonic function of the distance between them .  to a good approximation  this probability of generalization  i  decays exponentially with this distance  and  ii  does so in accordance with one of two metrics  depending on the relation between the dimensions along with the stimuli vary .  these empirical regularities are mathematically derivable from universal principles of natural kinds and probabilistic geometry that may  through evolutionary internalization  tend to govern the behaviors of all sentient organisms .      as i said  i don   t really understand this but i have the feeling that hari seldon would understand it without trouble .  i am also concerned  suddenly  that psychohistory may be developed within the next century .  i placed its development        years in the future .  is this going to be another case of my science fictional imagination falling ludicrously short .   science fiction series  i have received a letter from nancy bykowski of bolingbrook  illinois  which says  in part     i have noticed the trend in recent years towards trilogies and serial volumes .  i enjoy reading a series of books set in the same background  but it can be frustrating when the books do not stand alone .  .  .  . but there are some authors out there that seem to be writing serials so that we will be forced to buy their next book .  i believe i read somewhere that the publishers tend to encourage that kind of thinking .  so my question to you is  did you write your foundation trilogy in response to a request from a publisher  or was it simply the result of an idea that was too big for one volume .     as it happens  i  too  have noticed the tendency for novels to come in clumps these days .   it   s true of movies  also .  someday  we will have a motion picture called rocky xvii meets superman xi .   but why is that .  why are so many writers turning out a series of connected novels .  one very obvious reason is that it makes life simpler for them .  instead of having to invent a new social background for each story  they can make use of one that they have already devised .  the writer can thus begin a new novel with a ready made background and sometimes with ready made characters .  if you re not a writer yourself  you have no idea how much mental agony and psychic wear and tear that saves .  then  too  readers who have enjoyed a book often welcome a return of the same characters and background .  as a result  the pressure for a sequel and even for a continuing series is likely to come  at least to begin with  from those readers rather than from the author or publisher .  publishers naturally welcome any book in which the chance of success and profitability is high .  they are always more eager to receive a manuscript from an established writer than from a newcomer because they can usually be sure that the former will be profitable  while the latter always represents a risk .  by similar reasoning publishers would prefer to have an established writer do another book of a popular series than venture in a new direction altogether .  the series book is more nearly a sure thing  and publishers are almost as fond of a sure thing as you and i are .  .  however  are these series of novels written simply to force readers to buy the next book against his will .  of course not .  if readers don t like a particular book  they are not likely to buy a sequel .  if they like the first three books of a series and find the fourth disappointing  they are less likely to buy the fifth .  in short  a maintained popularity and profitability will tend to keep a series going indefinitely .  non popularity or declining popularity will bring an end to the series quickly .  as a matter of fact  far from a series of books continuing just to lure reluctant readers into purchasing volumes that they don t really want to read  it is the reverse that is likely to be true .  it is the writer  not the reader  who is likely to be victimized .  after all  writing a long series of related books can grow awfully tiresome for a writer .  he may have sucked the juice out of his characters and background and may long to go in other directions  thus stretching and resting his cramped and aching mind .  the writer therefore quits and goes about his business  and then a storm arises .  readers express loud disappointment and make demands for another book in the series .  publishers  becoming aware of this  and seeing no reason to allow profitability to go glimmering  then proceed to put pressure on the writer  who is often far less enthusiastic about his series than anyone else is  and  in the end  he must write .  in that case  anyone who says to him     you re turning out endless reams of this junk just to con the reader into buying your books     is likely to get a punch in the mouth if the writer is of the violent persuasion  or a sad look if the writer is as gentle and lovable as i am .  i   m talking from personal experience .  the first three books of the foundation series are compilations of separate pieces written for astounding science fiction between      and      .  they were written at editorial insistence  but  for a while  i was eager to comply .  i had had enough of them after eight years  however  and  in       determined to write no more .  i resisted all entreaties for additions to the foundation series and ignored all threats for thirty two years .  and then  finally  doubleday began snarling and foaming at the mouth so i agreed to write foundation   s edge and foundation and earth  the fourth and fifth books of the series .  so there you are  ms .  bykowski .  my foundation series was written  at least in part  as a result of publisher   s  and readers     pressures  but they also deal with a theme too large to be contained in one story or one novel  and each portion of the series  whether a short story or a novel  stands on its own .  but is this business of stories and novels in series an invention of science fiction .  it certainly is not .  it is not even a modern phenomenon .  the same pressures that lead to sequelization today were operative in ancient times as well so that sequels and series must surely be as old as writing .  the iliad had the odyssey as its sequel  and other greek writers capitalized on the unparalleled popularity of these two epics by writing other epics concerning events preceding  succeeding  and in between these two  none of which have survived  .  the great greek dramatists tended to write trilogies of plays .  aeschylus built a trilogy around agamemnon  sophocles built a trilogy about oedipus  and so on .  coming closer to home  mark twain wrote tom sawyer and when that proved successful  he wrote a sequel  huckleberry finn  and when that proved even more successful  he wrote a couple of other tales of tom and huck  and when those were not successful  he stopped .  of course  a series need not concentrate on    continuing the plot .     it may consist of a series of independent stories  which  however  share a common background and a continuing character .  an enormously successful series of this sort was a .  conan doyle   s sherlock holmes stories .  so compelling a character did doyle create in sherlock holmes that the public could never get enough of him .  doyle quickly began to grow tired of writing the stories and  indeed  began to hate sherlock holmes who had grown so large in public consciousness as to totally overshadow doyle himself .  in desperation  doyle killed sherlock holmes  and was then forced to bring him back to life .  here is an extreme example of the victimization of an author  though it did make doyle extremely wealthy  .  other mystery novel series featuring a continuing detective  hercule poirot  nero wolfe  etc .   followed as a matter of course .  when i was young  series of independent stories featuring continuing characters were extremely common .  there were the nick carter books  the frank merriwell books  and others  too .  there were magazines which  in each issue  carried a novella featuring some character such as the shadow  the spider  doc savage  secret agent x  operator s  and so on .  naturally  science fiction was influenced by such things .  during the     s and     s  neil r .  jones wrote some twenty stories featuring professor jameson and a group of companion robots with human brains  eando binder wrote ten stories about another robot  adam link  nelson bond wrote ten stories about a lovable bumbler named lancelot biggs .  however  the first successful series of novels in science fiction were by e .  e .  smith .  between      and       he turned out three skylark novels  and between      and       he turned out five lensman novels .  in the     s  robert a .  heinlein produced something new in his future history series .  here the plots seemed independent and were set at widely different times  but they all fit into a consistent historical development of the solar system  so that there were references in stories set later in time to events in stories set earlier in time .  i began another series of this sort with foundation in      .  i expanded the background to the galaxy as a whole and proceeded to trace the history methodically from story to story  without jumping about .  later  i tied in my robot series and my empire series so that my own future history series now consists of thirteen novels  with others to come  i suppose .  other series of the foundation type followed  the most successful being frank herbert   s dune series .  in fantasy  the great success was j .  r .  r .  tolkien   s lord of the rings trilogy  which inspired a host of imitations .  the late judylynn del rey  and her husband  lester  with their marvelous ability to spot trends  encouraged the writing of novel series and put them out under their publishing imprint of    del rey books     so that we now have a virtual inundation of book series .  the fashion may pass  but while it is here  it seems to be bringing us a considerable number of good things to enjoy .   survivors  martin h .  greenberg and i have co edited a series of anthologies for daw books  which include the best stories of a given year .  we began with the best of       a book that appeared in        and proceeded year by year until in       the fifteenth volume appeared with the best of      .  in press  as i write this  is volume sixteen which deals with the best of       and in preparation is volume seventeen which deals with the best of      .  for each of these books  marty writes a general introduction outlining the events of the year  both in the real world of science fiction  and in the imaginary world of the great outside .  we then each supply a headnote for each of the stories in the volume .  marty   s headnotes deal with the science fiction writer   s career  while i write on some subject or other that either the author or the story has inspired in my weird brain .  i read marty   s headnotes with avidity for they always tell me more about the writer than i know  but not more than i want to know  of course .  one thing that i   ve noticed  with some curiosity  is that science fiction writers tend to have a ten year lifespan  or  if anything  less .  that is  they will write science fiction  sometimes copiously  for ten years or less  and then they will dwindle off and fade to a halt .  sometimes  they don   t even dwindle  they simply stop dead .  it leaves me wondering why .  one explanation  of course  is that they find other and more lucrative markets .  john d .  macdonald wrote science fiction in his early years and then made the big time in mystery thrillers .  john jakes wrote science fiction in his early years and then made the big time in historical fiction .  another explanation is that they die  even science fiction writers die .  back in the     s  cyril kornbluth and henry kuttner died while each was at the peak of his career  and more recently the same was true for philip k .  dick and frank herbert .  but there are those who simply stop and end what seems a fruitful career without switching to other fields and while remaining vigorously alive .  i can even think of names of fresh young writers who graced the pages of this magazine in its early issues whom we  or anyone else  don   t hear from much anymore .  why is that .  do they run out of ideas .  do they simply get tired of writing .  does science fiction change into new channels with which they are out of sympathy .  i simply don   t know .  perhaps this is something that is true of all forms of writing and not of science fiction alone .  perhaps it is true of all forms of creative endeavor .  perhaps    burnout    is a common phenomenon which ought to be studied more than it is  by psychologists  not by me .  but if burnout is common  then what about those cases in which burnout does not occur .  it may be just as useful to study those who are burnout immune  and who have been writing high quality science fiction steadily  prolifically  and successfully for  say  forty years and more  and who show no signs of breaking under the strain .  lately  i have noticed that such people are termed    dinosaurs    by some observers in the field .  i suspect that the term is used pejoratively  that is  it is not used as a compliment .  from the things they have to say about the writers they call dinosaurs  i gather that  like the real dinosaurs  these writers are considered to be ancient  clumsy  and outmoded .  the term  however  is particularly inappropriate because the characteristic that we most associate with the real dinosaurs is that they are extinct  while the characteristic most noticeable about the writing dinosaurs is that they are not extinct .  as a matter of fact  i gather from the nature of the comments made about these dinosaurs that those who use the term are rather aggrieved at them for not being extinct and for hogging too much of the spotlight for far too much time .  well  that   s their problem .  for myself  i prefer to use the term    survivors     which is neither pejorative nor complimentary  but merely factual .  what are the characteristics that would qualify a science fiction writer to be a survivor .  to begin with  since i talked about a successful and steady and prolific writing life of at least forty years  a survivor would have to be at least sixty years old  and alive  and working .  naturally  he would have had to have started at quite a young age and been swatting away at it steadily since then .  i can think  offhand  of nine writers who fulfill these qualifications  and here they are      jack williamson .  his first story was published in       when he was twenty years old .  he has been writing steadily for fifty nine years  and he is now eighty years old .  to me  he is the undoubted and well beloved dean of science fiction .  his    the legion of space      which bounced me off the wall when i was a teenager  appeared fifty three years ago .      clifford d .  simak .  his first story was published in       when he was twenty seven years old .  he has been writing steadily for fifty six years and he is now eighty two years old .  his    city    appeared forty three years ago  and    cosmic engineers    forty eight years ago .     .  l .  sprague de camp .  his first story was published in       when he was thirty years old .  he has been writing steadily for forty nine years and is now seventy nine years old .  his    lest darkness fall    which i read in preference to studying for an all important test in physical chemistry  without ever regretting it  appeared forty eight years ago .     .  isaac asimov .   you didn   t think i   d leave myself out through some perverted notion of modesty  did you .   my first story was published in march        when i was nineteen .  i have been writing steadily for forty eight years  and i am now sixty seven years old .  my story    nightfall    appeared forty six years ago .      robert heinlein .  his first story was published in august        when he was thirty two .  he has been writing steadily for forty eight years and he is now eighty years old .  his    blowups happen     appeared forty seven years ago .      fritz leiber .  his first story was published in august        when he was twenty nine .  he has been writing steadily for forty eight years and he is now seventy six years old .  his    conjure wife    appeared forty four years ago .      frederik pohl .  it   s hard to say because so much of his early stuff appeared under pseudonyms of one sort or another  but an undoubted story of his appeared in      when he was twenty one .  he has been writing steadily for forty six years  and he is now sixty seven years old .  his    gravy planet        space merchants     appeared thirty five years ago .      arthur c .  clarke .  his first story appeared in       when he was twenty nine .  he has been writing steadily for forty one years  and he is now seventy years old .  his    rescue party    appeared forty one years ago .      poul anderson .  his first story appeared in       when he was twenty one .  he has been writing steadily for forty years  and is now sixty one years old .  his    the helping hand    appeared thirty seven years ago .   i don   t pretend that this list is necessarily definitive .  offhand  i can think of three other possible survivors .  lester del rey   s first story was published in       while a .  e .  van vogt and alfred bester were each first published in      .  in recent decades  however  they have not published much  so i can   t honestly deny burnout in their cases .  if we look at the list  we can come to some conclusions  i think .  in the first place the survivors were all science fiction fans from a very early age  and gained a life long fascination with the field .  that must be so .  secondly  each must be a nonsuffering writer .  lots of good writers  even great writes  don   t necessarily like to write  and must force themselves to do so .  this doesn   t prevent them from writing well  you understand  but it does prevent them from writing a lot  and my qualification for being a survivor is that one writes steadily and prolifically .  thirdly  each resists the notion of abandoning science fiction .  it is not likely that survivors can write only sf and nothing else .  to my knowledge  simak  pohl  and anderson have written good nonfiction  clarke and de camp have written quite a bit of good nonfiction  and i have written a thundering lot of it .  in addition  pohl has written mainstream fiction  he has a new novel entitled chernobyl that   s coming out  very unusual and not science fiction  .  de camp has written excellent historical novels .  as for me  i have written a great deal of mystery fiction .  in every case  however  no matter how they stray  these survivors always return to science fiction .  there you are .     dinosaurs    .  i think not .  i think the survivors  even i  are the great pillars of science fiction .  i wonder how many more of them will appear in the future .   nowhere .   in       the english scholar thomas more             published a book  in latin   with a long title  as was the fashion in those days  that was also in latin .  when it finally appeared in its first english edition in       the title was given as     a fruteful and pleasant worke of the beste state of a publyque weale  and of the newe yle  called utopia .     we refer to the book simply as utopia .  in the book  more described the workings of what he considered an ideal human society  as found on the island nation of utopia  one that was governed entirely by the dictates of reason .  his description of such a society is so noble and rational that it would seem enviable even today .  more was under no illusions as to the real world  however .  the word    utopia    is from the greek    ou        not     and    topos        place     so that it means    nowhere .     more realized  in other words  that his ideal existed nowhere on earth  and still doesn   t  .  in fact  his book  in describing his ideal society  served also by clear contrast to excoriate the actual governments of his day  particularly that of his native england which  of course  he knew the best .  an easy mistake was made  however .  since utopia  as described  was such a wonderful place  it could easily be imagined that the first syllable was from the greek prefix    eu      meaning    good    so that utopia became not    nowhere    but the    good place .     the word    utopia     entered the english language  and the other european languages as well  as meaning an ideal society .  the adjective    utopian     refers to any scheme that has what seems a good end in view  but that is not practical  and cannot be carried through in any realistic sense .  we might speak of utopian literature  written accounts in which ideal societies are described  with more   s as the classic  but not the earliest  example .  plato   s republic was a description  nineteen centuries earlier than utopia  of an ideal state dependent upon reason .  earlier still  were accounts of ideal states in mythological or religious literature  in the form of past golden ages or of future messianic ones .  the garden of eden is a well known example of the former  and the eleventh chapter of isaiah of the latter .  the production of utopian accounts has not fallen off since the time of more  either .  the most influential recent examples have been looking backward  published in      by edward bellamy              which described the united states of      under an ideal socialist government  and walden two  published in      by b .  f .  skinner          which described an ideal society based on skinner   s own theories of social engineering .  all such utopias are not convincing  however .  unless one accepts the conventions of religion  it is difficult to believe in golden or messianic ages .  nor can one easily suppose that sweet reason will at any time dominate humanity .  in the course of the nineteenth century  however  something new entered the field of utopianism .  the possibility arose that scientific and technological advance might impose a utopia from without  so to speak .  in other words  while human beings remained as irrational and imperfect as ever  the advance of science might supply plenty of food  cure disease and mental ailments  track down and abort irrational impulses  and so on .  a perfect technology would cancel out an imperfect humanity .  the tendency to take this attitude and to paint the future in glowing technological colors reached the point where what we call science fiction is called  in germany     utopian stories .     as a matter of fact  however  it isn   t at all likely that the average writer is going to try to write a truly utopian story .  there   s no percentage in it .  all you can do is describe such a society and explain  at great length  how good it is  and how well it works  and how it manages not to break down .  there can   t be any drama in it  no problems  no risks  no threat of catastrophe  no pulling through by the merest squeak .  clearly  if such things were possible  the utopia would be no utopia .  it follows that utopian stories are  by their very nature  dreadfully dull .  the one utopian novel i   ve actually managed to read was looking backward  and although it was a best seller in its times and still has its enthusiasts  i tell you right now that if dullness could kill  reading it would be a death sentence .  so dull are utopian books that they fail to fulfill their function of pointing out the errors and faults of the societies that really exist .  you can   t grow indignant over these faults if you fall asleep in the process .  there developed  therefore  the habit of attacking societies in a more direct fashion .  instead of describing the good opposite  one described the evil reality  but exaggerated it past bearing .  instead of a society in which everything was ideally good  one described a society in which everything was ideally bad .  the word coined for a totally bad society is    dystopia     where the first syllable is from the greek prefix    dys      meaning    abnormal    or    defective .     dystopia is the    bad place .     thus  you can figure out what    dystopian literature    would be .  dystopias are intrinsically more interesting than utopias .  milton   s description of his dystopian hell in the first two books of paradise lost is far more interesting than his description of utopian hell in the third book .  and in the lord of the rings  not much can be told about the stay of the fellowship in the utopian elfland of lorien  but how the story intensifies and grows more interesting as we approach the dystopian morder .  but can there be dystopias today with science and technology advancing as they do .  certainly .  you need only view science and technology as contributing to the evil  which is not difficult to do  .  and yet pure dystopian tales are as dull and as unbearable as pure utopian ones .  consider the most famous pure dystopian tale of modern times       by george orwell              published in       the same year in which walden two was published  .  i consider it an abominably poor book .  it made a big hit  in my opinion  only because it rode the tidal wave of cold war sentiment in the united states .  the pure utopian tale can only hit the single note of    isn   t it wonderful  wonderful  wonderful .      the pure dystopian tale can only hit the single note of    isn   t it awful  awful  awful .     and one cannot build a melody on the basis of a single note .  well  then  what is a science fiction writer supposed to do if both utopian and dystopian stories are dull .  remember  they are poor only if they are pure  so avoid the extremes .  milton   s hell was made interesting because of his portrait of satan  courageous even in the ultimate adversity  feeling pangs of remorse even when immersed in ultimate evil .  milton   s heaven was without interest because there was no way of introducing danger in the face of an omnipotent  omniscient god .  his dystopia was not pure  his utopia was .  the evil of mordor was made bearable by the courage and humanity of frodo and the story would have remained interesting and successful even if frodo had failed in the end .  it was his courage and humanity  not his victory  that really counted .  the essence of a story is the struggle of one thing against another  a living thing against the impersonal universe  a living thing against another living thing  one aspect of a living thing against another aspect of himself .  in each case  you have to make it possible for the reader to identify with at least one side of the struggle  so that his interest and sympathy is engaged .  i say    at least    one side  because if you are skillful  you can cause him to identify with both sides and be emotionally torn .  the side or sides with whom you identify must carryon the struggle with courage  intelligence  and decency  or  at least  learn to do so .  the story won   t be effective if you are ashamed of the side you make your own .  both sides must have a fair chance to win .  it is tempting to pile the odds up against your side  so as to make your hero   s ultimate victory the more unexpected  exciting  and triumphant  but in that case you must be sure that your side does end up victorious .  you can   t make it david versus goliath unless david wins  and as one becomes more and more experienced and sophisticated in reading  that may come to seem too obvious and even too unrealistic .  it seems to me  then  that the best one can do is to present one   s story as a struggle between sides which are both mixtures of good and evil  thus placing it somewhere between the extremes of utopia and dystopia   and don   t make the odds overwhelming in either direction .  one can then proceed to make one   s point without being forced into a happy ending and under conditions of maximum excitement and reader uncertainty .  the reader will not only be uncertain as to how his side will win  but if it will win  or even  perhaps  which is truly his side .  i don   t say this is easy  of course .   outsiders  insiders  i am a great booster of    the brotherhood of science fiction .     i wrote an editorial on the subject  with just that title  in the fifth issue of iasfm  january february        .  i delight in thinking of us ardent writers and readers of science fiction as a band of brothers  and sisters  of course  fond of each other  and supporting each other .  unfortunately  there are aspects of such a situation that are not entirely delightful .  let   s consider these unfavorable aspects  because if the field of science fiction is to remain as ideal as we all want it to be  we have to see the dangers .  we may not be able to defeat those dangers even if we see them  but we certainly can   t  if we don   t see them .  for instance  if we are truly a small and intimate band  as i remember us being in the golden age of campbell  though perhaps that may only be the consequence of nostalgia  then there is a danger that we might close our ranks  unfairly and petty mindedly  against outsiders .  i remember  for instance  when michael crichton wrote the andromeda strain and it hit the best seller lists .  in those days  it had not yet become common for science fiction and fantasy to be actual best sellers  and here was an    outsider    who had accomplished it .  what made him an outsider .  well  he hadn   t sold to the magazines .  he didn   t show up at conventions .  he wasn   t one of us .  there followed reviews in various science fiction prozines and fanzines and it seemed to me  at the time  that they were uniformly unfavorable .  i can   t judge how justified those reviews might have been for i never read the book  perhaps because i  too  felt he was an outsider  but there did appear  in my opinion  an extra helping of venom beyond what i usually notice in unfavorable reviews .  was that fair .  no  it wasn   t .  crichton  a person of great talent  went on to be very successful  both in his later books  some of them not science fiction  and in movies as well .  our objections to him did not hurt him and he doesn   t need us .  in retrospect  we might conclude that some of us were petty .  nor am i trying to preach from some high moral position  implying that i am myself above such things .  not at all .  i went through a period soon after world war ii  in which i reacted badly  though entirely within myself   and i look back on that period in shame .  when one is part of a small and comparatively insignificant clique  warming one   s self in its closeness and camaraderie  what happens if one of the clique suddenly rises and becomes famous in the wild world outside .  thus  in the     s  robert heinlein was quickly accepted as the best science fiction writer of us all   and in the opinion of many  he still is the grand master  and i accepted that  too .  i was not envious  for i was just a beginner and i knew that many writers were better than i was .  besides  i liked bob   s writing a great deal .  and most of all  he was one of us  writing for the same magazines  going to the same conventions  corresponding with us  first naming me and expecting me to first name him  and so on .  but then  soon after world war     bob heinlein was involved with a motion picture  destination  moon .  it wasn   t a very good motion picture  it didn   t make the hit that the later       a space odyssey or star wars did .  but it was the first motion picture involving one of us  and while i said not a word  i was secretly unhappy .  bob had left our group and become famous in the land of the infidels .  to make it worse  he had published    the green hills of earth     in the saturday evening post and it had created a stir .  it was a real science fiction story and it was in the slicks  not only in the slicks  but in the greatest and slickest slick of them all .  we all dreamed of publishing in the sep  i  also  but that was like dreaming of taking out marilyn monroe on a date .  you knew it was just a dream and you had no intention of even trying to make it come true .  and now bob had done it .  he hadn   t just tried  he had done it .  i don   t know whether i simply mourned his loss  because i thought that now he would never come back to us  or whether i was simply and greenly envious .  all i knew was that i felt more and more uncomfortable .  it was like having a stomachache in the mind  and it seemed to spoil all my fun in being a science fiction writer .  so i argued it out with myself  not because i am a noble person but because i hated feeling the way i did  and i wanted to feel better .  i said to myself that bob had blazed new trails  and that it didn   t matter who did it  as long as it was done .  those new trails had been opened not for robert heinlein  but for science fiction  and all of us who were in the business of writing or reading science fiction could be grateful and thankful for we would sooner or later experience the benefit of bob   s pioneering .  and that was true .  because bob made science fiction look good to people who did not ordinarily read science fiction  and who despised it when they thought of it at all  it became more possible for the rest of us to have our stuff published outside the genre magazines  even in the sep .   i had a two part serial published in that magazine myself eventually  but that was when it was long past its great days .   the result of my working this out meant i was free of sickness on later occasions .  when my first book  pebble in the sky  appeared under the doubleday imprint  it was followed in a matter of months by the martian chronicles by ray bradbury .  i don   t have to tell you that ray   s book far outshone mine .  it didn   t bother me  for it seemed to me that the better ray   s book did  the more people would read science fiction in book form  and some of them would be sure to look for more of the same and stumble over mine .  and they did .  pebble is still earning money  thirty six years later .  and however annoying it might be that michael crichton could enter our field straight out of medical school  move right up to the novel level  and land on the best seller list  and have everyone drooling over him  where   s the harm .  he did it  unintentionally  perhaps  for us .  he added to the respectability of science fiction among those who found us unrespectable  and made it easier for the rest of us to get on the best seller list occasionally .  far from snarling  we should have been cheering .  another point .  a band of brothers  and sisters  is at its best when there is nothing much to compete for .  as long as we were all getting no more than one and two cents a word   as we did in that wonderful golden age of campbell  with no chance at book publication  foreign sales and movies  as long as the only kudos we could get was first place in the     analytical laboratory    which meant a half cent a word bonus  as long as no one outside our small field had ever heard of any of us under any circumstances  what was there to compete over .  the most successful of us were almost as permanently impecunious as the least so there was no reason to snarl and bite .  now  however  times have changed .  there are many more of us  and some of us write best sellers .  in fact  the greatest best seller of the     s  stephen king  is  after a fashion  one of us .  it   s no longer a few thousand bucks that   s at stake  it   s a few million .  and that brother bit fades  bends  and crumples under the strain .  i don   t write reviews  but i do read them  and i   m beginning to see the venom again as one writer discusses the work of another member of the brotherhood .  what   s more  the annual award of the nebulas  which are determined by vote among the members of the science fiction writers of america  seems to rouse hard feeling and contentiousness every year .  the stakes are simply too high .  thus  a young member of the brotherhood  to me he seemed a child  complained to me the other day that the    young writers     young to him  were ferocious in their competitiveness .  there was none of the friendliness  he said  that there was in our day  meaning his and mine  though i was a published writer when he was born  .  i suppose he   s right  though .  in a way  i can   t ache to return to the good old days when we were all impoverished together .  it seems a glamorous time in my mind now  but i remember sophie tucker   s immortal dictum     i   ve tried poor  and i   ve tried rich  and rich is better .     but is there a price we must pay for it .  must the camaraderie be gone .  must the friendly back and forth be over .  why not remember that science fiction is still a relatively specialized field  that sf writers have to know a great deal more  and develop more unusual skill  than ordinary writers  that sf readers  too  demand more because they need more .  can we remember that we   re all in this together .  that those in front pave the way for those behind .  that at any time someone can appear from the strange land of outside  or the stranger land of youth  and carve out new territory for all of us  and that they should be welcomed gladly .  let   s be friends .  there are endless worlds of the mind and emotions to conquer  and we can advance more surely  if we support  not fight  each other .   science fiction anthologies  i hear it said now and then that the short story is a lost literary art form  that the magazines and various outlets that fostered the short story are dead and gone  that fiction today concentrates on the novel .  that would be too bad if it were true  but  of course  it isn   t entirely true .  in the field of science fiction  at least  the short story absolutely flourishes and the readers simply can   t get enough of it .  indeed  any good science fiction story can count on periodic resurrection in the form of items in single author collections and in multi author anthologies .  some of my stories have been anthologized up to thirty times  and i by no means hold the record for such things .  i suspect that both ray bradbury and harlan ellison  to name but two  can cite stories of their own that have seen far more repetitions than any of mine have .  and there you have something that is oddly characteristic of science fiction  the vast number and varying nature of anthologies in the field .  i have the impression that there is no precedent in literature for this .  why is it so .  why should science fiction  rather than some other subsection of popular literature  spawn an unending series of anthologies of enormous variety .  i suspect that  in part at least  what is responsible is the unusual fervor of the devoted science fiction reader .  particular stories strike such a reader with the force of a sledgehammer .  combine this with the fact that magazine science fiction tends to be ephemeral .  few young readers save the magazines for long .  even if they start a collection  after a few years there comes college or marriage or other interests generally  and the collection falls apart  drifts away  vanishes .  yet the memory of those particularly good stories lingers  and a glow of glory builds about them .  i have long lost count of the number of letters i have received from readers who tell me that once  when the world was young  they read a story about thus and so .  they can   t remember the title  the author  where it appeared or anything more than thus and so  but could i tell them what the story was and how they could go about finding it again .  sometimes i remember the story from the small clues they present and can give them the missing information .  more often i cannot .  you see  then  that anthologies offer a second chance .  they sometimes bring back for readers stories once loved and then lost .  once i deliberately devised an anthology  before the golden age  doubleday        in order to present some stories that i myself had loved and lost .  sometimes such stories are better not found  for they don   t  in actual fact  bear the prismatic colors that fond memory lends them  but sometimes they do .  when i reread    tumithak of the corridors    during the preparation of my      anthology  i found it to be a time machine that restored me to my teenage years for an hour or two .  the first anthology of magazine science fiction appeared in      .  it was the pocket book of science fiction  edited by donald a .  wollheim .  among the stories it contained was stanley g .  weinbaum   s     a martian odyssey     which i had never read  having missed the issue in which it first appeared .  i was able to enjoy it for the first time when i bought the anthology .  and there is another service such books offer .  they allow you to recover stories you never knew you had lost .  in       there appeared the first hardcover anthology of magazine science fiction  the best of science fiction  edited by groff conklin .  it was an anthology of almost painfully intense interest to me for it was the first to contain a story of mine     blind alley .     that was never one of my own favorites  in fact  i considered it then  and now  too  as rather second rate .  still  i discovered eventually that groff   s opinions of quality could usually be relied on  so perhaps i underestimate    blind alley .     in any case  astounding  the magazine in which    blind alley    had originally appeared  retained all rights in those days  but john campbell insisted that anthology income go to the authors involved .  it was in this way that i made the great discovery that the same story could be paid for twice and  therefore  by extension  any number of times .   it is only that which makes it possible for a science fiction writer to earn a living  so this was by no means a non significant discovery .   later in that same year  the most successful science fiction anthology ever to appear was published .  it was adventures in time and space  edited by raymond j .  healy and j .  francis mccomas .  it was a large  thick volume  with stories drawn almost entirely from the golden age of astounding  and it contained my story    nightfall .      that was my introduction to the strange notion that one of my own stories was already considered a classic .  the success of the healy mccomas anthology opened the floodgates .  i haven   t the faintest idea how many anthologies have been published since  but i am quite certain that there isn   t an issue of any science fiction magazine that hasn   t been carefully picked over to see if any gems have remained undiscovered  nor any gem or even semi gem that hasn   t been discovered and rediscovered and rediscovered .  lately  i myself have joined the parade .  i   m not entirely a novice at the anthologists    game  for i edited the hugo winners  doubleday        along with successor volumes in      and       all of which were quite successful .  however  i never let myself get too involved in such matters because every anthology entails a great deal of tedious scutwork  selection  obtaining of permissions  the making out of payments and so on .  the result was that through       i edited only nine anthologies  which is very few for a person of my own wholesale proclivities who considers nothing worth doing that isn   t worth doing a lot .  with my ninth anthology  however  one hundred great science fiction short short stories  doubleday         i made the marvelous discovery that my friend  martin harry greenberg  tall  a little plump  intelligent  conscientious  hard working  and good humored  found a peculiar perverted pleasure in doing all those things  like getting permissions and taking care of payments  that i hated to do .  then the two of us discovered charles g .  waugh  also tall  hard working  intelligent  and conscientious  but less plump and much more grave than either martin or i .  it turned out  he knew every science fiction story ever published  remembered all the statistics and plots  and could put his hand on any of them instantly .  ask him for a story about extraterrestrials from uranus who reproduce by binary fission and i imagine he would have three different sets of xeroxes in your hand the next day .  that changed everything .  in      and       i helped edit no less than twelve anthologies and  at the moment of writing  there are six in press and more in preparation .   not all are with martin and charles  a couple are with alice laurance  who has an attribute that the first two lack to an enormous degree  beauty  and one is with j .  o .  jeppson  to whom i am closely related by marriage .   very often these recent anthologies have had my name blown out of proportion on the covers for crass commercial reasons  and over my protests  since i contribute no more than my fair share .  on the other hand i contribute no less than my fair share either  and it chafes a little when someone takes it for granted that i am merely collecting money for the use of my name .  i would overlook the slur on my integrity involved in this  since all great men suffer calumny  but i hate to lose credit for all the work i do .  charles  martin  and i constantly consult each other by mail and phone  and we each dabble in every part of the work  but there is division of labor  too .  charles works particularly hard at locating stories and making photocopies .  martin works particularly hard at the business details .  and as for me  well  all the stories descend on me  and i read them all and do the final judging  what i throw out is thrown out  .  i then write the introduction or the headnotes or  usually  both .  and since i   m the one who lives in new york  i tend to do the trotting round to various publishers when that is necessary .  the net result is that each of the three of us does what he best likes to do so that preparing the anthologies becomes fun for all of us .  to be sure  i labor under the steady anxiety that something might happen to martin or charles  but  under my shrewd questioning  both sally greenberg and carol lynn waugh have made it clear that each entirely understands the importance of keeping her husband functioning  and i rely on them with all confidence .   the influence of science fiction  i suppose it   s only natural that those of us who are devotees of science fiction would like to find in it something more than a matter of idle amusement .  it ought to have important significance .  on many occasions in the past i have advanced arguments for supposing such significance to exist .  here is how it goes  the human way of life has always been subject to drastic and more or less irreversible change  usually  or  as i believe  always  mediated by some advance in science and or technology .  thus  life is forever changed with the invention of fire  or the wheel  or agriculture  or metallurgy  or printing .  the rate of change has been continually increasing  too  for as these changes are introduced  they tend to increase the security of the human species and therefore increase its number  thus in turn increasing the number of those capable of conceiving  introducing  and developing additional advances in science and technology .  besides that  each advance serves as a base for further advance so that the effect is cumulative .  during the last two centuries  the rate of change has become so great as to be visible in the course of the individual lifetime .  this has put a strain on the capacity of individuals  and societies  too  to adapt to such change  since the natural feeling always is that there should be no change .  one is used to things as they are .  during the last thirty years  the rate of change has become so great as to induce a kind of social vertigo .  there seems no way in which we can plan any longer  for plans become outdated as fast as they are implemented .  by the time we recognize a problem  action must be taken at once  and by the time we take action  however quickly  it is too late  the problem has changed its nature and gotten away from us .  what makes it worse is that  in the course of scientific and technological advance we have reached the stage where we dispose of enough power to destroy civilization  if it is misused   or to advance it to unheard of heights  if we use it correctly  .  with stakes so high and the situation so vertiginous  what can we do .  we must learn to anticipate fairly correctly and  in making our plans  take into account not what now exists  but what is likely to exist five years hence  or ten  or twenty  whenever the solution is likely to come into effect .  but how can one take change into account correctly  when the vast mass of the population stolidly refuses to take into account the existence of any change at all .   thus  most americans  far from planning now for       have shown by their recent actions that what they want is to see      restored .   that is where science fiction comes in .  science fiction is the one branch of literature that accepts the fact of change  the inevitability of change .  without the initial assumption that there will be change  there is no such thing as science fiction  for nothing is science fiction unless it includes events played out against a social or physical background significantly different from our own .  science fiction is at its best if the events described could not be played out at all except in a social or physical background significantly different from our own .  that doesn   t mean that a science fiction story should be predictive  or that it should portray something that is going to happen  before it can be important .  it doesn   t even have to portray something that might conceivably happen .  the existence of change  the acceptance of change  is enough .  people who read science fiction come  in time  to know that things will be different .  maybe better  maybe worse  but different .  maybe this way  maybe that way  but different .  if enough people read science fiction or are  at least  sufficiently influenced by people who read science fiction  enough of the population may come to accept change  even if only with resignation and grief  so that government leaders can plan for change in the hope of meeting something other than stolid resistance from the public .  and then  who knows  civilization might survive .  and yet this is highly tenuous  and while i accept the line of reasoning thoroughly  having  as far as i know  made it up   i can see that others might dismiss it as special pleading by someone who doesn   t want the stuff he writes to be dismissed as just .  .  .  stuff .  well  then  has science fiction already influenced the world .  has anything that science fiction writers have written so influenced real scientists  or engineers  or politicians  or industrialists as to introduce important changes .  what about the case of space flight  of trips to the moon .  this has been a staple of imaginative literature since roman times  and both jules verne and h .  g .  wells wrote highly popular stories about trips to the moon in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries .  certainly  those scientists and engineers who began to deal with rocketry realistically had read science fiction  and there is no question that men such as robert goddard and werner von braun had been exposed to such things .  this is not to say that science fiction taught them any rocketry .  as a matter of fact  wells used an anti gravity device to get to the moon  and verne used a gigantic gun  and both of these devices can be dismissed out of hand as ways of reaching the moon .  nevertheless  they stirred the imagination  as did all the other science fiction writers who flooded into the field as the twentieth century wore on  and who began to write material in large masses  if not always in high quality  .  all of this prepared the minds of more and more people for the notion of such trips .  it followed that when rockets were developed as war weapons during world war ii  there were not lacking engineers who saw them as devices for scientific exploration  for orbital flights  for trips to the moon and beyond .  and all this would not be laughed out of court by the general public  all the way down to the rock bottom of the average congressman  because science fiction had paved the way .  even this may not seem enough  too general  too broad .  how about specific influence .  how about something a specific writer has done that has influenced a specific person in such a way that the world has been changed .  that has been done  too .  consider the hungarian physicist  leo szilard  who  in the middle     s  began thinking of the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction that might produce a nuclear bomb  who recognized that his thought had become a very real possibility when uranium fission was discovered in       who moved heaven and earth to persuade allied scientists to censor themselves voluntarily in order to keep information from reaching the nazi enemy  who persuaded einstein to persuade president roosevelt to initiate a vast project for developing a nuclear bomb .  we know how that changed the world  whether for better or for worse is beside the point right now  but i certainly would not have wanted hider to have gotten the first nuclear bomb in the early     s   so we can say that leo szilard changed it .  and how did szilard come to have his original idea .  according to szilard himself  that idea came to him because he read a story by h .  g .  wells  originally published in       in which an    atomic bomb     the phrase h .  g .  wells himself used  had been featured .  here   s another case .  at the present moment  industrial robots are appearing on the assembly line with increasing frequency .  in japan  whole factories are being roboticized .  what   s more  the robots themselves are being made more versatile  more capable  and more    intelligent    very rapidly .  it isn   t far fetched to say that in a couple of decades this roboticization will be seen to have changed the face of society permanently  assuming that civilization continues to survive  .  is there anyone we can credit for this .  it is difficult to place that credit on a single pair of shoulders  but perhaps the pair most likely to deserve it belongs to a man named joseph f .  engelberger  who is the president of unimation  which manufactures one third of all the robots in use and has installed more of them than anybody else .  engelberger founded his company in the late     s  and how do you suppose he came to found it .  some years before  according to his own account  when he was still a college undergraduate  he became enthusiastic about the possibility of robots when he read i  robot by isaac asimov .  i assure you that when i was writing my positronic robot stories back in the     s  my intentions were clear and simple .  i just wanted to write some stories  sell them to a magazine  make a little money to pay my college tuition  and see my name in print .  if i had been writing anything but science fiction  that   s all that would have happened .  but i was writing science fiction  so i   m now changing the world .   women and science fiction  my early science fiction stories had no women in them for the most part .  there were two reasons for this  one social  one personal .  the social reason first .  prior to public recognition in the united states that babies are not brought by the stork  there was simply no sex in the science fiction magazines .  this was not a matter of taste  it was a matter of custom that had the force of law .  in most places  non recognition of the existence of sex was treated as though it was the law  and for all i know  maybe it was indeed local law .  in any case  words or actions that could bring a blush to the leathery cheek of the local censor were strictly out .  but if there   s no sex  what do you do with female characters .  they can   t have passions and feelings .  they can   t participate on equal terms with male characters because that would introduce too many complications where some sort of sex might creep in .  the best thing to do was to keep them around in the background  allowing them to scream in terror  to be caught and then rescued  and  at the end  to smile prettily at the hero .   it can be done safely then because the end is the universal rescue .   yet it must be admitted that science fiction magazines showed no guts whatsoever in fighting this situation .  that brings us to the personal reason .  in the     s and     s  the readership of the science fiction magazines was heavily  almost exclusively  in fact  masculine .  what   s more it was young and intellectual masculine .  the stereotypical science fiction reader was a skinny kid with glasses and acne  introverted and scapegoated by the tough kids who surrounded him and were rightly suspicious of anyone who knew how to read .  it stands to reason these youngsters knew nothing about girls .  by and large  i imagine they didn   t dare approach them  and if they did  were rejected by them scornfully  and if they weren   t  didn   t know what to do next .  so why on earth should they want this strange sub species in the stories they read .  they had not yet gotten out of the    i hate  translation     i   m scared of     girls    stage .  this is an exaggeration  perhaps  and no doubt there were a number of tough young men and girl chasing young men who read science fiction  but by and large  i suspect it was the stereotypical    skinny intellectual    who wrote letters to the magazines and denounced any intrusion of femininity .  i know .  i wrote such letters myself .  and in the days when i was reading and rating every science fiction story written  i routinely deducted many points for any intrusion of romance  however sanitized it might be .  at the time i wrote and sold my first few stories  i had not yet had a date with a young woman .  i knew nothing about them except what i could guess by surreptitious glances from a distance .  naturally  there were no women in my stories .   i once received a letter from a woman who denounced me for this lack .  humbly  i wrote back to explain the reason  stating that i was  very literally  an innocent as far as women were concerned at the beginning of my writing career .  she had a good answer for that  too .  she wrote back in letters of flame     that   s no excuse .      but times change .  for one thing  society changed .  the breath of liberty brought on by all the talk about it during world war ii weakened the censor  who retreated  muttering sourly under his breath .  the coming of the pill heralded the liberation of women from unwanted pregnancy  and marked the weakening of the double standard .  for another  people will grow up .  even i didn   t remain innocent .  i actually went out on a date on my twentieth birthday .  i met a particular woman two years later  fell in love at first sight  and all trace of fear suddenly left me .  i was married five months later and you   d be surprised how i changed .  i have in my proud possession a plaque handed me by a science fiction convention .  on the brass plate is inscribed that quality of mine that had earned me the plaque .  it reads    lovable lecher .     and yet science fiction lagged a bit  i think .  old habits didn   t change easily .  my own stories  for instance  remained free of sex except where it was an integral part of the development and then only to that extent  and still so remain .  i have gotten rid of my fear  witness my five volumes of naughty limericks   but not of my sense of decorum .  what  then  really brought on the change and brought science fiction more nearly into the mainstream of contemporary literature .  in my opinion  it was not chiefly social evolution  it was not the daring new writers  not the russes and leguins .  it was the coming of women into the science fiction readership .  if science fiction readers had remained almost entirely masculine  even had the acne cleared up and the youth withered  i think science fiction would have remained male chauvinist in the crudest possible way .  nowadays  i honestly think that at least a third  and possibly nearly half the science fiction readers are women .  when that is so  and when it is recognized that women are at least as articulate as men and  these days  quite ready to denounce male chauvinism and to demand treatment as human beings  it becomes impossible to continue villainy .  even i have to bow to the breath of decency .  in my new novel  foundation   s edge  of my seven central characters  four are women  all different  all perfectly able to take care of themselves  and all formidable .   for that matter  i introduced susan calvin in       and she strode through a man   s world  asking no quarter  and certainly giving none .  i just thought i   d mention that .   and what brought in the women readers .  i suppose there are a large number of reasons  but i have one that i favor .  it   s mr .  spock   s ears .  there is no question in my mind that the first example of decent science fiction that gained a mass following was the television show star trek  nearly twenty years ago .  for a wonder  it attracted as many women as men .  i don   t suppose there is room to doubt that what chiefly served to attract those women was the unflappable mr .  spock .  and for some reason i won   t pretend to guess at  they were intrigued by his ears .  very few of the    trekkies    leaked over into print science fiction   or all the magazines would have grown rich   but a minor percentage did and that was enough to feminize the readership of the science fiction magazines .  and i think that was all to the good  too .  with so many women thumbing the magazines  women writers were naturally more welcome and their viewpoints greeted with greater reader sympathy  and women editors made more sense  too .  don   t get me wrong .  there were women writers even in the early days of magazine science fiction  and women editors  too .  when i was young  some of my favorite stories were by a .  r .  long and by leslie f .  stone .  i didn   t know they were women  but they were .  in addition  mary gnaedinger  bea mahaffey  and cele goldsmith were excellent editors .  i never met ms .  gnaedinger  but i did meet bea and cele and i hereby testify that in addition to lots of brains  character  and personality  they each happened to be beautiful .   irrelevant  i know  but i thought i would mention it .   consequently  when george scithers left us  i found it delightful that kathleen moloney agreed to be the new editor .  it never occurred to me for an instant that a woman couldn   t handle the job just because she was a woman and  as a matter of fact  kathleen took to it with a kind of rabid delight .  she introduced interesting changes and stamped her personality on the magazine .  but then  there came along the all too frequent villain in such cases  the offer one can   t refuse .  it may have been kathleen   s performance here that aroused interest in other publishing houses and  well  one can   t turn down a chance to advance in one   s chosen profession  so we lost kathleen .  and yet all is not lost  either .  i have on numerous occasions mentioned the charming shawna mccarthy  who is as sharp as a scalpel  and who is universally liked for the excellent reason that she is universally likable .  i like her .  shawna served faithfully as right hand person first to george  and then to kathleen .  in the process  she learned every facet of the editing business and developed  thank goodness  the ambition to hold the top position .  so when kathleen left  i said     it has to be shawna     and everyone agreed with me  especially shawna .  and here she is .  readers  female and male  i give you shawna .   religion and science fiction in the november       issue of asimov   s  the cover story was    the gospel according to gamaliel crucis     by that excellent writer  michael bishop .  it dealt with a sensitive subject  the coming of a savior  or  in effect  the second coming of christ .  what makes it even more effective as a science fiction story is that the savior is an extraterrestrial  and not a particularly attractive one to our human eyes since she   .   is a giant mantis .  this is entirely legitimate  it seems to me  since if there is other life in the universe  especially intelligent life  one would expect that a truly universal god would be as concerned for them as for us  and would totally disregard physical shape since it is only the    soul     that inner intellectual and moral identity  that counts .  what is more  bishop decided to make the story more powerful by casting it into a biblical shape  dividing it into chapters and verses and making use of a touch of suitable biblical wording .  the result was a tour de force which we obviously considered quite successful  or we would not have published it .  still we were prepared for the fact that some readers might feel uneasy with  or even offended by  the subject matter and or style .  one letter was quite angry  indeed .  the writer was    strongly displeased    and considered it    a burlesque of the scriptures    and  finding no other value to the story  considered it to have been written and published only for the sake of the burlesque .  this can be argued with  of course  but never entirely settled .  if a reader sees in it only burlesque  he or she can scarcely be argued out of it .  there will always be differences of opinion  often based upon emotion rather than reason  with regard to the value of any work of art .  but there is something more general here .  there is the matter of how science fiction ought to deal with religion  especially our religion .   few people worry very much about how some other religion is handled  since only our own is the true one .   no one wants to offend people unnecessarily  and religion is a touchy subject  as we all know .  in that case  might it not be best simply to avoid religious angles altogether in writing science fiction .  as our angry correspondent says     i suggest .  .  . that offending any substantial religious group is not the way to win friends or sell magazines .     yes  we know that  and since we do want to win friends and sell magazines  we would not knowingly go out of our way to embarrass and humiliate even non substantial groups of our readers just for the fun of it .  but we are also editing a serious science fiction magazine that  we earnestly hope  includes stories of literary value  and it is the very essence of literature that it consider the great ideas and concerns of human history .  surely that complex of ideas that goes under the head of    religion    is one of the most central and essential  and it would be rather a shame to have it declared out of bounds .  in fact  for a magazine to self censor itself out of discussing religion would be to bow to those forces that don   t really believe in our constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and press .  if we were to do so  we would be  in a very deep sense  un american .  besides  if we were to try to avoid this very touchy subject where do we stop .  i tend to ignore religion in my own stories altogether  except when i absolutely have to have it .  well  i absolutely had to have it in some of my early foundation stories and in    nightfall     and so i made use of it .  and  whenever i bring in a religious motif  that religion is bound to seem vaguely christian because that is the only religion i know anything about  even though it is not mine .  an unsympathetic reader might think i am    burlesquing    christianity  but i am not .  then  too  it is impossible to write science fiction and really ignore religion .  what if we find intelligent beings on other worlds .  do they have a religion .  is our god universal  and is he she it their god as well .  what do we do about it .  what do they do about it .  this point is almost never taken up but  since it would certainly arise if such beings were discovered in actual fact  science fiction loses touch with reality in taking the easy way out and pretending religion doesn   t exist .  or  consider time travel .  i don   t know how many stories have been written about people going back in time to keep lincoln from being assassinated  but how about people going back in time to keep jesus from being crucified .  surely that greater feat would occur to someone in actual fact  if time travel were possible .  think of the changes that could be rung on such a theme .  if jesus were rescued while on his way to the site of crucifixion  and if the rescue were made by modern technology  a helicopter or something more advanced  while the roman soldiers were held off by rifle fire at the very least  would it not seem to the people of the time that supernatural forces were rescuing jesus .  would it not seem that angels were coming to the aid of a true savior .  would it not establish christianity as the true religion at once .  or would it .  clearly  it was god   s divine purpose  assuming the god of the bible exists  to have the crucifixion take place in order that jesus serve as a divine atonement for adam   s sin .  would the subversion of this plan be allowed to take place .  it   s a nice dilemma  and it is within the province of legitimate science fiction .  yet who has ever considered writing such a story  even though it would give us a chance to deal with what many consider the central event of history .  the story would be an extremely difficult one to write  and i wouldn   t feel up to it myself  but i think it is primarily self censorship that keeps it from being written .  for that matter  what if we went back in time and found that the biblical jesus never existed .  the mere existence of time travel makes all these speculations irresistible  so is it possible that very religious people might object to time travel themes  and call them blasphemous  simply because of the possibilities they give rise to .  the correspondent says in his letter     dr .  asimov  i know that you are an atheist      and there may be the implication that because of this i am insensitive to the feelings of religionists  or perhaps even anxious to make them seem ridiculous .  as a matter of fact  i have frequently  in my writings  made it clear that i have never encountered any convincing evidence of the existence of the biblical god  and that i am incapable of accepting that existence on faith alone .  that makes me an atheist  but  although this may surprise some americans  the constitution safeguards my right to be one and to proclaim myself one .  nevertheless  although i am an atheist  i am not a proselytizing one  i am not a missionary  i do not treat atheism as a kind of true faith that i must force on everyone .  after all  i have published more than almost anyone  about            words so far  and i have frequently discussed controversial problems .  you are free to go through my writings and search for any sign that i ridicule religion as such .  i have opposed those people who attack legitimate scientific findings  evolution  as an example  in the name of religion  and who do so without evidence  or  worse yet  with distorted and false evidence .  i don   t consider them true religionists  however  and i am careful to point out that they disgrace religion  and are a greater danger to honest religion than to science .  and suppose i weren   t an atheist .  my parents were jewish and i might have been brought up an orthodox jew  or become one of my own volition .  might it then be argued that i would naturally favor any story burlesquing christianity .  or suppose i were a methodist  would i therefore look for stories that burlesqued judaism  or catholicism  or atheism .  if i were in the mood to run this magazine in such a way as to offend    any substantial religious group    i wouldn   t have to be an atheist .  i could do it if i were anything at all  provided only that i were a bigot  or an idiot  or both .  in actual fact  i am neither and again  i offer my collected writings as evidence .  as for shawna  she doesn   t have a similar body of written works to cite but  if i may serve as character witness  i can tell you right now she is certainly not a bigot  and a hundred times certainly not an idiot .  needless to say  i am sorry that our correspondent was upset by    the gospel according to gamaliel crucis .     if we lived in an ideal world  we would never publish any story that upset anyone .  in this case  though  we had to choose .  on the one hand  we had a remarkable story that considered  quite fearlessly  an important idea  and we felt that most readers would recognize this point  if not at once then upon mature consideration .  on the other hand  we had a story that might offend some of our readers .  we made the choice .  we put quality and importance ahead of the chance of some offence .  we hope that our angry correspondent will consider the matter again and see that the story is far more than a burlesque .  he might even give bishop points for skill and courage .   time travel  i have often said  in speaking and in writing  that the qualified science fiction writer avoids the scientifically impossible .  yet i can   t bring myself to make that rule an absolute one  because there are some plot devices that offer such dramatic possibilities that we are forced to overlook the utter implausibilities that are involved .  the most glaring example of this is time travel .  there are infinite tortuosities one can bring to plot development if only you allow your characters to move along the time axis  and i  for one  can   t resist them  so that i have written a number of time travel stories  including one novel  the end of eternity .  you can get away with a kind of diluted time travel story  if you have your character move in the direction we all move  from present to future  and suspend the usual consciousness that accompanies the move by having him  please understand that  for conciseness i am using    him    as a shorthand symbol for    him or her     sleep away a long period of time  as rip van winkle did  or  better  having him frozen for an indefinite period at liquid nitrogen temperatures .  better still  you might make use of relativistic notions and have your character move into the future by having his subjective time slowed through motion at speeds close to that of light  or motion through an enormously intense gravitational field .  these are plausible devices that do not do damage to the structure of the universe  but they are one way motions  with no return possible .  i did it in pebble in the sky although i made use of an unknown  and unspecified  natural law involving nuclear fission  which was then quite new .  this was a weakness in the plot  but i got past it in the first couple of pages and never brought it up again so i hoped no one would notice it .   alas  many did .   the same device can be used to make repeated jumps  always into the future  or to bring someone from the past into the present .  once you have a device that sends someone into the future  however  it is asking too much of writer nature not to use some device  such as a blow on the head  to send a person into the past .   mark twain does it in     a connecticut yankee at king arthur   s court .      for that  there is some scientific justification at the subatomic level  where individual particles are involved and entropy considerations are absent .  for ordinary objects  where entropy is involved  there is none .  but all one shot changes in either direction are only devices to start the story  which then usually proceeds in a completely timebound fashion .  that   s not the true  or pure  time travel story .  in true time travel  the characters can move  at will  back and forth in time .  nor is it fair if this is done through supernatural intervention as in charles dickens   s a christmas carol .  it must be done by an artificial device under the control of a human being .  the first true time travel story was h .  g .  wells   s the time machine  published in      .  wells  who was probably the best science fiction writer of all time  if others  since  seem to have reached greater heights  it is only because they stand on well   s shoulders .    carefully explained the rationale behind it .  it requires four dimensions to locate an object  it is somewhere on the north south axis  somewhere on the east west axis  somewhere on the up down axis  and somewhere on the past future axis .  it exists not only in a certain point of three dimensional space but at a certain instant of time .  a merely three dimensional object is as much a mathematical abstraction as is a two dimensional plane  or a one dimensional line  or a zero dimensional point .  suppose you considered the great wall of china as existing for zero time and therefore consisting of three dimensions only .  it would then not exist at all and you could walk through its supposed position at any time .  since duration is a dimension like height  width  and thickness  and since we can travel at will north and south  east and west  and  if only by jumping  up and down  why shouldn   t we also travel yesterward and tomorrowward as soon as we work out a device for the purpose .  that was       remember  and wells   s analysis at that time had some shadow of justification .  but then  in       came einstein   s special theory of relativity  and it became clear that time is a dimension but it is not like the three spatial dimensions  and it can   t be treated as though it were .  and yet wells   s argument was so winning and the plots it made possible so enticing that science fiction writers generally just ignore einstein and follow wells .     do so myself in the end of eternity .    the dead giveaway that true time travel is flatly impossible arises from the well known    paradoxes    it entails .  the classic example is    what if you go back into the past and kill your grandfather when he was still a little boy .     in that case  you see  the murderer was never born  so who killed the little boy .  but you don   t need anything so drastic .  what if you go back and change any of the many small items that made it possible for your father and mother to meet  or to fall in love after they met  or to marry after they fall in love .  suppose you merely interfered with the crucial moment of sex and had it happen the next evening  or perhaps just five minutes later than it did  so that another sperm fertilized the ovum rather than the one that should have .  that  too  would mean the person committing the act would never come into existence  so who would commit the act .  in fact  to go into the past and do anything would change a great deal of what followed perhaps everything that followed .  so complex and hopeless are the paradoxes that follow  so wholesale is the annihilation of any reasonable concept of causality  that the easiest way out of the irrational chaos that results is to suppose that true time travel is  and forever will be  impossible .  however  any discussion of this gets so philosophical that i lose patience and would rather consider something simpler .  suppose you get into a time machine and travel twenty four hours into the future .  the assumption is that you are traveling only in the time dimension  and that the three spatial dimensions are unchanged .  however  as is perfectly obvious  earth is moving through the three dimensions in a very complex way .  the point on the surface on which the time machine is located is moving about the earth   s axis .  the earth is moving about the center of gravity of the earth moon system  and also about the center of gravity of the earth sun system  is accompanying the sun in its motion about the center of the galaxy  and the galaxy in its undefined motion relative to the center of gravity of the local group and to the center of gravity of the universe as a whole if there is one .  you might  of course  say that the time machine partakes of the motion of the earth  and wherever earth goes  the time machine goes  too .  suppose  though  we consider the earth   s motion  with the solar system generally  around the galactic center .  its speed relative to that center is estimated to be about     kilometers per second .  if the time machine travels twenty four hours into the future in one second  it travels     kilometers x         the number of seconds in a day   or            kilometers in one second .  that   s over sixty three times the speed of light .  if we don   t want to break the speed of light limit  then we must take not less than twenty three minutes to travel one day forward   or backward  in time .  what   s more  i suspect that considerations of acceleration would have to be involved .  the time machine would have to accelerate to light speed and then decelerate from it  and perhaps the human body could only stand so much acceleration in the time direction .  considering that the human body has never in all its evolution accelerated at all in the time direction  the amount of acceleration it ought to be able to endure might be very little indeed  so that the time machine would have to take considerably more than an hour to make a one day journey  say  at a guess  twelve hours .  that would mean we could only gain half a day per day  at most  in traveling through time .  spending ten years to go twenty years into the future  would not be in the least palatable .    can a time machine carry a life support system of that order of magnitude .   and  on top of that  i don   t see that having to chase after the earth would fail to cost the usual amount of energy just because we   re doing it by way of the time dimension .  without calculating the energy  i am positive time travel is insuperably difficult  quite apart from the theoretical considerations that make it totally impossible .  so let   s eliminate it from serious consideration .  but not from science fiction .  time travel stories are too much fun for them to be eliminated merely out of mundane considerations of impracticability  or even impossibility .   part three  on writing science fiction  plotting  every once in a while  an article about me appears in a newspaper  usually in the form of an interview .  i don   t go looking for these things  because i hate the hassle of being photographed  which  these days  invariably goes with interviews  and i hate the risk of being misquoted or misinterpreted .  nevertheless  i can   t always turn these things down because i   m not really a misanthrope  and because i do like to talk about myself .   oh  you noticed .   as a result of one such interview  an article about me appeared in the miami herald of august          .  it was a long article and quite favorable  the headline read    the amazing asimov     and it had very few inaccuracies in it .  it did quote me  to be sure  as saying that my book the sensuous dirty old man was    nauseating .     that is wrong .  i said that the books it satirized  the sensuous woman and the sensuous man  were nauseating .  my book was funny .  it also quoted me as saying that i considered    nightfall    to be my best story .  i don   t  not by a long shot .  i said it was my    best known     story  a different thing altogether .  usually any reporter who interviews me is willing to let it go at that  but the miami herald reporter was more enterprising .  she asked questions of my dear wife  janet  and of my brother  stan  who   s a vice president at the long island newsday .  both said nice things  but then they both like me .  however  she also consulted someone who teaches a course in science fiction at rutgers university .  her name is julia sullivan  and i don   t think i know her  though it is clear from what she is quoted as saying that she is a woman of luminous intelligence and impeccable taste .  she praised my clarity and wit  for instance  but i   m used to that .  the thing is  she is also quoted as saying about me that    he surprises me .  sometimes i think he   s written himself out  and then he comes up with something really good .  .  .  . he has the greatest mind for plot of any science fiction writer .     that   s nice .  i can   t recall anyone praising me for my plots before  and so  of course  it got me to thinking about the whole process of plotting .  a plot is an outline of the events of a story .  you might say  for instance     there   s this prince  see .  his father has recently died and his mother has married his uncle  who becomes the new king .  this upsets the prince who hoped to be king himself and who doesn   t like the uncle anyway .  then he hears that the ghost of his dead father has been seen      the first thing you have to understand is that a plot is not a story  any more than a skeleton is a living animal .  it   s simply a guide to the writer  in the same way that a skeleton is a guide to a paleontologist as to what a long extinct animal must have looked like .  the paleontologist has to fill in the organs  muscles  skin  etc .  all around the skeleton  and that   s not feasible except for a trained person .  hence  if you give the plot of hamlet to a non writer  that will not help him produce hamlet or anything even readable .  well  then  how do you go about building a story around the plot .      you can  if you wish  make the plot so detailed and so complex that you don   t have to do much in the way of    building .     events follow one another in rapid succession and the reader  or viewer  is hurried from one suspense filled situation to another .  you get this at a low level in comic strips and in the old movie serials of the silent days .  this is recognized as being suitable mainly for children  who don   t mind being rushed along without regard for logic or realism or any form of subtlety .  in fact children are apt to be annoyed with anything that impedes the bare bones of the plot  so that a few minutes of love interest is denounced as    mush .     of course  if it is done well enough  you have something like raiders of the lost ark  which i enjoyed tremendously  even if there were parts that made no sense at all .      you can go to the other extreme  if you wish  and virtually eliminate the plot .  there need be no sense of connected events .  you might simply have a series of vignettes as in woody allen   s radio days .  or you might tell a story that is designed merely to create a mood or evoke an emotion or illuminate a facet of the human condition .  this  too  is not for everyone  although  done well  it is satisfying to the sophisticated end of the reader   or viewer  spectrum .  the less sophisticated may complain that the story is not a story and ask    but what does it mean .     or    what happened .     the plotless story is rather like free verse  or abstract art  or atonal music .  something is given up that most people imagine to be inseparable from the art form  but which  if done well  and my goodness  is it hard to do it well   transcends the form and gives enormous satisfaction to those who can follow the writer into the more rarefied realms of the art .      what pleases the great middle people who are not children or semi literate adults  but who are not cultivated esthetes  either  are stories that have distinct plots  plots that are filled out successfully  one way or another  with non plot elements of various types .  i   ll mention a few .    a  you can use the plot as a way of bringing in humor or satire .  read books by p .  g .  wodehouse  or mark twain   s tom sawyer or charles dickens   s nicholas nickleby .    b  you can use the plot to develop an insight into the characters of the individuals who people the story .  the great literary giants  such as homer  shakespeare  goethe  tolstoy  dostoyevksy  do this supremely well .  since human beings and their relationships with each other and with the universe are far more complex and unpredictable than are simple events  the ability to deal with    characterization     successfully is often used as a way of defining    great literature .       c  you can use the plot to develop ideas .  the individuals who people the story may champion alternate views of life and the universe  and the struggle may be one in which each side tries to persuade or force the other into adopting its own worldview .  to do this properly  each side must present its view   ostensibly to each other  but really to the reader  and the reader must be enticed into favoring one side or another so that he can feel suspense over which side will win .  done perfectly  the two opposing views should represent not white and black  but two grays of slightly different shades so that the reader cannot make a clear cut decision but must think and come to conclusions of his own .  i go into greater detail on this version than on the other two  because this is what i do .   there are many other ways of dealing with plot  but the important thing to remember is that they are not necessarily mutually exclusive .  a humorous novel can be full of quite serious ideas and develop interesting characters  for instance .  on the other hand  writers can  more or less deliberately  sacrifice some elements of plot buildups in their anxiety to do  in great detail  what it is they want to do .  i am so intent on presenting my opposing ideas  for instance  that i make no serious attempt to characterize brilliantly or to drench the tale in humor .  as a result  much is made of my    cardboard characters    and i am frequently accused of being    talky .     but these accusations usually come from critics who don   t see  or perhaps lack the intelligence to see  what it is that i am trying to do .  but i   m sure that this is not what ms .  sullivan meant when she said i had    the greatest mind for plot .     i rather think she means that my stories  especially my novels  have very complicated plots that hang together and have no loose ends  that don   t get in the way of the ideas i present in my stories  and that are not obscured by those ideas  either .  now  how is that done .  i wish i could tell you .  all i   m aware of is that it takes a great deal of hard thinking  and that between the thinking and the writing that i must do  there is little time for me to do anything else .  fortunately  i both think and write very quickly and with almost no dithering  so i can get a great deal done .  which brings me to another part of the interview .  the reporter speaks of my apartment as    filled with eclectic  utilitarian furniture chosen more for comfort than for style  much like asimov   s wardrobe .  for a recent speaking engagement  he wore a western tie  a too big jacket  and a striped shirt with the kind of long wide collar that was popular in the     s .     she   s absolutely right .  as far as style is concerned  i   m a shambles .  it doesn   t bother me  though .  to learn to live and dress with full attention to style would require hours upon umpteen hours of thought  of education  of decision making  and so on .  and that takes time i don   t want to subtract from my writing .  what would you rather have .  asimov  the prolific writer  or asimov  the fashion plate .  i warn you .  you can   t have them both .   metaphor      i received a letter from a fan the other day  one who had bought a copy of agent of byzantium by harry turtledove  which appeared in a series entitled    isaac asimov presents .      that   s why he wrote to me .   the cover shows a man dressed  says my correspondent     in a romanesque military uniform  holding a roman helmet in his left hand .     he also carried    a very large  very modern  very lethal looking blaster rifle    and    an electronic scanning device .     my correspondent was intrigued by the anachronism  bought the book  read it  and    enjoyed the book .     however  he found no place in the story where a man was holding such a rifle and scanning device  and he felt cheated .  he had been lured into buying and reading the book by an inaccurate piece of cover art  and he wrote to complain .  so i thought about it .  now my knowledge of art is so small as to be beneath contempt  so naturally  i can   t be learned about it .  there is  however  nothing i don   t understand about the word trade  fifty years of intimate  continuous and successful practice at it gives me the right to say that   and so i will approach matters from that angle .  i see the reader   s complaint as the protest of the    literalist    against    metaphor .      the literalist wants a piece of art  whether word or picture  to be precise and exact with all its information in plain view on the surface .  metaphor  however   from a greek word meaning    transfer      converts one piece of information into another analogous one  because the second one is more easily visualizable  more dramatic  more  in short  poetic .  however  you have to realize there is a transfer involved and if you   re a    born again literalist     if i may use the phrase  you miss the whole point .  let   s try the bible  for instance .  the children of israel are wandering in the desert and come to the borders of canaan .  spies are sent in to see what the situation is and their hearts fail them .  they find a people with strong  walled cities  with many elaborate chariots and skilled armies  and with a high technology .  they come back and report    all the people we saw in it are men of a great stature .  and there we saw the giants .  .  .  . and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight .     right .  they were of    great stature    in the sense that they had a high technology .  they were    giants    of technology and the israelites were    grasshoppers    in comparison .  there was as much chance  the spies felt  of the israelites defeating the canaanites as of a grasshopper defeating a man .  it makes perfect metaphoric sense .  the use of    giants    and    grasshoppers    is dramatic and gets across the idea .  however  both jewish and christian fundamentalists get the vague notion that the canaanites were two hundred feet tall  so that ordinary human beings were as grasshoppers in comparison .  the infliction of literalism on us by fundamentalists who read the bible without seeing anything but words is one of the great tragedies of history .  or let   s turn to shakespeare and the tragedy of macbeth .  macbeth has just killed duncan and his hands are bloody and he is himself horror struck at the deed .  lady macbeth is concerned over her husband   s having been unmanned and gives him some practical advice .     go     she says     get some water and wash this filthy witness from your hand .     and macbeth  his whole mind in disarray  says     will all great neptune   s ocean wash this blood clean from my hand .  no .  this my hand will rather the multitudinous seas incarnadine  making the green one red .     it   s a powerful figure  as you see a bloody hand dipped into the ocean and all the vast sea turning red in response  but  literally  it makes no sense .  how can a few drops of blood turn the ocean red .  all the blood in all the human beings on earth if poured into the ocean would not change its overall color perceptibly .  macbeth might seem to be indulging in    hyperbole     an extravagant exaggeration which sometimes makes its point  but usually reduces it to ridicule  .  this  however  is not hyperbole  but metaphor .  consider .  macbeth has killed a man who had loved him and loaded him with honors  so he commits the terrible sin of ingratitude .  furthermore  the man he murdered was a guest in his house  so that macbeth has violated the hallowed and civilized rules of hospitality .  finally  the man he murdered was his king and in shakespeare   s time  a . king was looked upon as the visible representative of god on earth .  this triple crime has loaded macbeth   s soul with infinite guilt .  the blood cannot redden the ocean  but the blood is not blood  it is used here as a metaphor for guilt .  the picture of the ocean turning red gives you a violently dramatic notion of the infinite blackness that now burdens macbeth   s soul  something you couldn   t get if he had merely said     oh  my guilt is infinite .     a literalist who sets about calculating the effect on the ocean of a bloody hand is getting no value out of what he reads .  one more example .  consider coleridge   s    rime of the ancient mariner .      in the fourteenth verse of the third part  there come the lines     till clomb above the eastern bar the horned moon  with one bright star within the nether tip .     the    horned moon    is the crescent moon  of course  and there can   t be a bright star within the nether tip .  the crescent is the lighted portion of the moon  but the rest of it  though out of the sunlight and dark  is still there .  for a bright star to be within the nether tip is to have it shining through hundreds of miles of lunar substance .  it is an impossibility  and i don   t know how many readers have snickered at coleridge   s naivete in this .  but is it na  vet   .  the poem begins very simply and naturally till the ancient mariner kills the albatross  a lovable and unoffending bird .  this itself is a metaphor .  after all  human beings have killed lovable and unoffending birds since time immemorial .  in this case  though  the killing represents all the callous and indifferent cruelty of the human species  and  as a result  the ship with its crew  who approved the mariner   s deed  enters a strange world in which natural law is suspended and chaos is come again as god removes himself .  the atmosphere of the poem becomes weird and unearthly and normality begins to return only after the mariner involuntarily blesses all the living things in the ocean in a gush of love .  i have a feeling that coleridge knew that a star could not shine within the nether tip of the crescent but merely used it as one more example of the chaos of a world in which human cruelty denies love  order  and god   s presence .  it is only fitting that a star shine where no star could possibly shine .  to miss that point is to miss the point of the poem and to understand only its jigging meter and its clever rhyming  which is plenty  but far from enough .  a literalist deprives himself of the best part of art .  suppose we apply this way of looking at things to visual art .  if you ask an artist to illustrate a piece of writing precisely  you make of him a slave to the literal word .  you suppress his creativity and impugn the independence of his mind and ability .  the better the artist  the less likely he is  barring an absolute need for money  to accept such a job .  an artist worth his salt does not illustrate the literal words  but the mood of a story .  he tries  by virtue of his art and ability  to deepen and reinforce the meaning of a story and the intent of the writer .  thus  in the mid december      issue  the cover of asimov   s illustrates my story    christmas without rodney .     it does not illustrate any incident in the story .  instead it shows in the foreground a boy with a sullen and self absorbed expression .  what   s more  the predominant color is red  which to my way of thinking symbolizes anger  a metaphor for the flushed face of a person in rage  .  this demonstrates the anger of a spoiled brat who does not instantly have his own way  and the anger he inspires in the narrator of the story .  behind the boy is an elaborate robot  with one metal hand to his cheek as though uncertain as to his course of action  something that fulfills one of the underlying themes of the story .  the artist  gary freeman  does not illustrate the story  but adds to it and gives it a visual dimension .  that is what he is supposed to do and what he is paid to do .  this brings us to the cover illustration of agent of byzantium .  it is clearly the intent of the artist to illustrate the nature of the story  not the story itself .  constantinople is in the background  identified by the gilded dome of hagia sophia .  in the foreground is a soldier who has byzantine characteristics .  so far we have an historical novel .  but he also possesses objects of high technology associated with modern western culture .  clearly it is an historical novel set in an alternate reality .  and that is what the book deals with .  the cover is precise  it tells us what we need to know  it satisfies the artist   s own cravings  and if the details of the technology are not precisely met in any incident in the book  that matters not a whit .   ideas  someone once asked isaac newton how he managed to reach solutions to problems that others found impenetrable .  he answered     by thinking and thinking and thinking about it .     i don   t know what other answer people can possibly expect .  there is the romantic notion that there is such a thing as    inspiration     that a heavenly muse comes down and plunks her harp over your head and  presto  the job is done .  like all romantic notions  however  this is just a romantic notion .  some people may be better at solving problems and getting ideas than others are  they may have a livelier imagination  a more efficient way of grasping at distant consequences  but it all comes down to thinking in the end .  what counts is how well you can think  and even more  how long and persistently you can think without breaking down .  there are brilliant people  i imagine  who produce little  if anything  because their attention span to their own thoughts is so short  and there are less brilliant people who can plug away at their thoughts until they wrench something out of them .  all this comes up in my mind now because a friend of mine  a science fiction writer whose work i admire enormously  in the course of a conversation asked  in a very embarrassed manner     how do you get your ideas .     i could see what the problem was .  he had been having a little trouble coming up with something and he thought that perhaps he had lost the knack of getting ideas  or had never really had it  and he turned to me .  after all  i write so much that i must have no trouble getting ideas and i might even have some special system that others could use  too .  but i answered  very earnestly     how do i get my ideas .  by thinking and thinking and thinking till i   m ready to jump out the window .        you  too .     he said  quite obviously relieved .     of course     i said .     if you   re having trouble  all it means is that you   re one of us .  after all  if getting ideas were easy  everyone in the world would be writing .     after that  i put some serious thought into the matter of getting ideas .  was there any way i could spot my own system .  was there  in fact  any system at all  or did one simply think at random .  i went back over what happened in my mind before i wrote my most recent novel  nemesis  which doubleday published in october       and i thought it might be helpful to aspiring writers  or even just to readers  if i described the preliminary thinking that went into the novel .  it started when my doubleday editor  jennifer brehl  said to me     i   d like your next novel not to be part of a series  isaac .  i don   t want it to be a foundation novel or a robot novel or an empire novel .  write one that   s completely independent .     so i started thinking  and this is the way it went  in brief .   i   ll cut out all the false starts and dead ends and mooning about and try to trace a sensible pathway through it all .   the foundation novels  robot novels  and empire novels are all interconnected and all deal with a background in which interstellar travel at super luminal speeds is well established .  of my previous independent novels  the end of eternity deals with time travel  the gods themselves with communication between universes  and fantastic voyage ii with miniaturization .  in none of these is there interstellar travel .  very well  then  let me have a new novel which exploits an entirely new background .  let it deal with the establishment of interstellar travel  with the first interstellar voyages .  immediately i imagined a settled solar system  an earth in decay  large numbers of space settlements in lunar orbit and in the asteroids .  i imagined the space settlements as hostile to earth and vice versa .  that gave me a reason for the drive to develop interstellar travel .  naturally  technological advances may be made for their own sake  as mountains are climbed    because they   re there     but it helps to have a less exalted reason .  a settlement might want to get away from the solar system to create a completely new society  profiting by past experience to avoid some of humanity   s earlier mistakes .  good  but where do they go .  if they have true interstellar flight  as in my foundation novels  they can go anywhere  but that   s too much freedom .  it introduces too many possibilities and not enough difficulties .  if humanity is just developing interstellar flight  it might not be a very efficient process at first and a settlement trying to escape might find itself with a very limited range .  now where do they go .  the logical place is alpha centauri  the nearest star  but that is so logical that there   s no fun to it .  well  then  what if there   s another star only half as far as alpha centauri .  that would be easier to reach .  but why haven   t we seen it  if it exists .  well  it   s a red dwarf star and very dim  and besides there   s a patch of interstellar dust between it and ourselves and that dims it further so that it just hasn   t been noticed .  at that point  i remembered that a few years ago there was some speculation that the sun might have a very distant red dwarf companion that once in every revolution penetrated the comet cloud and sent some comets whizzing into the inner solar system where one or two might occasionally collide with earth and produce the periodic waves of life extinction .  the red dwarf was called nemesis .  the suggestion seems to have died down  but i made use of it .  my characters would go to the nearby red dwarf  which i would call nemesis  and then use that as the name for my novel .  of course  you can   t very well have a habitable planet circling a red dwarf star  but i wanted one .  it would give me greater flexibility than simply to have the settlement go into orbit about the red dwarf .  that meant i had to think up a set of conditions that  if you don   t question things too closely  would make it sound as though a habitable planet could exist .  for that i had to invent a gas giant  with an earth sized satellite  and it would be the satellite that would be habitable .  now i needed a problem .  the obvious one would be that nemesis was circling the sun and would eventually pass through the comet cloud .  i rejected that because it had been well discussed in the media and i wanted something a little less expected .  so i decided that nemesis was an independent star that happened to be en route to a relatively near miss of the solar system  with possibly dangerous gravitational effects .  that was a good problem  but i needed a plausible solution .  that took some time but i finally thought one up .   sorry  i won   t tell you what it is .  for that you   ll have to read the book .   what i needed next was a good character that would serve as the spinal column of the book  around whom everything would revolve .  i chose a fourteen year old girl  with certain characteristics that i thought would make her interesting .  then i needed a place to start the book .  i would begin with my main character and have her do or say something that starts the chain of events that will take up the rest of the book .  i made the choice and then waited no longer .  i sat down and started the book .  but  you might point out that i didn   t yet have the novel .  all i had was the social framework  a problem  a solution  a character and a beginning .  when do i make up all the details that go into the characteristically involved plot of one of my novels  and nemesis is quite involved  .  i   m afraid that i make that up as i go along  but not without thought .  having worked out the first scene  i find that by the time i   ve finished that  i have the second scene in mind  at the conclusion of which i have the third scene  and so on all the way through to the ninety fifth scene or so  which ends the novel .  to do that  i have to keep on thinking  on a smaller and more detailed scale all the time that i   m doing the book  which takes me nine months  perhaps  .  i do it at the cost of lots of lost sleep and lots of lack of attention to people and things about me  including an occasional blank stare even at my dear wife  janet  who never fails to get the alarmed notion that    something   s wrong    each time i go into a spasm of thought  .  but then isn   t it possible that two thirds of the way through the book i realize that toward the beginning i made a wrong turn and am now beating my way down a blind alley .  it is possible  but it   s never happened to me yet  and i don   t expect it to .  i always build the next scenes on whatever it is i have already done and never consider any possible alternatives .  i simply have no time to start over again .  however  i don   t mean to make the process sound simpler than it really is .  you must take into account  in the first place  that i have a natural aptitude for this sort of thing  and  also  that i have been doing it for over half a century now  and experience counts .  anyway  this is the closest i can come to explaining where i get my ideas .   suspense  i have said over and over again that i write by instinct only and that there is nothing purposeful or deliberate in what i do .  consequently  i am always more or less puzzled by people who analyze my writing and find all sorts of subtle details in it that i don   t recall ever putting in but that i suppose must be there or the critic wouldn   t find them and pull them out .  still  i have never been so puzzled as recently when i read a discussion of science fiction  where and by whom i do not remember for i threw it out in annoyance as soon as i came across the passage i   m about to tell you of  .  getting to me  the essayist mentioned the fact that my style was clumsy  my dialog stilted  my characterization non existent  but that there was no question that my books were    page turners .     in fact  he said  i was the most reliable producer of    page turning    writing in science fiction .  it was only after i had thrown out the material and sworn a bit that i began to think of what i had read .  what the essayist had said seemed to make no sense .  of course  he might be mad  but suppose  for the sake of argument  that he wasn   t .  in that case  if i were utterly deficient in style  dialog  and characterization  how could my writings be    page turners    .  why should any reader want to turn the page  that is  keep on reading  when what he read had nothing to recommend it .  what made a person want to keep on reading anything .  the most obvious reason was    suspense     which comes from latin words meaning    to be hanging     that is     to be suspended .     the reader finds himself in a painful situation where he is uncertain as to what will happen next in his reading matter  and he wants desperately to find out .  mind you  suspense is not an inalienable part of literature .  no one reads shakespeare   s sonnets in order to experience suspense .  nor do you read a p .  g .  wodehouse novel for the sake of suspense .  you know that bertie wooster will get out of the ridiculous fix in which he finds himself  and you don   t really care whether he does or not .  you read on only because you enjoy laughing .  most writing  however  especially in the less exalted realms of literature  is kept going by suspense .  the simplest form of suspense is to put your protagonist into constant danger  and make it seem certain that he can   t possibly get out of it .  then get him out of it just so that you can plunge him into something even worse  and so on .  then  having carried it on as long as you can  you let him emerge victorious .  you get this in its purest simplicity in something like the flash gordon comic strip  where  for years  flash ricocheted from crisis to crisis without ever getting time to wipe his brow  let alone go to the bathroom  .  or consider the kind of movie serial typified by the perils of pauline  in which the perils continued for fifteen installments  each ending in a cliffhanger .   this was so called because the protagonist was left hanging from a cliff or caught in some equally dangerous situation until the next episode of the serial a week later  a week spent by the kid viewers in delicious agony  resolved the situation .   this sort of suspense is ultra simple .  whether flash or pauline survives matters really only to flash or pauline .  nothing of greater moment hinges on their survival .  we take a step forward in crime novels whereupon success or failure may hinge the smooth functioning of justice  or in spy novels whereupon success or failure may hinge the survival of the nation  or in science fiction whereupon success or failure may hinge the survival of the earth itself  or even of the universe .  if we consider jack williamson   s the legion of space  which i read as a teenager with the same emotions that i viewed the movie serials half a decade earlier  we find the same unending danger about to destroy our beloved heroes and the security of earth along with them .  that gives more meaning and more tension to the story .  moving still farther up  then  we come to tales of unending danger that involve the great battle between good and evil  almost in the abstract .  surely the best example of this is j .  r .  r .  tolkien   s the lord of the rings  in which the forces of good  crystallized in the end into the person of brave  suffering little frodo  must somehow defeat the all but omnipotent satan figure of sauron .  mind you  suspense is not all that is required to make a piece of writing totally effective .  in most cases  it suffices only for one reading .  once you have seen the perils of pauline once  there is no need ever to see it again  because you know how she overcomes all her perils .  that removes the suspense  and once the suspense is gone  nothing else remains .  yet there are suspense filled items you read over and over again long after the suspense has been knocked out of them .  i suppose that it is possible for a person who is reading   or seeing  hamlet for the first time to be caught up most of all in whether hamlet will defeat his wicked uncle or not .  but i have read and seen hamlet dozens of times and i know every word of the play and yet i always enjoy it  because the beauty of the language is sufficient in itself  and the texture of the plot is so thick that one never runs out of different methods of producing the play .  in the same way  i have read the lord of the rings five times and enjoyed it more each time  because getting the suspense out of the way actually allows me to enjoy the writing and the texture of the book all the more .  now i come to my own writing  but i can only discuss it if you who are reading it understand that i never did anything of what i am about to describe purposely .  it all got done  every bit of it  instinctively  and i only understand it now after the fact .  i was interested  apparently  in going beyond the rather simplistic balance between good and evil  i didn   t want the hero adventuring with the reader always certain that he ought to win over the nasty villains  so that the nation or the society or the earth or the universe could be saved .  i wanted a situation in which the reader could not be certain which side was good and which evil  or in which he might wonder if perhaps both sides contained mixtures of good and evil .  i wanted a situation where the problem and the danger was itself uncertain  and where the resolution was not necessarily a true resolution because it might conceivably make things worse in the long run .  in short  i wanted to write fictional history in which there are no true endings  no true    they lived happily ever after     but in which  even when a problem is apparently solved  a new one arises to take its place .  to this end  i sacrificed everything else .  i made no attempt to indulge in anything but necessary description  so that i worked always on a    bare stage .     i forced the dialog to serve nothing more than as an indication of the progress of the problem  if there was one  toward the resolution  if there was one  .  i wasted no time on action for its own sake  or on characterization or on poetic writing .  i made everything just as clear and as straightforward as i could  so that the reader could concentrate on  and drive himself mad over  all the ambiguities i would introduce .   as you see  then  critics who complain that my books are too talky  and that they contain little or no action  miss the point completely .   i do my best to present a number of characters  each of whom has a different world view and each of whom argues his case as cogently as possible .  each of them thinks he is doing the sensible thing  working for the good of humanity  or his part of it .  there is no general agreement on what the problem might be  or even  sometimes  whether there is one at all  and when the story ends even the hero himself may not be satisfied with what he has done .  i worked this out little by little in my stories and novels  and it reached its peak in the foundation series .  there is indeed suspense in the series on a simple scale .  will the small world of the first foundation hold its own against the surrounding mightier kingdoms and  if so  how .  will it survive the onslaught of the empire and of a mutant emotion controller  and of the second foundation .  but that is not the prime suspense .  should the first foundation survive .  should there be a second empire .  will the second empire just be a repetition of the miseries of the first .  are the traders or the mayors correct in their view of what the first foundation ought to do .  in the two later volumes  the hero golan trevize spends the first in coming to an agonized decision  and the second in an agonized wonder as to whether his decision was right .  in short  i try to introduce all the uncertainties of history  instead of the implausible certainties of an unrealistic fictional world .  and apparently it works  and my novels are    page turners .     but i have more to say and i will continue my discussion of suspense in next month    s editorial .   serials  when is a writer not a writer .  when he is asked to write outside his specialty .  writing is not a unitary matter .  a person who is a skilled science writer  or who can turn out fascinating popular histories  may be hopeless when it comes to writing fiction .  the reverse is also true .  even a person like myself who is adept at both fiction and nonfiction and ranges over considerable variety in both subdivisions is not a universal writer .  i can   t and won   t write plays  whether for the theater  motion pictures  or television .  i don   t have the talent for it .  it is surprising  in fact  how thinly talent can be subdivided .  the functions  advantages  and disadvantages of fiction differ so with subject matter that every writer is more at home in one kind of fiction than in another .  i can do science fiction and mysteries  but i would be madly misjudging myself if i tried to do    mainstream     fiction or even    new wave    science fiction .  oddly enough  even length counts .  you might think that if someone is writing a story  it can be any length .  if it finishes itself quickly  it is a short story  if it goes on for a long time  it is a novel  if it is something in between  it is a novelette or a novella .  that   s just not so .  length is not the sole difference .  a novel is not a lengthy short story .  a short story is not a brief novel .  they are two different species of writing .  a novel has space in which to develop a plot leisurely  with ample room for subplots  for detailed background  for description  for character development  for comic relief .  a short story must make its point directly and without side issues .  every sentence must contribute directly to the plot development .  a novel is a plane  a short story is a line .  a novel which is too short and thus abbreviates the richness of its development would be perceived by the reader as skimpy and therefore unsatisfactory .  a short story which is too long and allows the reader   s attention to wander from the plot is diffuse and therefore unsatisfactory .  there are writers who are at home with the broad swing of the novel and are not comfortable within the confinement of the short story .  there are writers who are clever at driving home points in short stories and who are lost in the echoing chambers of the novel .  and of course there are writers who can do both .  a magazine such as ours is primarily a vehicle in which the short story is displayed .  it is important we fulfill this function for a variety of reasons     .  short stories are worth doing and worth reading .  they can make concise points that novels cannot  in ways that novels cannot .     .  a group of short stories which  in length  take up the room of one novel  offers far more variety than a novel can  and there is something very pleasant about variety .     .  those writers who are adept at the short story need a vehicle .     .  beginning writers need a vehicle  too  and beginners are well advised to concentrate on short stories at the start .  even if their true skill turns out to be in the novel  initial training had better be in the short story  which requires a smaller investment in time and effort .  a dozen short stories will take no more time than a novel and offer much more scope for experimentation and    finding one   s self .      when george  joel  and i began this magazine  we were aware of all these points and were determined to make it a magazine devoted to the short story exclusively .  and we are still so determined .  yet it is not easy to be rigid .  it is perhaps not even desirable to be rigid under all circumstances .  there are times when the best of rules ought to be bent a little .  what are the forces  for instance  that drag us in the direction of length .  to begin with  there are  rightly or wrongly  more literary honors and monetary rewards for novels than for short stories  so that if a writer can handle any length  he usually finds himself gravitating toward the novel .  naturally  since a novel requires a great investment of time and effort  it is the experienced writers of tried quality who are most likely to move in that direction .  and once they   ve done that  they   re not likely to want to let go .  it becomes difficult  in fact  to persuade them to take time out from their current novel in order to write a short story .  as long as we stick rigidly to short stories  therefore  we tend to lose the chance at picking up the work of some of the best practitioners in the field .  newcomers  however worthy  tend to have lesser experience and their writing tends to be less polished .  for the most part  this does not dismay us .  we want the newcomers  and the freshness of concept and approach is quite likely to make up for what clumsiness of technique is brought about through inexperience .  the clumsiness  after all  will smooth out with time  and at that point  the new talent will almost inevitably begin to write novels .  occasionally  then  we bend .  if a story comes along by an established writer that is unusually good but is rather long  we are tempted to run it .  we have indeed run stories as long as        words in a single issue .  there are advantages to this .  if you like the story  you can get deeply immersed in it and savor the qualities that length makes possible and that you can   t get otherwise .  and there are disadvantages .  if you don   t like the story and quit reading it  you have only half a magazine left and you may feel cheated .  george must judge the risk and decide when a long story is likely to be so generally approved of that the advantage will far outweigh the disadvantage .  but what do we do about novels .  ignore them .  most novelists do not object to making extra money by allowing a magazine to publish part or all of the novel prior to its publication as a novel .  and most magazines welcome the chance of running a novel in installments .  consider the advantages to the magazine .  if the first part of a serial is exciting  well written and grabs the reader  it is to be expected that a great many readers will then haunt the newsstands waiting for the next issue .  if many serials prove to have this grabbing quality  readers will subscribe rather than take the chance of missing installments .  magazine publishers do not object to this .  even joel wouldn   t .  there are  however  disadvantages .  some readers actively dislike novels .  others may like novels but bitterly resent being stopped short and asked to wait a month for a continuation  and may also resent having to run the risk of missing installments .  we are aware of these disadvantages and also of our own responsibility for encouraging the short story  so we have sought a middle ground .  these days there are so many novels and so few magazines that there isn   t room to serialize them all .  many good novels are therefore available for the prior publication of only a chunk of themselves  some chunk that stands by itself .  we have been deliberately keeping our eyes open for these .  it   s not always easy to find a novel chunk that stands by itself .  the fact that something goes afterward  or comes before  or both  is likely to give the reader a vague feeling of incompleteness .  sometimes  then  we try to run several chunks  each of which stands by itself  or almost does .  this comes close to serialization  but if the second piece can be read comfortably without reference to the first  then it   s not .  again  george must use his judgment in such cases .  but then  every once in a long while  we are trapped by our own admiration of a novel and find ourselves with a chunk we would desperately like to publish  but that is too long to fit into a single issue and that can   t conveniently be divided into two independent chunks .  then  with a deep breath  if we can think of no way out  we serialize .  we hate to do this  and we hardly ever will .  but hardly ever isn   t never .  when there   s no other way out  rather than lose out on something really first class  we will have to ask you to wait a month .  but hardly ever .   the name of our field  in last issue   s editorial  i talked of jules verne   s    extraordinary voyages    and that brings up the point of how difficult it was to find a name for the kind of items that are published in this magazine and others like it .  this magazine contains    stories     and    story    is simply a shortened form of    history     a recounting of events in orderly detail .  the recounting could  in either case  be of real incidents or of made up ones  but we have become used to thinking of a    history    as real and of a    story    as made up .  a    tale    is something that is    told     from the anglo saxon  and a    narrative    is something that is    narrated      from the latin  .  either    tale    or    narrative    can be used for either a real or a made up account .     narrative    is the less common of the two simply because it is the longer word and therefore has an air of pretentiousness about it .  a word which is used exclusively for made up items and never for real ones is    fiction     from a latin word meaning    to invent .     what this magazine contains  then  are stories  or tales  or  most precisely  fiction .  naturally  fiction can be of different varieties  depending on the nature of the content .  if the events recounted deal mainly with love  we have    love stories    or    love tales    or    love fiction .     similarly  we can have    detective stories     or    terror tales     or    mystery fiction     or    confession stories     or    western tales     or    jungle fiction .     the items that appear in this magazine deal  in one fashion or another  with future changes in the level of science  or of science derived technology .  doesn   t it make sense  then  to consider the items to be    science stories     or    science tales     or  most precisely     science fiction    .  and yet    science fiction     which is so obvious a name when you come to think of it  is a late development .  jules verne   s extraordinary voyages were called    scientific fantasies    in great britain  and the term    science fantasy    is still sometimes used today .     fantasy    is from a greek word meaning    imagination    so it isn   t completely inappropriate  but it implies the minimal existence of constraints .  when we speak of    fantasy    nowadays  we generally refer to stories that are not bound by the laws of science  whereas science fiction stories are so bound .  another term used in the     s was    scientific romance .     romance was originally used for anything published in the    romance languages     that is  in the popular tongues of western europe  so that it was applied to material meant to be read for amusement .  more serious works were written in latin  of course .  the trouble is that    romance    has come to be applied to love stories in particular so    science romance    has a wrong feel to it .     pseudo science stories    was sometimes used  but that is insulting .     pseudo    is from a greek word meaning    false     and while the kind of extrapolations of science used in science fiction are not true science  they are not false science either .  they are    might be true    science .     super science stories     still another name  is childish .  in       when hugo gernsback published the first magazine ever to be devoted exclusively to science fiction  he called it amazing stories .  this caught on .  when other magazines appeared  synonyms for    amazing    were frequently used .  we had astounding stories  astonishing stories  wonder stories  marvel stories  and startling stories all on the stands  when the world and i were young .  such names  however  do not describe the nature of the stories but their effect on the reader  and that is insufficient .  a story can amaze  astound  astonish  and startle you  it can cause you to marvel and wonder  and yet it need not be science fiction .  it need not even be fiction .  something better was needed .  gernsback knew that .  he had originally thought of calling his magazine    scientific fiction .     that is hard to pronounce quickly  though  chiefly because of the repetition of the syllable    fic .     why not combine the words and eliminate one of those syllables .  we then have    scientifiction .        scientifiction     though  is an ugly word  hard to understand and  if understood  likely to scare off those potential readers who equate the    scientific    with the    difficult .     gernsback therefore used the word only in a subtitle  amazing stories  the magazine of scientifiction .  he introduced    stf    as the abbreviation of    scientifiction .     both abbreviation and word are still sometimes used .  when gernsback was forced to give up amazing stories he published a competing magazine  science wonder stories .  in its first issue  june         he used the term    science fiction    and the abbreviation    s . f .      or    sf    without periods  became popular .  occasionally  the word has been hyphenated as    science fiction     but that is only done rarely .  the story  however  doesn   t end there .  as i said last issue  there is a feeling among some that the phrase    science fiction    unfairly stresses the science content of the stories .  since      in particular  science fiction has tended to shift at least some of its emphasis from science to society  from gadgets to people .  it still deals with changes in the level of science and technology  but those changes move farther into the background .  i believe it was robert heinlein who first suggested that we ought to speak of    speculative fiction     instead  and some  like harlan ellison  strongly support that move now .  to me  though     speculative    seems a weak word .  it is four syllables long and is not too easy to pronounce quickly .  besides  almost anything can be speculative fiction .  a historical romance can be speculative  a true crime story can be speculative .     speculative fiction    is not a precise description of our field and i don   t think it will work .  in fact  i think    speculative fiction    has been introduced only to get rid of    science    but to keep    s . f .     this brings us to forrest j .  ackerman  a wonderful guy whom i love dearly .  he is a devotee of puns and word play and so am i  but forry has never learned that some things are sacred .  he couldn   t resist coining    sci fi    as an analog  in appearance and pronunciation  to    hi fi     the well known abbreviation for    high fidelity .        sci fi    is now widely used by people who don   t read science fiction .  it is used particularly by people who work in movies and television .  this makes it  perhaps  a useful term .  we can define    sci fi    as trashy material sometimes confused  by ignorant people  with sf .  thus  star trek is sf while godzilla meets mothra is sci fi .   hints  every once in a short while i get a letter from some eager young would be writer asking me for some    hints    on the art of writing science fiction .  the feeling i have is that my correspondents think there is some magic formula jealously guarded by the professionals  but that since i   m such a nice guy i will spill the beans if properly approached .  alas  there   s no such thing  no magic formula  no secret tricks  no hidden short cuts .  i   m sorry to have to tell you that it   s a matter of hard work over a long period of time .  if you know of any exceptions to this  that   s exactly what they are  exceptions .  there are  however  some general principles that could be useful  to my way of thinking  and here they are      you have to prepare for a career as a successful science fiction writer  as you would for any other highly specialized calling .   first  you have to learn to use your tools  just as a surgeon has to learn to use his .  the basic tool for any writer is the english language  which means you must develop a good vocabulary and brush up on such prosaic things as spelling and grammar .  there can be little argument about vocabulary  but it may occur to you that spelling and grammar are just frills .  after all  if you write great and gorgeous stories  surely the editor will be delighted to correct your spelling and grammar .  not so .  he  or she  won   t be .  besides  take it from an old war horse  if your spelling and grammar are rotten  you won   t be writing a great and gorgeous story .  someone who can   t use a saw and hammer doesn   t turn out stately furniture .  even if you   ve been diligent at school  have developed a vocabulary  can spell    sacrilege    and    supersede    and never say    between you and i    or    i ain   t never done nothing     that   s still not enough .  there   s the subtle structure of the english sentence and the artful construction of the english paragraph .  there is the clever interweaving of plot  the handling of dialog  and a thousand other intricacies .  how do you learn that .  do you read books on how to write  or attend classes on writing  or go to writing conferences .  these are all of inspirational value  i   m sure  but they won   t teach you what you really want to know .  what will teach you is the careful reading of the masters of english prose .  this does not mean condemning yourself to years of falling asleep over dull classics .  good writers are invariably fascinating writers  the two go together .  in my opinion  the english writers who most clearly use the correct word every time and who most artfully and deftly put together their sentences and paragraphs are charles dickens  mark twain  and p .  g .  wodehouse .  read them  and others  but with attention .  they represent your schoolroom .  observe what they do and try to figure out why they do it .  it   s no use other people explaining it to you  until you see it for yourself and it becomes part of you  nothing will help .  but suppose that no matter how you try  you can   t seem to absorb the lesson .  well  it may be that you   re not a writer .  it   s no disgrace .  you can always go on to take up some slightly inferior profession like surgery or the presidency of the united states .  it won   t be as good  of course  but we can   t all scale the heights .  second  for a science fiction writing career  it is not enough to know the english language  you also have to know science .  you may not want to use much science in your stories  but you   ll have to know it anyway  so that what you do use  you don   t misuse .  this does not mean you have to be a professional scientist  or a science major at college .  you don   t even have to go to college .  it does mean  though  that you have to be willing to study science on your own  if your formal education has been weak in that direction .  it   s not impossible .  one of the best writers of hard science fiction is fred pohl  and he never even finished high school .  of course  there are very few people who are as bright as fred  but you can write considerably less well than he does and still be pretty good .  fortunately  there is more good  popular science writing these days than there was in previous generations  and you can learn a great deal  rather painlessly  if you read such science fiction writers as l .  sprague de camp  ben bova  and poul anderson in their nonfictional moods  or even isaac asimov .  what   s more  professional scientists are also writing effectively for the public these days  as witness carl sagan   s magnificent books .  and there   s always scientific american .  third  even if you know your science and your writing  it is still not likely that you will be able to put them together from scratch .  you will have to be a diligent reader of science fiction itself to learn the conventions and the tricks of the trade  how to interweave background and plot  for instance .      you have to work at the job .   the final bit of schooling is writing itself .  nor must you wait till your preparation is complete .  the act of writing is itself part of the preparation .  you can   t completely understand what good writers do until you try it yourself .  you learn a great deal when you find your story breaking apart in your hands  or beginning to hang together .  write from the very beginning  then  and keep on writing .      you have to be patient .   since writing is itself a schooling  you can   t very well expect to sell the first story you write .   yes  i know bob heinlein did it  but he was bob heinlein .  you are only you .   but then  why should that discourage you .  after you finished the first grade at school  you weren   t through  were you .  you went on to the second grade  then the third  then the fourth  and so on .  if each story you write is one more step in your literary education  a rejection shouldn   t matter .   editors don   t reject writers  they reject pieces of paper that have been typed on .  ed .   the next story will be better  and the next one after that still better  and eventually but then why bother to submit the stories .  if you don   t  how can you possibly know when you graduate .  after all  you don   t know which story you   ll sell .  you might even sell the first .  you almost certainly won   t  but you just might .  of course  even after you sell a story  you may fail to place the next dozen  but having done it once  it is quite likely that you will eventually do it again  if you persevere .  but what if you write and write and write and you don   t seem to be getting any better and all you collect are printed rejection slips .  once again  it may be that you are not a writer and will have to settle for a lesser post such as that of chief justice of the supreme court .      you have to be reasonable .   writing is the most wonderful and satisfying task in the world  but it does have one or two insignificant flaws .  among those flaws is the fact that a writer can almost never make a living at it .  oh  a few writers make a lot of money  they   re the ones we all hear about .  but for every writer who rakes it in  there are a thousand who dread the monthly rent bill .  it shouldn   t be like that  but it is .  take my case .  three years after i sold my first story  i reached the stage of selling everything i wrote  so that i had become a successful writer .  nevertheless  it took me seventeen more years as a successful writer before i could actually support myself in comfort on my earnings as a writer .  so while you   re trying to be a writer  make sure you find another way of making a decent living  and don   t quit your job after you make your first sale .   writing for young people  there is an exceedingly useful volume entitled the science fiction encyclopedia edited by peter nicholls  doubleday        to which i frequently refer .  recently  as i leafed through its pages en route to looking up something  i came across the following passage     the intellectual level of a book is not necessarily expressed by a marketing label .  much adult sf  the works of .  .  . isaac asimov  for example  is of great appeal to older children  and is to some extent directed at them .     the line of three dots in the above quotation signals the omission of a few words in which the writer specifies two other science fiction writers .  i omit them because they may resent the original statement and may not feel i ought to give the remark further circulation .  as for me  i don   t object to the comment because  for one thing  i consider it true .  i write my    adult    novels for adults  but i have no objection whatsoever to young people reading them  and i try to write in such a way that my novels are accessible to them .  why .  first  it is the way i like to write .  i like to have the ideas in my novels sufficiently interesting and subtle to catch at the attention and thinking of intelligent adults  and  at the same time  to have the writing clear enough so as to raise no difficulties for the intelligent youngster .  to manage the combination i consider a challenge  and i like challenges .  second  it is good business .  attract an adult and you may well have someone who is here today and gone tomorrow .  attract a youngster and you have a faithful reader for life .  mind you  i don   t write as i do with the second reason in mind  i write as i do for the first reason i gave you .  nevertheless  i have discovered that the second reason exists  and i have long lost count of the number of people who tell me they have an astronomical number of my books and that they    were at once hooked after reading my book  so and so  when they were ten years old .     but if the same books can be read by both adults and youngsters  what is the distinction between truly adult books  ones that the writer of the item in the science fiction encyclopedia would judge as possessing a high    intellectual level     and truly juvenile books .  let   s see .  can it be vocabulary .  do adult books have    hard words    while juvenile books have    easy words    .  to some extent  i suppose that might be so .  if an author makes a fetish of using unusual words  as william buckley does   or clark ashton smith  to mention someone in our own line   then the writing grows opaque for youngsters and adults alike  for it is my experience that the average adult does not have a vocabulary much larger  if any  than a bright youngster does .  on the other hand  if an author uses the correct words  hard or easy  then the bright youngster will guess the meaning from the context or look it up in a dictionary .  i think the bright youngster enjoys having his mind stretched and welcomes the chance of learning a new word .  i don   t worry about my vocabulary  for that reason  even when i am writing my science books for grade school youngsters .  i may give the pronunciation of scientific terms they are not likely to have encountered before  and i sometimes define them  but i don   t avoid them  and after having given pronunciation and definition i use them freely .  well  then  is it the difference between long sentences and short sentences .  that is true only in this sense  it is more difficult to make a long sentence clear than it is to make a short one clear .  if  then  you are a poor writer and want to make sure that youngsters understand you  stick to short sentences .  unfortunately  a long series of short sentences  like a long stretch of writing with no    hard    words  is irritating to anyone intelligent  young or old .  a youngster is particularly offended because he thinks  sometimes with justice  that the writer thinks that because the youngster is young  he is therefore stupid .  the book is at once discarded .   this is called    writing down     by the way  something i try never to do .   the trick is to write clearly .  if you write clearly enough  a long sentence will hold no terrors .  if you hit the proper mix of long and short  and hard and easy  and make everything clear  then  believe me  the youngster will have no trouble .  of course  he has to be an intelligent youngster  but there are a larger percentage of those than of intelligent oldsters  for life hasn   t had a chance yet to dull the youngsters    wits .  is it a matter of subject matter .  do adult novels deal with death and torture and mayhem and sex  natural and unnatural  and all kinds of unpleasantness  while juvenile novels deal with sweetness and niceness .  you know that   s not so .  think of the current rash of    horror    films  which fill the screen with blood and murder and torture and are designed to frighten .  youngsters flock to them  and the gorier they are  the more they enjoy them .  even censors don   t seem to mind the mayhem .  when there are loud squawks from the righteous who want to kick books out of school libraries  the objections are most often to the use of    dirty    words and to sex .  however  i have  in my time  lived half a block from a junior high school and listened to the youngsters going there and coming back .  i picked up a lot of colorful obscenity  both sexual and scatological  in that way  for i had forgotten some of what i had learned as a youngster .  i think the youngsters themselves would have no objection to books containing gutter language and sexual detail  or fail to understand them  either .  that distinction between adult books and juvenile books is not a natural one but is enforced by adult fiat .   i admit that i use no gutter language or sex in my juvenile books  but then i use no gutter language and very little sex in my adult books .    how about action  then .  adult books can pause for sensitive description of all kinds  or for a skillful and painstaking dissection of motivation  and so on .  juvenile books tend to deal entirely with action .  is that right .  actually  the distinction is not between adults and juveniles  but between a few people  both adult and juvenile  and most people  both adult and juvenile  .  most people  of whatever age  are impatient with anything but action .  watch the popular adventure programs on television  subtract the action  and find out what you have left  and then remember that it is adults  for the most part  who are watching them .  on the other hand  my books contain very little    action     hence no movie sales  and deal largely with the interplay of ideas in rather cerebral dialog  as many critics point out  sometimes with irritation  and yet  says the encyclopedia  i appeal to youngsters .  clarity  not action  is the key .  can it be a question of style .  are adult books written in a complicated and experimental style  while juvenile books are not .  to be sure  a juvenile book written in a complicated and experimental style is more apt to be a commercial failure than one written in a straightforward style .  on the other hand  this is also true of adult books .  the difference is that tortuous style is frequently admired by critics in adult books  but never in juvenile books .  this means that many adults  who are guided by critics  or who merely wish to appear chic  buy opaque and experimental books  and then  possibly  don   t read them  aside from any    dirty parts    they might have .  proust   s remembrance of things past springs to mind .  my dear wife  janet  is reading it  every word  for the second time but there are moments when i see the perspiration standing out  in great drops  on her forehead .  how about rhetorical tricks .  metaphors  allusions  and all the rest of it  depend upon experience  and youngsters  however bright they are  have not yet had time to gather experience .  for instance  my george and azazel stories are pure fluff  but they are the most nearly adult stories i write .  i use my full vocabulary  together with involved sentence structure  and never hesitate to rely on the reader to fill in what i leave out .  i can refer to    the elusive promise of nocturnal elysium     without any indication of what i mean .  i can speak of the eiffel tower as a    stupid building still under construction     and depend on the reader to know what the tower looks like and therefore see why the remark is wrong  but apt .  nevertheless  the stories are meant to be humorous and all the rhetorical devices contribute to that .  the young person who misses some of the allusions nevertheless should get much of the humor and enjoy the story anyway .  in short  i maintain there is no hard and fast distinction between    adult    writing and    juvenile    writing .  a good book is a good book and can be enjoyed by both adults and youngsters .  if my books appeal to both  that is to my credit .   names  we received an interesting letter some time ago from greg cox of washington state .  it is short and i will take the liberty of quoting its one sentence in full     i enjoyed very much the good doctor   s story in the may issue     the evil drink does      but i have to ask  how did a young lady from such an allegedly puritanical background end up with the unlikely  if appealing  name of    ishtar mistik    .  .  .     it   s a good question  but it makes an assumption .  in the story  ishtar remarks     i was brought up in the strictest possible way .  it is impossible for me to behave in anything but the most correct manner .     from that you may suppose that ishtar   s family were rigidly doctrinaire presbyterians  or superlatively moral catholics  or tradition bound orthodox jews  but if you do  it   s an assumption .  i say nothing about ishtar   s religious background .  to be sure  ishtar is the babylonian goddess of love  the analog of the greek aphrodite  and it is therefore odd that such a name should be given a child by puritanical parents  if the puritanism is christian or jewish in origin .  but who says it is .  the family may be a group of puritanical druids  even druids may have strict moral codes  and probably do  who chose    ishtar    for its sound .  but let   s go into the matter of names more systematically .  every writer has to give his characters names .  there are occasional exceptions as when a writer may refer to a limited number of characters  in puckish fashion  as    the young man        the doctor        the skeptic     and so on .  p .  g .  wodehouse  for example  in his golf stories  refers to the narrator as    the oldest member    and never gives him a name .  he only need be referred to for a few paragraphs at the start  however  and then remains in the background as a disembodied voice .  in my own george and azazel stories  the first person character to whom george speaks in the introduction and whom he regularly insults  has no name .  he is merely    i .      of course  the perceptive reader may think  from the nature of george   s insults  that i   s name is isaac asimov  but again that is only an assumption .  allowing for such minor exceptions then  writers need names .  you might think that this is not something that bothers anyone but apparently it does .  i have received numerous letters  usually from young teenagers  who seem to be totally unimpressed by the ease with which i work up complex plots and ingenious gimmicks and socko endings but who say     how do you manage to decide what names to give your characters .     that is what puzzles them .  in my attempts to answer  i have had to think about the subject .  in popular fiction intended for wide consumption  especially among the young  names are frequently chosen for blandness .  you don   t want the kids to stumble over the pronunciation of strange names or to be distracted by them .  your characters  therefore  are named jack armstrong or pat reilly or sam jones .  such stories are filled with bills and franks and joes coupled with harpers and andersons and jacksons .  that is also part of the comforting assumption that all decent characters  heroes especially  are of northwest european extraction .  naturally  you may have comic characters or villains  and they can be drawn from among the    inferior    races  with names to suit .  the villainous mexican can be pablo  the comic black  rastus  the shrewd jew  abie  and so on .  aside from the wearisome sameness of such things  the world changed after the     s .  hitler gave racism a bad name  and all over the world  people who had till then been patronized as    natives    began asserting themselves .  it became necessary to choose names with a little more imagination and to avoid seeming to reserve heroism for your kind and villainy for the other kind .  on top of this science fiction writers had a special problem .  what names do you use for non human characters  robots  extraterrestrials  and so on .  there have been a variety of solutions to this problem .  for instance  you might deliberately give extraterrestrials unpronounceable names  thus indicating that they speak an utterly strange language designed for sound producing organs other than human vocal cords .  the name xlbnushk  for instance .  that  however  is not a solution that can long be sustained .  no reader is going to read a story in which he periodically encounters xlbnushk without eventually losing his temper .  after all  he has to look at the letter combination and he   s bound to try to pronounce it every time he sees it .  besides  in real life  a difficult name is automatically simplified .  in geology  there is something called    the mohorovicic discontinuity    named for its yugoslavian discoverer .  it is usually referred to by non yugoslavians as    the moho discontinuity .     in the same way  xlbnushk would probably become    nush .     another way out is to give non human characters   or even human characters living in a far future in which messy emotionalism has been eliminated  codes instead of names .  you can have a character called      mm        for instance .  that sort of thing certainly gives a story a science fictional ambience .  and it can work .  in neil jones    professor jameson stories of half a century ago  the characters were organic brains in metallic bodies  all of whom had letter number names .  eventually  one could tell them apart  and didn   t even notice the absence of ordinary names .  this system  however  will work only if it rarely occurs .  if all  or even most  stories numbered their characters  there would be rebellion in the ranks .  my own system  when dealing with the far future  or with extraterrestrials  is to use names  not codes  and easily pronounceable names  too  but names that don   t resemble any real ones  or any recognizable ethnic group .  for one thing that gives the impression of    alienism    without annoying the reader .  for another  it minimizes the chance of offending someone by using his or her name .  this is a real danger .  the most amusing example was one that was encountered by l .  sprague de camp when he wrote    the merman    back in      .  the hero was one vernon brock  not a common name  and he was an ichthyologist  not a common profession  .  after the story appeared in the december       astounding  a thunderstruck sprague heard from a real vernon brock who was really an ichthyologist .  fortunately  the real brock was merely amused and didn   t mind at all  but if he had been a nasty person  he might have sued .  sprague would certainly have won out  but he would have been stuck with legal fees  lost time  and much annoyance .  sometimes i get away with slight misspellings  baley instead of bailey  hari instead of harry  daneel instead of daniel .  at other times  i make the names considerably different  especially the first name  salvor hardin  gaal dornick  golan trevize  stor gendibal  janov pelorat .   i hope i   m getting them right  i   m not bothering to look them up .   my feminine characters also receive that treatment  though the names i choose tend to be faintly classical because i like the sound  callia  artemisia  noys  arcadia  gladia  and so on .  i must admit that when i started doing this  i expected to get irritated letters from readers  but  you know  i never got one .  it began in wholesale manner in      with the first foundation story and in the forty plus years since  not one such letter arrived .  well  damon knight once referred to noys in a review of the end of eternity as    the woman with the funny name     but that   s as close as it got .  which brings me to the george and azazel stories again .  there i use a different system .  the george and azazel stories are intended to be humorous .  in fact  they are farces  with no attempt at or pretense of realism .  the stories are outrageously overwritten on purpose .  my ordinary writing style is so  deliberately  plain that every once in a while  i enjoy showing that i can be florid and rococo if i choose .  well  then  in a rococo story  how on earth can i be expected to have characters with ordinary names  even though the stories are set in the present and  except for azazel  deal only with earth people  so that i can   t use nonexistent names .  instead i use real names  but choose very unusual and pretentious first names .  in my george and azazel stories  characters have been named mordecai sims  gottlieb jones  menander block  hannibal west  and so on .  by associating the outlandish first name with a sober last name  i heighten the oddness of the first .   on second thought  i should have made ishtar mistik  ishtar smith .   none of this is  of course  intended as a universal rule .  it   s just what i do .  if you want to write an sf story  by all means make up a system of your own .   origlnality  having published an editorial entitled    plagiarism    in the august       issue of the magazine  it occurs to me to look at the other side of the coin .  after all  if plagiarism is reprehensible  total originality is just about impossible .  the thing is that there exists an incredible number of books in which an enormous variety of ideas and an even more enormous variety of phrases and ways of putting things have been included .  anyone literate enough to write well has  as a matter of course  read a huge miscellany of printed material and  the human brain being what it is  a great deal of it remains in the memory at least unconsciously  and will be regurgitated onto the manuscript page at odd moments .  in       for instance  john livingston lowes  an english professor at harvard  published a six hundred page book entitled the road to xanadu  in which he traced nearly every phrase in    the rime of the ancient mariner    to various travel books that were available to the poet  samuel taylor coleridge .  i tried reading the book in my youth  but gave up .  it could only interest another coleridge scholar .  besides  i saw no point to it .  granted that the phrases already existed scattered through a dozen books  they existed for everybody .  it was only coleridge who thought of putting them together  with the necessary modifications  to form one of the great poems of the english language .  coleridge might not have been a hundred percent original but he was original enough to make the poem a work of genius .  you can   t overrate the skills involved in selection and arrangement .  it was this that was in my own mind  once  when i was busily working on a book of mine called words of science back in the days when i was actively teaching at boston university school of medicine .  the book consisted of     one page essays on various scientific terms  giving derivations  meanings and various historical points of interest .  for the purpose  i had an unabridged dictionary spread out on my desk  for i couldn   t very well make up the derivations  nor could i rely on my memory to present them to me in all correct detail .   my memory is good  but not that good .   a fellow faculty member happened by and looked over my shoulder .  he read what i was writing at the moment  stared at the unabridged and said     why  you   re just copying the dictionary .     i stopped dead  sighed  closed the dictionary  lifted it with an effort and handed it to my friend .     here     i said .     the dictionary is yours .  now go write the book .     he shrugged his shoulders and walked away without offering to take the dictionary .  he was bright enough to get the point .  there are times  though  when i wonder how well any story of mine would survive what one might call the    road to xanadu     test .   there   s no point in offending fellow writers by analyzing their originality  so i   ll just stick to my own stuff .   the most original story i ever wrote in my opinion was    nightfall     which appeared back in      .  i had not quite reached my twenty first birthday when i wrote it and i have always been inordinately proud of the plot .     it was a brand new plot     i said     and i killed it as i wrote it  for no one else would dare write a variation of it .     to be sure  it was john campbell who presented me with the emerson quote that began the story     if the stars would appear one night in a thousand years  how would men believe and adore  and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of god      and it was campbell who sent me home to write the reverse of emerson   s thesis .  allowing for that  the development and details of the story were mine  or were they .  in       i was preparing an anthology of my favorite stories of the     s  the years  that is  before john campbell   s editorship  so that i named the book before the golden age  and i included  of course  jack williamson   s    born of the sun     which had been published in      and had  at that time  fascinated my fourteen year old self .  i reread it  naturally  before including it and was horrified .  you see  it dealt in part with a cult whose members were furious at scientists for rationalizing the mystic tenets of the believers .  in an exciting scene  the cultists attacked the scientists    citadel at a very crucial moment and the scientists tried to hold them off long enough to get their task done .  i can   t deny having read that story .  after all  i still remembered it with pleasure forty years later .  yet only six and a half years after reading it  i wrote    nightfall    which dealt in part with a cult whose members were furious at scientists for rationalizing the mystic tenets of the believers .  in an exciting scene  the cultists attacked the scientists    citadel at a very crucial moment and the scientists tried to hold them off long enough to get their task done .  no  it wasn   t plagiarism .  for one thing i wrote it entirely differently .  however  the scene fit both stories and having been impressed by it in jack   s story  i drew from memory  and used it in my own story automatically  never for one moment considering that i wasn   t making it up out of nothing but had earlier read something very like that scene .  i suppose that any thoroughgoing scholar who was willing to spend several years at the task could trace almost every quirk in    nightfall    to one story or another that appeared in the science fiction magazines in the     s .   yes  i read them all .   naturally  he could do the same for any other story written by any other author .  here   s something even more curious .  in a note dated june           a reader sent me an enclosure  a photocopy of a short article from the october      issue of the magazine sky  now known as sky and telescope  i believe  .  the article is entitled    if the stars appeared only one night in a thousand years .     it begins with the emerson quotation and it is by m .  t .  brackbill .  the author describes what it might be like if the night on which the stars appear were coming .  there might be    prostellarists    who believe the stars are coming  and    antistellarists     who dismiss the whole thing as a fable .  and then the night comes and everyone stares entranced at the stars and finally watches them disappear with the dawn  sadly realizing that for a thousand years they will never be seen again .  it   s rather touching  and about the only thing brackbill misses  that i could see  was the certainty that on that particular night there was bound to be a heavy night long overcast in various parts of the world  so that millions of people would invariably be disappointed .  the person who sent me the photocopy accompanied it with this note     dear mr .  asimov  i happened to spot this article .  i wonder if it was an inspiration for one of the greatest short stories ever written .      just an    inspiration    .  if the article and    nightfall    were carefully studied and compared  how many events and phrases in the story might seem to have been inspired or hinted at in the article .  i haven   t the heart to do this myself and i hope no one else does .  unfortunately  neither the name nor address of the person who sent me the article was on the note  and the envelope the whole thing had come in had not been saved .   please  everyone  if you want an answer  put your name and return address on your letter and not just on the envelope .  i frequently discard envelopes without glancing at them except to make sure they are addressed to me .   in any case  i couldn   t answer him .  so i must use this editorial as the only way of reaching him .  the truth is that i never saw the article  never had a hint that it existed until the day i received the note and enclosure from my unknown correspondent .  it had not the slightest iota of direct influence on my story .  but john campbell presented me with the emerson quote and the request that i reverse it  only three years after the article had appeared .  had he seen it .  i wouldn   t be surprised if he had  and if  as soon as he had come across it or had had it drawn to his attention  copied down the quote and then waited for the first unwary science fiction writer to cross his threshold .   how thankful i am that it was i .    were he still alive  he would only be seventy five today  if he were   i would ask him about it .  i am quite sure  though  what his answer would be .  it would be     what difference does it make .     so there arises the question     if it is impossible to be completely original  how can you tell permissible influence from plagiarism .     well  it depends on the extent and detail of the borrowing .  based on that  it is possible to tell .  it may not always be provable in a court of law  but  believe me  it is possible to tell .   book reviews  i have never made any secret of the fact that i dislike the concept of reviews and the profession of reviewing .  it is a purely emotional reaction because  for reasons that are all too easy to work out  i strongly dislike having anyone criticize my stuff adversely .  i don   t think i   m alone in this .  from my close observation of writers  almost all my friends are writers  they fall into two groups     those who bleed copiously and visibly at any bad review  and    those who bleed copiously and secretly at any bad review .  i   m class one .  most of my friends aim at class two and don   t quite make it and aren   t quite aware that they don   t make it .  unfortunately  there   s no way in which one can get back at a reviewer .  i have sometimes had the urge to do some fancy horsewhipping in the form of a mordant letter designed to flay the reptilian hide off the sub moron involved  but  except in my very early days  i have always resisted .  this is not out of idealism but out of the bitter knowledge that the writer always loses in such a confrontation .  instead  then  i take to muttering derogatory comments about reviewing and reviewers in general .  but i   m in a bad spot here .  this magazine  which is the apple of my eye  not only has a regular book review column  but has other items  less regularly included  that review one or another of the facets of the science fiction field .  if i really despise reviewing so  why is it i allow reviewing in the magazine .  because i don   t really despise reviewing and reviewers .  that is an emotional reaction that i recognize as emotional  and therefore discount .  i am a rational man  i like to think  and in any disagreement between my emotions and my rationality  i should hope it is rationality that wins out every time .  now let   s get down to cases .  a publisher to whom i was beholden asked me to read a book by an important writer and to give them a quote that could be used on the cover .  i tried to beg off  but they insisted that i at least read it  and give it a chance .  so i did .  i tried to read it  and the gears locked tight long before i finished .  it seemed to me so unsuccessful a book that there was no way in which i could give it the quote that was wanted .  i felt awful  but i had to call the publisher and beg off .  now  then  assuming my judgment was correct  should that book be reviewed .  why say unkind things about it .  in the case of an ordinary bad book  one might wonder .  at the most  it might only be necessary to say     this is a bad book because      with a few unemotional sentences added .  you don   t crack a peanut with a sledgehammer .  an unsatisfactory book written by an important writer  however  requires a detailed review to explain why it seems to have gone wrong and where and how .  this is not so much to warn off readers  who will probably have bought the book in great numbers anyway by the time the review comes out .  it is because even a flawed book by a good writer can be an important educational experience .  its failure can be used as a way of sharpening the general taste for the literary good .  it will educate  properly reviewed  not only the reader  but the writer as well  the veteran as well as the neophyte .  and yet despite the value of such a review  i could not in a million years review the book myself .  there are emotional objections .  how can i say unkind things about someone else when i detest having someone say unkind things about me .  if i can   t take it  i have no right to dish it out .  then  too  how can i review a book by a friend  or  possibly  a rival  and be sure of being objective .  if that isn   t enough  there are technical objections .  even if everyone were to grant that i am a whizz at writing science fiction  that does not necessarily mean that i   m a whizz at understanding what makes science fiction good and bad .  even when i feel a story to be bad i don   t necessarily have the ability to point out just where and how and why the badness exists .  so we have baird searles reviewing books for us .  he has the talent for saying what needs to be said and i am grateful that he has .  now consider what a reviewer must do  if he is to be good at his job .      a reviewer must read the book carefully  every word of it  if possible  even if it seems to be very bad .  this is an extraordinarily difficult job .  it is the mark of an unsuccessful book if it is hard to read  if it is clumsy  wearying  uninteresting  dull  monotonous  insulting to the intelligence  predictable  repetitious  infelicitous  any or all of these things .  when you and i read a book of this sort  we stop reading .  a competent reviewer mustn   t .  he must stick to it to give the book an utterly fair shake .      a reviewer must read with attention  marking passages perhaps  taking notes perhaps  so that he won   t have to work from memory alone in writing his review  so that he won   t make factual errors or unreasonable criticisms .      a reviewer must read with detachment and not allow his judgment of the book to be twisted by his judgment of the writer .  he may know a writer to be an irritating boor and yet realize the writer   s book may be great .  he may know a writer to be a saint  and yet realize the writer   s book may be awful .  he must concentrate on the book and only on the book .      a reviewer must not only be a person of literary judgment  but he must have a wide knowledge of the field  so that he can exert his judgment of the book against the context of other books by the author  of books by other authors of similar experience or similar intent  and of the field in general .      a reviewer must be a competent writer himself  for the most literarily penetrating review ever written loses its point if it  itself  is so badly written that any reader grows bored  irritated  or confused .      finally  and this is the point where even the cleverest reviewer  perhaps especially the cleverest reviewer  can come a cropper  the review must not be a showcase for the reviewer himself .  the purpose of the review is not to demonstrate the superior erudition of the reviewer or to make it seem that the reviewer  if he but took the trouble  could write the book better than the author did .   why the devil doesn   t he do it  then .   nor must it seem to be a hatchet job in which the reviewer is carrying out some private vengeance .   this may not be so  you understand  but it mustn   t even seem to be so .    these are not easy conditions to meet  and the fact is that though there are many reviewers  there are not many good reviewers .  and why not .  probably all reviewers will gladly accept sturgeon   s law  that ninety percent of everything is crud  with respect to the books they review  and it holds just as solidly for the reviews they write .  and is there anything a good book reviewer must receive from the editor for all that is expected of him .  certainly .  in a word  independence .  when an editor hires a book reviewer  he doesn   t  or shouldn   t  buy a scribbler who has agreed to put the boss   s opinions into words .  no  it is the book reviewer and his opinions that have been hired .  the book reviews in this magazine do not necessarily express the opinions of george  shawna  or myself  although they might .  in fact  george  shawna  and myself do not necessarily agree among ourselves as to the worth of a particular piece of writing .  but it is the reviewer   s opinions you want  not ours  and it is his you will get .  he is the professional in this respect .  baird searles  in my opinion  is one of the good reviewers  and we are glad we have him  and we hope he stays with us a long time .  he does not ask us for our views before he writes his column and if  inconceivably  he asked us  we wouldn   t tell him .  and it   s because reviewers can be like baird searles that we have a review column .   what writers go through  every once in a while i get a letter that strikes a chord .  jeanne s .  king of marietta  georgia  suggested that i write an editorial on what writers go through .  her tender heart bled for writers and i think she has a point .  first  let me make it clear what i mean by    writers .     i don   t want to confine the word only to those who are successful  who have published bestselling books  or who crank out reams of published material every year  if not every day   or who make a lavish living out of their pens  typewriters  or word processors  or who have gained fame and adulation .  i also mean those writers who just sell an occasional item  who make only a bit of pin money to eke out incomes earned mainly in other fashions  whose names are not household words  and who are not recognized in the street .  in fact  let me go farther and say i even mean those writers who never sell anything  who are writers only in the sense that they work doggedly at it  sending out story after story  and living in a hope that is not yet fulfilled .  we can   t dismiss this last classification as    failures    and not    real    writers .  for one thing  they are not necessarily failures forever .  almost every writer  before he becomes a success  even a runaway supernova success  goes through an apprentice period when he   s a    failure .     secondly  even if a writer is destined always to be a failure  and even if he is never going to sell  he remains a human being for whom all the difficulties and frustration of a writer   s life exist and  in fact  exist without the palliation of even an occasional and minor triumph .  if we go to the other extreme and consider the writer whose every product is an apparently sure sale  we find that the difficulties and frustrations have not disappeared .  for one thing  no number of triumphs  no amount of approval  seem to have any carrying power at the crucial moment .  when even the most successful writer sits down before a blank piece of paper  he is bound to feel that he is starting from scratch and  indeed  that the damoclean sword of rejection hangs over him .   by the way  when i say    he    and    him     i mean to add    she    and    her    every time .   if i may use myself as an example  i always wince a little when anyone  however sincerely and honestly  assumes that i am never rejected .  i admit that i am rarely rejected  but between    rarely    and    never    is a vast gulf .  even though i no longer work on spec and write only when a particular item is requested  i still run the risk .  the year doesn   t pass without at least one failure .  it was only a couple of months ago that esquire ordered a specific article from me .  i duly delivered it  and they  just as duly  handed it back .  that is the possibility all of us live with .  we sit there alone  pounding out the words  with our heart pounding in time .  each sentence brings with it a sickening sensation of not being right .  each page keeps us wondering if we are moving in the wrong direction .  even if  for some reason  we feel we are getting it right and that the whole thing is singing with operatic clarity  we are going to come back to it the next day and reread it and hear only a duck   s quacking .  it   s torture for everyone of us .  then comes the matter of rewriting and polishing  of removing obvious flaws  at least  they seem obvious  but are they really .   and replacing them with improvements  or are we just making things worse .   .  there   s simply no way of telling if the story is being made better or is just being pushed deeper into the muck until the time finally comes when we either tear it up as hopeless  or risk the humiliation of rejection by sending it off to an editor .  once the story is sent off  no amount of steeling one   s self  no amount of telling one   s self over and over that it is sure to be rejected  can prevent one from harboring that one wan little spark of hope .  maybe  maybe the period of waiting is refined torture in itself .  is the editor simply not getting round to it  or has he read it and is he suspended in uncertainty .  is he going to read it again and maybe decide to use it  or has it been lost  or has it been tossed aside to be mailed back at some convenient time and been forgotten .  how long do you wait before you write a query letter .  and if you do write a letter  is it subservient enough .  sycophantic enough .  groveling enough .  after all  you don   t want to offend him .  he might be just on the point of accepting  and if an offensive letter from you comes along  he may snarl and rip your manuscript in two  sending you the halves .  and when the day comes that the manila envelope appears in the mail  all your mumbling to yourself that it is sure to come will not avail you .  the sun will go into eclipse .  it   s been over forty years since i   ve gone through all this in its full hellishness  but i remember it with undiminished clarity .  and then even if you make a sale  you have to withstand the editor   s suggestions which  at the very least  mean you have to turn back to the manuscript  work again  add or change or subtract material  and perhaps produce a finished product that will be so much worse than what had gone before that you lose the sale you thought you had made .  at the worst  the changes requested are so misbegotten from your standpoint that they ruin the whole story in your eyes  and yet you may be in a position where you dare not refuse  so that you must maim your brainchild rather than see it die .   or ought you to take back the story haughtily and try another editor .  and will the first editor then blacklist you .   even after the item is sold and paid for and published  the triumph is rarely unalloyed .  the number of miseries that might still take place are countless .  a book can be produced in a slipshod manner or it can have a repulsive book jacket  or include blurbs that give away the plot or clearly indicate that the blurb writer didn   t follow the plot .  a book can be nonpromoted  treated with indifference by the publisher and therefore found in no bookstores  and sell no more than a few hundred copies .  even if it begins to sell well  that can be aborted when it is reviewed unsympathetically or even viciously by someone with no particular talent or qualifications in criticism .  if you sell a story to a magazine you may feel it is incompetently illustrated  or dislike the blurb  or worry about misprints .  you are even liable to face the unsympathetic comments of individual readers who will wax merry  sardonic  or contemptuous at your expense  and what are their qualifications for doing so .  you will bleed as a result .  i never met a writer who didn   t bleed at the slightest unfavorable comment  and no number of favorable or even ecstatic remarks will serve as a styptic pencil .  in fact  even total success has its discomforts and inconveniences .  there are  for instance  people who send you books to autograph and return  but don   t bother sending postage or return envelopes  reducing you to impounding their books or  if you can   t bring yourself to do that  getting envelopes  making the package  expending stamps  and possibly even going to the post office .  people who send you manuscripts to read and criticize  nothing much  just a page by page analysis  and if you think it   s all right  would you get it published with a generous advance  please .  thank you .   .  people who dash off two dozen questions  starting with a simple one like  what in your opinion is the function of science fiction and in what ways does it contribute to the welfare of the world  illustrating your thesis with citations from the classic works of various authors .   please use additional pages  if necessary .   people who send you a form letter  with your name filled in  misspelled   asking for an autographed photograph  and with no envelope or postage supplied .  teachers who flog a class of thirty into each sending you a letter telling you how they liked a story of yours  and sending you a sweet letter of her own asking you to send a nice answer to each one of the little dears .  and so on well  then  why write .  a seventeenth century german chemist  johann joachim becher  once wrote     the chemists are a strange class of mortals  impelled by an almost insane impulse to seek their pleasure among smoke and vapor  soot and flame  poi sins and poverty  yet among all these evils i seem to live so sweetly  that may i die if i would change places with the persian king .     well  what goes for chemistry  goes for writing .  i know all the miseries  but somewhere among them is happiness .  i can   t easily explain where it is or what it consists of  but it is there .  i know the happiness and i experience it  and i will not stop writing while i live  and may i die if i would change places with the president of the united states .   revisions  when it comes to writing  i am a    primitive .     i had had no instruction when i began to write  or even by the time i had begun to publish .  i took no courses .  i read no books on the subject .  this was not bravado on my part  or any sense of arrogance .  i just didn   t know that there were courses or books on the subject .  in all innocence  i just thought you sat down and wrote .  naturally  i have picked up a great deal about writing in the days since i began  but in certain important respects  my early habits imprinted me and i find i can   t change .  some of these imprinted habits are trivial .  for instance  i cannot leave a decent margin .  editors have tried begging and they have tried ordering  and my only response is a firm    never .      when i was a kid  you see  getting typewriting paper was a hard thing to do for it required m o n e y  of which i had none .  therefore what i had  i saved  single spaced  both sides  and typing to the very edge of the page  all four edges .  well  i learned that one could not submit a manuscript unless it was double spaced on one side of the page only  and i was forced  unwillingly  to adopt that wasteful procedure .  i also learned about margins and established them  but not wide enough .  nor could i ever make them wide enough .  my sense of economy had gone as far as it would go and it would go no farther .  more important was the fact that i had never learned about revisions .  my routine was  and still is  to write a story in first draft as fast as i can .  then i go over it  and correct errors in spelling  grammar  and word order .  then i prepare my second draft  making minor changes as i go and as they occur to me .  my second draft is my final draft .  no more changes except under direct editorial order and then with rebellion in my heart .  i didn   t know there was anything wrong with this .  i thought it was the way you were supposed to write .  in fact when bob heinlein and i were working together at the navy yard in philadelphia during world war ii  bob asked me how i went about writing a story and i told him .  he said     you type it twice .  why don   t you type it correctly the first time .     i felt bitterly ashamed  and the very next story i wrote  i tried my level best to get it right the first time .  i failed .  no matter how carefully i wrote  there were always things that had to be changed .  i decided i just wasn   t as good as heinlein .  but then  in       i attended the breadloaf writers    conference at the invitation of fletcher pratt .  there i listened in astonishment to some of the things said by the lecturers .     the secret of writing     said one of them     is rewriting .     fletcher pratt himself said     if you ever write a paragraph that seems to you to sing  to be the best thing you   ve ever written  to be full of wonder and poetry and greatness  cross it out  it stinks .      over and over again  we were told about the importance of polishing  of revising  of tearing up and rewriting .  i got the bewildered notion that  far from being expected to type it right the first time  as heinlein had advised me  i was expected to type it all wrong  and get it right only by the thirty second time  if at all .  i went home immersed in gloom  and the very next time i wrote a story  i tried to tear it up .  i couldn   t make myself do it .  so i went over it to see all the terrible things i had done  in order to revise them .  to my chagrin  everything sounded great to me .   my own writing always sounds great to me .   eventually  after wasting hours and hours  to say nothing of spiritual agony  i gave it up .  my stories would have to be written the way they always were  and still are .  what is it i am saying  then .  that it is wrong to revise .  no  of course not  any more than it is wrong not to revise .  you don   t do anything automatically  simply because some    authority     including me  says you should .  each writer is an individual  with his or her own way of thinking  and doing  and writing .  some writers are not happy unless they polish and polish  unless they try a paragraph this way and that way and the other way .  once oscar wilde  coming down to lunch  was asked how he had spent his morning .     i was hard at work     he said .     oh .     he was asked .     did you accomplish much .        yes  indeed     said wilde .     i inserted a comma .     at dinner  he was asked how he had spent the afternoon .      more work      he said .     inserted another comma .     was the rather sardonic question .     no     said wilde  unperturbed .     i removed the one i had inserted in the morning .     well  if you   re oscar wilde  or some other great stylist  polishing may succeed in imparting an ever higher gloss to your writing and you should revise and revise .  if  on the other hand  you   re not much of a stylist  like me  for instance  and are only interested in straightforward storytelling and clarity  then a small amount of revision is probably all you need .  beyond that small amount you may merely be shaking up the rubble .  i was told last night  for instance  that daniel keyes  author of the classic    flowers for algernon     is supposed to have said     the author   s best friend is the person who shoots him just before he makes one change too many .     let   s try the other extreme .  william shakespeare is reported by ben jonson to have boasted that he    never blotted a word .     the bard of avon  in other words  would have us believe that  like heinlein  he got it right the first time  and that what he handed in to the producers at the globe theatre was first draft .   he may have been twisting the truth a bit .  prolific writers tend to exaggerate the amount of nonrevision they do .   well  if you happen to be another will shakespeare  or another bob heinlein  mr .  heinlein now admits to two or three drafts on his longer works .   ed   maybe you can get away without revising at all .  but if you   re just an ordinary writer  like me  maybe you   d better do some .   as a matter of fact  ben jonson commented that he wished will had    blotted out a thousand     and there are indeed places where will might have been  ssh .   improved on .    let   s pass on to a slightly different topic .  i am sometimes asked if i prepare an outline first before writing a story or a book .  the answer is  no  i don   t .  to begin with  this was another one of those cases of initial ignorance .  i didn   t know at the start of my career that such things as outlines existed .  i just wrote a story and stopped when i finished  and if it happened to be one length it was a short  and if it happened to be another it was a novelette .  when i wrote my first novel  doubleday told me to make it        words long .  so i wrote until i had        words and then stopped  and by the greatest good luck  it turned out to be the end of the novel .  when i began my second novel  i realized that such an amazing coincidence was not likely to happen twice in a row  so i prepared an outline .  i quickly discovered two things .  one  an outline constricted me so that i could not breathe .  two  there was no way i could force my characters to adhere to the outline  even if i wanted to do so  they refused .  i never tried an outline again .  in even my most complicated novels  i merely fix the ending firmly in my mind  decide on a beginning  and then  from that beginning  charge toward the ending  making up the details as i go along .  on the other hand  p .  g .  wodehouse  for whose writings i have an idolatrous admiration  always prepared outlines  spending more time on them than on the book and getting every event  however small  firmly in place before beginning .  there   s something to be said on both sides of course .  if you are a structured and rigid person who likes everything under control  you will be uneasy without an outline .  on the other hand  if you are an undisciplined person with a tendency to wander allover the landscape  you will be better off with an outline even if you feel you wouldn   t like one .  on the third hand  if you are quick thinking and ingenious  but with a strong sense of the whole  you will be better off without an outline .  how do you decide which you are .  well  try an outline  or try writing without one  and find out for yourself .  the thing is  don   t feel that any rule of writing must be hard and fast  and handed down from sinai .  try them all out by all means  but in the last analysis  stick to that which makes you comfortable .  you are  after all  an individual .   irony  it is well known that i know nothing about the craft of writing in any formal way .  i say so myself  constantly .  being an editorial director  however  has its demands and duties .  i must answer letters from readers  for instance  and take into account any unhappiness they may have with stories and editorial policy .  and that means i am sometimes forced to think about writing techniques .  that brings me to the subject at hand  the matter of the use of irony by writers .  in the march      issue  i discussed satire .  the two are often lumped together  and  in fact  sometimes confused and treated as though they were synonymous .  they are not .  satire  as i explained  achieves its purpose of castigating the evils of humanity and society by exaggeration .  it puts those evils under a magnifying glass with the intention of making them clearly visible .  irony does it differently .  you can get a hint from the fact that    irony    is from a greek word meaning    dissimulation .     an ironist must pretend  and the classic ironist was socrates  who in his discussions with others would relentlessly pretend ignorance and ask all kinds of naive questions designed to trap an overconfident adversary into rashly taking positions that then proved to be indefensible under further naive questioning by socrates .  naturally  socrates was not ignorant and the questions were not naive  and his method of procedure is known as    socratic irony .     you may well believe that those who suffered under his bland lash did not grow to love him  and i suspect he fully earned his final draught of hemlock .  socrates set the fashion for irony for all time .  he pretended to be ignorant when he was actually piercingly intelligent  and ever since then  ironists have pretended to believe and say the opposite of what they wanted the reader to understand .  instead of exaggerating the evils they are denouncing  they reverse them and call them good .  the satirist induces laughter by his exaggeration  the ironist induces indignation by his reversal .  the satirist is often good natured  the ironist tends to be savage and bitter .  satire is a comparatively mild technique whose purpose is easily grasped .  irony is a difficult technique whose point is frequently missed  and the ironist may find he is holding a two edged sword and is himself badly gashed .  most satirists find themselves indulging in irony sometimes  and i know exactly where i first encountered irony .  i was reading charles dickens   s pickwick papers for the first time  as a pre teener  and in chapter two  i encountered dickens   s description of tracy tupman   s zeal at    general benevolence .     said dickens     the number of instances .  .  . in which that excellent man referred objects of charity to the houses of other members for left off garments or pecuniary relief is almost incredible .     i was astonished .  i thought to myself that it wasn   t very kind of mr .  tupman to send poor people to other members instead of giving them something himself  so how could he be benevolent .  and after a while  the light dawned .  he wasn   t benevolent .  in fact  i decided indignantly  he was a stingy bum  and my liking for him was strictly limited for the rest of the book and ever since .  i did not know that what i had just read was irony  but i understood the concept from that time on  and i eventually learned the word .  if you want a savage and prolonged bit of writing with a great deal of irony in it  i refer you to mark twain   s the mysterious stranger  which was not published till after he was safely dead .  i warn you  though  it   s not pleasant reading .  it certainly makes plain  however  twain   s bitter feelings about humanity and the assorted evils that seemed  to twain  at any rate  to be inextricably bound up with it .  and it may  for a time at least  embitter you with humanity  too .  even that  however  must take second place to the all time high in caustic irony  a pamphlet by jonathan swift  published about       entitled     a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people in ireland from being a burden to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the public .      swift served in ireland and could see first hand  and with enormous indignation  the manner in which the english brutally and callously ground the irish into helpless and hopeless poverty .  he therefore pointed out that since the only thing the irish were allowed to produce and keep for their own use were their children  it would supply them with needed money  and others with needed food  if those irish children were sold in order to be fattened and slaughtered for sale at the butcher   s .  with an absolutely straight face  and with incredible ingenuity  he pointed out all the advantages that would accrue from such cannibalism .  if anything could possibly have evoked shame and even reform from those responsible for the irish plight  that pamphlet would have done it .  undoubtedly  many of those who read the pamphlet were shamed  some may even have altered their attitudes and behavior .  by and large  however  the exploitation of the irish continued unchanged for nearly two more centuries and the light that casts on humanity is not a good one .  and yet  you know  not everyone has a    sense of irony     which is by no means the same as a    sense of humor .     i firmly believe that one can have one and not the other .  it is possible to be confused by a pretense to believe the opposite of what you believe  as i was for a few minutes by dickens   s description of tupman as benevolent .  of course  i caught on  but if i had lacked a sense of irony  i suppose i wouldn   t have .  there were  actually  good and kindly people who read swift   s pamphlet with indignation  not at the mistreatment of the irish  but at swift   s apparently callous and immoral advocacy of cannibalism .  they thought he meant it  and denounced him with immeasurable vehemence .  and that finally brings me to asimov   s for sometimes what we publish contains irony  and if irony is hard to handle even for the absolute master of the art  good old swift  you can understand that it is a slippery tool for lesser mortals .  in the february      issue  tom rainbow wrote a    viewpoint    article entitled     sentience and the single extraterrestrial     that dealt with the requirements for such things as intelligence  sentience  and self awareness .  he described the kind of extraterrestrials that might  or might not  possess such things .  from the title alone  you can tell that he is writing in the humorous mode  and indeed  when you read his essay  you will find that he is saying perfectly serious things in a deliberately funny way .  in one place  he uses irony .  having talked of the requirements of self awareness in terms of brain body ratios  he points out that women   s brains are smaller than men   s but so are their bodies  leaving the brain body ratio nearly the same in both sexes .   actually  if there   s an advantage it   s on the side of women .   with heavy irony  he says     this reasoning leads to the somewhat startling conclusion that women must be self aware .     how can one believe that rainbow really thinks the conclusion is    startling     .  he   s using ironic dissimulation .  he   s pretending to think it   s startling  and italicizing    self aware    as a typographical indication of astonishment  in order for you to understand thoroughly that this is not startling and that people who consider women inferior beings are ignorant  and even stupid .  and to make it even plainer  he puts himself in the ironic position of these ignoramuses and says in the next sentence     heck  guys  if even girls can be self aware  then there   s hope for giant dill pickles .     the use of the adolescent term    heck     and the equally adolescent    guys     and the shift from    women    to italicized    girls    all show that he is not speaking in his own persona and that he has nothing but contempt for the attitude .  he is relying  poor fellow  on his readers having a sense of irony .  well  they do  by and large .  but there are always exceptions  and a few women have written indignant letters to point out that this was insulting .  one said that it wasn   t funny or cute .  no  indeed  swift   s advocacy of cannibalism wasn   t funny or cute  either  but he was trying for something else .  to be sure  swift   s entire pamphlet was aimed at his target and rainbow was merely bringing in the matter of women   s brains as a side issue  and perhaps if he were doing it again  he might decide it would be more judicious not to indulge .  but please  women  the man is on your side and tried to show it by the use of that two edged sword  irony .  you may think the irony didn   t work  but that doesn   t make rainbow any enemy of womankind .   plagiarism  to the ancient romans  a    plagiarius    was what we call a kidnapper  and to steal children is certainly a heinous crime .  it appears to those who work with their minds and imagination  however  that to steal one   s brainchildren is almost as heinous a crime  and so    plagiarism      in english  has come to mean the stealing of the ideas  forms  or words by someone who then puts them forth as his or her own .  a scientist   s formulas  an artist   s paintings  an inventor   s models  a philosopher   s thoughts  might all be the subject of plagiarism  but common usage has come to apply the term  specifically  to the theft of a writer   s production .  plagiarism is a horrid nightmare to writers in several different ways  and it is much more serious than nonwriters may realize .  if a writer  for any reason  commits plagiarism  copying some already published material  and if he gets away with it to the extent of getting the plagiarized material republished  he is bound to be caught sooner or later .  some reader  somewhere  will notice the theft .  in that case  even if the plagiarist isn   t sued or punished in any way  you can be sure that no editor who knows of the plagiarism will buy anything from that writer again .  if the plagiarist has a career  it is permanently ruined .  you may think that such a literary thief deserves a ruined career  and certainly i think so  but copying an already published item word for word is such a surefire failure that only an idiot or a complete novice would do it .  what about the case where someone simply makes use of the central idea of the story  the series of events it contains  the climax  the emotional milieu  and so on  but does not repeat it word for word .  what if he uses his  or her  own words entirely  changes the incidents in nonessential details  puts it in a different setting and so on .  in that case  it becomes more difficult to decide whether plagiarism has taken place .  after all  it is possible to have the same ideas someone else has had .  thus  ted sturgeon once wrote a story which he sent to horace gold of galaxy and which was accepted .  i wrote a story which i sent to horace gold while ted   s story was still unpublished .  there was no communication between us  we lived in different cities and had not exchanged phone calls or letters in months  nor had either of us discussed our stories with anyone .  nevertheless  not only did we both center our stories about a double meaning in the word    hostess     but two of my characters were drake and vera  and two of his were derek and verna .  it was the purest of coincidences  for except for the double meaning and the character names that we shared  the stories were miles apart .  nevertheless  even the appearance of plagiarism must be avoided .  i had to make enough changes in my story  because it was the later one received  to destroy the appearance .  to do so spoiled the story in my opinion  but it had to be done anyway .  in the same way  when i am writing a story  i must be conscious that there have been other stories dealing with similar ideas or similar characters or similar events  and i must make every effort to dilute that similarity .  when i wrote a story once called    each an explorer     i never for a moment forgot john campbell   s    who goes there .     and spent more time trying to avoid his story than trying to write my own .  in the same way  when i wrote    lest we remember     published in this magazine   i had to steer a mile wide of keyes   s    flowers for algernon .     it   s part of the game .  but i haven   t read every story ever written and many that i have read  i have completely forgotten  at least consciously .  what if i duplicate important elements of stories i have never read  or have forgotten .  it   s possible .  i once wrote a short short that ended with a certain dramatic climax in the last sentence .  eventually  i received a letter from another writer whose story had been published before i wrote my story and who had made use of the same dramatic climax in his last sentence .  what   s more  i had his story in an anthology in my library .  i did not remember reading it  but i had had the opportunity to do so .  the two stories  except for the climaxes  were completely different  but i promptly wrote the other author and told him that although he had my word that there was no conscious imitation  i would withdraw the story from circulation and it would never again appear in any anthology  any collection  any form whatever  and it never has .  fortunately  the other writer accepted this  but what protection do i  or any other writer  have against the accusation of plagiarism over what is a bit of unconscious recall  or  for that matter  an outright coincidence .  actually  very little .  i rely  to a large extent  on my prolificity and my unblemished record .  no one as prolific as i would seem to have to depend on someone else   s ideas  and my own mental fertility is obvious to all .  secondly  i am cautious enough never to discuss my stories before they are published  nor will i listen to others who might want to discuss their stories .  in fact  i won   t even read unsolicited manuscripts sent me by strangers .  they go back at once  unread .  even so  every established writer lives under an eternal damocles   s sword of possible accusation of plagiarism .  a casual reference  a small similarity  a nonessential duplication may be enough to produce such a suit .  such a suit  however unjustified  however certain of being thrown out of court  can be hurtful to an innocent writer .  it is  after all  an expense .  lawyers must be paid  time must be lost and  invariably  one is urged to    payoff the kook .     but what if you  the established writer  have been plagiarized .  that has never happened to me to the extent of publication  that i know of .  to be sure  there have been pastiches of me  deliberate imitations of my robot stories  or my black widowers mystery stories  and so on .  these come under the heading of fun .  the writer who turns them out makes no secret of it  and the editor knows that it   s a pastiche .  sometimes  they send the manuscript to me to ask if i have any objection .  i have always given permission .  then  too  there are stories that are bound to be similar to mine in some benign way .  the star wars movies have some distant similarities to my foundation stories  but  what the heck  you can   t make a fuss about such things .  unpublished plagiarism is more common .  an english professor once sent me a story written by a student in first year english .  it didn   t seem to her likely that the kid could have written that good a story and there were things in it that seemed reminiscent of me  like the three laws of robotics .  i went over the story and it was my    galley slave    word for word .  i returned it to the professor and told her to  a  punish the student appropriately  and  b  not let me know anything about it .   i   m soft hearted .   and what if you   re an editor and get stuck with some material that might conceivably be plagiarized .  in the first place  is it .  a completely original  nonreminiscent story is possible  but very rarely met up with .  similarities with some particular published story are almost unavoidable .  however  the more similarities there are  with the same previously published story  the greater the possibility of plagiarism .  nevertheless  it is difficult to establish certainty if the copying isn   t word for word .  should an editor refuse a story  however good  if there are too many similarities .  of course .  remember that i said even the appearance of plagiarism must be strictly avoided .  there is  however  a catch .  an editor has not read every story that has been published .  sometimes an editor  being human  has not even read every famous story ever published .  or an editor has read many stories but some of them have completely gone from her mind .  such an editor may  in all innocence  therefore publish a doubtful story .  he  or she  is then a victim and not an accomplice .  just as honest  established writers must live  constantly  with the fear of being accused of plagiarism  or of themselves being plagiarized  so must honest  established editors live  constantly  with the fear of being victimized into publishing a doubtful story .  what does one do in such a case .  one can   t entirely ignore the matter .  for one thing  the similarity between the new story and an older story is sure to be seen by some readers .  even if the older story is very obscure  someone will have read it and remembered it .  if it is a well known story  letters will come in heaps .  one can ask the writer of the doubtful story for an explanation .  if the explanation seems unconvincing  one can avoid buying stories from the writer again .  one might warn other editors in the field to be careful .  and one can try hard not to let it happen again  knowing full well that there is no way of stopping every piece of literary prestidigitation .  it is comforting to know  however  that if an editor lets something suspicious get into print  the fact will not remain unreported for long .  we can be sure  then  that if no indignant reader has written within two weeks of the appearance of an issue  we have probably committed no ghastly mistakes of this nature in that issue .   symbolism  to a child  a story is a story  and to many of us  as we grow older  a story remains a story .  the good guy wins  the bad guy loses .  boy meets girl  boy loses girl  boy gets girl .  we don   t want anything beyond that  at least to begin with .  the trouble is that if that   s all there is  one is likely to grow weary eventually .  children love to play tick tack toe  for instance  but it   s such a limited game that  after a while  most children don   t want to play it any more .  in the same way  children  as they grow older  may stop wanting to read stories that are only stories .  since writers get as tired writing stories that are only stories  as readers get tired reading them  it is only natural that writers begin to search for new and different ways to tell a story  for their own mental health  if nothing else .  a writer can try to find a new kind of plot  or he can indulge in stylistic experimentation  or he can strive for events that are ambiguous and conclusions that are inconclusive  or he can blur the distinction between good and evil  or between dream and reality .  there are many  many things he can do and the one thing all these attempts have in common is that they annoy those readers who still are in the stage of wanting stories that are only stories .  mind you  i don   t sneer at such readers .  for one thing  i myself still write stories that are primarily stories  because that   s what i like .  in my stories  there is a clear beginning  a clear middle  and a clear end  the good guy usually wins  and so on .  nevertheless  you can   t blame writers and readers for wanting something more than that  and those of us    include myself  please note  who are suspicious of experimentation and fancy tricks ought to make some effort to understand what   s going on .  we may fail to grasp it entirely  but we may at least see just enough to avoid an explosion of unreasonable anger .  one game that writers very commonly play is the one called    symbolism .     a story can be written on two levels .  on the surface  it is simply a story  and anyone can read it as such and be satisfied .  even children can read it .  but the simple characters and events of the surface may stand for  or symbolize  other subtler things .  below the surface  therefore  there may be hidden and deeper meanings that children and unsophisticated adults don   t see .  those who can see the inner structure  however  can get a double pleasure out of it .  first  since the inner structure is usually cleverer and more convoluted than the surface  it exercises the mind more pleasantly .  second  since it is not easy to detect  the reader has the excitement of discovery and the pleasure of admiring his own cleverness .   you can easily imagine what fun the writer has constructing such symbolic significance .    i suppose the best example of something written on two levels is the pair of books popularly known as alice in wonderland .  on the surface  it   s a simply written fantasy  and children love it .  some adults reading it  however  find themselves in an intricate maze of puns  paradoxes  and inside jokes .   read martin gardner   s the annotated alice  if you want to increase your pleasure in the book .   or take j .  r .  r .  tolkien   s the lord of the rings .  on the surface  it is a simple tale of a dangerous quest .  the small hobbit  frodo  must take a dangerous ring into the very teeth of an all powerful enemy and destroy it  and  of course  he succeeds .  on a second  deeper level  it is an allegory of good and evil  leading us to accept the possibility that the small and weak can triumph where the  equally good  large and powerful might not  that even evil has its uses that contribute to the victory of the good  and so on .  but there is a third level  too .  what is the ring that is so powerful and yet so evil .  why is it that those who possess it are corrupted by it and cannot give it up .  is such a thing pure fantasy or does it have an analogue in reality .  my own feeling is that the ring represents modern technology .  this corrupts and destroys society  in tolkien   s view  and  yet  those societies who gain it and who are aware of its evils simply cannot give it up .  i have read the lord of the rings five times  so far  and i have not yet exhausted my own symbolic reading of it .  i do not agree with  and i resent  tolkien   s attitude and yet i get pleasure out of the intricacy and skill of the structure .  there is another important point to be made concerning symbolism .  a writer may insert it  without knowing he has done so  or else  a clever interpreter can find significance in various parts of a story that a writer will swear he had no intention of inserting .  this has happened to me  for instance .  the middle portion of my novel the gods themselves  with its intricate picture of a trisexual society  has been interpreted psychiatrically and philosophically in ways that i know i didn   t intend  and in terms that i literally don   t understand .  my foundation series has been shown  by apparently careful analysis  to be thoroughly marxist in inspiration  except that i had never read one word by marx  or about marx either  at the time the stories were written  or since .  when i complained once to someone who worked up a symbolic meaning of my story    nightfall    that made no sense to me at all  he said to me  haughtily     what makes you think you understand the story just because you   ve written it .     and when i published an essay in which i maintained that tolkien   s ring symbolized modern technology  and a reader wrote to tell me that tolkien himself had denied it  i responded with     that doesn   t matter .  the ring nevertheless symbolizes modern technology .     sometimes it is quite demonstrable that an author inserts a deeper symbolism than he knows   or even understands .  i have almost never read a layman   s explanation of relativity that didn   t succumb to the temptation of quoting alice because lewis carroll included paradoxes that are unmistakably relativistic in nature .  he did not know that  of course  he just happened to be a genius at paradox .  well  sometimes this magazine publishes stories that must not be read only on the surface  and  as is almost inevitable  this riles a number of readers .  i am thinking  for instance  of the novella    statues    by jim aikin  which appeared in our november      issue  and which some readers objected to strenuously .  there were statements to the effect that it wasn   t science fiction or even fantasy  that it had no point  that it was anti christian  and so on .  to begin with  the story  taken simply as a story  is undoubtedly unpleasant in spots .  i winced several times when i read it  and i tell you  right now  that i wouldn   t  and couldn   t  write such a story .  but i   m not the be all and the end all .  the story  however difficult to stomach some of its passages may be  was skillfully and powerfully written .  even some of those who objected had to admit that .  and it was indeed a fantasy .  aikin made it clear toward the end that the statues were not pushed about  and that their apparent movement was not a delusion .  they were on the side of the heroine and were cooperating with her  trying to rescue her from her unhappy life .  but that is only the surface .  a little deeper and we see that it is a case of the old gods trying to save the young woman from the new .  it is a rebellion against the rigid pharisaic morality of some aspects of the judeo christian tradition and a harking back to the greater freedom of some aspects of paganism .  the story is in the spirit of that powerful line of a .  c .  swinburne in his    hymn to proserpine        thou has conquered  o pale galilean  the world has grown gray from thy breath .     looked at this way  the story is not anti christian  surely the    christian    characters in the story are not all there is to christianity   but is against hypocrisy in the name of religion  which i imagine no one favors  least of all christians .  the great french dramatist moliere took up his cudgels against that same foe in his masterpiece tartuffe and you can   t imagine the trouble he got into as a result .  but if you go deeper still  you will find the story is one more expression of the longing for the old .  in this story it is expressed by contrasting the frowning new god with the kindly old ones .  in the lord of the rings it is expressed by contrasting the evil technology of the dark lord  sauron  with the pastoral life of the simple hobbits .   of course  it is much safer to make of the enemy a devil figure than a god figure  so tolkien got into no trouble at all .   you can see the value of symbolism when you compare either of these with jack finney   s famous    the third level     where he demonstrates his longing for the old by a straightforward contrast between      and      .  it leaves nothing to discover and  in my opinion  therefore  is a weak story .  but    statues     like it or not  is a strong story that makes an important point with great skill .   prediction  there is a general myth among laymen that  somehow  the chief function of a science fiction writer is to make predictions that eventually come true .  thus  i am frequently asked     how does it feel to see all the predictions you have made coming true .     to which i can only reply     it feels great  in those very few cases in which something i have said actually came to pass .     at other times  i am asked with utter confidence     can you give us a few of your predictions that have come true .     i would love to be able to say     well  to name just a few  airplanes  radios  television  skyscrapers  and  in my early days  the wheel and fire .     but i can   t bring myself to do that .  the interviewers might actually print it  and they might try to give me a medal for predicting fire .  however  i came across a prediction i made once that i didn   t know i had made  that actually i didn   t know was a prediction .  nor did i discover it myself .  someone pointed it out to me .  in order to explain this  i   ll have to take the long way round .  please bear with me .  back in       i began to write a novel called the caves of steel .  it was finished in       was published in the october  november  and december       issues of galaxy as a three part serial  and was published in book form by doubleday in      .  it was a science fiction murder mystery that introduced my characters elijah baley and r .  daneel olivaw  whom some of you may have come across in your reading .  toward the end of the caves of steel  i needed a second murder for the sake of the plot  and that bothered me  for i don   t like murders and i rarely have them in my mysteries .  when i do  there is only one and it is committed offstage  usually before the story begins .   i   m funny that way .   the first murder in the caves of steel had been offstage before the story began  and the second murder would be offstage  also  but i didn   t want to kill a human being  so  instead  i killed a rather simple robot .  but  again  i didn   t want to kill him brutally by smashing in his cranium or throwing him into a vat of melted lead .  i preferred something more science fictional .  so here is a character in the story  a dr .  gerrigel  describing the dead robot        in the robot   s partly clenched right fist     said dr .  gerrigel     was a shiny ovoid about two inches long and half an inch wide with a mica window at one end .  the fist was in contact with his skull as though the robot   s last act had been to touch his head .  the thing he was holding was an alpha sprayer .  you know what they are  i suppose .        the nature of the alpha sprayer was then explained for the sake of the reader .  it was described as a device that sends out a beam of alpha particles through the mica window .  the impingement of the alpha particles on the robot   s positronic brain was drastic .  or  as i put it     dr .  gerrigel said     yes  and his positronic brain paths were immediately randomized .  instant death  so to speak .        well  why not .  alpha particles are capable of knocking electrons out of atoms .  it is because they do so  leaving electrically charged ions behind  that it was discovered  in       that they could be detected in cloud chambers .  the ions  with their electric charge  served as nuclei for tiny water droplets and those droplets marked out the path of the particle .  positrons  which i use in robotic brain paths in order to make them sound science fictional  are precisely like electrons except for possessing a positive charge rather than a negative one .  alpha particles should shove them out of the way with equal ease  and if positrons make up the brain paths  shoving them away disrupts the brain paths and inactivates the robots .  there   s nothing ingenious about it at all .  perfectly humdrum .  and then a short time ago  i received a letter from a gentleman working with a corporation that deals with computers .  it begins as follows      this letter is to inform you and congratulate you on another remarkable scientific prediction of the future  namely your foreseeing of the dynamic random access memory  dram  logic upset problem caused by alpha particle emission  first observed in       but written about by you in caves of steel in      .      note  actually       .    apparently the corporation tracked down failures in memory devices and finally decided that      these failures are caused by trace amounts of radioactive elements present in the packaging material used to encapsulate the silicon devices which  upon radioactive decay  emit high energy alpha particles that upset the logic states of the semiconductor memory .  .  .  .     i am writing you about this topic because in your book  caves of steel  published in the     s  you use an alpha particle emitter to    murder    one of the robots in the story  by destroying     randomizing     its positronic brain .  this is  of course  as good a way of describing a logic upset as any i   ve heard .     i get a great big kick out of finding out that our millions of dollars of research  culminating in several international awards for the most important scientific contribution in the field of reliability of semiconductor devices in      and       was predicted in substantially accurate form twenty years  note  twenty five years  actually  before the events took place .  you may certainly with great pride add this phenomenon to your collection of scientific predictions .      well  you can easily imagine that i was delighted  but truth is mighty and will prevail .  i instantly wrote to the gentleman who was so pleased at my prediction that i honestly was not aware that i was making a prediction  and that the whole thing was a tribute  not to my ingenuity  but to the good luck that constantly dogs my footsteps .   a much more intuitive and remarkable prediction was made by the science fictional father of us all  h .  g .  wells .  first  a little background .  in       the british chemist frederick soddy              advanced the    isotope concept    based on his studies of the elements produced in the course of radioactive decay .  he proposed that a particular element might be made up of atoms identical in chemical properties but differing somewhat in atomic weight .  elements  then  instead of necessarily being made up of absolutely identical elements were actually mixtures of several almost identical    isotopes    differing in atomic weight .  this made so much sense  it was quickly accepted and has remained a cornerstone of chemistry and of atomic physics ever since .  but just the other day  i received a reprint of a paper by h .  g .  wells  written on september         seventeen years before soddy   s suggestion   in which he refers to some work done by a chemist the previous year  before radioactivity had even been discovered  and suggests that to explain that work  it is possible to suppose that    there are two kinds of oxygen  one with an atom a little heavier than the other .     by saying that  he is anticipating and predicting the existence of isotopes .  furthermore  he points out that    the electric spark traversing the gas has a .  .  . selective action .  your heavier atoms or molecules get driven this or that way with slightly more force .     this is a pretty good description of a phenomenon first noted by the british physicist joseph john thomson              in       sixteen years after wells   s suggestion .  how   s that .   naturally  i would like to point to something of my own that contained a bit of nice intuitive insight  and here it is .  in       i wrote a scientific essay     i   m looking over a four leaf clover     which eventually appeared in the september      issue of the magazine of fantasy and science fiction .  in it i wanted to speculate about the origin of the universe and i was anxious to rebut the favorite comment of some who would ask     if the universe started as a    cosmic egg     where did the cosmic egg come from .     the hope was that if i were faced with that question i would have to admit the existence of a supernatural agency of creation .  i therefore postulated the existence of    negative energy    and supposed that energy was created in both negative and positive form so that there was no net creation .  i went on to advance what i called     asimov   s cosmogonic principle    and wrote     the most economical way of expressing the principle is    in the beginning  there was nothing .        well  some ten years later  the theory of the    inflationary universe    was advanced .  it was altogether different from anything i had suggested  but in one respect it was identical .  the universe was pictured as starting as a quantum fluctuation in a vacuum  so that    in the beginning  there was nothing .     that piece of insight i am really proud of .   best seller  in the december      issue of this magazine  you may recall that the first two chapters of my novel  foundation   s edge  were presented as an excerpt  together with an essay of my own on the novel   s genesis and some pleasant comments from my friends and colleagues .  i agreed to all this under strong pressure from the editorial staff  who thought it would be a good thing and who overrode my own objections that readers would complain that i was using the magazine for personal aggrandizement .  as it happened  my fears were groundless .  readers    comments were generally friendly  and a gratifying number indicated their determination to get the book and finish reading it .  it may be that you are curious to know what happened after the book was published .   for those of you interested in asimovian trivia  it was published on october         .   i   d like to tell you  because what happened astonished me totally .  the book proved to be a best seller .  i don   t mean it was a    best seller    in the usual publisher   s promotion way of indicating that it didn   t actually sink without a trace on publication day .  i mean it appeared on the national best seller lists and  as i write  it is in third place on both the new york times and on the publishers weekly list of hardcover fiction .  maybe by the time this editorial appears  it will have disappeared from the lists  but right now it   s there .  in the past  in these editorials  i have promised to keep you up to date on my endeavors and i will do it now in the form of an invented interview   q .  dr .  asimov  is this your first best seller .   a .  for some reason  people find that hard to believe  perhaps because i   m so assiduous at publicizing myself  but foundation   s edge is my first best seller .  it is my    nd book and i have been a professional writer for forty four years  so i guess this qualifies me as something less than an overnight success .  mind you  this is not my first successful book .  very few of my books have actually lost money for the publisher and many of them have done very well indeed over the years .  the earlier books of the foundation trilogy have sold in the millions over the thirty years they have been in print .  again  if you group all my books together and total the number of sales of     asimov     never mind the titles  then i have a best seller every year .  however  foundation   s edge is the first time a single book of mine has sold enough copies in a single week to make the best seller lists  and in the eight weeks since publication  as i write   it has done it in each of eight weeks .   q .  and how do you feel about that  dr .  a .  .   a .  actually  i have no room for any feeling but that of astonishment .  after publishing two hundred and sixty one books without any hint of best sellerdom  no matter how many of them might have been praised  i came to think of that as a law of nature .  as for foundation   s edge in particular  it has no sex in it  no violence  no sensationalism of any kind  and i had come to suppose that this was a perfect recipe for respectable nonbest sellerdom .  once i get over the astonishment  though  if ever   i suppose i will have room for feeling great .  after all  foundation   s edge will earn more money than i expected  and it will help my other books to sell more copies  and it may mean that future novels of mine may do better than i would otherwise expect  and i can   t very well complain about any of that .  then  too  think of the boost to my ego .   yes  i know .  you think that   s the last thing it needs .   people who till now have known i was a writer and accepted it with noticeable lack of excitement even over the number of books i have committed  now stop me in order to congratulate me  and do so with pronounced respect .  personally  i don   t think that being on the best seller lists makes a book any the higher in quality and  all too often  it might indicate the reverse  but i must admit i enjoy the congratulations and all that goes with it .   q .  are there any disadvantages to all this great stuff  isaac .   a .  oddly enough  there are .  for one thing  my esteemed publishers  doubleday and company  would like me to travel allover the united states pushing the book .   it is  at the moment  their only fiction best seller and they are as eager as i am to have it stay on the lists forever .   they are putting considerable money into advertising and promotion and it would only be fair that i do my bit as well .  however  i don   t like to travel  and so i have to refuse their suggestions that i go to chicago  for instance .  and it makes me feel guilty  and a traitor both to my publisher and my book .  i have made a trip to philadelphia  though .  there is also a higher than normal demand for interviews through visits or on the telephone .  this doesn   t demand traveling on my part and i try to oblige  telling myself it   s good publicity for the book   but it does cut into my writing time  and i can   t allow too much of that .  then  too  there   s an extraordinary demand for free copies .  this is a common disease among writers    friends and relations  who feel that there is no purpose in knowing a writer if you have to help support him .  my dear wife  j .  o .  jeppson   who is a shrewd questioner  has discovered the astonishing fact that some people think writers get unlimited numbers of free copies to give out .  they don   t .  except for a certain very small number  they have to buy copies just as anyone else does .   even if they did have unlimited numbers of free copies  giving them rather than selling them would ruin a writer  just as giving meat rather than selling it would ruin a butcher .   what i have done is to resist firmly any temptation to hand out foundation   s edge .  i have told everyone they must buy copies at a bookstore .  if they insist  i will give them copies of other books  but those sales of foundation   s edge must be registered .  every little bit helps .   q .  do you see any importance in this situation aside from personal profit and gratification .   a .  i do  indeed .  soon after foundation   s edge was published  arthur c .  clarke   s new novel        odyssey two was published  and it hit the best seller lists  too .  at the moment of writing it is in fifth place on the new york times list .  earlier this year  robert a .  heinlein made the list with friday and frank herbert did so with white plague .  i think this is the first year in which four different science fiction writers made the lists with straight science fiction books .  i also think that in the case of clarke and myself  this is the first time straight science fiction has landed so high on the lists .  this is gratifying to me as a long time science fiction fan .  it indicates to me that  finally  science fiction is coming to be of interest to the general public and not simply to those few who inhabit the sf    ghetto .     in fact  i wish to point this out to those sf writers who are bitter and resentful because they feel that their books are shoved into the background and disregarded merely because they have the sf label on them .  neither foundation   s edge nor       odyssey two makes any effort to hide the fact that it is science fiction .  the publishers    promotion in each case utterly fails to obscure that fact .  in the case of foundation   s edge  the new york times carefully describes it as    science fiction     each week in its best seller listing .  and yet it continues to sell .  to be sure  there is a trace of the    ghetto    just the same .  there is one thing that arthur and i have in common  aside from bestselling books .  as of the moment of writing  neither foundation   s edge nor       odyssey two has been reviewed in the new york times .  i presume the paper hesitates to bestow that accolade on mere science fiction .  oh  well .   q .  and what are your present projects  isaac .   a .  well  doubleday has informed me  in no uncertain terms  that i am condemned to write one novel after another for life  and that i am not permitted to consider dying .  so i am working on another novel .  this one is to be the third novel of the robot series .  both lije baiey and r .  daneel will reappear  and will complete the trilogy that began with the caves of steel and the naked sun .  the third novel is called world of the dawn .  after that  i am afraid that doubleday expects me to do a fifth foundation novel  and  apparently  so do the readers .  for three decades they badgered me for a sequel to the foundation trilogy and when i gave that to them  the ungrateful dogs responded by badgering me for a sequel to the sequel .  i   d complain  except that i love it .   note   on december          the new york times finally reviewed foundation   s edge  and very favorably too .  on that day  the book had slipped to sixth place in the best seller list  still not bad  but clarke had climbed to second place .   pseudonyms  it was quite fashionable  in earlier times  to refrain from putting one   s name to things one had written .  the writer could leave himself unnamed     anonymous     from greek words meaning    no name      or else he could use a false name     pseudonym     from greek words meaning    false name     .  so common was the practice that a pseudonym is often referred to as a    pen name     or  to give it greater elegance by placing it in french  a    nom de plume .     there were a variety of reasons for this .  in most places in the world and at most times  it was all too easy to write something that would get you in trouble .  the corruption  venality  and cruelty of those in power cried out for exposure  and those in power had the strongest objections to being exposed .  for that reason  writers had to expect all sorts of governmental correction if caught  anywhere from a fine to death by torture .  the best known example of this type of pseudonym was voltaire  the eighteenth century french satirist  whose real name was francois marie arouet .  a second major reason was that any nonscholarly writing was looked upon as rather frivolous  and a decent person guilty of concocting such material might well be looked upon askance by society  and considered as having lost caste .  a pseudonym  therefore  preserved respectability .  this was especially true of women who were widely considered subhuman in mentality  by men  and who would have shocked the world by a too open demonstration of the possession of brains .  mary ann evans  therefore  wrote under the name of george eliot  and charlotte bronte at first wrote under the name of currer bell .  one would think that neither reason would hold for the world of modern american science fiction .  why should anyone fear punishment for writing science fiction in our free land  or why should anyone fear the loss of respectability if convicted of the deed .  and yet it is conceivable  particularly in the early days of magazine science fiction  that people in the more sensitive professions  such as teaching  would not have cared to have it known that they wrote    pseudo scientific trash     and so would protect themselves from lack of promotion  or outright dismissal  by the use of a pseudonym .  i don   t know of such cases definitely  but i suspect some .  it is even more likely that in the bad old days before the women   s movement became strong  women who wrote science fiction concealed their sex from the readers   and even  sometimes  from the editors  .  science fiction was thought to be a very masculine pursuit at the time and i know two editors  no names  please  even though both are now dead  who insisted on believing that women could not write good science fiction .  pseudonyms were therefore necessary if they were to sell anything at all .  sometimes  women did not have to use pseudonyms .  their first names might be epicene  and that would be protection enough .  thus  leslie f .  stone and leigh brackett were women but  as far as one could tell from their names  they might be as masculine as leslie fiedler and leigh hunt .  editors and readers at first believed they were .  or women might simply convert names to initials .  could you tell that a .  r .  long owned up to the name of amelia  or that c .  l .  moore was catherine to her friends .  there were other reasons for pseudonyms in science fiction .  in the early days of the magazine many of the successful writers could only make a living by writing a great deal just as fast as they could  for a variety of pulp markets .  they might use different names for different markets  creating separate personalities  so to speak  that wouldn   t compete with each other .  thus will jenkins wrote for the slicks under his own name  but adopted the pseudonym murray leinster when he wrote science fiction .  sometimes  even within the single field of science fiction  particular writers wrote too many stories .  they were so good that editors would cheerfully buy  let us say  eighteen stories from them in a particular year in which they only published twelve issues of their magazines .  this meant  if you work out the arithmetic carefully  that it would be necessary to run more than one story by them in a single issue now and then  and editors generally have a prejudice against that .  readers would feel they were cheated of variety  or suspect that editors were showing undue favoritism  or who knows what .  therefore some of the stories would be put under a pseudonym .  the pseudonyms might be transparent enough .  for instance  robert a .  heinlein at the height of his magazine popularity wrote half his stories under the name of anson macdonald  but bob   s middle initial a .  stood for anson  and macdonald was the maiden name of his then wife .  similarly  l .  ron hubbard wrote under the name of rene lafayette  but the initial l .  in hubbard   s name was lafayette  and rene was a not too distant version of ron .  still  as long as the readers were led to believe that not too many stories of one author were included in the inventory  all was well .  sometimes  an author is so identified with a particular type of story  that when he writes another type of story  he doesn   t want to confuse the reader by false associations  so he adopts a new name .  thus  john w .  campbell was a writer of super science stories of cosmic scope  and one day he wrote a story called    twilight    which was altogether different .  he put it under the name of don a .  stuart  his then wife   s maiden name was dona stuart  you see  and rapidly made that name even more popular than his own .  sometimes  an author simply wants to separate his writing activities from his nonwriting activities  if they are of equal importance to him .  thus  a talented teacher at milton academy  who is named harry c .  stubbs  writes under the name of hal clement .  he   s not hiding .  hal is short for harry  as all shakespearian devotees know  and the c .  in his full name stands for clement .  again  my dear wife has practiced medicine for over thirty years as janet jeppson  m . d .  as a writer she prefers j .  o .  jeppson .  the earnings fall into two different slots as far as the i . r . s .  is concerned and that makes it convenient for her bookkeeping .  in my own case  i have eschewed pseudonyms almost entirely  i am far too fond of my own name  and far too proud of my writing to want to sail under false colors for any reason .  and yet  in one or two cases .  .  .  thus in       i was persuaded to write a juvenile science fiction novel in the hope that it would be sold as the beginning of a long lived television series .   those were early days  and no one understood how television was going to work .   i objected  very correctly i think  that tv might ruin the stuff and make me ashamed of having my name associated with it .  my editor said     then use a pseudonym .     i did  plucking paul french out of the air for the purpose  and eventually wrote six novels under that name .   some people  with little knowledge of science fiction  assumed from this that all my sf was written under paul french  a suggestion that simply horrified me .   as soon as it was clear that tv was not interested in my juveniles  i dropped all pretense  and made use of the three laws of robotics  for instance  which was a dead giveaway .  eventually  when it was time for new printings  i had my own name put upon it .  again  in       i wrote a short story for an editor who wanted it done under a pseudonym in order to give the impression that it was bya brand new author .   the reason is complicated and i won   t bore you with it .  you   ll find it in my autobiography .   i wrote it  reluctantly  under the name george e .  dale  but eventually included it in my book the early asimov as a story of my own .  also  in       i sold a story to the magazine super science stories which printed it under the pseudonym h .  b .  ogden  for reasons i no longer remember .   even my memory has its limits .   so little did i care for the story  and so unhappy was lover the nonuse of my name that i totally forgot about it  until nearly forty years later when i was going over my diary carefully in order to prepare my autobiography .  i was shocked to find there was a story of mine that i had forgotten and didn   t own in printed form .  fortunately  with the help of forrest   .  ackerman i got the issue and reprinted the story in the first volume of my autobiography  in memory yet green  acknowledging it as my own .  in       i was persuaded to write a book entitled the sensuous dirty old man  in which i gently satirized sexual how to books such as the sensuous woman .  since the latter book was written by a writer identified only as          my editor felt the joke should be carried on by having my book written by    dr .  a .     even before publication day  however  it was announced that i was the author and my identity was never a secret .  at the present moment  then  absolutely none of my writing appears under anything but my own name .  which brings up one puzzle .  the early pulps occasionally made use of    house names .     a particular magazine would use a pseudonym that was never used except in that magazine  but that pseudonym might be used by any number of different writers .  i have never really understood why this was done and if any reader knows i would appreciate being told .   dialog  most stories deal with people and one of the surefire activities of people is that of talking and of making conversation .  it follows that in most stories there is dialog .  sometimes stories are largely dialog  my own stories almost always are .  for that reason  when i think of the art of writing  which isn   t often  i must admit  i tend to think of dialog .  in the romantic period of literature in the first part of the nineteenth century  the style of dialog tended to be elaborate and adorned .  authors used their full vocabulary and had their characters speak ornately .  i remember when i was very young and first read charles dickens   s nicholas nickleby .  how i loved the conversation .  the funny passages were very funny to me  though i had trouble with john browdie   s thick yorshire accent  something his beloved matilda  brought up under similar conditions  lacked  for some reason  .  what i loved even more though was the ornamentation  the way everyone    spoke like a book .     thus  consider the scene in which nicholas nickleby confronts his villainous uncle ralph .  nicholas   s virtuous and beautiful sister  kate  who has been listening to ralph   s false version of events  which make out nicholas to have been doing wrong  cried out wildly to her brother     refute these calumnies .     of course  i had to look up    refute    and    calumny    in the dictionary  but that meant i had learned two useful words .  i also had never heard any seventeen year old girl of my acquaintance use those words but that just showed me how superior the characters in the book were  and that filled me with satisfaction .  it   s easy to laugh at the books of that era and to point out that no one really talks that way .  but then  do you suppose people in shakespeare   s time went around casually speaking in iambic pentameter  .  still  don   t you want literature to improve on nature .  sure you do .  when you go to the movies  the hero and heroine don   t look like the people you see in the streets  do they .  of course not .  they look like movie stars .  the characters in fiction are better looking  stronger  braver  more ingenious and clever than anyone you are likely to meet  so why shouldn   t they speak better  too .  and yet there are values in realism  in making people look  and sound  and act like real people .  for instance  back in       some of the players on the pennant winning chicago white sox were accused of accepting money from gamblers to throw the world series  the so called    black sox    scandal  and were barred from baseball for life as a result .  at the trial  a young lad is supposed to have followed his idol  the greatest of the accused     shoeless    joe jackson  and to have cried out in anguish     say it ain   t so  joe .     that is a deathless cry that can   t be tampered with .  it is unthinkable to have the boy say    refute these calumnies  joseph     even though that   s what he means .  any writer who tried to improve matters in that fashion would  and should  be lynched at once .  i doubt that anyone would  or should  even change it to    say it isn   t so  joe .     for that matter  you couldn   t possibly have had kate nickleby cry out to her brother     say it ain   t so  nick .     of course  during much of history most people were illiterate and the reading of books was very much confined to the few who were educated and scholarly .  such books of fiction as existed were supposed to    improve the mind     or risk being regarded as works of the devil .  it was only gradually  as mass education began to flourish  that books began to deal with ordinary people .  of course  shakespeare had his clowns and dickens had his sam wellers  and in both cases  dialog was used that mangled the english language to some extent  but that was intended as humor .  the audience was expected to laugh uproariously at these representatives of the lower classes .  as far as i know the first great book which was written entirely and seriously in substandard english and which was a great work of literature nevertheless   or even  possibly  to some extent because of it  was mark twain   s huckleberry finn  which was published in      .  huck finn is himself the narrator  and he is made to speak as an uneducated backwoods boy would speak  if he happened to be a literary genius .  that is  he used the dialect of an uneducated boy  but he put together sentences and paragraphs like a master .  the book was extremely popular when it came out because its realism made it incredibly effective  but it was also extremely controversial as all sorts of fatheads inveighed against it because it didn   t use proper english .  and yet  at that  mark twain had to draw the line  too  as did all writers until the present generation .  people  all sorts of people  use vulgarisms as a matter of course .  i remember my days in the army when it was impossible to hear a single sentence in which the common word for sexual intercourse was not used as an all purpose adjective .  later  after i had gotten out of the army  i lived on a street along which young boys and girls walked to the local junior high school in the morning  and back again in the evening  and their shouted conversations brought back memories of my barracks days with nauseating clarity .  yet could writers reproduce that aspect of common speech .  of course not .  for that reason  huck finn was always saying that something was    blamed    annoying     blamed    this     blamed    that .  you can bet that the least he was really saying was    damned .     a whole set of euphemisms was developed and placed in the mouths of characters who wouldn   t  in real life  have been caught dead saying them .  think of the all the    dad blameds .     and    goldarneds     and    consarneds    we have seen in print and heard in the movies .  to be sure  youngsters say them as a matter of caution for they would probably be punished  if of    good family     by their parents if caught using the terms they had heard said parents use .   don   t let your hearts bleed for the kids for when they grow up they will beat up their kids for the same crime .   for the last few decades  however  it has become permissible to use all the vulgarisms freely and many writers have availed themselves of the new freedom to lend an air of further realism to their dialog .  what   s more  they are apt to resent bitterly any suggestion that this habit be modified or that some nonvulgar expression be substituted .  in fact  one sees a curious reversal now .  a writer must withstand a certain criticism if he does not make use of said vulgarisms once when i read a series of letters by science fiction writers in which such terms were used freely and frequently  i wrote a response that made what seemed to me to be an obvious point .  in it  i said something like this     ordinary people  who are not well educated and who lack a large working vocabulary  are limited in their ability to lend force to their statements .  in their search for force  they must therefore make use of vulgarisms which serve  through their shock value  but which  through overuse  quickly lose whatever force they have  so that the purpose of the use is defeated .     writers  on the other hand  have  it is to be presumed  the full and magnificent vocabulary of the english language at their disposal .  they can say anything they want with whatever intensity of invective they require in a thousand different ways without ever once deviating from full respectability of utterance .  they have  therefore  no need to trespass upon the usages of the ignorant and forlorn  and to steal their tattered expressions as substitutes for the language of shakespeare and milton .     all i got for my pains were a few comments to the effect that there must be something seriously wrong with me .  nevertheless  it is my contention that dialog is realistic when  and only when  it reflects the situation as you describe it and when it produces the effect you wish to produce .  at rather rare intervals  i will make use of dialect .  i will have someone speak as a brooklyn bred person would  that is  as i myself do  in my hours of ease   or insert yiddishisms here and there  if it serves a purpose .  i may even try to make up a dialect  as i did in foundation   s edge  if it plays an important part in the development of the story .  mostly  however  i do not .  the characters in my stories  almost without exception  are pictured as being well educated and highly intelligent .  it is natural  therefore  for them to make use of a wide vocabulary and to speak precisely and grammatically  even though i try not to fall into the ornateness of the romantic ear .  and  as a matter of quixotic principle  i try to avoid expletives  even mild ones  when i can .  but other writers  of course  may do as they please .
