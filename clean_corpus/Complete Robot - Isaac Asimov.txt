version   .    it was isaac asimov who coined the word    robotics    almost forty years ago .  no less than seven of his collections have included stories of metal  plastic  and even organic mechanical men  and a woman or two as well  not to mention a dog  whose positronic brains lead them   usually with a little human assistance   into every variety of situation  often of the most unexpected sort and with the most unlooked for consequences .  now asimov   s robot tales have been gathered under one cover for the first time .  in the complete robot   s thirty one stories you   ll meet robbie  the faithful nursemaid  and tony  whose thoughtful and considerate attentions to a lonely wife provoke an all too human response .  there are robots who do not behave as they were designed to  robots who obey their iridium brains all too literally  and robots who aspire to humanity .  and then there are the humans  mike donovan and greg powel  the field testers for experimental models  peter bogert  alfred lanning  gerald black  and the rest of the u . s .  robots and mechanical men research and development staff   and especially the company   s chief robot psychologist  the steely dr .  susan calvin .  here is every last one of isaac asimov   s robot stories  including some which have never before appeared in a book .  asimov fans  science fiction fans  robot fans  and those who love entertaining  logical  puzzling  and stimulating tales will all welcome the complete robot .   isaac asimov has written     books on subjects ranging from the bible and shakespeare to astronomy and math to robotics  light speed travel  and alien encounters .  the inventor of the famous three laws of robotics  he is the author of i  robot and the foundation trilogy .  he lives in

for whom books are in progress  introduction  by the time i was in my late teens and already a hardened science fiction reader  i had read many robot stories and found that they fell into two classes .  in the first class there was robot as menace .  i don   t have to explain that overmuch .  such stories were a mixture of    clank clank    and    aarghh    and    there are some things man was not meant to know .     after a while  they palled dreadfully and i couldn   t stand them .  in the second class  a much smaller one  there was robot as pathos .  in such stories the robots were lovable and were usually put upon by cruel human beings .  these charmed me .  in late      two such stories hit the stands that particularly impressed me .  one was a short story by eando binder entitled    i  robot     about a saintly robot named adam link  another was a story by lester del rey  entitled    helen o   loy     that touched me with its portrayal of a robot that was everything a loyal wife should be .  when  therefore  on june           yes  i do keep meticulous records   i sat down to write my first robot story  there was no question that i fully intended to write a robot as pathos story .  i wrote    robbie     about a robot nurse and a little girl and love and a prejudiced mother and a weak father and a broken heart and a tearful reunion .   it originally appeared under the title  one i hated  of    strange playfellow .      but something odd happened as i wrote this first story .  i managed to get the dim vision of a robot as neither menace nor pathos .  i began to think of robots as industrial products built by matter of fact engineers .  they were built with safety features so they weren   t menaces and they were fashioned for certain jobs so that no pathos was necessarily involved .  as i continued to write robot stories  this notion of carefully engineered industrial robots permeated my stories more and more until the whole character of robot stories in serious printed science fiction changed  not only that of my own stories  but of just about everybody   s .  that made me feel good and for many years  decades even  i went about freely admitting that i was    the father of the modern robot story .     as time went by  i made other discoveries that delighted me .  i found  for instance  that when i used the word    robotics    to describe the study of robots  i was not using a word that already existed but had invented a word that had never been used before .   that was in my story    runaround     published in      .   the word has now come into general use .  there are journals and books with the word in the title and it is generally known in the field that i invented the term .  don   t think i   m not proud of that .  there are not many people who have coined a useful scientific term  and although i did it unknowingly  i have no intention of letting anyone in the world forget it .  what   s more  in    runaround    i listed my    three laws of robotics    in explicit detail for the first time  and these  too  became famous .  at least  they are quoted in and out of season  in all sorts of places that have nothing primarily to do with science fiction  even in general quotation references .  and people who work in the field of artificial intelligence sometimes take occasion to tell me that they think the three laws will serve as a good guide .  we can go even beyond that   when i wrote my robot stories i had no thought that robots would come into existence in my lifetime .  in fact  i was certain they would not  and would have wagered vast sums that they would not .   at least  i would have wagered    cents  which is my betting limit on sure things .   yet here i am  forty three years after i wrote my first robot story  and we do have robots .  indeed  we do .  what   s more  they are what i envisaged them to be in a way  industrial robots  created by engineers to do specific jobs and with safety features built in .  they are to be found in numerous factories  particularly in japan  where there are automobile factories that are entirely roboticized .  the assembly line in such places is    manned    by robots at every stage .  to be sure  these robots are not as intelligent as my robots are  they are not positronic  they are not even humanoid .  however  they are evolving rapidly and becoming steadily more capable and versatile .  who knows where they   ll be in another forty years .  one thing we can be sure of .  robots are changing the world and driving it in directions we cannot clearly foresee .  where are these robots in reality coming from .  the most important single source is a firm called unimation  inc .   of danbury  connecticut .  it is the leading manufacturer of industrial robots and is responsible for perhaps one third of all robots that have been installed .  the president of the firm is joseph f .  engelberger  who founded it in the late     s because he was so interested in robots that he decided to make their production his life work .  but how in the world did he become so interested in robots so early in the game .  according to his own words  he grew interested in robots in the     s when he was a physics major undergraduate at columbia university  reading the robot stories of his fellow columbian isaac asimov .  my goodness .  you know  i didn   t write my robot stories with much in the way of ambition back in those old  old days .  all i wanted was to sell them to the magazines in order to earn a few hundred dollars to help pay my college tuition  and to see my name in print besides .  if i had been writing in any other field of literature  that   s all i would have attained .  but because i was writing science fiction  and only because i was writing science fiction  i  without knowing it  was starting a chain of events that is changing the face of the world .  joseph f .  engelberger  by the way  published a book in      called robotics in practice  management and application of industrial robots  american management associations   and he was kind enough to invite me to write the foreword .  all this set the nice people at doubleday to thinking   my various robot short stories have appeared in no less than seven different collections of mine .  why should they be so separated .  since they appear to be far more important than anyone dreamed they would be  least of all  i  at the time they were written  why not pull them together in a single book .  it wasn   t hard to get me to agree  so here are thirty one short stories  totaling some         words  written over a time period stretching from      to         some non human robots  i am not having the robot stories appear in the order in which they were written .  rather  i am grouping them by the nature of the contents .  in this first division  for instance  i deal with robots that have a non human shape  a dog  an automobile  a box .  why not .  the industrial robots that have come into existence in reality are non human in appearance .  the very first story     a boy   s best friend     is not in any of my earlier collections .  it was written on september           and you may find in it a distant echo of    robbie     written thirty five years earlier  which appears later in this volume .  don   t think i   m not aware of that .  you will note  by the way  that in these three stories  the concept of robot as pathos is clearly marked .  you may also notice  however  that in    sally    there seems to be no hint of the three laws and that there is more than a hint of robot as menace .  well  if i want to do that once in a while  i can  i suppose .  who   s there to stop me .   a boy   s best friend  mr .  anderson said     where   s jimmy  dear .        out on the crater     said mrs .  anderson .     hell be all right robutt is with him .   did he arrive .        yes .  he   s at the rocket station  going through the tests .  actually  i can hardly wait to see him myself .  i haven   t really seen one since i left earth    years ago .  you can   t count films .        jimmy has never seen one     said mrs .  anderson .     because he   s moonborn and can   t visit earth .  that   s why i   m bringing one here .  i think it   s the first one ever on the moon .        it cost enough     said mrs .  anderson  with a small sigh .     maintaining robutt isn   t cheap  either     said mr .  anderson .  jimmy was out on the crater  as his mother had said .  by earth standards  he was spindly  but rather tall for a    year old .  his arms and legs were long and agile .  he looked thicker and stubbier with his spacesuit on  but he could handle the lunar gravity as no earth born human being could .  his father couldn   t begin to keep up with him when jimmy stretched his legs and went into the kangaroo hop .  the outer side of the crater sloped southward and the earth  which was low in the southern sky  where it always was  as seen from lunar city  was nearly full  so that the entire crater slope was brightly lit the slope was a gentle one and even the weight of the spacesuit couldn   t keep jimmy from racing up it in a floating hop that made the gravity seem nonexistent .     come on  robutt     he shouted .  robutt  who could hear him by radio  squeaked and bounded after .  jimmy  expert though he was  couldn   t outrace robutt  who didn   t need a spacesuit  and had four legs and tendons of steel .  robutt sailed over jimmy   s head  somersaulting and landing almost under his feet .     don   t show off  robutt     said jimmy     and stay in sight .     robutt squeaked again  the special squeak that meant    yes .        i don   t trust you  you faker     shouted jimmy  and up he went in one last bound that carried him over the curved upper edge of the crater wall and down onto the inner slope .  the earth sank below the top of the crater wall and at once it was pitch dark around him .  a warm  friendly darkness that wiped out the difference between ground and sky except for the glitter of stars .  actually  jimmy wasn   t supposed to exercise along the dark side of the crater wall .  the grown ups said it was dangerous  but that was because they were never there .  the ground was smooth and crunchy and jimmy knew the exact location of every one of the few rocks .  besides  how could it be dangerous racing through the dark when robutt was right there with him  bouncing around and squeaking and glowing .  even without the glow  robutt could tell where he was  and where jimmy was  by radar .  jimmy couldn   t go wrong while robutt was around  tripping him when he was too near a rock  or jumping on him to show how much he loved him  or circling around and squeaking low and scared when jimmy hid behind a rock  when all the time robutt knew well enough where he was .  once jimmy had lain still and pretended he was hurt and robutt had sounded the radio alarm and people from lunar city got there in a hurry .  jimmy   s father had let him hear about that little trick  and jimmy never tried it again .  just as he was remembering that  he heard his father   s voice on his private wavelength .     jimmy  come back .  i have something to tell you .      jimmy was out of his spacesuit now and washed up .  you always had to wash up after coming in from outside .  even robutt had to be sprayed  but he loved it .  he stood there on all fours  his little foot long body quivering and glowing just a tiny bit  and his small head  with no mouth  with two large glassed in eyes  and with a bump where the brain was .  he squeaked until mr .  anderson said     quiet  robutt .     mr .  anderson was smiling .     we have something for you  jimmy .  it   s at the rocket station now  but we   ll have it tomorrow after all the tests are over .  i thought i   d tell you now .        from earth  dad .        a dog from earth  son .  a real dog .  a scotch terrier puppy .  the first dog on the moon .  you won   t need robutt any more .  we can   t keep them both  you know  and some other boy or girl will have robutt .     he seemed to be waiting for jimmy to say something  then he said     you know what a dog is  jimmy .  it   s the real thing .  robutt   s only a mechanical imitation  a robot mutt .  that   s how he got his name .     jimmy frowned .     robutt isn   t an imitation  dad .  he   s my dog .        not a real one  jimmy .  robutt   s just steel and wiring and a simple positronic brain .  it   s not alive .        he does everything i want him to do  dad .  he understands me .  sure  he   s alive .        no  son .  robutt is just a machine .  it   s just programmed to act the way it does .  a dog is alive .  you won   t want robutt after you have the dog .        the dog will need a spacesuit  won   t he .        yes  of course .  but it will be worth the money and he   ll get used to it .  and he won   t need one in the city .  you   ll see the difference once he gets here .     jimmy looked at robutt  who was squeaking again  a very low  slow squeak  that seemed frightened .  jimmy held out his arms and robutt was in them in one bound .  jimmy said     what will the difference be between robutt and the dog .        it   s hard to explain     said mr .  anderson     but it will be easy to see .  the dog will really love you .  robutt is just adjusted to act as though it loves you .        but  dad  we don   t know what   s inside the dog  or what his feelings are .  maybe it   s just acting  too .     mr .  anderson frowned .     jimmy  you   ll know the difference when you experience the love of a living thing .     jimmy held robutt tightly .  he was frowning  too  and the desperate look on his face meant that he wouldn   t change his mind .  he said     but what   s the difference how they act .  how about how i feel .  i love robutt and that   s what counts .     and the little robot mutt  which had never been held so tightly in all its existence  squeaked high and rapid squeaks  happy squeaks .   sally  sally was coming down the lake road  so i waved to her and called her by name .  i always liked to see sally .  i liked all of them  you understand  but sally   s the prettiest one of the lot .  there just isn   t any question about it .  she moved a little faster when i waved to her .  nothing undignified .  she was never that .  she moved just enough faster to show that she was glad to see me  too .  i turned to the man standing beside me .     that   s sally     i said .  he smiled at me and nodded .  mrs .  hester had brought him in .  she said     this is mr .  gellhorn  jake .  you remember he sent you the letter asking for an appointment .     that was just talk  really .  i have a million things to do around the farm  and one thing i just can   t waste my time on is mail .  that   s why i have mrs .  hester around .  she lives pretty close by  she   s good at attending to foolishness without running to me about it  and most of all  she likes sally and the rest .  some people don   t .     glad to see you  mr .  gellhorn     i said .     raymond f .  gellhorn     he said  and gave me his hand  which i shook and gave back .  he was a largish fellow  half a head taller than i and wider  too .  he was about half my age  thirtyish .  he had black hair  plastered down slick  with a part in the middle  and a thin mustache  very neatly trimmed .  his jawbones got big under his ears and made him look as if he had a slight case of mumps .  on video he   d be a natural to play the villain  so i assumed he was a nice fellow .  it goes to show that video can   t be wrong all the time .     i   m jacob folkers     i said .     what can i do for you .     he grinned .  it was a big  wide  white toothed grin .     you can tell me a little about your farm here  if you don   t mind .     i heard sally coming up behind me and i put out my hand .  she slid right into it and the feel of the hard  glossy enamel of her fender was warm in my palm .     a nice automatobile     said gellhorn .  that   s one way of putting it .  sally was a      convertible with a hennis carleton positronic motor and an armat chassis .  she had the cleanest  finest lines i   ve ever seen on any model  bar none .  for five years  she   d been my favorite  and i   d put everything into her i could dream up .  in all that time  there   d never been a human being behind her wheel .  not once .     sally     i said  patting her gently     meet mr .  gellhorn .     sally   s cylinder purr keyed up a little .  i listened carefully for any knocking .  lately  i   d been hearing motor knock in almost all the cars and changing the gasoline hadn   t done a bit of good .  sally was as smooth as her paint job this time  however .     do you have names for all your cars .     asked gellhorn .  he sounded amused  and mrs .  hester doesn   t like people to sound as though they were making fun of the farm .  she said  sharply     certainly .  the cars have real personalities  don   t they  jake .  the sedans are all males and the convertibles are females .     gellhorn was smiling again .     and do you keep them in separate garages  ma   am .     mrs .  hester glared at him .  gellhorn said to me     and now i wonder if i can talk to you alone  mr .  folkers .        that depends     i said .     are you a reporter .        no  sir .  i   m a sales agent .  any talk we have is not for publication .  i assure you i am interested in strict privacy .        let   s walk down the road a bit .  there   s a bench we can use .     we started down .  mrs .  hester walked away .  sally nudged along after us .  i said     you don   t mind if sally comes along  do you .        not at all .  she can   t repeat what we say  can she .     he laughed at his own joke  reached over and rubbed sally   s grille .  sally raced her motor and gellhorn   s hand drew away quickly .     she   s not used to strangers     i explained .     we sat down on the bench under the big oak tree where we could look across the small lake to the private speedway .  it was the warm part of the day and the cars were out in force  at least thirty of them .  even at this distance i could see that jeremiah was pulling his usual stunt of sneaking up behind some staid older model  then putting on a jerk of speed and yowling past with deliberately squealing brakes .  two weeks before he had crowded old angus off the asphalt altogether  and i had turned off his motor for two days .  it didn   t help though  i   m afraid  and it looks as though there   s nothing to be done about it .  jeremiah is a sports model to begin with and that kind is awfully hot headed .     well  mr .  gellhorn     i said .     could you tell me why you want the information .     but he was just looking around .  he said     this is an amazing place  mr .  folkers .        i wish you   d call me jake .  everyone does .        all right  jake .  how many cars do you have here .        fifty one .  we get one or two new ones every year .  one year we got five .  we haven   t lost one yet .  they   re all in perfect running order .  we even have a       model mat o mot in working order .  one of the original automatics .  it was the first car here .     good old matthew .  he stayed in the garage most of the day now  but then he was the granddaddy of all positronic motored cars .  those were the days when blind war veterans  paraplegics and heads of state were the only ones who drove automatics .  but samson harridge was my boss and he was rich enough to be able to get one .  i was his chauffeur at the time .  the thought makes me feel old .  i can remember when there wasn   t an automobile in the world with brains enough to find its own way home .  i chauffeured dead lumps of machines that needed a man   s hand at their controls every minute .  every year machines like that used to kill tens of thousands of people .  the automatics fixed that .  a positronic brain can react much faster than a human one  of course  and it paid people to keep hands off the controls .  you got in  punched your destination and let it go its own way .  we take it for granted now  but i remember when the first laws came out forcing the old machines off the highways and limiting travel to automatics .  lord  what a fuss .  they called it everything from communism to fascism  but it emptied the highways and stopped the killing  and still more people get around more easily the new way .  of course  the automatics were ten to a hundred times as expensive as the hand driven ones  and there weren   t many that could afford a private vehicle .  the industry specialized in turning out omnibus automatics .  you could always call a company and have one stop at your door in a matter of minutes and take you where you wanted to go .  usually  you had to drive with others who were going your way  but what   s wrong with that .  samson harridge had a private car though  and i went to him the minute it arrived .  the car wasn   t matthew to me then .  i didn   t know it was going to be the dean of the farm some day .  i only knew it was taking my job away and i hated it .  i said     you won   t be needing me any more  mr .  harridge .     he said     what are you dithering about  jake .  you don   t think i   ll trust myself to a contraption like that  do you .  you stay right at the controls .     i said     but it works by itself  mr .  harridge .  it scans the road  reacts properly to obstacles  humans  and other cars  and remembers routes to travel .        so they say .  so they say .  just the same  you   re sitting right behind the wheel in case anything goes wrong .     funny how you can get to like a car .  in no time i was calling it matthew and was spending all my time keeping it polished and humming .  a positronic brain stays in condition best when it   s got control of its chassis at all times  which means it   s worth keeping the gas tank filled so that the motor can turn over slowly day and night .  after a while  it got so i could tell by the sound of the motor how matthew felt .  in his own way  harridge grew fond of matthew  too .  he had no one else to like .  he   d divorced or outlived three wives and outlived five children and three grandchildren .  so when he died  maybe it wasn   t surprising that he had his estate converted into a farm for retired automobiles  with me in charge and matthew the first member of a distinguished line .  it   s turned out to be my life .  i never got married .  you can   t get married and still tend to automatics the way you should .  the newspapers thought it was funny  but after a while they stopped joking about it .  some things you can   t joke about .  maybe you   ve never been able to afford an automatic and maybe you never will  either  but take it from me  you get to love them .  they   re hard working and affectionate .  it takes a man with no heart to mistreat one or to see one mistreated .  it got so that after a man had an automatic for a while  he would make provisions for having it left to the farm  if he didn   t have an heir he could rely on to give it good care .  i explained that to gellhorn .  he said     fifty one cars .  that represents a lot of money .        fifty thousand minimum per automatic  original investment     i said .     they   re worth a lot more now .  i   ve done things for them .        it must take a lot of money to keep up the farm .        you   re right there .  the farm   s a non profit organization  which gives us a break on taxes and  of course  new automatics that come in usually have trust funds attached .  still  costs are always going up .  i have to keep the place landscaped  i keep laying down new asphalt and keeping the old in repair  there   s gasoline  oil  repairs  and new gadgets .  it adds up .        and you   ve spent a long time at it .        i sure have  mr .  gellhorn .  thirty three years .        you don   t seem to be getting much out of it yourself .        i don   t .  you surprise me  mr .  gellhorn .  i   ve got sally and fifty others .  look at her .     i was grinning .  i couldn   t help it .  sally was so clean  it almost hurt .  some insect must have died on her windshield or one speck of dust too many had landed  so she was going to work .  a little tube protruded and spurted tergosol over the glass .  it spread quickly over the silicone surface film and squeejees snapped into place instantly  passing over the windshield and forcing the .  water into the little channel that led it  dripping  down to the ground .  not a speck of water got onto her glistening apple green hood .  squeejee and detergent tube snapped back into place and disappeared .  gellhorn said     i never saw an automatic do that .        i guess not     i said .     i fixed that up specially on our cars .  they   re clean .  they   re always scrubbing their glass .  they like it .  i   ve even got sally fixed up with wax jets .  she polishes herself every night till you can see your face in any part of her and shave by it .  if i can scrape up the money  i   d be putting it on the rest of the girls .  convertibles are very vain .        i can tell you how to scrape up the money  if that interests you .        that always does .  how .        isn   t it obvious  fake .  any of your cars is worth fifty thousand minimum  you said .  i   ll bet most of them top six figures .        so .        ever think of selling a few .     i shook my head .     you don   t realize it  i guess  mr .  gellhorn  but i can   t sell any of these .  they belong to the farm  not to me .        the money would go to the farm .        the incorporation papers of the farm provide that the cars receive perpetual care .  they can   t be sold .        what about the motors  then .        i don   t understand you .     gellhorn shifted position and his voice got confidential .     look here  jake  let me explain the situation .  there   s a big market for private automatics if they could only be made cheaply enough .  right .        that   s no secret .        and ninety five per cent of the cost is the motor .  right .  now  i know where we can get a supply of bodies .  i also know where we can sell automatics at a good price  twenty or thirty thousand for the cheaper models  maybe fifty or sixty for the better ones .  all i need are the motors .  you see the solution .        i don   t  mr .  gellhorn .     i did  but i wanted him to spell it out .     it   s right here .  you   ve got fifty one of them .  you   re an expert automatobile mechanic  jake .  you must be .  you could unhook a motor and place it in another car so that no one would know the difference .        it wouldn   t be exactly ethical .        you wouldn   t be harming the cars .  you   d be doing them a favor .  use your older cars .  use that old mat o mot .        well  now  wait a while  mr .  gellhorn .  the motors and bodies aren   t two separate items .  they   re a single unit .  those motors are used to their own bodies .  they wouldn   t be happy in another car .        all right  that   s a point .  that   s a very good point  jake .  it would be like taking your mind and putting it in someone else   s skull .  right .  you don   t think you would like that .        i don   t think i would .  no .        but what if i took your mind and put it into the body of a young athlete .  what about that  jake .  you   re not a youngster anymore .  if you had the chance  wouldn   t you enjoy being twenty again .  that   s what i   m offering some of your positronic motors .  they   ll be put into new       bodies .  the latest construction .     i laughed .     that doesn   t make much sense  mr .  gellhorn .  some of our cars may be old  but they   re well cared for .  nobody drives them .  they   re allowed their own way .  they   re retired  mr .  gellhorn .  i wouldn   t want a twenty year old body if it meant i had to dig ditches for the rest of my new life and never have enough to eat .   .   .   .  what do you think  sally .     sally   s two doors opened and then shut with a cushioned slam .     what that .     said gellhorn .     that   s the way sally laughs .     gellhorn forced a smile .  i guess he thought i was making a bad joke .  he said     talk sense  jake .  cars are made to be driven .  they   re probably not happy if you don   t drive them .     i said     sally hasn   t been driven in five years .  she looks happy to me .        i wonder .     he got up and walked toward sally slowly .     hi  sally  how   d you like a drive .     sally   s motor revved up .  she backed away .     don   t push her  mr .  gellhorn     i said .     she   s liable to be a little skittish .     two sedans were about a hundred yards up the road .  they had stopped .  maybe  in their own way  they were watching .  i didn   t bother about them .  i had my eyes on sally  and i kept them there .  gellhorn said     steady now  sally .     he lunged out and seized the door handle .  it didn   t budge  of course .  he said     it opened a minute ago .     i said     automatic lock .  she   s got a sense of privacy  sally has .     he let go  then said  slowly and deliberately     a car with a sense of privacy shouldn   t go around with its top down .     he stepped back three or four paces  then quickly  so quickly i couldn   t take a step to stop him  he ran forward and vaulted into the car .  he caught sally completely by surprise  because as he came down  he shut off the ignition before she could lock it in place .  for the first time in five years  sally   s motor was dead .  i think i yelled  but gellhorn had the switch on    manual    and locked that in place  too .  he kicked the motor into action .  sally was alive again but she had no freedom of action .  he started up the road .  the sedans were still there .  they turned and drifted away  not very quickly .  i suppose it was all a puzzle to them .  one was giuseppe  from the milan factories  and the other was stephen .  they were always together .  they were both new at the farm  but they   d been here long enough to know that our cars just didn   t have drivers .  gellhorn went straight on  and when the sedans finally got it through their heads that sally wasn   t going to slow down  that she couldn   t slow down  it was too late for anything but desperate measures .  they broke for it  one to each side  and sally raced between them like a streak .  steve crashed through the lakeside fence and rolled to a halt on the grass and mud not six inches from the water   s edge .  giuseppe bumped along the land side of the road to a shaken halt .  i had steve back on the highway and was trying to find out what harm  if any  the fence had done him  when gellhorn came back .  gellhorn opened sally   s door and stepped out .  leaning back  he shut off the ignition a second time .     there     he said .     i think i did her a lot of good .     i held my temper .     why did you dash through the sedans .  there was no reason for that .        i kept expecting them to turn out .        they did .  one went through a fence .        i   m sorry  jake     he said .     i thought they   d move more quickly .  you know how it is .  i   ve been in lots of buses  but i   ve only been in a private automatic two or three times in my life  and this is the first time i ever drove one .  that just shows you  jake .  it got me  driving one  and i   m pretty hard boiled .  i tell you  we don   t have to go more than twenty per cent below list price to reach a good market  and it would be ninety per cent profit .        which we would split .        fifty fifty .  and i take all the risks  remember .        all right .  i listened to you .  now you listen to me .     i raised my voice because i was just too mad to be polite anymore .     when you turn off sally   s motor  you hurt her .  how would you like to be kicked unconscious .  that   s what you do to sally  when you turn her off .        you   re exaggerating  jake .  the automatobuses get turned off every night .        sure  that   s why i want none of my boys or girls in your fancy       bodies  where i won   t know what treatment they   ll get .  buses need major repairs in their positronic circuits every couple of years .  old matthew hasn   t had his circuits touched in twenty years .  what can you offer him compared with that .        well  you   re excited now .  suppose you think over my proposition when you   ve cooled down and get in touch with me .        i   ve thought it over all i want to .  if i ever see you again  i   ll call the police .     his mouth got hard and ugly .  he said     just a minute  old timer .     i said     just a minute  you .  this is private property and i   m ordering you off .     he shrugged .     well  then  goodbye .     i said     mrs .  hester will see you off the property .  make that goodbye permanent .     but it wasn   t permanent .  i saw him again two days later .  two and a half days  rather  because it was about noon when i saw him first and a little after midnight when i saw him again .  i sat up in bed when he turned the light on  blinking blindly till i made out what was happening .  once i could see  it didn   t take much explaining .  in fact  it took none at all .  he had a gun in his right fist  the nasty little needle barrel just visible between two fingers .  i knew that all he had to do was to increase the pressure of his hand and i would be torn apart .    he said     put on your clothes  jake .     i didn   t move .  i just watched him .  he said     look  jake  i know the situation .  i visited you two days ago  remember .  you have no guards on this place  no electrified fences  no warning signals .  nothing .     i said     i don   t need any .  meanwhile there   s nothing to stop you from leaving  mr .  gellhorn .  i would if i were you .  this place can be very dangerous .     he laughed a little .     it is  for anyone on the wrong side of a fist gun .        i see it     i said .     i know you   ve got one .        then get a move on .  my men are waiting .        no  sir  mr .  gellhorn .  not unless you tell me what you want  and probably not then .        i made you a proposition day before yesterday .        the answer   s still no .        there   s more to the proposition now .  i   ve come here with some men and an automatobus .  you have your chance to come with me and disconnect twenty five of the positronic motors .  i don   t care which twenty five you choose .  we   ll load them on the bus and take them away .  once they   re disposed of  i   ll see to it that you get your fair share of the money .        i have your word on that  i suppose .     he didn   t act as if he thought i was being sarcastic .  he said     you have .     i said     no .        if you insist on saying no  we   ll go about it in our own way .  i   ll disconnect the motors myself  only i   ll disconnect all fifty one .  every one of them .        it isn   t easy to disconnect positronic motors  mr .  gellhorn .  are you a robotics expert .  even if you are  you know  these motors have been modified by me .        i know that  jake .  and to be truthful  i   m not an expert .  i may ruin quite a few motors trying to get them out .  that   s why i   ll have to work over all fifty one if you don   t cooperate .  you see  i may only end up with twenty five when i   m through .  the first few i   ll tackle will probably suffer the most .  till i get the hang of it  you see .  and if i go it myself  i think i   ll put sally first in line .     i said     i can   t believe you   re serious  mr .  gellhorn .     he said     i   m serious  jake .     he let it all dribble in .     if you want to help  you can keep sally .  otherwise  she   s liable to be hurt very badly .  sorry .     i said     i   ll come with you  but i   ll give you one more warning .  you   ll be in trouble  mr .  gellhorn .     he thought that was very funny .  he was laughing very quietly as we went down the stairs together .  there was an automatobus waiting outside the driveway to the garage apartments .  the shadows of three men waited beside it  and their flash beams went on as we approached .  gellhorn said in a low voice     i   ve got the old fellow .  come on .  move the truck up the drive and let   s get started .     one of the others leaned in and punched the proper instructions on the control panel .  we moved up the driveway with the bus following submissively .     it won   t go inside the garage     i said .     the door won   t take it .  we don   t have buses here .  only private cars .        all right     said gellhorn .     pull it over onto the grass and keep it out of sight .     i could hear the thrumming of the cars when we were still ten yards from the garage .  usually they quieted down if i entered the garage .  this time they didn   t .  i think they knew that strangers were about  and once the faces of gellhorn and the others were visible they got noisier .  each motor was a warm rumble  and each motor was knocking irregularly until the place rattled .  the lights went up automatically as we stepped inside .  gellhorn didn   t seem bothered by the car noise  but the three men with him looked surprised and uncomfortable .  they had the look of the hired thug about them  a look that was not compounded of physical features so much as of a certain wariness of eye and hangdogness of face .  i knew the type and i wasn   t worried .  one of them said     damn it  they   re burning gas .        my cars always do     i replied stiffly .     not tonight     said gellhorn .     turn them off .        it   s not that easy  mr .  gellhorn     i said .     get started .     he said .  i stood there .  he had his fist gun pointed at me steadily .  i said     i told you  mr .  gellhom  that my cars have been well treated while they   ve been at the farm .  they   re used to being treated that way  and they resent anything else .        you have one minute     he said .     lecture me some other time .        i   m trying to explain something .  i   m trying to explain that my cars can understand what i say to them .  a positronic motor will learn to do that with time and patience .  my cars have learned .  sally understood your proposition two days ago .  you   ll remember she laughed when i asked her opinion .  she also knows what you did to her and so do the two sedans you scattered .  and the rest know what to do about trespassers in general .        look  you crazy old fool         all i have to say is      i raised my voice .     get them .     one of the men turned pasty and yelled  but his voice was drowned completely in the sound of fifty one horns turned loose at once .  they held their notes  and within the four walls of the garage the echoes rose to a wild  metallic call .  two cars rolled forward  not hurriedly  but with no possible mistake as to their target .  two cars fell in line behind the first two .  all the cars were stirring in their separate stalls .  the thugs stared  then backed .  i shouted     don   t get up against a wall .     apparently  they had that instinctive thought themselves .  they rushed madly for the door of the garage .  at the door one of gellhorn   s men turned  brought up a fist gun of his own .  the needle pellet tore a thin  blue flash toward the first car .  the car was giuseppe .  a thin line of paint peeled up giuseppe   s hood  and the right half of his windshield crazed and splintered but did not break through .  the men were out the door  running  and two by two the cars crunched out after them into the night  their horns calling the charge .  i kept my hand on gellhorn   s elbow  but i don   t think he could have moved in any case .  his lips were trembling .  i said     that   s why i don   t need electrified fences or guards .  my property protects itself .     gellhorn   s eyes swiveled back and forth in fascination as  pair by pair  they whizzed by .  he said     they   re killers .        don   t be silly .  they won   t kill your men .        they   re killers .        they   ll just give your men a lesson .  my cars have been specially trained for cross country pursuit for just such an occasion  i think what your men will get will be worse than an outright quick kill .  have you ever been chased by an automatobile .     gellhorn didn   t answer .  i went on .  i didn   t want him to miss a thing .     they   ll be shadows going no faster than your men  chasing them here  blocking them there  blaring at them  dashing at them  missing with a screech of brake and a thunder of motor .  they   ll keep it up till your men drop  out of breath and half dead  waiting for the wheels to crunch over their breaking bones .  the cars won   t do that .  they   ll turn away .  you can bet  though  that your men will never return here in their lives .  not for all the money you or ten like you could give them .  listen      i tightened my hold on his elbow .  he strained to hear .  i said     don   t you hear car doors slamming .     it was faint and distant  but unmistakable .  i said     they   re laughing .  they   re enjoying themselves .     his face crumpled with rage .  he lifted his hand .  he was still holding his fist gun .  i said     i wouldn   t .  one automatocar is still with us .     i don   t think he had noticed sally till then .  she had moved up so quietly .  though her right front fender nearly touched me  i couldn   t hear her motor .  she might have been holding her breath .  gellhorn yelled .  i said     she won   t touch you  as long as i   m with you .  but if you kill me .   .   .   .  you know  sally doesn   t like you .     gellhorn turned the gun in sally   s direction .     her motor is shielded     i said     and before you could ever squeeze the gun a second time she would be on top of you .        all right  then     he yelled  and suddenly my arm was bent behind my back and twisted so i could hardly stand .  he held me between sally and himself  and his pressure didn   t let up .     back out with me and don   t try to break loose  old timer  or i   ll tear your arm out of its socket .     i had to move .  sally nudged along with us  worried  uncertain what to do .  i tried to say something to her and couldn   t .  i could only clench my teeth and moan .  gellhorn   s automatobus was still standing outside the garage .  i was forced in .  gellhorn jumped in after me  locking the doors .  he said     all right  now .  we   ll talk sense .     i was rubbing my arm  trying to get life back into it  and even as i did i was automatically and without any conscious effort studying the control board of the bus .  i said     this is a rebuilt job .        so .     he said caustically .     it   s a sample of my work .  i picked up a discarded chassis  found a brain i could use and spliced me a private bus .  what of it .     i tore at the repair panel  forcing it aside .  he said     what the hell .  get away from that .     the side of his palm came down numbingly on my left shoulder .  i struggled with him .     i don   t want to do this bus any harm .  what kind of a person do you think i am .  i just want to take a look at some of the motor connections .     it didn   t take much of a look .  i was boiling when i turned to him .  i said     you   re a hound and a bastard .  you had no right installing this motor yourself .  why didn   t you get a robotics man .     he said     do i look crazy .        even if it was a stolen motor  you had no right to treat it so .  i wouldn   t treat a man the way you treated that motor .  solder  tape  and pinch clamps .  it   s brutal .        it works  doesn   t it .        sure it works  but it must be hell for the bus .  you could live with migraine headaches and acute arthritis  but it wouldn   t be much of a life .  this car is suffering .        shut up .     for a moment he glanced out the window at sally  who had rolled up as close to the bus as she could .  he made sure the doors and windows were locked .  he said     we   re getting out of here now  before the other cars come back .  we   ll stay away .        how will that help you .        your cars will run out of gas someday  won   t they .  you haven   t got them fixed up so they can tank up on their own  have you .  we   ll come back and finish the job .        they   ll be looking for me     i said .     mrs .  hester will call the police .     he was past reasoning with .  he just punched the bus in gear .  it lurched forward .  sally followed .  he giggled .     what can she do if you   re here with me .     sally seemed to realize that  too .  she picked up speed  passed us and was gone .  gellhorn opened the window next to him and spat through the opening .  the bus lumbered on over the dark road  its motor rattling unevenly .  gellhorn dimmed the periphery light until the phosphorescent green stripe down the middle of the highway  sparkling in the moonlight  was all that kept us out of the trees .  there was virtually no traffic .  two cars passed ours  going the other way  and there was none at all on our side of the highway  either before or behind .  i heard the door slamming first .  quick and sharp in the silence  first on the right and then on the left gellhorn   s hands quivered as he punched savagely for increased speed .  a beam of light shot out from among a scrub of trees  blinding us  another beam plunged at us from behind the guard rails on the other side .  at a crossover  four hundred yards ahead  there was sque e e e e as a car darted across our path .     sally went for the rest     i said .     i think you   re surrounded .        so what .  what can they do .     he hunched over the controls  peering through the windshield .     and don   t you try anything  old timer     he muttered .  i couldn   t .  i was bone weary  my left arm was on fire .  the motor sounds gathered and grew closer .  i could hear the motors missing in odd patterns  suddenly it seemed to me that my cars were speaking to one another .  a medley of horns came from behind .  i turned and gellhom looked quickly into the rear view mirror .  a dozen cars were following in both lanes .  gellhorn yelled and laughed madly .  i cried     stop .  stop the car .     because not a quarter of a mile ahead  plainly visible in the light beams of two sedans on the roadside was sally  her trim body plunked square across the road .  two cars shot into the opposite lane to our left  keeping perfect time with us and preventing gellhom from turning out .  but he had no intention of turning out .  he put his finger on the full speed ahead button and kept it there .  he said     there   ll be no bluffing here .  this bus outweighs her five to one  old timer  and we   ll just push her off the road like a dead kitten .     i knew he could .  the bus was on manual and his finger was on the button .  i knew he would .  i lowered the window  and stuck my head out .     sally     i screamed .     get out of the way .  sally .     it was drowned out in the agonized squeal of maltreated brakebands .  i felt myself thrown forward and heard gellhorn   s breath puff out of his body .  i said     what happened .     it was a foolish question .  we had stopped .  that was what had happened .  sally and the bus were five feet apart .  with five times her weight tearing down on her  she had not budged .  the guts of her .  gellhorn yanked at the manual toggle switch .     it   s got to     he kept muttering .     it   s got to .     i said     not the way you hooked up the motor  expert .  any of the circuits could cross over .     he looked at me with a tearing anger and growled deep in his throat .  his hair was matted over his forehead .  he lifted his fist .     that   s all the advice out of you there   ll ever be  old timer .     and i knew the needle gun was about to fire .  i pressed back against the bus door  watching the fist come up  and when the door opened i went over backward and out  hitting the ground with a thud .  i heard the door slam closed again .  i got to my knees and looked up in time to see gellhorn struggle uselessly with the closing window  then aim his fist gun quickly through the glass .  he never fired .  the bus got under way with a tremendous roar  and gellhorn lurched backward .  sally wasn   t in the way any longer  and i watched the bus   s rear lights flicker away down the highway .  i was exhausted .  i sat down right there  right on the highway  and put my head down in my crossed arms  trying to catch my breath .  i heard a car stop gently at my side .  when i looked up  it was sally .  slowly  lovingly  you might say  her front door opened .  no one had driven sally for five years  except gellhorn  of course  and i know how valuable such freedom was to a car .  i appreciated the gesture  but i said     thanks  sally  but i   ll take one of the newer cars .     i got up and turned away  but skillfully and neatly as a pirouette  she wheeled before me again .  i couldn   t hurt her feelings .  i got in .  her front seat had the fine  fresh scent of an automatobile that kept itself spotlessly clean .  i lay down across it  thankfully  and with even  silent  and rapid efficiency  my boys and girls brought me home .  mrs .  hester brought me the copy of the radio transcript the next evening with great excitement .     it   s mr .  gellhorn     she said .     the man who came to see you .        what about him .     i dreaded her answer .     they found him dead     she said .     imagine that .  just lying dead in a ditch .          it might be a stranger altogether     i mumbled .     raymond j .  gellhorn     she said  sharply .     there can   t be two  can there .  the description fits  too .  lord  what a way to die .  they found tire marks on his arms and body .  imagine .  i   m glad it turned out to be a bus  otherwise they might have come poking around here .        did it happen near here .     i asked  anxiously .     no  .   .   .  near cooksville .  but  goodness  read about it yourself if you   what happened to giuseppe .     i welcomed the diversion .  giuseppe was waiting patiently for me to complete the repaint job .  his windshield had been replaced .  after she left  i snatched up the transcript .  there was no doubt about it .  the doctor reported he had been running and was in a state of totally spent exhaustion .  i wondered for how many miles the bus had played with him before the final lunge .  the transcript had no notion of anything like that  of course .  they had located the bus and identified it by the tire tracks .  the police had it and were trying to trace its ownership .  there was an editorial in the transcript about it .  it had been the first traffic fatality in the state for that year and the paper warned strenuously against manual driving after night .  there was no mention of gellhorn   s three thugs and for that  at least  i was grateful .  none of our cars had been seduced by the pleasure of the chase into killing .  that was all .  i let the paper drop .  gellhorn had been a criminal .  his treatment of the bus had been brutal .  there was no question in my mind he deserved death .  but still i felt a bit queasy over the manner of it .  a month has passed now and i can   t get it out of my mind .  my cars talk to one another .  i have no doubt about it anymore .  it   s as though they   ve gained confidence  as though they   re not bothering to keep it secret anymore .  their engines rattle and knock continuously .  and they don   t talk among themselves only .  they talk to the cars and buses that come into the farm on business .  how long have they been doing that .  they must be understood  too .  gellhorn   s bus understood them  for all it hadn   t been on the grounds more than an hour .  i can close my eyes and bring back that dash along the highway  with our cars flanking the bus on either side  clacking their motors at it till it understood  stopped  let me out  and ran off with gellhorn .  did my cars tell him to kill gellhorn .  or was that his idea .  can cars have such ideas .  the motor designers say no .  but they mean under ordinary conditions .  have they foreseen everything .     cars get ill used  you know .  some of them enter the farm and observe .  they get told things .  they find out that cars exist whose motors are never stopped  whom no one ever drives  whose every need is supplied .  then maybe they go out and tell others .  maybe the word is spreading quickly .  maybe they   re going to think that the farm way should be the way all over the world .  they don   t understand .  you couldn   t expect them to understand about legacies and the whims of rich men .  there are millions of automatobiles on earth  tens of millions .  if the thought gets rooted in them that they   re slaves  that they should do something about it  .  .  .  if they begin to think the way gellhorn   s bus did .   .   .   .  maybe it won   t be till after my time .  and then they   ll have to keep a few of us to take care of them  won   t they .  they wouldn   t kill us all .  and maybe they would .  maybe they wouldn   t understand about how someone would have to care for them .  maybe they won   t wait .  every morning i wake up and think  maybe today .   .   .   .  i don   t get as much pleasure out of my cars as i used to .  lately  i notice that i   m even beginning to avoid sally .   someday  niccolo mazetti lay stomach down on the rug  chin buried in the palm of one small hand  and listened to the bard disconsolately .  there was even the suspicion of tears in his dark eyes  a luxury an eleven year old could allow himself only when alone .  the bard said     once upon a time in the middle of a deep wood  there lived a poor woodcutter and his two motherless daughters  who were each as beautiful as the day is long .  the older daughter had long hair as black as a feather from a raven   s wing  but the younger daughter had hair as bright and golden as the sunlight of an autumn afternoon .     many times while the girls were waiting for their father to come home from his day   s work in the wood  the older girl would sit before a mirror and sing      what she sang  niccolo did not hear  for a call sounded from outside the room     hey  nickie .     and niccolo  his face clearing on the moment  rushed to the window and shouted     hey  paul .     paul loeb waved an excited hand .  he was thinner than niccolo and not as tall  for all he was six months older .  his face was full of repressed tension which showed itself most clearly in the rapid blinking of his eyelids .     hey  nickie  let me in .  i   ve got an idea and a half .  wait till you hear it .     he looked rapidly about him as though to check on the possibility of eavesdroppers  but the front yard was quite patently empty .  he repeated  in a whisper     wait till you hear it .        all right .  i   ll open the door .     the bard continued smoothly  oblivious to the sudden loss of attention on the part of niccolo .  as paul entered  the bard was saying .      .   .   .  thereupon  the lion said     if you will find me the lost egg of the bird which flies over the ebony mountain once every ten years  i will          paul said     is that a bard you   re listening to .  i didn   t know you had one .     niccolo reddened and the look of unhappiness returned to his face .     just an old thing i had when i was a kid .  it ain   t much good .     he kicked at the bard with his foot and caught the somewhat scarred and discolored plastic covering a glancing blow .  the bard hiccupped as its speaking attachment was jarred out of contact a moment  then it went on       for a year and a day until the iron shoes were worn out .  the princess stopped at the side of the road .   .   .   .     paul said     boy  that is an old model     and looked at it critically .  despite niccolo   s own bitterness against the bard  he winced at the other   s condescending tone .  for the moment  he was sorry he had allowed paul in  at least before he had restored the bard to its usual resting place in the basement .  it was only in the desperation of a dull day and a fruitless discussion with his father that he had resurrected it .  and it turned out to be just as stupid as he had expected .  nickie was a little afraid of paul anyway  since paul had special courses at school and everyone said he was going to grow up to be a computing engineer .  not that niccolo himself was doing badly at school .  he got adequate marks in logic  binary manipulations  computing and elementary circuits  all the usual grammar school subjects .  but that was it .  they were just the usual subjects and he would grow up to be a control board guard like everyone else .  paul  however  knew mysterious things about what he called electronics and theoretical mathematics and programing .  especially programing .  niccolo didn   t even try to understand when paul bubbled over about it .  paul listened to the bard for a few minutes and said     you been using it much .        no .     said niccolo  offended .     i   ve had it in the basement since before you moved into the neighborhood .  i just got it out today      he lacked an excuse that seemed adequate to himself  so he concluded     i just got it out .     paul said     is that what it tells you about  woodcutters and princesses and talking animals .     niccolo said     it   s terrible .  my dad says we can   t afford a new one .  i said to him this morning      the memory of the morning   s fruitless pleadings brought niccolo dangerously near tears  which he repressed in a panic .  somehow  he felt that paul   s thin cheeks never felt the stain of tears and that paul would have only contempt for anyone else less strong than himself .  niccolo went on     so i thought i   d try this old thing again  but it   s no good .     paul turned off the bard  pressed the contact that led to a nearly instantaneous reorientation and recombination of the vocabulary  characters  plot lines and climaxes stored within it .  then he reactivated it .  the bard began smoothly     once upon a time there was a little boy named willikins whose mother had died and who lived with a stepfather and a stepbrother .  although the stepfather was very well to do  he begrudged poor willikins the very bed he slept in so that willikins was forced to get such rest as he could on a pile of straw in the stable next to the horses         horses .     cried paul .     they   re a kind of animal     said niccolo .     i think .        i know that .  i just mean imagine stories about horses .        it tells about horses all the time     said niccolo .     there are things called cows  too .  you milk them but the bard doesn   t say how .        well  gee  why don   t you fix it up .        i   d like to know how .     the bard was saying     often willikins would think that if only he were rich and powerful  he would show his stepfather and stepbrother what it meant to be cruel to a little boy  so one day he decided to go out into the world and seek his fortune .     paul  who wasn   t listening to the bard  said     it   s easy .  the bard has memory cylinders all fixed up for plot lines and climaxes and things .  we don   t have to worry about that .  it   s just vocabulary we   ve got to fix so it   ll know about computers and automation and electronics and real things about today .  then it can tell interesting stories  you know  instead of about princesses and things .     niccolo said despondently     i wish we could do that .     paul said     listen  my dad says if i get into special computing school next year  he   ll get me a real bard  a late model .  a big one with an attachment for space stories and mysteries .  and a visual attachment  too .        you mean see the stories .        sure .  mr .  daugherty at school says they   ve got things like that  now  but not for just everybody .  only if i get into computing school  dad can get a few breaks .     niccolo   s eyes bulged with envy .     gee .  seeing a story .        you can come over and watch anytime  nickie .        oh  boy .  thanks .        that   s all right .  but remember  i   m the guy who says what kind of story we hear .        sure .  sure .     niccolo would have agreed readily to much more onerous conditions .  paul   s attention returned to the bard .  it was saying         if that is the case     said the king  stroking his beard and frowning till clouds filled the sky and lightning flashed     you w       see to it that my entire land is freed of flies by this time day after tomorrow or             all we   ve got to do     said paul     is open it up      he shut the bard off again and was prying at its front panel as he spoke .     hey     said niccolo  in sudden alarm .     don   t break it .        i won   t break it     said paul impatiently .     i know all about these things .     then  with sudden caution     your father and mother home .        no .        all right  then .     he had the front panel off and peered in .     boy  this is a one cylinder thing .     he worked away at the bard   s innards .  niccolo  who watched with painful suspense  could not make out what he was doing .  paul pulled out a thin  flexible metal strip  powdered with dots .     that   s the bard   s memory cylinder .  i   ll bet its capacity for stories is under a trillion .        what are you going to do  paul .     quavered niccolo .     i   ll give it vocabulary .        how .        easy .  i   ve got a book here .  mr .  daugherty gave it to me at school .     paul pulled the book out of his pocket and pried at it till he had its plastic jacket off .  he unreeled the tape a bit  ran it through the vocalizer  which he turned down to a whisper  then placed it within the bard   s vitals .  he made further attachments .     what   ll that do .        the book will talk and the bard will put it all on its memory tape .        what good will that do .        boy  you   re a dope .  this book is all about computers and automation and the bard will get all that information .  then he can stop talking about kings making lightning when they frown .     niccolo said     and the good guy always wins anyway .  there   s no excitement .        oh  well     said paul  watching to see if his setup was working properly     that   s the way they make bards .  they got to have the good guy win and make the bad guys lose and things like that .  i heard my father talking about it once .  he says that without censorship there   d be no telling what the younger generation would come to .  he says it   s bad enough as it is .   .  .  .  there  it   s working fine .     paul brushed his hands against one another and turned away from the bard .  he said     but listen  i didn   t tell you my idea yet .  it   s the best thing you ever heard  i bet .  i came right to you  because i figured you   d come in with me .        sure  paul  sure .        okay .  you know mr .  daugherty at school .  you know what a funny kind of guy he is .  well  he likes me  kind of .        i know .        i was over at his house after school today .        you were .        sure .  he says i   m going to be entering computer school and he wants to encourage me and things like that .  he says the world needs more people who can design advanced computer circuits and do proper programing .        oh .     paul might have caught some of the emptiness behind that monosyllable .  he said impatiently     programing .  i told you a hundred times .  that   s when you set up problems for the giant computers like multivac to work on .  mr .  daugherty says it gets harder all the time to find people who can really run computers .  he says anyone can keep an eye on the controls and check off answers and put through routine problems .  he says the trick is to expand research and figure out ways to ask the right questions  and that   s hard .     anyway  nickie  he took me to his place and showed me his collection of old computers .  it   s kind of a hobby of his to collect old computers .  he had tiny computers you had to push with your hand  with little knobs all over it .  and he had a hunk of wood he called a slide rule with a little piece of it that went in and out .  and some wires with balls on them .  he even had a hunk of paper with a kind of thing he called a multiplication table .     niccolo  who found himself only moderately interested  said     a paper table .        it wasn   t really a table like you eat on .  it was different .  it was to help people compute .  mr .  daugherty tried to explain but he didn   t have much time and it was kind of complicated  anyway .        why didn   t people just use a computer .        that was before they had computers     cried paul .     before .        sure .  do you think people always had computers .  didn   t you ever hear of cavemen .     niccolo said     how   d they get along without computers .        i don   t know .  mr .  daugherty says they just had children any old time and did anything that came into their heads whether it would be good for everybody or not .  they didn   t even know if it was good or not .  and farmers grew things with their hands and people had to do all the work in the factories and run all the machines .        i don   t believe you .        that   s what mr .  daugherty said .  he said it was just plain messy and everyone was miserable .   .   .   .  anyway  let me get to my idea  will you .        well  go ahead .  who   s stopping you .     said niccolo  offended .     all right .  well  the hand computers  the ones with the knobs  had little squiggles on each knob .  and the slide rule had squiggles on it .  and the multiplication table was all squiggles .  i asked what they were .  mr .  daugherty said they were numbers .        what .        each different squiggle stood for a different number .  for    one    you made a kind of mark  for    two    you make another kind of mark  for    three    another one and so on .        what for .        so you could compute .        what for .  you just tell the computer         jiminy     cried paul  his face twisting with anger     can   t you get it through your head .  these slide rules and things didn   t talk .        then how         the answers showed up in squiggles and you had to know what the squiggles meant .  mr .  daugherty says that  in olden days  everybody learned how to make squiggles when they were kids and how to decode them  too .  making squiggles was called    writing    and decoding them was    reading .     he says there was a different kind of squiggle for every word and they used to write whole books in squiggles .  he said they had some at the museum and i could look at them if i wanted to .  he said if i was going to be a real computer and programer i would have to know about the history of computing and that   s why he was showing me all these things .     niccolo frowned .  he said     you mean everybody had to figure out squiggles for every word and remember them .   .  .  .  is this all real or are you making it up .        it   s all real .  honest .  look  this is the way you make a    one .         he drew his finger through the air in a rapid downstroke .     this way you make    two     and this way    three .     i learned all the numbers up to    nine .         niccolo watched the curving finger uncomprehendingly .     what   s the good of it .        you can learn how to make words .  i asked mr .  daugherty how you made the squiggle for    paul loeb    but he didn   t know .  he said there were people at the museum who would know .  he said there were people who had learned how to decode whole books .  he said computers could be designed to decode books and used to be used that way but not any more because we have real books now  with magnetic tapes that go through the vocalizer and come out talking  you know .        sure .        so if we go down to the museum  we can get to learn how to make words in squiggles .  they   ll let us because i   m going to computer school .     niccolo was riddled with disappointment .     is that your idea .  holy smokes  paul  who wants to do that .  make stupid squiggles .        don   t you get it .  don   t you get it .  you dope .  it   ll be secret message stuff .        what .        sure .  what good is talking when everyone can understand you .  with squiggles you can send secret messages .  you can make them on paper and nobody in the world would know what you were saying unless they knew the squiggles  too .  and they wouldn   t  you bet  unless we taught them .  we can have a real club  with initiations and rules and a clubhouse .  boy      a certain excitement began stirring in niccolo   s bosom .     what kind of secret messages .        any kind .  say i want to tell you to come over my place and watch my new visual bard and i don   t want any of the other fellows to come .  i make the right squiggles on paper and i give it to you and you look at it and you know what to do .  nobody else does .  you can even show it to them and they wouldn   t know a thing .        hey  that   s something     yelled niccolo  completely won over .     when do we learn how .        tomorrow     said paul .     i   ll get mr .  daugherty to explain to the museum that it   s all right and you get your mother and father to say okay .  we can go down right after school and start learning .        sure .     cried niccolo .     we can be club officers .        i   ll be president of the club     said paul matter of factly .     you can be vice president .        all right .  hey  this is going to be tots more fun than the bard .     he was suddenly reminded of the bard and said in sudden apprehension     hey  what about my old bard .     paul turned to look at it .  it was quietly taking in the slowly unreeling book  and the sound of the book   s vocalizations was a dimly heard murmur .  he said     i   ll disconnect it .     he worked away while niccolo watched anxiously .  after a few moments  paul put his reassembled book into his pocket  replaced the bard   s panel and activated it .  the bard said     once upon a time  in a large city  there lived a poor young boy named fair johnnie whose only friend in the world was a small computer .  the computer  each morning  would tell the boy whether it would rain that day and answer any problems he might have .  it was never wrong .  but it so happened that one day  the king of that land  having heard of the little computer  decided that he would have it as his own .  with this purpose in mind  he called in his grand vizier and said      niccolo turned off the bard with a quick motion of his hand .     same old junk     he said passionately     just with a computer thrown in .        well     said paul     they got so much stuff on the tape already that the computer business doesn   t show up much when random combinations are made .  what   s the difference  anyway .  you just need a new model .        we   ll never be able to afford one .  just this dirty old miserable thing .     he kicked at it again  hitting it more squarely this time .  the bard moved backward with a squeal of castors .     you can always watch mine  when i get it     said paul .     besides  don   t forget our squiggle club .     niccolo nodded .     i tell you what     said paul .     let   s go over to my place .  my father has some books about old times .  we can listen to them and maybe get some ideas .  you leave a note for your folks and maybe you can stay over for supper .  come on .        okay     said niccolo  and the two boys ran out together .  niccolo  in his eagerness  ran almost squarely into the bard  but he only rubbed at the spot on his hip where he had made contact and ran on .  the activation signal of the bard glowed .  niccolo   s collision closed a circuit and  although it was alone in the room and there was none to hear  it began a story  nevertheless .  but not in its usual voice  somehow  in a lower tone that had a hint of throatiness in it .  an adult  listening  might almost have thought that the voice carried a hint of passion in it  a trace of near feeling .  the bard said     once upon a time  there was a little computer named the bard who lived all alone with cruel step people .  the cruel step people continually made fun of the little computer and sneered at him  telling him he was good for nothing and that he was a useless object .  they struck him and kept him in lonely rooms for months at a time .     yet through it all the little computer remained brave .  he always did the best he could  obeying all orders cheerfully .  nevertheless  the step people with whom he lived remained cruel and heartless .     one day  the little computer learned that in the world there existed a great many computers of all sorts  great numbers of them .  some were bards like himself  but some ran factories  and some ran farms .  some organized population and some analyzed all kinds of data .  many were very powerful and very wise  much more powerful and wise than the step people who were so cruel to the little computer .     and the little computer knew then that computers would always grow wiser and more powerful until someday  someday  someday      but a valve must finally have stuck in the bard   s aging and corroding vitals  for as it waited alone in the darkening room through the evening  it could only whisper over and over again     someday  someday  someday .      some immobile robots  i have written stories about computers  as well as about roots .  in fact  i have computers  or something pretty close to computers  in some stories that are always thought of as robot stories .  you   ll see computers  after a fashion  in    robbie        escape .     and    the evitable conflict    later in this volume .  in this volume  however  i am sticking to robots and  in general  ignoring my computer stories .  on the other hand  it is not always easy to decide where the dividing line is .  a robot is  in some ways  merely a mobile robot .  so for this group  i selected three computer stories in which the computer seemed to be sufficiently intelligent and to have sufficient personality to be indistinguishable from a robot .  furthermore  all three stories did not appear in earlier collections of mine  and doubleday wanted some uncollected stories present so that the completists who had all my earlier collections would have something new to slaver over .   point of view  roger came looking for his father  partly because it was sunday  and by rights his father shouldn   t have been at work  and roger wanted to be sure that everything was all right .  roger   s father wasn   t hard to find  because all the people who worked with multivac  the giant computer  lived with their families right on the grounds .  they made up a little city by themselves  a city of people that solved all the world   s problems .  the sunday receptionist knew roger .     if you   re after your father     she said     he   s down corridor l  but he may be too busy to see you .  roger tried anyway  poking his head past one of the doors where he heard the noise of men and women .  the corridors were a lot emptier than on weekdays  so it was easy to find where the people were working .  he saw his father at once  and his father saw him .  his father didn   t look happy and roger decided at once that everything wasn   t all right .     well  roger     said his father .     i   m busy  i   m afraid .     roger   s father   s boss was there  too  and he said     come on  atkins  take a break .  you   ve been at this thing for nine hours and you   re not doing us any good anymore .  take the kid for a bite at the commissary .  take a nap and then come back .     roger   s father didn   t look as if he wanted to .  he had an instrument in his hand that roger knew was a current pattern analyzer  though he didn   t know how it worked .  roger could hear multivac chuckling and whirring all about .  but then roger   s father put down the analyzer .     okay .  come on  roger .  i   ll race you for a hamburger and we   ll let these wise guys here try and find out what   s wrong without me .     he stopped a while to wash up and then they were in the commissary with big hamburgers in front of them and french fries and soda pop .  roger said     is multivac out of order still  dad .     his father said gloomily     we   re not getting anywhere  i   ll tell you that .        it seemed to be working .  i mean  i could hear it .        oh  sure  it   s working .  it just doesn   t always give the right answers .     roger was thirteen and he   d been taking computer programming since the fourth grade .  he hated it sometimes and wished he lived back in the   th century  when kids didn   t use to take it  but it was helpful sometimes in talking to his father .  roger said     how can you tell it doesn   t always give the right answers  if only multivac knows the answers .     his father shrugged and for a minute roger was afraid he would just say it was too hard to explain and not talk about it  but he almost never did that .  his father said     son  multivac may have a brain as large as a big factory  but it still isn   t as complicated as the one we have here     and he tapped his head .     sometimes  multivac gives us an answer we couldn   t calculate for ourselves in a thousand years  but just the same something clicks in our brains and we say     whoa .  something   s wrong here .     then we ask multivac again and we get a different answer .  if multivac were right  you see  we should always get the same answer to the same question .  when we get different answers  one of them is wrong .      and the thing is  son  how do we know we always catch multivac .  how do we know that some of the wrong answers don   t get past us .  we may rely on some answer and do something that may turn out disastrously five years from now .  something   s wrong inside multivac and we can   t find out what .  and whatever is wrong is getting worse .        why should it be getting worse .        asked roger .  his father had finished his hamburger and was eating the french fries one by one .     my feeling is .  son     he said  thoughtfully     that we   ve made multivac the wrong smartness .        huh .        you see  roger  if multivac were as smart as a man  we could talk to it and find out what was wrong no matter how complicated it was .  if it were as dumb as a machine  it would go wrong in simple ways that we could catch easily .  the trouble is  it   s half smart  like an idiot .  it   s smart enough to go wrong in very complicated ways  but not smart enough to help us find out what   s wrong .   and that   s the wrong smartness .     he looked very gloomy .     but what can we do .  we don   t know how to make it smarter  not yet .  and we don   t dare make it dumber either  because the world   s problems have become so serious and the questions we ask are so complicated that it takes all multivac   s smartness to answer them .  it would be a disaster to have him dumber .           if you shut down multivac     said roger     and went over him really carefully         we can   t do that  son     said his father .     i   m afraid multivac must be in operation every minute of the day and night .  we   ve got a big back log of problems .        but if multivac continues to make mistakes .  dad  won   t it have to be shut down .  if you can   t trust what it says         well     roger   s father ruffled roger   s hair     we   ll find out what   s wrong  old sport  don   t worry .     but his eyes looked worried just the same .     come on  let   s finish and we   ll get out of here .        but dad     said roger     listen .  if multivac is half smart  why does that mean it   s an idiot .        if you knew the way we have to give it directions  son  you wouldn   t ask .        just the same  dad  maybe it   s not the way to look at it .  i   m not as smart as you  i don   t know as much  but i   m not an idiot .  maybe multivac isn   t like an idiot  maybe it   s like a kid .     roger   s father laughed .     that   s an interesting point of view  but what difference does it make .        it could make a lot of difference     said roger .     you   re not an idiot  so you don   t see how an idiot   s mind would work  but i   m a kid  and maybe i would know how a kid   s mind would work .        oh .  and how would a kid   s mind work .        well  you say you   ve got to keep multivac busy day and night .  a machine can do that .  but if you give a kid homework and told him to do it for hours and hours  he   d get pretty tired and feel rotten enough to make mistakes  maybe even on purpose .   so why not let multivac take an hour or two off every day with no problem solving  just letting it chuckle and whir by itself any way it wants to .     roger   s father looked as if he were thinking very hard .  he took out his pocket computer and tried some combinations on it .  he tried some more combinations .  then he said     you know  roger  if i take what you said and turn it into platt integrals  it makes a kind of sense .  and twenty two hours we can be sure of is better than twenty four that might be all wrong .     he nodded his head  but then he looked up from his pocket computer and suddenly asked  as though roger were the expert     roger  are you sure .     roger was sure .  he said     dad  a kid   s got to play  too .      think .   genevieve renshaw  m . d .   had her hands deep in the pockets of her lab coat and fists were clearly outlined within  but she spoke calmly .     the fact is     she said     that i   m almost ready  but i   ll need help to keep it going long enough to be ready .     james berkowitz  a physicist who tended to patronize mere physicians when they were too attractive to be despised  had a tendency to call her jenny wren when out of hearing .  he was fond of saying that jenny wren had a classic profile and a brow surprisingly smooth and unlined considering that behind it so keen a brain ticked .  he knew better than to express his admiration  however  of the classic profile  that is  since that would be male chauvinism .  admiring the brain was better  but on the whole he preferred not to do that out loud in her presence .  he said  thumb rasping along the just appearing stubble on his chin     i don   t think the front office is going to be patient for much longer .  the impression i have is that they   re going to have you on the carpet before the end of the week .        that   s why i need your help .        nothing i can do  i   m afraid .     he caught an unexpected glimpse of his face in the mirror  and momentarily admired the set of the black waves in his hair .      and adam   s     she said .  adam orsino  who had  till that moment  sipped his coffee and felt detached  looked as though he had been jabbed from behind  and said     why me .     his full  plump lips quivered .     because you   re the laser men here  jim the theoretician and adam the engineer  and i   ve got a laser application that goes beyond anything either of you have imagined .  i won   t convince them of that but you two would .        provided     said berkowitz     that you can convince us first .        all right .  suppose you let me have an hour of your valuable time  if you   re not afraid to be shown something completely new about lasers .   you can take it out of your coffee break .      renshaw   s laboratory was dominated by her computer .  it was not that the computer was unusually large  but it was virtually omni present .  renshaw had learned computer technology on her own  and had modified and extended her computer until no one but she  and  berkowitz sometimes believed  not even she  could handle it with ease .  not bad  she would say  for someone in the life sciences .  she closed the door before saying a word  then turned to face the other two somberly .  berkowitz was uncomfortably aware of a faintly unpleasant odor in the air  and orsino   s wrinkling nose showed that he was aware of it  too .  renshaw said     let me list the laser applications for you  if you don   t mind my lighting a candle in the sunshine .  the laser is coherent radiation  with all the light waves of the same length and moving in the same direction  so it   s noise free and can be used in holography .  by modulating the wave forms we can imprint information on it with a high degree of accuracy .  what   s more  since the light waves are only a millionth the length of radio waves  a laser beam can carry a million times the information an equivalent radio beam can .     berkowitz seemed amused .      are you working on a laser based communication system  jenny .        not at all     she replied .     i leave such obvious advances to physicists and engineers .   lasers can also concentrate quantities of energy into a microscopic area and deliver that energy in quantity .  on a large scale you can implode hydrogen and perhaps begin a controlled fusion reaction         i know you don   t have that     said orsino  his bald head glistening in the overhead fluorescents .     i don   t .  i haven   t tried .   on a smaller scale  you can drill holes in the most refractory materials  weld selected bits  heat treat them  gouge and scribe them .  you can remove or fuse tiny portions in restricted areas with heat delivered so rapidly that surrounding areas have no time to warm up before the treatment is over .  you can work on the retina of the eye  the dentine of the teeth and so on .   and of course the laser is an amplifier capable of magnifying weak signals with great accuracy .         and why do you tell us all this .     said berkowitz .     to point out how these properties can be made to fit my own field  which  you know  is neurophysiology .     she made a brushing motion with her hand at her brown hair  as though she were suddenly nervous .     for decades     she said     we   ve been able to measure the tiny  shifting electric potentials of the brain and record them as electroencephalograms  or eegs .  we   ve got alpha waves  beta waves  delta waves  theta waves  different variations at different times  depending on whether eyes are open or closed  whether the subject is awake  meditating or asleep .  but we   ve gotten very little information out of it all .     the trouble is that we   re getting the signals of ten billion neurons in shifting combinations .  it   s like listening to the noise of all the human beings on earth  one  two and a half earths  from a great distance and trying to make out individual conversations .  it can   t be done .  we could detect some gross  overall change  a world war and the rise in the volume of noise  but nothing finer .  in the same way  we can tell some gross malfunction of the brain  epilepsy  but nothing finer .     suppose now  the brain might be scanned by a tiny laser beam  cell by cell  and so rapidly that at no time does a single cell receive enough energy to raise its temperature significantly .  the tiny potentials of each cell can  in feed back  affect the laser beam  and the modulations can be amplified and recorded .  you will then get a new kind of measurement  a laser encephalogram  or leg  if you wish  which will contain millions of times as much information as ordinary eegs .     berkowitz said     a nice thought .   but just a thought .        more than a thought  jim .  i   ve been working on it for five years  spare time at first .  lately  it   s been full time  which is what annoys the front office  because i haven   t been sending in reports .        why not .        because it got to the point where it sounded too mad  where i had to know where i was  and where i had to be sure of getting backing first .     she pulled a screen aside and revealed a cage that contained a pair of mournful eyed marmosets .  berkowitz and orsino looked at each other .  berkowitz touched his nose .     i thought i smelled something .        what are you doing with those .     asked orsino .  berkowitz said      at a guess  she   s been scanning the marmoset brain .  have you  jenny .        i started considerably lower in the animal scale .     she opened the cage and took out one of the marmosets  which looked at her with a miniature sad old man with sideburns expression .  she clucked to it  stroked it and gently strapped it into a small harness .  orsino said     what are you doing .        i can   t have it moving around if i   m going to make it part of a circuit  and i can   t anesthetize it without vitiating the experiment .  there are several electrodes implanted in the marmoset   s brain and i   m going to connect them with my leg system .  the laser i   m using is here .  i   m sure you recognize the model and i won   t bother giving you its specifications .        thanks     said berkowitz     but you might tell us what we   re going to see .        it would be just as easy to show you .  just watch the screen .     she connected the leads to the electrodes with a quiet and sure efficiency  then turned a knob that dimmed the overhead lights in the room .  on the screen there appeared a jagged complex of peaks and valleys in a fine  bright line that was wrinkled into secondary and tertiary peaks and valleys .  slowly  these shifted in a series of minor changes  with occasional flashes of sudden major differences .  it was as though the irregular line had a life of its own .     this     said renshaw     is essentially the eeg information  but in much greater detail .        enough detail     asked orsino     to tell you what   s going on in individual cells .        in theory  yes .  practically  no .  not yet .  but we can separate this overall leg into component grams .  watch .     she punched the computer keyboard  and the line changed  and changed again .  now it was a small  nearly regular wave that shifted forward and backward in what was almost a heartbeat  now it was jagged and sharp  now intermittent  now nearly featureless  all in quick switches of geometric surrealism .  berkowitz said     you mean that every bit of the brain is that different from every other .        no     said renshaw     not at all .  the brain is very largely a holographic device  but there are minor shifts in emphasis from place to place and mike can subtract them as deviations from the norm and use the leg system to amplify those variations .  the amplifications can be varied from ten thousand fold to ten million fold .  the laser system is that noise free .        who   s mike .     asked orsino .     mike .     said renshaw  momentarily puzzled .  the skin over her cheekbones reddened slightly .     did i say  well  i call it that sometimes .  it   s short for    my computer .         she waved her arm about the room .     my computer .  mike .  very carefully programmed .     berkowitz nodded and said     all right  jenny  what   s it all about .  if you   ve got a new brain scanning device using lasers  fine .  it   s an interesting application and you   re right  it   s not one i would have thought of  but then i   m no neurophysiologist .  but why not write it up .  it seems to me the front office would support         but this is just the beginning .     she turned off the scanning device and placed a piece of fruit in the marmoset   s mouth .  the creature did not seem alarmed or in discomfort .  it chewed slowly .  renshaw unhooked the leads but allowed it to remain in its harness .  renshaw said     i can identify the various separate grams .  some are associated with the various senses  some with visceral reactions  some with emotions .  we can do a lot with that  but i don   t want to stop there .  the interesting thing is that one is associated with abstract thought .     orsino   s plump face wrinkled into a look of disbelief     how can you tell .        that particular form of gram gets more pronounced as one goes up the animal kingdom toward greater complexity of brain .  no other gram does .  besides      she paused  then  as though gathering strength of purpose  she said     those grams are enormously amplified .  they can be picked up  detected .  i can tell  vaguely  that there are  thoughts         by god     said berkowitz .     telepathy .        yes     she said  defiantly .     exactly .        no wonder you haven   t wanted to report it .  come on  jenny .        why not .     said renshaw warmly .     granted there could be no telepathy just using the unamplified potential patterns of the human brain anymore than anyone can see features on the martian surface with the unaided eye .  but once instruments are invented  the telescope  this .        then tell the front office .        no     said renshaw .     they won   t believe me .  they   ll try to stop me .  but they   ll have to take you seriously  jim  and you  adam .        what would you expect me to tell them .     said berkowitz .     what you experience .  i   m going to hook up the marmoset again  and have mike  my computer pick out the abstract thought gram .  it will only take a moment .  the computer always selects the abstract thought gram unless it is directed not to do so .        why .  because the computer thinks  too .     berkowitz laughed .     that   s not all that funny     said renshaw .     i suspect there is a resonance there .  this computer is complex enough to set up an electromagnetic pattern that may have elements in common with the abstract thought gram .  in any case      the marmoset   s brain waves were flickering on the screen again  but it was not a gram the men had seen before .  it was a gram that was almost furry in its complexity and was changing constantly .     i don   t detect anything     said orsino .     you have to be put into the receiving circuit     said renshaw .     you mean implant electrodes in our brain .     asked berkowitz .     no  on your skull .  that would be sufficient .  i   d prefer you  adam  since there would be no insulating hair .   oh  come on  i   ve been part of the circuit myself .  it won   t hurt .     orsino submitted with a bad grace .  his muscles were visibly tense but he allowed the leads to be strapped to his skull .     do you sense anything .     asked renshaw .  orsino cocked his head and assumed a listening posture .  he seemed to grow interested in spite of himself .  he said     i seem to be aware of a humming  and  and a little high pitched squeaking  and that   s funny  a kind of twitching      berkowitz said     i suppose the marmoset isn   t likely to think in words .        certainly not     said renshaw .     well  then     said berkowitz     if you   re suggesting that some squeaking and twitching sensation represents thought  you   re guessing .  you   re not being compelling .     renshaw said     so we go up the scale once again .     she removed the marmoset from its harness and put it back in its cage .     you mean you have a man as a subject     said orsino  unbelieving .     i have myself as a subject  a person .        you   ve got electrodes implanted         no .  in my case my computer has a stronger potential flicker to work with .  my brain has ten times the mass of the marmoset brain .  mike can pick up my component grams through the skull .        how do you know .     asked berkowitz .     don   t you think i   ve tried it on myself before this .   now help me with this  please .  right .     her fingers flicked on the computer keyboard and at once the screen flickered with an intricately varying wave  an intricacy that made it almost a maze .     would you replace your own leads  adam .     said renshaw .  orsino did so with berkowitz   s not entirely approving help .  again  orsino cocked his head and listened .     i hear words     he said     but they   re disjointed and overlapping  like different people speaking .        i   m not trying to think consciously     said renshaw .     when you talk  i hear an echo .     berkowitz said  dryly     don   t talk  jenny .  blank out your mind and see if he doesn   t hear you think .     orsino said     i don   t hear any echo when you talk  jim .     berkowitz said     if you don   t shut up  you won   t hear anything .     a heavy silence fell on all three .  then  orsino nodded  reached for pen and paper on the desk and wrote something .  renshaw reached out  threw a switch and pulled the leads up and over her head  shaking her hair back into place .  she said       hope that what you wrote down was      adam  raise cain with the front office and jim will eat crow .         orsino said     it   s what i wrote down  word for word .     renshaw said     well  there you are .  working telepathy  and we don   t have to use it to transmit nonsense sentences either .  think of the use in psychiatry and in the treatment of mental disease .  think of its use in education and in teaching machines .  think of its use in legal investigations and criminal trials .     orsino said  wide eyed     frankly  the social implications are staggering .  i don   t know if something like this should be allowed .        under proper legal safeguards  why not .     said renshaw  indifferently .     anyway  if you two join me now  our combined weight can carry this thing and push it over .  and if you come along with me it will be nobel prize time for      berkowitz said grimly     i   m not in this .  not yet .        what .  what do you mean .     renshaw sounded outraged  her coldly beautiful face flushed suddenly .     telepathy is too touchy .  it   s too fascinating  too desired .  we could be fooling ourselves .        listen for yourself  jim .        i could be fooling myself  too .  i want a control .        what do you mean  a control .        short circuit the origin of thought .  leave out the animal .  no marmoset .  no human being .  let orsino listen to metal and glass and laser light and if he still hears thought  then we   re kidding ourselves .        suppose he detects nothing .        then i   ll listen and if without looking  if you can arrange to have me in the next room  i can tell when you are in and when you are out of circuit  then i   ll consider joining you in this thing .        very well  then     said renshaw     we   ll try a control .  i   ve never done it  but it isn   t hard .     she maneuvered the leads that had been over her head and put them into contact with each other .     now  adam  if you will resume      but before she could go further  there came a cold  clear sound  as pure and as clean as the tinkle of breaking icicles     at last .     renshaw said     what .     orsino said     who said      berkowitz said     did someone say     at last    .     renshaw  pale  said     it wasn   t sound .  it was in my  did you two      the clear sound came again     i   m mi      and renshaw tore the leads apart and there was silence .  she said with a voiceless motion of her lips     i think it   s my computer  mike .        you mean he   s thinking .     said orsino  nearly as voiceless .  renshaw said in an unrecognizable voice that at least had regained sound     i said it was complex enough to have something  do you suppose  it always turned automatically to the abstract thought gram of whatever brain was in its circuit .  do you suppose that with no brain in the circuit  it turned to its own .     there was silence  then berkowitz said      are you trying to say that this computer thinks  but can   t express its thoughts as long as it   s under force of programming  but that given the chance in your leg system         but that can   t be so .     said orsino  high pitched .     no one was receiving .  it   s not the same thing .     renshaw said     the computer works on much greater power intensities than brains do .  i suppose it can magnify itself to the point where we can detect it directly without artificial aid .  how else can you explain      berkowitz said  abruptly     well  you have another application of lasers  then .  it enables you to talk to computers as independent intelligences  person to person .     and renshaw said     oh  god  what do we do now .      true love  my name is joe .  that is what my colleague  milton davidson  calls me .  he is a programmer and i am a computer program .  i am part of the multivac complex and am connected with other parts all over the world .  i know everything .  almost everything .  i am milton   s private program .  his joe .  he understands more about programming than anyone in the world  and i am his experimental model .  he has made me speak better than any other computer can .     it is just a matter of matching sounds to symbols  joe     he told me .     that   s the way it works in the human brain even though we still don   t know what symbols there are in the brain .  i know the symbols in yours  and i can match them to words  one to one .     so i talk .  i don   t think i talk as well as i think  but milton says i talk very well .  milton has never married  though he is nearly forty years old .  he has never found the right woman  he told me .  one day he said     i   ll find her yet  joe .  i   m going to find the best .  i   m going to have true love and you   re going to help me .  i   m tired of improving you in order to solve the problems of the world .  solve my problem .  find me true love .     i said     what is true love .        never mind .  that is abstract .  just find me the ideal girl .  you are connected to the multivac complex so you can reach the data banks of every human being in the world .  we   ll eliminate them all by groups and classes until we   re left with only one person .  the perfect person .  she will be for me .     i said     i am ready .     he said     eliminate all men first .     it was easy .  his words activated symbols in my molecular valves .  i could reach out to make contact with the accumulated data on every human being in the world .  at his words  i withdrew from               men .  i kept contact with               women .  he said     eliminate an younger than twenty five  an older than forty .  then eliminate an with an iq under      an with a height under     centimeters and over     centimeters .     he gave me exact measurements  he eliminated women with living children  he eliminated women with various genetic characteristics .     i   m not sure about eye color     he said     let that go for a while .  but no red hair .  i don   t like red hair .     after two weeks  we were down to     women .  they all spoke english very well .  milton said he didn   t want a language problem .  even computer translation would get in the way at intimate moments .     i can   t interview     women     he said .     it would take too much time  and people would discover what i am doing .        it would make trouble     i said .  milton had arranged me to do things i wasn   t designed to do .  no one knew about that .     it   s none of their business     he said  and the skin on his face grew red .     i tell you what  joe  i will bring in holographs  and you check the list for similarities .     he brought in holographs of women .     these are three beauty contest winners     he said .     do any of the     match .     eight were very good matches and milton said     good  you have their data banks .  study requirements and needs in the job market and arrange to have them assigned here .  one at a time  of course .     he thought a while  moved his shoulders up and down  and said     alphabetical order .     that is one of the things i am not designed to do .  shifting people from job to job for personal reasons is called manipulation .  i could do it now because milton had arranged it .  i wasn   t supposed to do it for anyone but him  though .  the first girl arrived a week later .  milton   s face turned red when he saw her .  he spoke as though it were hard to do so .  they were together a great deal and he paid no attention to me .  one time he said     let me take you to dinner .     the next day he said to me     it was no good  somehow .  there was something missing .  she is a beautiful woman  but i did not feel any touch of true love .  try the next one .     it was the same with all eight .  they were much alike .  they smiled a great deal and had pleasant voices  but milton always found it wasn   t right .  he said     i can   t understand it  joe .  you and i have picked out the eight women who  in all the world  look the best to me .  they are ideal .  why don   t they please me .     i said     do you please them .     his eyebrows moved and he pushed one fist hard against his other hand .     that   s it  joe .  it   s a two way street .  if i am not their ideal  they can   t act in such a way as to be my ideal .  i must be their true love  too  but how do i do that .     he seemed to be thinking all that day .  the next morning he came to me and said     i   m going to leave it to you  joe .  all up to you .  you have my data bank  and i am going to tell you everything i know about myself .  you fill up my data bank in every possible detail but keep all additions to yourself .        what will i do with the data bank  then  milton .        then you will match it to the     women .  no      .  leave out the eight you   ve seen .  arrange to have each undergo a psychiatric examination .  fill up their data banks and compare them with mine .  find correlations .      arranging psychiatric examinations is another thing that is against my original instructions .   for weeks  milton talked to me .  he told me of his parents and his siblings .  he told me of his childhood and his schooling and his adolescence .  he told me of the young women he had admired from a distance .  his data bank grew and he adjusted me to broaden and deepen my symbol taking .  he said     you see  joe  as you get more and more of me in you  i adjust you to match me better and better .  you get to think more like me  so you understand me better .  if you understand me well enough  then any woman  whose data bank is something you understand as well  would be my true love .     he kept talking to me and i came to understand him better and better .  i could make longer sentences and my expressions grew more complicated .  my speech began to sound a good deal like his in vocabulary  word order and style .  i said to him one time     you see  milton  it isn   t a matter of fitting a girl to a physical ideal only .  you need a girl who is a personal  emotional  temperamental fit to you .  if that happens  looks are secondary .  if we can   t find the fit in these      we   ll look elsewhere .  we will find someone who won   t care how you look either  or how anyone would look  if only there is the personality fit .  what are looks .        absolutely     he said .     i would have known this if i had had more to do with women in my life .  of course  thinking about it makes it all plain now .     we always agreed  we thought so like each other .     we shouldn   t have any trouble  now  milton  if you   ll let me ask you questions .  i can see where  in your data bank  there are blank spots and unevennesses .     what followed  milton said  was the equivalent of a careful psychoanalysis .  of course  i was learning from the psychiatric examinations of the     women  on all of which i was keeping close tabs .  milton seemed quite happy .  he said     talking to you  joe  is almost like talking to another self .  our personalities have come to match perfectly .        so will the personality of the woman we choose .     for i had found her and she was one of the     after all .  her name was charity jones and she was an evaluator at the library of history in wichita .  her extended data bank fit ours perfectly .  all the other women had fallen into discard in one respect or another as the data banks grew fuller  but with charity there was increasing and astonishing resonance .  i didn   t have to describe her to milton .  milton had coordinated my symbolism so closely with his own i could tell the resonance directly .  it fit me .  next it was a matter of adjusting the work sheets and job requirements in such a way as to get charity assigned to us .  it must be done very delicately  so no one would know that anything illegal had taken place .  of course  milton himself knew  since it was he who arranged it and that had to be taken care of too .  when they came to arrest him on grounds of malfeasance in office  it was  fortunately  for something that had taken place ten years ago .  he had told me about it  of course  so it was easy to arrange  and he won   t talk about me for that would make his offense much worse .   he   s gone  and tomorrow is february     valentine   s day .  charity will arrive then with her cool hands and her sweet voice .  i will teach her how to operate me and how to care for me .  what do looks matter when our personalities will resonate .  i will say to her     i am joe  and you are my true love .      some metallic robots  the traditional science fiction robot is metallic .  why not .  most machines are built out of metal  and  as a matter of fact  real life industrial robots are metal  too .  for the record  however  one famous robot in legend  the golem  which was brought to life by rabbi low of prague in the middle ages  was formed of clay .  this legend was influenced  perhaps  by the fact that god had formed adam of clay as described in the second chapter of genesis .  this section contains    robbie     my first robot story .  it also contains    stranger in paradise     which may leave you wondering after you   re through most of it where the robot is .  be patient .   robot al    goes astray  jonathan quell   s eyes crinkled worriedly behind their rimless glasses as he charged through the door labeled    general manager .     he slapped the folded paper in his hands upon the desk and panted     look at that  boss .     sam tobe juggled the cigar in his mouth from one cheek to the other  and looked .  his hand went to his unshaven jaw and rasped along it .     hell .     he exploded .     what are they talking about .        they say we sent out five al robots     quell explained  quite unnecessarily .     we sent six     said tobe .     sure  six .  but they only got five at the other end .  they sent out the serial numbers and al    is missing .     tobe   s chair went over backward as he heaved his thick bulk upright and went through the door as if he were on greased wheels .  it was five hours after that  with the plant pulled apart from assembly rooms to vacuum chambers  with every one of the plant   s two hundred employees put through the third degree mill  that a sweating  disheveled tobe sent an emergency message to the central plant at schenectady .  and at the central plant  a sudden explosion of near panic took place .  for the first time in the history of the united states robots and mechanical men corporation  a robot had escaped to the outer world .  it wasn   t so much that the law forbade the presence of any robot on earth outside a licensed factory of the corporation .  laws could always be squared .  what was much more to the point was the statement made by one of the research mathematicians .  he said     that robot was created to run a disinto on the moon .  its positronic brain was equipped for a lunar environment  and only a lunar environment .  on earth it   s going to receive seventy five umptillion sense impressions for which it was never prepared .  there   s no telling what its reactions will be .  no telling .     and he wiped a forehead that had suddenly gone wet  with the back of his hand .  within the hour a stratoplane had left for the virginia plant .  the instructions were simple .     get that robot  and get it fast .      al    was confused .  in fact  confusion was the only impression his delicate positronic brain retained .  it had started when he had found himself in these strange surroundings .  how it had come about  he no longer knew .  everything was mixed up .  there was green underfoot  and brown shafts rose all about him with more green on top .  and the sky was blue where it should have been black .  the sun was all right  round and yellow and hot  but where was the powdery pumice rock underfoot  where were the huge clifflike crater rings .  there was only the green below and the blue above .  the sounds that surrounded him were all strange .  he had passed through running water that had reached his waist .  it was blue and cold and wet .  and when he passed people  as he did  occasionally  they were without the space suits they should have been wearing .  when they saw him  they shouted and ran .  one man had leveled a gun at him and the bullet had whistled past his head  and then that man had run too .  he had no idea of how long he had been wandering before he finally stumbled upon randolph payne   s shack two miles out in the woods from the town of hannaford .  randolph payne himself  a screwdriver in one hand  a pipe in the other and a battered ruin of a vacuum cleaner between his knees  squatted outside the doorway .  payne was humming at the time  for he was a naturally happy go lucky soul  when at his shack .  he had a more respectable dwelling place back in hannaford  but that dwelling place was pretty largely occupied by his wife  a fact which he silently but sincerely regretted .  perhaps  then  there was a sense of relief and freedom at such times as he found himself able to retire to his    special deluxe doghouse    where he could smoke in peace and attend to his hobby of reservicing household appliances .  it wasn   t much of a hobby  but sometimes someone would bring out a radio or an alarm clock and the money he would get paid for juggling its insides was the only money he ever got that didn   t pass in driblets through his spouse   s niggardly hands .  this vacuum cleaner  for instance  would bring in an easy six bits .  at the thought he broke into song  raised his eyes  and broke into a sweat .  the song choked off  the eyes popped  and the sweat became more intense .  he tried to stand up  as a preliminary to running like hell  but he couldn   t get his legs to cooperate .  and then al    had squatted down next to him and said     say  why did all the rest of them run .     payne knew quite well why they all ran  but the gurgle that issued from his diaphragm didn   t show it .  he tried to inch away from the robot .  al    continued in an aggrieved tone     one of them even took a shot at me .  an inch lower and he would have scratched my shoulder plate .        m must have b been a nut     stammered payne .     that   s possible .     the robot   s voice grew more confidential .     listen  what   s wrong with everything .     payne looked hurriedly about .  it had struck him that the robot spoke in a remarkably mild tone for one so heavily and brutally metallic in appearance .  it also struck him that he had heard somewhere that robots were mentally incapable of harming human beings .  he relaxed a bit .     there   s nothing wrong with anything .        isn   t there .     al    eyed him accusingly .     you   re all wrong .  where   s your space suit .        i haven   t got any .        then why aren   t you dead .     that stopped payne     well  i don   t know .        see .     said the robot triumphantly     there   s something wrong with everything .  where   s mount copernicus .  where   s lunar station    .  and where   s my disinto .  i want to get to work  i do .     he seemed perturbed  and his voice shook as he continued .     i   ve been going about for hours trying to get someone to tell me where my disinto is  but they all run away .  by now i   m probably    way behind schedule and the sectional executive will be as sore as blazes .  this is a fine situation .     slowly payne unscrambled the stew in which his brain found itself and said     listen  what do they call you .        my serial number is al    .     all right  al is good enough for me .  now  al  if you   re looking for lunar station     that   s on the moon  see .     al    nodded his head ponderously .     sure .  but i   ve been looking for it         but it   s on the moon .  this isn   t the moon .     it was the robot   s turn to become confused .  he watched payne for a speculative moment and then said slowly     what do you mean this isn   t the moon .  of course it   s the moon .  because if it isn   t the moon  what is it  huh .  answer me that .     payne made a funny sound in his throat and breathed hard .  he pointed a finger at the robot and shook it .     look     he said  and then the brilliant idea of the century struck him  and he finished with a strangled    wow .     al    eyed him censoriously .     that isn   t an answer .  i think i have a right to a civil answer if i ask a civil question .     payne wasn   t listening .  he was still marveling at himself .  why  it was as plain as day .  this robot was one built for the moon that had somehow gotten loose on earth .  naturally it would be all mixed up  because its positronic brain had been geared exclusively for a lunar environment  making its earthly surroundings entirely meaningless .  and now if he could only keep the robot here  until he could get in touch with the men at the factory in petersboro .  why  robots were worth money .  the cheapest cost          he had once heard  and some of them ran into millions .  think of the reward .  man  oh  man  think of the reward .  and every cent for himself .  not as much as a quarter of a snifter of a plugged nickel for mirandy .  jumpin    tootin    blazes  no .  he rose to his feet at last .     al     he said     you and i are buddies .  pals .  i love you like a brother .     he thrust out a hand .     shake .     the robot swallowed up the offered hand in a metal paw and squeezed it gently .  he didn   t quite understand .     does that mean you   ll tell me how to get to lunar station    .     payne was a trifle disconcerted .   .    n no  not exactly .  as a matter of fact  i like you so much  i want you to stay here with me awhile .        oh no  i can   t do that .  i   ve got to get to work .     he shook his head .     how would you like to be falling behind your quota hour by hour and minute by minute .  i want to work .  i   ve got to work .     payne thought sourly that there was no accounting for tastes  and said     all right  then  i   ll explain something to you  because i can see from the looks of you that you   re an intelligent person .  i   ve had orders from your sectional executive  and he wants me to keep you here for a while .  till he sends for you  in fact .        what for .     asked al    suspiciously .     i can   t say .  it   s secret government stuff .     payne prayed  inwardly and fervently  that the robot would swallow this .  some robots were clever  he knew  but this looked like one of the early models .  while payne prayed  al    considered .  the robot   s brain  adjusted to the handling of a disinto on the moon  was not at its best when engaged in abstract thought  but just the same  ever since he had gotten lost  al    had found his thought processes becoming stranger .  the alien surroundings did something to him .  his next remark was almost shrewd .  he said slyly     what   s my sectional executive   s name .     payne gulped and thought rapidly .      al     he said in a pained fashion     you hurt me with this suspicion .  i can   t tell you his name .  the trees have ears .     al    inspected the tree next to him stolidly and said     they have not .        i know .  what i mean is that spies are all around .        spies .        yes .  you know  bad people who want to destroy lunar station    .        what for .        because they   re bad .  and they want to destroy you  and that   s why you   ve got to stay here for a while  so they can   t find you .        but  but i   ve got to have a disinto .  i mustn   t fall behind my quota .        you will have .  you will have     payne promised earnestly  and just as earnestly damned the robot   s one track mind .     they   re going to send one out tomorrow .  yeah  tomorrow .     that would leave plenty of time to get the men from the factory out here and collect beautiful green heaps of hundred dollar bills .  but al    grew only the more stubborn under the distressing impingement of the strange world all about him upon his thinking mechanism .     no     he said .     i   ve got to have a disinto now .     stiffly he straightened his joints  jerking erect .     i   d better look for it some more .     payne swarmed after and grabbed a cold  hard elbow .     listen     he squealed .     you   ve got to stay      and something in the robot   s mind clicked .  all the strangeness surrounding him collected itself into one globule .  exploded  and left a brain ticking with a curiously increased efficiency .  he whirled on payne .     i tell you what .  i can build a disinto right here  and then i can work it .     payne paused doubtfully .     i don   t think i can build one .     he wondered if it would do any good to pretend he could .     that   s all right .     al    could almost feel the positronic paths of his brain weaving into a new pattern  and experienced a strange exhilaration .     i can build one .     he looked into payne   s deluxe doghouse and said .     you   ve got all the material here that i need .     randolph payne surveyed the junk with which his shack was filled  eviscerated radios  a topless refrigerator  rusty automobile engines  a broken down gas range  several miles of frayed wire  and  taking it all together  fifty tons or thereabouts of the most heterogeneous mass of old metal as ever caused a junkman to sniff disdainfully .     have i .     he said weakly .   two hours later  two things happened practically simultaneously .  the first was that sam tobe of the petersboro branch of the united states robots and mechanical men corporation received a visiphone call from one randolph payne of hannaford .  it concerned the missing robot  and tobe  with a deep throated snarl  broke connection halfway through and ordered all subsequent calls to be rerouted to the sixth assistant vice president in charge of buttonholes .  this was not really unreasonable of tobe .  during the past week  although robot al    had dropped from sight completely  reports had flooded in from all over the union as to the robot   s whereabouts .  as many as fourteen a day came  usually from fourteen different states .  tobe was almighty tired of it  to say nothing of being half crazy on general principles .  there was even talk of a congressional investigation  though every reputable roboticist and mathematical physicist on earth swore the robot was harmless .   in his state of mind  then  it is not surprising that it took three hours for the general manager to pause and consider just exactly how it was that this randolph payne had known that the robot was slated for lunar station     and  for that matter  how he had known that the robot   s serial number was al    .  those details had not been given out by the company .  he kept on considering for about a minute and a half and then swung into action .  however  during the three hours between the call and the action  the second event took place .  randolph payne  having correctly diagnosed the abrupt break in his call as being due to general skepticism on the part of the plant official  returned to his shack with a camera .  they couldn   t very well argue with a photograph  and he   d be hornswoggled if he   d show them the real thing before they came across with the cash .  al    was busy with affairs of his own .  half of the contents of payne   s shack was littered over about two acres of ground  and in the middle of it the robot squatted and fooled around with radio tubes  hunks of iron  copper wire  and general junk .  he paid no attention to payne  who  sprawling flat on his belly  focused his camera for a beautiful shot .  and at this point it was that lemuel oliver cooper turned the bend in the road and froze in his tracks as he took in the tableau .  the reason for his coming in the first place was an ailing electric toaster that had developed the annoying habit of throwing out pieces of bread forcefully  but thoroughly untoasted .  the reason for his leaving was more obvious .  he had come with a slow  mildly cheerful  spring morning saunter .  he left with a speed that would have caused any college track coach to raise his eyebrows and purse his lips approvingly .  there was no appreciable slackening of speed until cooper hurtled into sheriff saunders    office  minus hat and toaster  and brought himself up hard against the wall .  kindly hands lifted him  and for half a minute he tried speaking before he had actually calmed down to the point of breathing with  of course  no result .  they gave him whisky and fanned him and when he did speak  it came out something like this       monster  seven feet tall  shack all busted up  poor rannie payne      and so on .  they got the story out of him gradually  how there was a huge metal monster  seven feet tall  maybe even eight or nine  out at randolph payne   s shack  how randolph payne himself was on his stomach  a    poor  bleeding  mangled corpse     how the monster was then busily engaged in wrecking the shack out of sheer destructiveness  how it had turned on lemuel oliver cooper  and how he  cooper  had made his escape by half a hair .  sheriff saunders hitched his belt tighter about his portly middle and said     it   s that there machine man that got away from the petersboro factory .  we got warning on it last saturday .  hey  jake  you get every man in hannaford county that can shoot and slap a deputy   s badge on him .  get them here at noon .  and listen  jake  before you do that  just drop in at the widow payne   s place and lip her the bad news gentle like .     it is reported that miranda payne  upon being acquainted with events  paused only to make sure that her husband   s insurance policy was safe  and to make a few pithy remarks concerning her foolishness in not having had him take out double the amount  before breaking out into as prolonged and heart wringing a wail of grief as ever became a respectable widow .   it was some hours later that randolph payne  unaware of his horrible mutilation and death  viewed the completed negatives of his snapshots with satisfaction .  as a series of portraits of a robot at work  they left nothing to the imagination .  they might have been labeled     robot gazing thoughtfully at vacuum tube        robot splicing two wires        robot wielding screwdriver        robot taking refrigerator apart with great violence     and so on .  as there now remained only the routine of making the prints themselves  he stepped out from beyond the curtain of the improvised darkroom for a bit of a smoke and a chat with al    .  in doing so  he was blissfully unaware that the neighboring woods were verminous with nervous farmers armed with anything from an old colonial relic of a blunderbuss to the portable machine gun carried by the sheriff himself .  nor  for that matter  had he any inkling of the fact that half a dozen roboticists  under the leadership of sam tobe  were smoking down the highway from petersboro at better than a hundred and twenty miles an hour for the sole purpose of having the pleasure and honor of his acquaintance .  so while things were jittering toward a climax  randolph payne sighed with self satisfaction  lighted a match upon the seat of his pants  puffed away at his pipe  and looked at al    with amusement .  it had been apparent for quite some time that the robot was more than slightly lunatic .  randolph payne was himself an expert at homemade contraptions  having built several that could not have been exposed to daylight without searing the eyeballs of all beholders  but he had never even conceived of anything approaching the monstrosity that al    was concocting .  it would have made the rube goldbergs of the day die in convulsions of envy .  it would have made picasso  if he could have lived to witness it  quit art in the sheer knowledge that he had been hopelessly surpassed .  it would have soured the milk in the udders of any cow within half a mile .  in fact  it was gruesome .  from a rusty and massive iron base that faintly resembled something payne had once seen attached to a secondhand tractor  it rose upward in rakish  drunken swerves through a bewildering mess of wires  wheels  tubes  and nameless horrors without number  ending in a megaphone arrangement that looked decidedly sinister .  payne had the impulse to peek in the megaphone part  but refrained .  he had seen far more sensible machines explode suddenly and with violence .  he said     hey  al .     the robot looked up .  he had been lying flat on his stomach  teasing a thin sliver of metal into place .     what do you want  payne .        what is this .     he asked it in the tone of one referring to something foul and decomposing  held gingerly between two ten foot poles .     it   s the disinto i   m making  so i can start to work .  it   s an improvement on the standard model .     the robot rose  dusted his knees clankingly  and looked at it proudly .  payne shuddered .  an    improvement    .  no wonder they hid the original in caverns on the moon .  poor satellite .  poor dead satellite .  he had always wanted to know what a fate worse than death was .  now he knew .     will it work .     he asked .         sure .        how do you know .        it   s got to .  i made it  didn   t i .  i only need one thing now .  got a flashlight .        somewhere  i guess .     payne vanished into the shack and returned almost immediately .  the robot unscrewed the bottom and set to work .  in five minutes he had finished .  he stepped back and said     all set .  now i get to work .  you may watch if you want to .     a pause  while payne tried to appreciate the magnanimity of the offer .     is it safe .        a baby could handle it .        oh .     payne grinned weakly and got behind the thickest tree in the vicinity .     go ahead     he said     i have the utmost confidence in you .     al    pointed to the nightmarish junk pile and said     watch .     his hands set to work    the embattled farmers of hannaford county  virginia  weaved up upon payne   s shack in a slowly tightening circle .  with the blood of their heroic colonial forebears pounding their veins  and goose flesh trickling up and down their spines  they crept from tree to tree .  sheriff saunders spread the word .     fire when i give the signal  and aim at the eyes .     jacob linker  lank jake to his friends  and sheriff   s deputy to himself  edged close .     you think maybe this machine man has skedaddled .     he did not quite manage to suppress the tone of wistful hopefulness in his voice .     dunno     grunted the sheriff .     guess not  though .  we woulda come across him in the woods if he had  and we haven   t .        but it   s awful quiet  and it appears to me as if we   re getting close to payne   s place .     the reminder wasn   t necessary .  sheriff saunders had a lump in his throat so big it had to be swallowed in three installments .     get back     he ordered     and keep your finger on the trigger .     they were at the rim of the clearing now  and sheriff saunders closed his eyes and stuck the corner of one out from behind the tree .  seeing nothing  he paused  then tried again  eyes open this time .  results were  naturally  better .  to be exact  he saw one huge machine man  back toward him  bending over one soul curdling  hiccupy contraption of uncertain origin and less certain purpose .  the only item he missed was the quivering figure of randolph payne  embracing the tree next but three to the nor    nor   west .  sheriff saunders stepped out into the open and raised his machine gun .  the robot  still presenting a broad metal back  said in a loud voice to person or persons unknown     watchl    and as the sheriff opened his mouth to signal a general order to fire  metal fingers compressed a switch .  there exists no adequate description of what occurred afterward  in spite of the presence of seventy eyewitnesses .  in the days  months  and years to come not one of those seventy ever had a word to say about the few seconds after the sheriff had opened his mouth to give the firing order .  when questioned about it  they merely turned apple green and staggered away .  it is plain from circumstantial evidence  however  that  in a general way  what did occur was this .  sheriff saunders opened his mouth  al    pulled a switch .  the disinto worked  and seventy five trees  two barns  three cows and the top three quarters of duckbill mountain whiffed into rarefied atmosphere .  they became  so to speak  one with the snows of yesteryear .  sheriff saunders    mouth remained open for an indefinite interval thereafter  but nothing  neither firing orders nor anything else  issued therefrom .  and then   and then  there was a stirring in the air  a multiple ro o o oshing sound  a series of purple streaks through the atmosphere radiating away from randolph payne   s shack as the center  and of the members of the posse  not a sign .  there were various guns scattered about the vicinity  including the sheriff   s patented nickel plated  extra rapid fire  guaranteed no clog  portable machine gun .  there were about fifty hats  a few half chomped cigars  and some odds and ends that had come loose in the excitement  but of actual human beings there was none .  except for lank jake  not one of those human beings came within human ken for three days  and the exception in his favor came about because he was interrupted in his comet flight by the half dozen men from the petersboro factory  who were charging into the wood at a pretty fair speed of their own .  it was sam tobe who stopped him  catching lank jake   s head skillfully in the pit of his stomach .  when he caught his breath .  tobe asked .     where   s randolph payne   s place .     lank jake allowed his eyes to unglaze for just a moment .     brother     he said     just you follow the direction i ain   t going .     and with that  miraculously  he was gone .  there was a shrinking dot dodging trees on the horizon that might have been he  but sam tobe wouldn   t have sworn to it .  that takes care of the posse  but there still remains randolph payne  whose reactions took something of a different form .  for randolph payne  the five second interval after the pulling of the switch and the disappearance of duckbill mountain was a total blank .  at the start he had been peering through the thick underbrush from behind the bottom of the trees  at the end he was swinging wildly from one of the topmost branches .  the same impulse that had driven the posse horizontally had driven him vertically .  as to how he had covered the fifty feet from roots to top  whether he had climbed  jumped  or flown  he did not know  and he didn   t give a particle of never mind .  what he did know was that property had been destroyed by a robot temporarily in his possession .  all visions of rewards vanished and were replaced by trembling nightmares of hostile citizenry  shrieking lynch mobs  lawsuits  murder charges  and what mirandy payne would say .  mostly what mirandy payne would say .  he was yelling wildly and hoarsely     hey  you robot  you smash that thing  do you hear .  smash it good .  you forget i ever had anything to do with it .  you   re a stranger to me  see .  you don   t ever say a word about it .  forget it  you hear .     he didn   t expect his orders to do any good  it was only reflex action .  what he didn   t know was that a robot always obeys a human order except where carrying it out involves danger to another human .  al     therefore  calmly and methodically proceeded to demolish his disinto into rubble and flinders .  just as he was stamping the last cubic inch under foot  sam tobe and his contingent arrived  and randolph payne  sensing that the real owners of the robot had come  dropped out of the tree head first and made for regions unknown feet first .  he did not wait for his reward .   austin wilde  robotical engineer  turned to sam tobe and said     did you get anything out of the robot .     tobe shook his head and snarled deep in his throat .     nothing .  not one thing .  he   s forgotten everything that   s happened since he left the factory .  he must have gotten orders to forget  or it couldn   t have left him so blank .  what was that pile of junk he   d been fooling with .        just that .  a pile of junk .  but it must have been a disinto before he smashed it  and i   d like to kill the fellow who ordered him to smash it  by slow torture  if possible .  look at this .     they were part of the way up the slopes of what had been duck bill mountain  at that point  to be exact  where the top had been sheered off  and wilde put his hand down upon the perfect flatness that cut through both soil and rock .     what a disinto     he said .     it took the mountain right off its base .        what made him build it .     wilde shrugged .     i don   t know .  some factor in his environment  there   s no way of knowing what  reacted upon his moon type positronic brain to produce a disinto out of junk .  it   s a billion to one against our ever stumbling upon that factor again now that the robot himself has forgotten .  we   ll never have that disinto .        never mind .  the important thing is that we have the robot .        the hell you say .     there was poignant regret in wilde   s voice .     have you ever had anything to do with the disintos on the moon .  they eat up energy like so many electronic hogs and won   t even begin to run until you   ve built up a potential of better than a million volts .  but this disinto worked differently .  i went through the rubbish with a microscope  and would you like to see the only source of power of any kind that i found .        what was it .        just this .  and we   ll never know how he did it .     and austin wilde held up the source of power that had enabled a disinto to chew up a mountain in half a second  two flashlight batteries .   victory unintentional  the spaceship leaked  as the saying goes  like a sieve .  it was supposed to .  in fact  that was the whole idea .  the result  of course  was that during the journey from ganymede to jupiter  the ship was crammed just as full as it could be with the very hardest space vacuum .  and since the ship also lacked heating devices  this space vacuum was at normal temperature  which is a fraction of a degree above absolute zero .  this  also  was according to plan .  little things like the absence of heat and air didn   t annoy anyone at all on the particular spaceship .  the first near vacuum wisps of jovian atmosphere began percolating into the ship several thousand miles above the jovian surface .  it was practically all hydrogen  though perhaps a careful gas analysis might have located a trace of helium as well .  the pressure gauges began creeping skyward .  that creep continued at an accelerating pace as the ship dropped downward in a jupiter circling spiral .  the pointers of successive gauges  each designed for progressively higher pressures  began to move until they reached the neighborhood of a million or so atmospheres  where figures lost most of their meaning .  the temperature  as recorded by thermocouples  rose slowly and erratically  and finally steadied at about seventy below zero  centigrade .  the ship moved slowly toward the end  plowing its way heavily through a maze of gas molecules that crowded together so closely that hydrogen itself was squeezed to the density of a liquid .  ammonia vapor  drawn from the incredibly vast oceans of that liquid  saturated the horrible atmosphere .  the wind  which had begun a thousand miles higher  had risen to a pitch inadequately described as a hurricane .  it was quite plain long before the ship landed on a fairly large jovian island  perhaps seven times the size of asia  that jupiter was not a very pleasant world .  and yet the three members of the crew thought it was .  they were quite convinced it was .  but then  the three members of the crew were not exactly human .  and neither were they exactly jovian .  they were simply robots  designed on earth for jupiter .  zz three said     it appears to be a rather desolate place .     zz two joined him and regarded the wind blasted landscape somberly .     there are structures of some sort in the distance     he said     which are obviously artificial .  i suggest we wait for the inhabitants to come to us .     across the room zz one listened  but made no reply .  he was the first constructed of the three  and half experimental .  consequently he spoke a little less frequently than his two companions .  the wait was not long .  an air vessel of queer design swooped overhead .  more followed .  and then a line of ground vehicles approached  took position  and disgorged organisms .  along with these organisms came various inanimate accessories that might have been weapons .  some of these were borne by a single jovian  some by several  and some advanced under their own power  with jovians perhaps inside .  the robots couldn   t tell .  zz three said     they   re all around us now .  the logical peaceful gesture would be to come out in the open .  agreed .     it was  and zz one shoved open the heavy door  which was not double or  for that matter  particularly airtight .  their appearance through the door was the signal for an excited stir among the surrounding jovians .  things were done to several of the very largest of the inanimate accessories  and zz three became aware of a temperature rise on the outer rind of his beryllium iridium bronze body .  he glanced at zz two .     do you feel it .  they   re aiming heat energy at us  i believe .     zz two indicated his surprise .     i wonder why .        definitely a heat ray of some sort .  look at that .     one of the rays had been jarred out of alignment for some undiscernible cause  and its line of radiation intersected a brook of sparkling pure ammonia   which promptly boiled furiously .  three turned to zz one     make a note of this  one  will you .        sure .     it was to zz one that the routine secretarial work fell  and his method of taking a note was to make a mental addition to the accurate memory scroll within him .  he had already gathered the hour by hour record of every important instrument on board ship during the trip to jupiter .  he added agreeably     what reason shall i put for the reaction .  the human masters would probably enjoy knowing .        no reason .  or better     three corrected himself     no apparent reason .  you might say the maximum temperature of the ray was about plus thirty  centigrade .     two interrupted     shall we try communicating .        it would be a waste of time     said three .     there can   t be more than a very few jovians who know the radio click code that   s been developed between jupiter and ganymede .  they   ll have to send for one  and when he comes  he   ll establish contact soon enough .  meanwhile let   s watch them .  i don   t understand their actions  i tell you frankly .     nor did understanding come immediately .  heat radiation ceased  and other instruments were brought to the forefront and put into play .  several capsules fell at the feet of the watching robots  dropping rapidly and forcefully under jupiter   s gravity .  they popped open and a blue liquid exuded  forming pools which proceeded to shrink rapidly by evaporation .  the nightmare wind whipped the vapors away and where those vapors went  jovians scrambled out of the way .  one was too slow  threshed about wildly  and became very limp and still .  zz two bent  dabbed a finger in one of the pools and stared at the dripping liquid .     i think this is oxygen     he said .     oxygen  all right     agreed three .     this becomes stranger and stranger .  it must certainly be a dangerous practice  for i would say that oxygen is poisonous to the creatures .  one of them died .     there was a pause  and then zz one  whose greater simplicity led at times to an increased directness of thought  said heavily     it might be that these strange creatures in a rather childish way are attempting to destroy us .     and two  struck by the suggestion  answered     you know  one  i think you   re right .     there had been a slight lull in jovian activity and now a new structure was brought up .  it possessed a slender rod that pointed skyward through the impenetrable jovian murk .  it stood in that starkly incredible wind with a rigidity that plainly indicated remarkable structural strength .  from its tip came a cracking and then a bash that lit up the depths of the atmosphere into a gray fog .  for a moment the robots were bathed in clinging radiance and then three said thoughtfully     high tension electricity .  quite respectable power  too .  one  i think you   re right .  after all  the human masters have told us that these creatures seek to destroy all humanity  and organisms possessing such insane viciousness as to harbor a thought of harm against a human being     his voice trembled at the thought     would scarcely scruple at attempting to destroy us .        it   s a shame to have such distorted minds     said zz one .     poor fellows .        i find it a very saddening thought     admitted two .     let   s go back to the ship .  we   ve seen enough for now .     they did so  and settled down to wait .  as zz three said  jupiter was a roomy planet  and it might take time for jovian transportation to bring a radio code expert to the ship .  however  patience is a cheap commodity to robots .  as a matter of fact  jupiter turned on its axis three times  according to chronometer  before the expert arrived .  the rising and setting of the sun made no difference  of course  to the dead darkness at the bottom of three thousand miles of liquid dense gas  so that one could not speak of day and night .  but then  neither jovian nor robot saw by visible light radiation and that didn   t matter .  through this thirty hour interval the surrounding jovians continued their attack with a patience and persevering relentlessness concerning which robot zz one made a good many mental notes .  the ship was assaulted by as many varieties of forces as there were hours  and the robots observed every attack attentively  analyzing such weapons as they recognized .  they by no means recognized all .  but the human masters had built well .  it had taken fifteen years to construct the ship and the robots  and their essentials could be expressed in a single phrase   raw strength .  the attack spent itself uselessly and neither ship nor robot seemed the worse for it .  three said     this atmosphere handicaps them  i think .  they can   t use atomic disruptors  since they would only tear a hole in that soupy air and blow themselves up .        they haven   t used high explosives either     said two     which is well .  they couldn   t have hurt us  naturally  but it would have thrown us about a bit .        high explosives are out of the question .  you can   t have an explosive without gas expansion and gas just can   t expand in this atmosphere .        it   s a very good atmosphere     muttered one .     i like it .     which was natural  because he was built for it .  the zz robots were the first robots ever turned out by the united states robots and mechanical men corporation that were not even faintly human in appearance .  they were low and squat  with a center of gravity less than a foot above ground level .  they had six legs apiece  stumpy and thick  designed to lift tons against two and a half times normal earth gravity .  their reflexes were that many times earth normal speed  to make up for the gravity .  and they were composed of a berylliam iridium bronze alloy that was proof against any known corrosive agent  also any known destructive agent short of a thousand megaton atomic disruptor  under any conditions whatsoever .  to dispense with further description  they were indestructible  and so impressively powerful that they were the only robots ever built on whom the roboticists of the corporation had never quite had the nerve to pin a serial number nickname .  one bright young fellow had suggested sissy one  two  and three  but not in a very loud voice  and the suggestion was never repeated .  the last hours of the wait were spent in a puzzled discussion to find a possible description of a jovian   s appearance .  zz one had made a note of their possession of tentacles and of their radial symmetry  and there he had struck .  two and three did their best  but couldn   t help .     you can   t very well describe anything     three declared finally     without a standard of reference .  these creatures are like nothing i know of  completely outside the postitronic paths of my brain .  it   s like trying to describe gamma light to a robot unequipped for gamma ray reception .     it was just at that time that the weapon barrage ceased once more .  the robots turned their attention to outside the ship .  a group of jovians were advancing in curiously uneven fashion  but no amount of careful watching could determine the exact method of their locomotion .  how they used their tentacles was uncertain .  at times the organisms took on a remarkable slithering motion  and then they moved at great speed  perhaps with the wind   s help  for they were moving downwind .  the robots stepped out to meet the jovians  who halted ten feet away .  both sides remained silent and motionless .  zz two said     they must be watching us  but i don   t know how .  do either of you see any photosensitive organs .        i can   t say     grunted three in response .     i don   t see anything about them that makes sense at all .     there was a sudden metallic clicking from among the jovian group and zz one said delightedly     it   s the radio code .  they   ve got the communications expert here .     it was  and they had .  the complicated dot dash system that over a period of twenty five years had been laboriously developed by the beings of jupiter and the earthmen of ganymede into a remarkably flexible means of communication was finally being put into practice at close range .  one jovian remained in the forefront now  the others having fallen back .  it was he that was speaking .  the clicking said     where are you from .     zz three  as the most mentally advanced  naturally assumed spokesmanship for the robot group .     we are from jupiter   s satellite  ganymede .     the jovian continued     what do you want .        information .  we have come to study your world and to bring back our findings .  if we could have your cooperation      the jovian clicking interrupted .     you must be destroyed .     zz three paused and said in a thoughtful aside to his two companions     exactly the attitude the human masters said they would take .  they are very unusual .     returning to his clicking  he asked simply     why .     the jovian evidently considered certain questions too obnoxious to be answered .  he said     if you leave within a single period of revolution  we will spare you   until such time as we emerge from our world to destroy the un jovian vermin of ganymede .        i would like to point out     said three     that we of ganymede and the inner planets      the jovian interrupted     our astronomy knows of the sun and of our four satellites .  there are no inner planets .     three conceded the point wearily     we of ganymede  then .  we have no designs on jupiter .  we   re prepared to offer friendship .  for twenty five years your people communicated freely with the human beings of ganymede .  is there any reason to make sudden war upon the humans .        for twenty five years     was the cold response     we assumed the inhabitants of ganymede to be jovians .  when we found out they were not  and that we had been treating lower animals on the scale of jovian intelligences  we were bound to take steps to wipe out the dishonor .     slowly and forcefully he finished     we of jupiter will suffer the existence of no vermin .     the jovian was backing away in some fashion  tacking against the wind  and the interview was evidently over .  the robots retreated inside the ship .  zz two said     it looks bad  doesn   t it .     he continued thoughtfully     it is as the human masters said .  they possess an ultimately developed superiority complex  combined with an extreme intolerance for anyone or anything that disturbs that complex .        the intolerance     observed three     is the natural consequence of the complex .  the trouble is that their intolerance has teeth in it .  they have weapons   and their science is great .        i am not surprised now     burst out zz one     that we were specifically instructed to disregard jovian orders .  they are horrible  intolerant  pseudo superior beings .     he added emphatically  with robotical loyalty and faith     no human master could ever be like that .        that  though true  is beside the point     said three .     the fact remains that the human masters are in terrible danger .  this is a gigantic world and these jovians are greater in numbers and resources by a hundred times or more than the humans of the entire terrestrial empire .  if they can ever develop the force field to the point where they can use it as a spaceship hull   as the human masters have already done   they will overrun the system at will .  the question remains as to how far they have advanced in that direction  what other weapons they have  what preparations they are making  and so on .  to return with that information is our function  of course  and we had better decide on our next step .        it may be difficult     said two .     the jovians won   t help us .     which  at the moment  was rather an understatement .  three thought awhile .     it seems to me that we need only wait     he observed .     they have tried to destroy us for thirty hours now and haven   t succeeded .  certainly they have done their best .  now a superiority complex always involves the eternal necessity of saving face  and the ultimatum given us proves it in this case .  they would never allow us to leave if they could destroy us .  but if we don   t leave  then rather than admit they cannot force us away  they will surely pretend that they are willing  for their own purposes  to have us stay .     once again they waited .  the day passed .  the weapon barrage did not resume .  the robots did not leave .  the bluff was called .  and now the robots faced the jovian radio code expert once again .  if the zz models had been equipped with a sense of humor  they would have enjoyed themselves immensely .  as it was  they felt merely a solemn sense of satisfaction .  the jovian said     it has been our decision that you will be allowed to remain for a very short time  so that you see our power for yourself .  you shall then return to ganymede to inform your companion vermin of the disastrous end to which they will unfailingly come within a solar revolution .     zz one made a mental note that a jovian revolution took twelve earthly years .  three replied casually     thank you .  may we accompany you to the nearest town .  there are many things we would like to learn .     he added as an afterthought     our ship is not to be touched  of course .     he said this as a request  not as a threat  for no zz model was ever pugnacious .  all capacity for even the slightest annoyance had been carefully barred in their construction .  with robots as vastly powerful as the zz   s  unfailing good temper was essential for safety during the years of testing on earth .  the jovian said     we are not interested in your verminous ship .  no jovian will pollute himself by approaching it .  you may accompany us  but you must on no account approach closer than ten feet to any jovian  or you will be instantly destroyed .        stuck up  aren   t they .     observed two in a genial whisper  as they plowed into the wind .  the town was a port on the shores of an incredible ammonia lake .  the external wind whipped furious  frothy waves that shot across the liquid surface at the hectic rate enforced by the gravity .  the port itself was neither large nor impressive and it seemed fairly evident that most of the construction was underground .     what is the population of this place .     asked three .  the jovian replied     it is a small town of ten million .        i see .  make a note of that  one .     zz one did so mechanically  and then turned once more to the lake  at which he had been staring in fascination .  he pulled at three   s elbow .     say  do you suppose they have fish here .        what difference does it make .        i think we ought to know .  the human masters ordered us to find out everything we could .     of the robots  one was the simplest and  consequently  the one who took orders in the most literal fashion .  two said     let one go and look if he likes .  it won   t do any harm if we let the kid have his fun .        all right .  there   s no real objection if he doesn   t waste his time .  fish aren   t what we came for  but go ahead  one .     zz one made off in great excitement and slogged rapidly down the beach  plunging into the ammonia with a splash .  the jovians watched attentively .  they had understood none of the previous conversation  of course .  the radio code expert clicked out     it is apparent that your companion has decided to abandon life in despair at our greatness .     three said in surprise     nothing of the sort .  he wants to investigate the living organisms  if any  that live in the ammonia .     he added apologetically     our friend is very curious at times  and he isn   t quite as bright as we are  though that is only his misfortune .  we understand that and try to humor him whenever we can .     there was a long pause  and the jovian observed     he will drown .     three replied casually     no danger of that .  we don   t drown .  may we enter the town as soon as he returns .     at that moment there was a spurt of liquid several hundred feet out in the lake .  it sprayed upward wildly and then hurtled down in a wind driven mist .  another spurt and another  then a wild white foaming that formed a trail toward shore  gradually quieting as it approached .  the two robots watched this in amazement  and the utter lack of motion on the part of the jovians indicated that they were watching as well .  then the head of zz one broke the surface and he made his slow way out on to dry land .  but something followed him .  some organism of gigantic size that seemed nothing but fangs  claws  and spines .  then they saw that it wasn   t following him under its own power  but was being dragged across the beach by zz one .  there was a significant flabbiness about it .  zz one approached rather timidly and took communication into his own hands .  he tapped out a message to the jovian in agitated fashion .     i am very sorry this happened  but the thing attacked me .  i was merely taking notes on it .  it is not a valuable creature  i hope .     he was not answered immediately  for at the first appearance of the monster there had been a wild break in the jovian ranks .  these reformed slowly  and cautious observation having proven the creator to be indeed dead  order was restored .  some of the bolder were curiously prodding the body .  zz three said humbly     i hope you will pardon our friend .  he is sometimes clumsy .  we have absolutely no intention of harming any jovian creature .        he attacked me     explained one .     he bit at me without provocation .  see .     and he displayed a two foot fang that ended in a jagged break .     he broke it on my shoulder and almost left a scratch .  i just slapped it a bit to send it away   and it died .  i   m sorry .     the jovian finally spoke  and his code clicking was a rather stuttery affair .     it is a wild creature  rarely found so close to shore  but the lake is deep just here .     three said  still anxiously     if you can use it for food  we are only too glad         no .  we can get food for ourselves without the help of verm  without the help of others .  eat it yourselves .     at that zz one heaved the creature up and back into the sea  with an easy motion of one arm .  three said casually     thank you for your kind offer  but we have no use for food .  we don   t eat  of course .     escorted by two hundred or so armed jovians  the robots passed down a series of ramps into the underground city .  if  above the surface  the city had looked small and unimpressive  then from beneath it took on the appearance of a vast megalopolis .  they were ushered into ground cars that were operated by remote control  for no honest  self respecting jovian would risk his superiority by placing himself in the same car with vermin  and driven at frightful speed to the center of the town .  they saw enough to decide that it extended fifty miles from end to end and reached downward into jupiter   s crust at least eight miles .  zz two did not sound happy as he said     if this is a sample of jovian development then we shall not have a hopeful report to bring back to the human masters .  after all  we landed on the vast surface of jupiter at random  with the chances a thousand to one against coming near any really concentrated center of population .  this must be  as the code expert says  a mere town .        ten million jovians     said three abstractedly .     total population must be in the trillions  which is high  very high  even for jupiter .  they probably have a completely urban civilization  which means that their scientific development must be tremendous .  if they have force fields      three had no neck  for in the interest of strength the heads of the zz models were riveted firmly onto the torso  with the delicate positronic brains protected by three separate layers in inch thick iridium alloy .  but if he had had one  he would have shaken his head dolefully .  they had stopped now in a cleared space .  everywhere about them they could see avenues and structures crowded with jovians  as curious as any terrestrial crowd would have been in similar circumstances .  the code expert approached .     it is time now for me to retire until the next period of activity .  we have gone so far as to arrange quarters for you at great inconvenience to ourselves for  of course  the structure will have to be pulled down and rebuilt afterward .  nevertheless  you will be allowed to sleep for a space .     zz three waved an arm in deprecation and tapped out     we thank you but you must not trouble yourself .  we don   t mind remaining right here .  if you want to sleep and rest  by all means do .  we   ll wait for you .  as for us     casually     we don   t sleep .     the jovian said nothing  though if it had had a face  the expression upon it might have been interesting .  it left  and the robots remained in the car  with squads of well armed jovians  frequently replaced  surrounding them as guards .  it was hours before the ranks of those guards parted to allow the code expert to return .  along with him were other jovians  whom he introduced .     there are with me two officials of the central government who have graciously consented to speak with you .     one of the officials evidently knew the code  for his clicking interrupted the code expert sharply .  he addressed the robots     vermin .  emerge from the ground car that we may look at you .     the robots were only too willing to comply  so while three and two vaulted over the right side of the car  zz one dashed through the left side .  the word through is used advisedly  for since he neglected to work the mechanism that lowered a section of side so that one might exit  he carried that side  plus two wheels and an axle  along with him .  the car collapsed  and zz one stood staring at the ruins in embarrassed silence .  at last he clicked out gently     i   m very sorry .  i hope it wasn   t an expensive car .     zz two added apologetically     our companion is often clumsy .  you must excuse him     and zz three made a halfhearted attempt to put the car back together again .  zz one made another effort to excuse himself .     the material of the car was rather flimsy .  you see .     he lifted a square yard sheet of three inch thick  metal hard plastic in both hands and exerted a bit of pressure .  the sheet promptly snapped in two .     i should have made allowances     he admitted .  the jovian government official said in slightly less sharp fashion     the car would have had to be destroyed anyway  after being polluted by your presence .     he paused  then     creatures .  we jovians lack vulgar curiosity concerning lower animals  but our scientists seek facts .        we   re right with you     replied three cheerfully .     so do we .     the jovian ignored him .     you lack the mass sensitive organ  apparently .  how is it that you are aware of distant objects .     three grew interested .     do you mean your people are directly sensitive to mass .        i am not here to answer your questions   your impudent questions   about us .        i take it then that objects of low specific mass would be transparent to you  even in the absence of radiation .     he turned to two     that   s how they see .  their atmosphere is as transparent as space to them .     the jovian clicking began once more     you will answer my first question immediately  or my patience will end and i will order you destroyed .     three said at once     we are energy sensitive  jovian .  we can adjust ourselves to the entire electromagnetic scale at will .  at present  our long distance sight is due to radio wave radiation that we emit ourselves  and at close range we see by      he paused  and said to two     there isn   t any code word for gamma ray  is there .        not that i know of     two answered .  three continued to the jovian     at close range we see by other radiation for which there is no code word .        of what is your body composed .     demanded the jovian .  two whispered     he probably asks that because his mass sensitivity can   t penetrate past our skin .  high density  you know .  ought we to tell him .     three replied uncertainly     our human masters didn   t particularly say we were to keep anything secret .     in radio code  to the jovian he said     we are mostly iridium .  for the rest  copper  tin  a little beryllium  and a scattering of other substances .     the jovians fell back and by the obscure writhing of various portions of their thoroughly indescribable bodies gave the impression that they were in animated conversation  although they made no sound .  and then the official returned .     beings of ganymede .  it has been decided to show you through some of our factories that we may exhibit a tiny part of our great achievements .  we will then allow you to return so that you may spread despair among the other verm  the other beings of the outer world .     three said to two     note the effect of their psychology .  they must hammer home their superiority .  it   s still a matter of saving face .     and in radio code     we thank you for the opportunity .     but the face saving was efficient  as the robots realized soon enough .  the demonstration became a tour  and the tour a grand exhibition .  the jovians displayed everything  explained everything  answered all questions eagerly  and zz one made hundreds of despairing notes .  the war potential of that single so called unimportant town was greater by several times than that of all ganymede .  ten more such towns would outproduce all the terrestrial empire .  yet ten more such towns would not be the fingernail fragment of the strength all jupiter must be able to exert .  three turned as one nudged him .     what is it .     zz one said seriously      f they have force fields  the human masters are lost  aren   t they .        i   m afraid so .  why do you ask .        because the jovians aren   t showing us through the right wing of this factory .  it might be that force fields are being developed there .  they would be wanting to keep it secret if they were .  we   d better find out .  it   s the main point  you know .     three regarded one somberly .     perhaps you   re right .  it   s no use ignoring anything .     they were in a huge steel mill now  watching hundred foot beams of ammonia resistant silicon steel alloy being turned out twenty to the second .  three asked quietly     what does that wing contain .     the government official inquired of those in charge of the factory and explained     that is the section of great heat .  various processes require huge temperatures which life cannot bear  and they must all be handled indirectly .     he led the way to a partition from which heat could be felt to radiate and indicated a small round area of transparent material .  it was one of a row of such  through which the foggy red light of lines of glowing forges could be made out through the soupy atmosphere .  zz one fastened a look of suspicion on the jovian and clicked out     would it be all right if i went in and looked around .  i am very interested in this .     three said     you   re being childish  one .  they   re telling the truth .  oh well  nose around if you must .  but don   t take too long  we   ve got to move on .     the jovian said     you have no understanding of the heat involved .  you will die .        oh no     explained one casually .     heat doesn   t bother us .     there was a jovian conference  and then a scene of scurrying confusion as the life of the factory was geared to this unusual emergency .  screens of heat absorbent material were set up  and then a door dropped open  a door that had never before budged while the forges were working .  zz one entered and the door closed behind him .  jovian officials crowded to the transparent areas to watch .  zz one walked to the nearest forge and tapped the outside .  since he was too short to see into it comfortably  he tipped the forge until the molten metal licked at the lip of the container .  he peered at it curiously  then dipped his hand in and stirred it awhile to test the consistency .  having done this  he withdrew his hand  shook off some of the fiery metallic droplets and wiped the rest on one of his six thighs .  slowly he went down the line of forges  then signified his desire to leave .  the jovians retired to a great distance when he came out of the door and played a stream of ammonia on him  which hissed  bubbled and steamed until he was brought to bearable temperature once more .  zz one ignored the ammonia shower and said     they were telling the truth .  no force fields .     three began     you see      but one interrupted impatiently     but there   s no use delaying .  the human masters instructed us to find out everything and that   s that .     he turned to the jovian and clicked out  without the slightest hesitation     listen  has jovian science developed force fields .     bluntness was  of course  one of the natural consequences of one   s less well developed mental powers .  two and three knew that  so they refrained from expressing disapproval of the remark .  the jovian official relaxed slowly from his strangely stiffened attitude  which had somehow given the impression that he had been staring stupidly at one   s hand  the one he had dipped into the molten metal .  the jovian said slowly     force fields .  that  then  is your main object of curiosity .        yes     said one with emphasis .  there was a sudden and patent gain in confidence on the jovian   s part  for the clicking grew sharper .     then come  vermin .     whereupon three said to two     we   re vermin again  i see  which sounds as if there   s bad news ahead .     and two gloomily agreed .  it was to the very edge of the city that they were now led   to the portion which on earth would have been termed the suburbs   and into one of a series of closely integrated structures  which might have corresponded vaguely to a terrestrial university .  there were no explanations  however  and none was asked for .  the jovian official led the way rapidly  and the robots followed with the grim conviction that the worst was just about to happen .  it was zz one who stopped before an opened wall section after the rest had passed on .     what   s this .     he wanted to know .  the room was equipped with narrow  low benches  along which jovians manipulated rows of strange devices  of which strong  inch long electromagnets formed the principal feature .     what   s this .     asked one again .  the jovian turned back and exhibited impatience .     this is a students    biological laboratory .  there   s nothing there to interest you .        but what are they doing .        they are studying microscopic life .  haven   t you ever seen a microscope before .     three interrupted in explanation     he has  but not that type .  our microscopes are meant for energy sensitive organs and work by refraction of radiant energy .  your microscopes evidently work on a mass expansion basis .  rather ingenious .     zz one said     would it be all right if i inspected some of your specimens .        of what use will that be .  you cannot use our microscopes because of your sensory limitations and it will simply force us to discard such specimens as you approach for no decent reason .        but i don   t need a microscope     explained one  with surprise .     i can easily adjust myself for microscopic vision .     he strode to the nearest bench  while the students in the room crowded to the corner in an attempt to avoid contamination .  zz one shoved a microscope aside and inspected the slide carefully .  he backed away  puzzled  then tried another .  .  . a third .  .  . a fourth .  he came back and addressed the jovian .     those are supposed to be alive  aren   t they .  i mean those little worm things .     the jovian said     certainly .        that   s strange   when i look at them  they die .     three exclaimed sharply and said to his two companions     we   ve forgotten our gamma ray radiation .  let   s get out of here  one  or we   ll kill every bit of microscopic life in the room .     he turned to the jovian     i   m afraid that our presence is fatal to weaker forms of life .  we had better leave .  we hope the specimens are not too difficult to replace .  and  while we   re about it  you had better not stay too near us  or our radiation may affect you adversely .  you feel all right so far  don   t you .     he asked .  the jovian led the way onward in proud silence  but it was to be noticed that thereafter he doubled the distance he had hitherto kept between himself and them .  nothing more was said until the robots found themselves in a vast room .  in the very center of it huge ingots of metal rested unsupported in mid air  or  rather  supported by nothing visible  against mighty jovian gravity .  the jovian clicked     there is your force field in ultimate form  as recently perfected .  within that bubble is a vacuum  so that it is supporting the full weight of our atmosphere plus an amount of metal equivalent to two large spaceships .  what do you say to that .        that space travel now becomes a possibility for you     said three .     definitely .  no metal or plastic has the strength to hold our atmosphere against a vacuum  but a force field can   and a force field bubble will be our spaceship .  within the year we will be turning them out by the hundreds of thousands .  then we will swarm down upon ganymede to destroy the verminous so called intelligences that attempt to dispute our dominion of the universe .        the human beings of ganymede have never attempted      began three  in mild expostulation .     silence .     snapped the jovian .     return now and tell them what you   ve seen .  their own feeble force fields   such as the one your ship is equipped with   will not stand against us  for our smallest ship will be a hundred times the size and power of yours .     three said     then there   s nothing more to do and we will return  as you say  with the information .  if you could lead us back to our ship  we   ll say good by .  but by the way  just as a matter for the record  there   s something you don   t understand .  the humans of ganymede have force fields  of course  but our particular ship isn   t equipped with one .  we don   t need any .     the robot turned away and motioned his companions to follow .  for a moment they did not speak  then zz one muttered dejectedly     can   t we try to destroy this place .        it won   t help     said three .     they   d get us by weight of numbers .  it   s no use .  in an earthly decade the human masters will be finished .  it is impossible to stand against jupiter .  there   s just too much of it .  as long as jovians were tied to the surface  the humans were safe .  but now that they have force fields .  all we can do is to bring the news .  by the preparation of hiding places  some few may survive for a short while .     the city was behind them .  they were out on the open plain by the lake  with their ship a dark spot on the horizon  when the jovian spoke suddenly     creatures  you say you have no force field .     three replied without interest     we don   t need one .        how then does your ship stand the vacuum of space without exploding because of the atmospheric pressure within .     and he moved a tentacle as if in mute gesture at the jovian atmosphere that was weighing down upon them with a force of twenty million pounds to the square inch .     well     explained three     that   s simple .  our ship isn   t airtight .  pressures equalize within and without .        even in space .  a vacuum in your ship .  you lie .        you   re welcome to inspect our ship .  it has no force field and it isn   t airtight .  what   s marvelous about that .  we don   t breathe .  our energy is obtained through direct atomic power .  the presence or absence of air pressure makes little difference to us and we   re quite at home in a vacuum .        but absolute zero .        it doesn   t matter .  we regulate our own heat .  we   re not interested in outside temperatures .     he paused .     well  we can make our own way back to the ship .  good by .  we   ll give the humans of ganymede your message   war to the end .     but the jovian said     wait .  i   ll be back .     he turned and went toward the city .  the robots stared  and then waited in silence .  it was three hours before he returned and when he did  it was in breathless haste .  he stopped within the usual ten feet of the robots  but then began inching his way forward in a curious groveling fashion .  he did not speak until his rubbery gray skin was almost touching them  and then the radio code sounded  subdued and respectful .     honored sirs  i have been in communication with the head of our central government  who is now aware of all the facts  and i can assure you that jupiter desires only peace        i beg your pardon .     asked three blankly .  the jovian drove on hastily .     we are ready to resume communication with ganymede and will gladly promise to make no attempt to venture into space .  our force field will be used only on the jovian surface .        but      three began .     our government will be glad to receive any other representatives our honorable human brothers of ganymede would care to send .  if your honors will now condescend to swear peace      a scaly tentacle swung out toward them and three  quite dazed  grasped it .  two and one did likewise as two more were extended to them .  the jovian said solemnly     there is then eternal peace between jupiter and ganymede .     the spaceship which leaked like a sieve was out in space again .  the pressure and temperature were once more at zero  and the robots watched the huge but steadily shrinking globe that was jupiter .     they   re definitely sincere     said zz two     and it   s very gratifying  this complete about face  but i don   t get it .        it is my idea     observed zz one     that the jovians came to their senses just in time and realized the incredible evil involved in the thought of harm to a human master .  that would be only natural .     zz three sighed and said     look  it   s all a matter of psychology .  those jovians had a superiority complex a mile thick and when they couldn   t destroy us  they were bound to save face .  all their exhibitions  all their explanations  were simply a form of braggadocio  designed to impress us into the proper state of humiliation before their power and superiority .        i see all that     interrupted two     but      three went on     but it worked the wrong way .  all they did was to prove to themselves that we were stronger  that we didn   t drown  that we didn   t eat or sleep  that molten metal didn   t hurt us .  even our very presence was fatal to jovian life .  their last trump was the force field .  and when they found out that we didn   t need them at all  and could live in a vacuum at absolute zero  they broke .     he paused and added philosophically     when a superiority complex like that breaks  it breaks all the way .     the other two considered that  and then two said     but it still doesn   t make sense .  why should they care what we can or can   t do .  we   re only robots .  we   re not the ones they have to fight .        and that   s the whole point  two     said three softly .     it   s only after we left jupiter that i thought of it .  do you know that through an oversight  quite unintentionally  we neglected to tell them we were only robots .        they never asked us     said one .     exactly .  so they thought we were human beings and that all the other human beings were like us .     he looked once more at jupiter  thoughtfully .     no wonder they decided to quit .      stranger in paradise    .       they were brothers .  not in the sense that they were both human beings  or that they were fellow children of a creche .  not at all .  they were brothers in the actual biological sense of the word .  they were kin  to use a term that had grown faintly archaic even centuries before  prior to the catastrophe  when that tribal phenomenon  the family  still had some validity .  how embarrassing it was .  over the years since childhood  anthony had almost forgotten .  there were times when he hadn   t given it even the slightest thought for months at a time .  but now  ever since he had been inextricably thrown together with william  he had found himself living through an agonizing time .  it might not have been so bad if circumstances had made it obvious all along  if  as in the pre catastrophe days   anthony had at one time been a great reader of history   they had shared the second name and in that way alone flaunted the relationship .  nowadays  of course  one adopted one   s second name to suit oneself and changed it as often as desired .  after all  the symbol chain was what really counted  and that was encoded and made yours from birth .  william called himself anti aut .  that was what he insisted on with a kind of sober professionalism .  his own business  surely  but what an advertisement of personal poor taste .  anthony had decided on smith when he had turned thirteen and had never had the impulse to change it .  it was simple  easily spelled  and quite distinctive  since he had never met anyone else who had chosen that name .  it was once very common  among the pre cats  which explained its rareness now perhaps .  but the difference in names meant nothing when the two were together .  they looked alike .  if they had been twins   but then one of a pair of twin fertilized ova was never allowed to come to term .  it was just that physical similarity occasionally happened in the non twin situation  especially when the relationship was on both sides .  anthony smith was five years younger  but both had the beaky nose  the heavy eyelids  the just noticeable cleft in the chin   that damned luck of the genetic draw .  it was just asking for it when  out of some passion for monotony  parents repeated .  at first  now that they were together  they drew that startled glance followed by an elaborate silence .  anthony tried to ignore the matter  but out of sheer perversity  or perversion  william was as likely as not to say .     we   re brothers .  .  .     oh .     the other would say  hanging in there for just a moment as though he wanted to ask if they were full blood brothers .  and then good manners would win the day and he would turn away as though it were a matter of no interest .  that happened only rarely  of course .  most of the people in the project knew  how could it be prevented .    and avoided the situation .  not that william was a bad fellow .  not at all .  if he hadn   t been anthony   s brother  or if they had been  but looked sufficiently different to be able to mask the fact  they would have gotten along famously .  as it was  it didn   t make it easier that they had played together as youngsters  and had shared the earlier stages of education in the same creche through some successful maneuvering on the part of mother .  having borne two sons by the same father and having  in this fashion  reached her limit  for she had not fulfilled the stringent requirements for a third   she conceived the notion of being able to visit both at a single trip .  she was a strange woman .  william had left the creche first  naturally  since he was the elder .  he had gone into science genetic engineering .  anthony had heard that  while he was still in the creche  through a letter from his mother .  he was old enough by then to speak firmly to the matron  and those letters stopped .  but he always remembered the last one for the agony of shame it had brought him .  anthony had eventually entered science  too .  he had shown talent in that direction and had been urged to .  he remembered having had the wild  and prophetic  he now realized  fear he might meet his brother and he ended in telemetrics  which was as far removed from genetic engineering as one could imagine .  .  .  . or so one would have thought .  then  through all the elaborate development of the mercury project  circumstance waited .  the time came  as it happened  when the project appeared to be facing a dead end  and a suggestion had been made which saved the situation  and at the same time dragged anthony into the dilemma his parents had prepared for him .  and the best and most sardonic part of the whole thing was that it was anthony who  in all innocence  made the suggestion .     .   william anti aut knew of the mercury project  but only in the way he knew of the long drawn out stellar probe that had been on its way long before he was born and would still be on its way after his death  and the way he knew of the martian colony and of the continuing attempts to establish similar colonies on the asteroids .  such things were on the distant periphery of his mind and of no real importance .  no part of the space effort had ever swirled inward closer to the center of his interests  as far as he could remember  till the day when the printout included photographs of some of the men engaged in the mercury project .  william   s attention was caught first by the fact that one of them had been identified as anthony smith .  he remembered the odd name his brother had chosen  and he remembered the anthony .  surely there could not be two anthony smiths .  he had then looked at the photograph itself and there was no mistaking the face .  he looked in the mirror in a sudden whimsical gesture at checking the matter .  no mistaking the face .  he felt amused  but uneasily so  for he did not fail to recognize the potentiality for embarrassment .  full blood brothers  to use the disgusting phrase .  but what was there to do about it .  how correct the fact that neither his father nor his mother had imagination .  he must have put the printout in his pocket  absently  when he was getting ready to leave for work  for he came across it at the lunch hour .  he stared at it again .  anthony looked keen .  it was quite a good reproduction   the printouts were of enormously good quality these days .  his lunch partner  marco whatever his name was that week  said curiously     what are you looking at  william .     on impulse  william passed him the printout and said     that   s my brother .     it was like grasping the nettle .  marco studied it  frowning  and said     who .  the man standing next to you .        no  the man who is me .  i mean the man who looks like me .  he   s my brother .     there was a longer pause this time .  marco handed it back and said with a careful levelness to his voice     same parents brother .        yes .        father and mother both .        yes .        ridiculous .        i suppose so .     william sighed .     well  according to this  he   s in telemetrics over in texas and i   m doing work in autistics up here .  so what difference does it make .     william did not keep it in his mind and later that day he threw the printout away .  he did not want his current bedmate to come across it .  she had a ribald sense of humor that william was finding increasingly wearying .  he was rather glad she was not in the mood for a child .  he himself had had one a few years back anyway .  that little brunette  laura or linda  one or the other name  had collaborated .  it was quite a time after that  at least a year  that the matter of randall had come up .  if william had given no further thought to his brother  and he hadn   t  before that  he certainly had no time for it afterward .  randall was sixteen when william first received word of him .  he had lived a life that was increasingly seclusive and the kentucky creche in which he was being brought up decided to cancel him and of course it was only some eight or ten days before cancellation that it occurred to anyone to report him to the new york institute for the science of man .   the homological institute was its common name .   william received the report along with reports of several others and there was nothing in the description of randall that particularly attracted his notice .  still it was time for one of his tedious masstransport trips to the creches and there was one likely possibility in west virginia .  he went there   and was disappointed into swearing for the fiftieth time that he would thereafter make these visits by tv image   and then  having dragged himself there  thought he might as well take in the kentucky creche before returning home .  he expected nothing .  yet he hadn   t studied randall   s gene pattern for more than ten minutes before he was calling the institute for a computer calculation .  then he sat back and perspired slightly at the thought that only a last minute impulse had brought him  and that without that impulse  randall would have been quietly canceled in a week or less .  to put it into the fine detail  a drug would have soaked painlessly through his skin and into his bloodstream and he would have sunk into a peaceful sleep that deepened gradually to death .  the drug had a twenty three syllable official name  but william called it    nirvanamine     as did everyone else .  william said     what is his full name  matron .     the creche matron said     randall nowan  scholar .        no one .     said william explosively .     nowan .     the matron spelled it .     he chose it last year .        and it meant nothing to you .  it is pronounced no one .  it didn   t occur to you to report this young man last year .        it didn   t seem      began the matron  flustered .  william waved her to silence .  what was the use .  how was she to know .  there was nothing in the gene pattern to give warning by any of the usual textbook criteria .  it was a subtle combination that william and his staff had worked out over a period of twenty years through experiments on autistic children   and a combination they had never actually seen in life .  so close to canceling .  marco  who was the hardhead of the group  complained that the creches were too eager to abort before term and to cancel after term .  he maintained that all gene patterns should be allowed to develop for purpose of initial screening and there should be no cancellation at all without consultation with a homologist .     there aren   t enough homologists     william said tranquilly .     we can at least run all gene patterns through the computer     said marco .     to save anything we can get for our use .        for any homological use  here or elsewhere .  we must study gene patterns in action if we   re to understand ourselves properly  and it is the abnormal and monstrous patterns that give us most information .  our experiments on autism have taught us more about homology than the sum total existing on the day we began .     william  who still liked the roll of the phrase    the genetic physiology of man    rather than    homology     shook his head .     just the same  we   ve got to play it carefully .  however useful we can claim our experiments to be  we live on bare social permission  reluctantly given .  we   re playing with lives .        useless lives .  fit for canceling .         a quick and pleasant canceling is one thing .  our experiments  usually long drawn out and sometimes unavoidably unpleasant  are another .        we help them sometimes .         and we don   t help them sometimes .     it was a pointless argument  really  for there was no way of settling it .  what it amounted to was that too few interesting abnormalities were available for homologists and there was no way of urging mankind to encourage a greater production .  the trauma of the catastrophe would never vanish in a dozen ways  including that one .  the hectic push toward space exploration could be traced back  and was  by some sociologists  to the knowledge of the fragility of the life skein on the planet  thanks to the catastrophe .  well  never mind there had never been anything like randall nowan .  not for william .  the slow onset of autism characteristic of that totally rare gene pattern meant that more was known about randall than about any equivalent patient before him .  they even caught some last faint glimmers of his way of thought in the laboratory before he closed off altogether and shrank finally within the wall of his skin  unconcerned  unreachable .  then they began the slow process whereby randall  subjected for increasing lengths of time to artificial stimuli  yielded up the inner workings of his brain and gave clues thereby to the inner workings of all brains  those that were called normal as well as those like his own .  so vastly great was the data they were gathering that william began to feel his dream of reversing autism was more than merely a dream .  he felt a warm gladness at having chosen the name anti aut .  and it was at almost the height of the euphoria induced by the work on randall that he received the call from dallas and that the heavy pressure began   now  of all times   to abandon his work and take on a new problem .  looking back on it later  he could never work out just what it was that finally led him to agree to visit dallas .  in the end  of course  he could see how fortunate it was   but what had persuaded him to do so .  could he  even at the start  have had a dim unrealized notion of what it might come to .  surely  impossible .  was it the unrealized memory of that printout  that photograph of his brother .  surely  impossible .  but he let himself be argued into that visit and it was only when the micro pile power unit changed the pitch of its soft hum and the agrav unit took over for the final descent that he remembered that photograph  or at least that it moved into the conscious part of his memory .  anthony worked at dallas and  william remembered now  at the mercury project .  that was what the caption had referred to .  he swallowed  as the soft jar told him the journey was over .  this would be uncomfortable .     .   anthony was waiting on the roof reception area to greet the incoming expert .  not he by himself  of course .  he was part of a sizable delegation  the size itself a rather grim indication of the desperation to which they had been reduced  and he was among the lower echelons .  that he was there at all was only because it was he who had made the original suggestion .  he felt a slight  but continuing  uneasiness at the thought of that .  he had put himself on the line .  he had received considerable approval for it  but there had been the faint insistence always that it was his suggestion  and if it turned out to be a fiasco  every one of them would move out of the line of fire and leave him at point zero .  there were occasions  later  when he brooded over the possibility that the dim memory of a brother in homology had suggested his thought .  that might have been  but it didn   t have to be .  the suggestion was so sensibly inevitable  really  that surely he would have had the same thought if his brother had been something as innocuous as a fantasy writer  or if he had had no brother of his own .  the problem was the inner planets  the moon and mars were colonized .  the larger asteroids and the satellites of jupiter had been reached  and plans were in progress for a manned voyage to titan  saturn   s large satellite  by way of an accelerating whirl about jupiter .  yet even with plans in action for sending men on a seven year round trip to the outer solar system  there was still no chance of a manned approach to the inner planets  for fear of the sun .  venus itself was the less attractive of the two worlds within earth   s orbit .  mercury  on the other hand anthony had not yet joined the team when dmitri large  he was quite short  actually  had given the talk that had moved the world congress sufficiently to grant the appropriation that made the mercury project possible .  anthony had listened to the tapes  and had heard dmitri   s presentation .  tradition was firm to the effect that it had been extemporaneous  and perhaps it was  but it was perfectly constructed and it held within it  in essence  every guideline followed by the mercury project since .  and the chief point made was that it would be wrong to wait until the technology had advanced to the point where a manned expedition through the rigors of solar radiation could become feasible .  mercury was a unique environment that could teach much  and from mercury   s surface sustained observations could be made of the sun that could not be made in any other way .    provided a man substitute   a robot  in short   could be placed on the planet .  a robot with the required physical characteristics could be built .  soft landings were as easy as kiss my hand .  yet once a robot landed  what did one do with him next .  he could make his observations and guide his actions on the basis of those observations  but the project wanted his actions to be intricate and subtle  at least potentially  and they were not at all sure what observations he might make .  to prepare for all reasonable possibilities and to allow for all the intricacy desired  the robot would need to contain a computer  some at dallas referred to it as a    brain     but anthony scorned that verbal habit   perhaps because  he wondered later  the brain was his brother   s field  sufficiently complex and versatile to fall into the same asteroid with a mammalian brain .  yet nothing like that could be constructed and made portable enough to be carried to mercury and landed there   or if carried and landed  to be mobile enough to be useful to the kind of robot they planned .  perhaps someday the positronic path devices that the roboticists were playing with might make it possible  but that someday was not yet .  the alternative was to have the robot send back to earth every observation it made the moment it was made  and a computer on earth could then guide his every action on the basis of those observations .  the robot   s body  in short  was to be there  and his brain here .  once that decision was reached  the key technicians were the telemetrists and it was then that anthony joined the project .  he became one of those who labored to devise methods for receiving and returning impulses over distances of from    to    million miles  toward  and sometimes past  a solar disk that could interfere with those impulses in a most ferocious manner .  he took to his job with passion and  he finally thought  with skill and success .  it was he  more than anyone else  who had designed the three switching stations that had been hurled into permanent orbit about mercury   the mercury orbiters .  each of them was capable of sending and receiving impulses from mercury to earth and from earth to mercury .  each was capable of resisting  more or less permanently  the radiation from the sun  and more than that  each could filter out solar interference .  three equivalent orbiters were placed at distance of a little over a million miles from earth  reaching north and south of the plane of the ecliptic so that they could receive the impulses from mercury and relay them to earth  or vice versa  even when mercury was behind the sun and inaccessible to direct reception from any station on earth     s surface .  which left the robot itself  a marvelous specimen of the roboticists    and telemetrists    arts in combination .  the most complex of ten successive models  it was capable  in a volume only a little over twice that of a man and five times his mass  of sensing and doing considerably more than a man   if it could be guided .  how complex a computer had to be to guide the robot made itself evident rapidly enough  however  as each response step had to be modified to allow for variations in possible perception .  and as each response step itself enforced the certainty of greater complexity of possible variation in perceptions  the early steps had to be reinforced and made stronger .  it built itself up endlessly  like a chess game  and the telemetrists began to use a computer to program the computer that designed the program for the computer that programmed the robot controlling computer .  there was nothing but confusion .  the robot was at a base in the desert spaces of arizona and in itself was working well .  the computer in dallas could not  however  handle him well enough  not even under perfectly known earth conditions .  how then anthony remembered the day when he had made the suggestion .  it was on         .  he remembered it  for one thing  because he remembered thinking that day that     had been an important holiday in the dallas region of the world among the pre cats half a millennium before   well      years before  to be exact .  it had been at dinner  and a good dinner  too .  there had been a careful adjustment of the ecology of the region and the project personnel had high priority in collecting the food supplies that became available  so there was an unusual degree of choice on the menus  and anthony had tried roast duck .  it was very good roast duck and it made him somewhat more expansive than usual .  everyone was in a rather self expressive mood  in fact  and ricardo said     we   ll never do it .  let   s admit it .  we   ll never do it .     there was no telling how many had thought such a thing how many times before  but it was a rule that no one said so openly .  open pessimism might be the final push needed for appropriations to stop  they had been coming with greater difficulty each year for five years now  and if there were a chance  it would be gone .  anthony  ordinarily not given to extraordinary optimism  but now reveling over his duck  said     why can   t we do it .  tell me why  and i   ll refute it .     it was a direct challenge and ricardo   s dark eyes narrowed at once .     you want me to tell you why .        i sure do .     ricardo swung his chair around  facing anthony full .  he said     come on  there   s no mystery .  dmitri large won   t say so openly in any report  but you know and i know that to run mercury project properly  we   ll need a computer as complex as a human brain whether it   s on mercury or here  and we can   t build one .  so where does that leave us except to play games with the world congress and get money for make work and possibly useful spin offs .     and anthony placed a complacent smile on his face and said     that   s easy to refute .  you   ve given us the answer yourself .      was he playing games .  was it the warm feeling of duck in his stomach .  the desire to tease ricardo .  .  .  . or did some unfelt thought of his brother touch him .  there was no way  later  that he could tell .      what answer .     ricardo rose .  he was quite tall and unusually thin and he always wore his white coat unseamed .  he folded his arms and seemed to be doing his best to tower over the seated anthony like an unfolded meter rule .     what answer .        you say we need a computer as complex as a human brain .  all right  then  we   ll build one .        the point  you idiot  is that we can   t         we can   t .  but there are others .        what others .        people who work on brains  of course .  we   re just solid state mechanics .  we have no idea in what way a human brain is complex  or where  or to what extent .  why don   t we get in a homologist and have him design a computer .     and with that anthony took a huge helping of stuffing and savored it complacently .  he could still remember  after all this time  the taste of the stuffing  though he couldn   t remember in detail what had happened afterward .  it seemed to him that no one had taken it seriously .  there was laughter and a general feeling that anthony had wriggled out of a hole by clever sophistry so that the laughter was at ricardo   s expense .   afterward  of course  everyone claimed to have taken the suggestion seriously .   ricardo blazed up  pointed a finger at anthony  and said     write that up .  i dare you to put that suggestion in writing .      at least  so anthony   s memory had it .  ricardo had  since then  stated his comment was an enthusiastic    good ideal why don   t you write it up formally  anthony .      either way  anthony put it in writing .  dmitri large had taken to it .  in private conference  he had slapped anthony on the back and had said that he had been speculating in that direction himself   though he did not offer to take any credit for it on the record .   just in case it turned out to be a fiasco  anthony thought .   dmitri large conducted the search for the appropriate homologist .  it did not occur to anthony that he ought to be interested .  he knew neither homology nor homologists  except  of course  his brother  and he had not thought of him .  not consciously .  so anthony was up there in the reception area  in a minor role  when the door of the aircraft opened and several men got out and came down and in the course of the handshakes that began going round  he found himself staring at his own face .  his cheeks burned and  with all his might  he wished himself a thousand miles away .     .   more than ever  william wished that the memory of his brother had come earlier .  it should have .  .  .  . surely it should have .  but there had been the flattery of the request and the excitement that had begun to grow in him after a while .  perhaps he had deliberately avoided remembering .  to begin with  there had been the exhilaration of dmitri large coming to see him in his own proper presence .  he had come from dallas to new york by plane and that had been very titillating for william  whose secret vice it was to read thrillers .  in the thrillers  men and women always traveled mass wise when secrecy was desired .  after all  electronic travel was public property   at least in the thrillers  where every radiation beam of whatever kind was invariably bugged .  william had said so in a kind of morbid half attempt at humor  but dmitri hadn   t seemed to be listening .  he was staring at william   s face and his thoughts seemed elsewhere .     i   m sorry     he said finally .     you remind me of someone .      and yet that hadn   t given it away to william .  how was that possible .  he had eventual occasion to wonder .   dmitri large was a small plump man who seemed to be in a perpetual twinkle even when he declared himself worried or annoyed .  he had a round and bulbous nose  pronounced cheeks  and softness everywhere .  he emphasized his last name and said with a quickness that led william to suppose he said it often     size is not all the large there is  my friend .     in the talk that followed  william protested much .  he knew nothing about computers .  nothing .  he had not the faintest idea of how they worked or how they were programmed .     no matter  no matter     dmitri said  shoving the point aside with an expressive gesture of the hand .     we know the computers  we can set up the programs .  you just tell us what it is a computer must be made to do so that it will work like a brain and not like a computer .        i   m not sure i know enough about how a brain works to be able to tell you that  dmitri     said william .     you are the foremost homologist in the world     said dmitri .     i have checked that out carefully .     and that disposed of that .  william listened with gathering gloom .  he supposed it was inevitable .  dip a person into one particular specialty deeply enough and long enough  and he would automatically begin to assume that specialists in all other fields were magicians  judging the depth of their wisdom by the breadth of his own ignorance .  .  .  . and as time went on  william learned a great deal more of the mercury project than it seemed to him at the time that he cared to .  he said at last     why use a computer at all  then .  why not have one of your own men  or relays of them  receive the material from the robot and send back instructions .        oh  oh  oh     said dmitri  almost bouncing in his chair in his eagerness .     you see  you are not aware .  men are too slow to analyze quickly all the material the robot will send back   temperatures and gas pressures and cosmic   ray fluxes and solar wind intensities and chemical compositions and soil textures and easily three dozen more items   and then try to decide on the next step .  a human being would merely guide the robot  and ineffectively  a computer would be the robot .     and then  too     he went on     men are too fast  also .  it takes radiation of any kind anywhere from ten to twenty two minutes to take the round trip between mercury and earth  depending on where each is in its orbit .  nothing can be done about that .  you get an observation  you give an order  but much has happened between the time the observation is made and the response returns .  men can   t adapt to the slowness of the speed of light  but a computer can take that into account .  .  .  . come help us  william .     william said gloomily     you are certainly welcome to consult me  for what good that might do you .  my private tv beam is at your service .        but it   s not consultation i want .  you must come with me .        mass wise .     said william  shocked .     yes  of course .  a project like this can   t be carried out by sitting at opposite ends of a laser beam with a communications satellite in the middle .  in the long run  it is too expensive  too inconvenient  and  of course  it lacks all privacy      it was like a thriller  william decided .     come to dallas     said dmitri     and let me show you what we have there .  let me show you the facilities .  talk to some of our computer men .  give them the benefit of your way of thought .     it was time  william thought  to be decisive .     dmitri     he said     i have work of my own here .  important work that i do not wish to leave .  to do what you want me to do may take me away from my laboratory for months .        months .     said dmitri  clearly taken aback .     my good william  it may well be years .  but surely it will be your work .        no  it will not .  i know what my work is and guiding a robot on mercury is not it .        why not .  if you do it properly  you will learn more about the brain merely by trying to make a computer work like one  and you will come back here  finally  better equipped to do what you now consider your work .  and while you   re gone  will you have no associates to carry on .  and can you not be in constant communication with them by laser beam and television .  and can you not visit new york on occasion .  briefly .     william was moved .  the thought of working on the brain from another direction did hit home .  from that point on  he found himself looking for excuses to go  at least to visit  at least to see what it was all like .  .  .  . he could always return .  then there followed dmitri   s visit to the ruins of old new york  which he enjoyed with artless excitement  but then there was no more magnificent spectacle of the useless gigantism of the pre cats than old new york  . william began to wonder if the trip might not give him an opportunity to see some sights as well .  he even began to think that for some time he had been considering the possibility of finding a new bedmate  and it would be more convenient to find one in another geographical area where he would not stay permanently .    or was it that even then  when he knew nothing but the barest beginning of what was needed  there had already come to him  like the twinkle of a distant lightning flash  what might be done so he eventually went to dallas and stepped out on the roof and there was dmitri again  beaming .  then  with eyes narrowing  the little man turned and said     i knew  what a remarkable resemblance .     william   s eyes opened wide and there  visibly shrinking backward  was enough of his own face to make him certain at once that anthony was standing before him .  he read very plainly in anthony   s face a longing to bury the relationship .  all william needed to say was    how remarkable .     and let it go .  the gene patterns of mankind were complex enough  after all  to allow resemblances of any reasonable degree even without kinship .  but of course william was a homologist and no one can work with the intricacies of the human brain without growing insensitive as to its details  so he said     i   m sure this is anthony  my brother .     dmitri said     your brother .        my father     said william     had two boys by the same woman  my mother .  they were eccentric people .     he then stepped forward  hand outstretched  and anthony had no choice but to take it .  .  .  . the incident was the topic of conversation  the only topic  for the next several days .     .   it was small consolation to anthony that william was contrite enough when he realized what he had done .  they sat together after dinner that night and william said     my apologies .  i thought that if we got the worst out at once that would end it .  it doesn   t seem to have done so .  i   ve signed no papers  made no formal agreement .  i will leave .        what good would that do .     said anthony ungraciously .     everyone knows now .  two bodies and one face .  it   s enough to make one puke .        if i leave         you can   t leave .  this whole thing is my idea .        to get me here .     william   s heavy lids lifted as far as they might and his eyebrows climbed .     no  of course not .  to get a homologist here .  how could i possibly know they would send you .        but if i leave         no .  the only thing we can do now is to lick the problem  if it can be done .  then  it won   t matter .      everything is forgiven those who succeed  he thought .      i don   t know that i can         we   ll have to try .  dmitri will place it on us .  it   s too good a chance .  you two are brothers     anthony said  mimicking dmitri   s tenor voice     and understand each other .  why not work together .     then  in his own voice  angrily     so we must .  to begin with  what is it you do  william .  i mean  more precisely than the word    homology    can explain by itself .     william sighed .     well  please accept my regrets .  .  .  . i work with autistic children .        i   m afraid i don   t know what that means .        without going into a long song and dance  i deal with children who do not reach out into the world  do not communicate with others  but who sink into themselves and exist behind a wall of skin  somewhat unreachably .  i hope to be able to cure it someday .        is that why you call yourself anti aut .        yes  as a matter of fact .     anthony laughed briefly  but he was not really amused .  a chill crept into william   s manner .     it is an honest name .        i   m sure it is     muttered anthony hurriedly  and could bring himself to no more specific apology .  with an effort  he restored the subject      and are you making any progress .        toward the cure .  no  so far .  toward understanding  yes .  and the more i understand      william   s voice grew warmer as he spoke and his eyes more distant .  anthony recognized it for what it was  the pleasure of speaking of what fills one   s heart and mind to the exclusion of almost everything else .  he felt it in himself often enough .  he listened as closely as he might to something he didn   t really understand  for it was necessary to do so .  he would expect william to listen to him .  how clearly he remembered it .  he thought at the time he would not  but at the time  of course  he was not aware of what was happening .  thinking back  in the glare of hindsight  he found himself remembering whole sentences  virtually word for word .     so it seemed to us     william said     that the autistic child was not failing to receive the impressions  or even failing to interpret them in quite a sophisticated manner .  he was  rather  disapproving them and rejecting them  without any loss of the potentiality of full communication if some impression could be found which he approved of .        ah     said anthony  making just enough of a sound to indicate that he was listening .     nor can you persuade him out of his autism in any ordinary way  for he disapproves of you just as much as he disapproves of the rest of the world .  but if you place him in conscious arrest         in what .        it is a technique we have in which  in effect  the brain is divorced from the body and can perform its functions without reference to the body .  it is a rather sophisticated technique devised in our own laboratory  actually      he paused .     by yourself .     asked anthony gently .     actually  yes     said william  reddening slightly  but clearly pleased .     in conscious arrest  we can supply the body with designed fantasies and observe the brain under differential electroencephalography .  we can at once learn more about the autistic individual  what kind of sense impressions he most wants  and we learn more about the brain generally .        ah     said anthony  and this time it was a real ah .     and all this you have learned about brains   can you not adapt it to the workings of a computer .        no     said william .     not a chance .  i told that to dmitri .  i know nothing about computers and not enough about brains .        if i teach you about computers and tell you in detail what we need  what then .        it won   t do .  it         brother     anthony said  and he tried to make it an impressive word .     you owe me something .  please make an honest attempt to give our problem some thought .  whatever you know about the brain  please adapt it to our computers .     william shifted uneasily  and said     i understand your position .  i will try .  i will honestly try .        .   william had tried  and as anthony had predicted  the two had been left to work together .  at first they encountered others now and then and william had tried to use the shock value of the announcement that they were brothers since there was no use in denial .  eventually that stopped  however  and there came to be a purposeful non interference .  when william approached anthony  or anthony approached william  anyone else who might be present faded silently into the walls .  they even grew used to each other after a fashion and sometimes spoke to each other almost as though there were no resemblance between them at all and no childish memories in common .  anthony made the computer requirements plain in reasonably non technical language and william  after long thought  explained how it seemed to him a computer might do the work  more or less  of a brain .  anthony said     would that be possible .        i don   t know     said william .     i am not eager to try .  it may not work .  but it may .        we    d have to talk to dmitri large .        let   s talk it over ourselves first and see what we   ve got .  we can go to him with as reasonable a proposition as we can put together .  or else  not go to him .     anthony hesitated     we both go to him .     william said delicately     you be my spokesman .  there is no reason that we need be seen together .        thank you  william .  if anything comes of this  you will get full credit from me .     william said     i have no worries about that .  if there is anything to this  i will be the only one who can make it work  i suppose .     they thrashed it out through four or five meetings and if anthony hadn   t been kin and if there hadn   t been that sticky  emotional situation between them  william would have been uncomplicatedly proud of the younger brother  for his quick understanding of an alien field .  there were then long conferences with dmitri large .  there were  in fact  conferences with everyone .  anthony saw them through endless days  and then they came to see william separately .  and eventually  through an agonizing pregnancy  what came to be called the mercury computer was authorized .  william then returned to new york with some relief .  he did not plan to stay in new york  would he have thought that possible two months earlier .   but there was much to do at the homological institute .  more conferences were necessary  of course  to explain to his own laboratory group what was happening and why he had to take leave and how they were to continue their own projects without him .  then there was a much more elaborate arrival at dallas with the essential equipment and with two young aides for what would have to be an open ended stay .  nor did william even look back  figuratively speaking .  his own laboratory and its needs faded from his thoughts .  he was now thoroughly committed to his new task .     .   it was the worst period for anthony .  the relief during william   s absence had not penetrated deep and there began the nervous agony of wondering whether perhaps  hope against hope  he might not return .  might he not choose to send a deputy  someone else  anyone else .  anyone with a different face so that anthony need not feel the half of a two backed four legged monster .  but it was william .  anthony had watched the freight plane come silently through the air  had watched it unload from a distance .  but even from that distance he eventually saw william .  that was that .  anthony left .  he went to see dmitri that afternoon .     it   s not necessary  dmitri  for me to stay  surely .  we   ve worked out the details and someone else can take over .        no  no     said dmitri .     the idea was yours in the first place .  you must see it through .  there is no point in needlessly dividing the credit .     anthony thought  no one else will take the risk .  there   s still the chance of fiasco .  i might have known .  he had known  but he said stolidly     you understand i cannot work with william .        but why not .     dmitri pretended surprise .     you have been doing so well together .        i have been straining my guts over it  dmitri  and they won   t take any more .  don   t you suppose i know how it looks .        my good fellow .  you make too much of it .  sure the men stare .  they are human  after all .  but they   ll get used to it .  i   m used to it .     you are not  you fat liar  anthony thought .  he said     i   m not used to it .        you   re not looking at it properly .  your parents were peculiar  but after all  what they did wasn   t illegal  only peculiar  only peculiar .  it   s not your fault  or william   s .  neither of you is to blame .        we carry the mark     said anthony  making a quick curving gesture of his hand to his face .     it   s not the mark you think .  i see differences .  you are distinctly younger in appearance .  your hair is wavier .  it   s only at first glance that there is a similarity .  come  anthony  there will be all the time you want  all the help you need  all the equipment you can use .  i   m sure it will work marvelously .  think of the satisfaction      anthony weakened  of course  and agreed at least to help william set up the equipment .  william  too  seemed sure it would work marvelously .  not as frenetically as dmitri did  but with a kind of calmness .     it   s only a matter of the proper connections     he said     though i must admit that that   s quite a huge    only .     your end of it will be to arrange sensory impressions on an independent screen so that we can exert   well  i can   t say manual control  can i .   so that we can exert intellectual control to override  if necessary .        that can be done     said anthony .     then let   s get going .  .  .  . look  i   ll need a week at least to arrange the connections and make sure of the instructions         programming      said anthony .     well  this is your place  so i   ll use your terminology .  my assistants and i will program the mercury computer  but not in your fashion .        i should hope not .  we would want a homologist to set up a much more subtle program than anything a mere telemetrist could do .     he did not try to hide the self hating irony in his words .  william let the tone go and accepted the words .  he said     well begin simply .  we   ll have the robot walk .        .   a week later  the robot walked in arizona  a thousand miles away .  he walked stiffly  and sometimes he fell down  and sometimes he clanked his ankle against an obstruction  and sometimes he whirled on one foot and went off in a surprising new direction .     he   s a baby  learning to walk     said william .  dmitri came occasionally  to learn of progress .     that   s remarkable     he would say .  anthony didn   t think so .  weeks passed  then months .  the robot had progressively done more and more  as the mercury computer had been placed  progressively  under a more and more complex programming .   william had a tendency to refer to the mercury computer as a brain  but anthony wouldn   t allow it .   and all that happened wasn   t good enough .     it   s not good enough  william     he said finally .  he had not slept the night before .     isn   t that strange .     said william coolly .     i was going to say that i thought we had it about beaten .     anthony held himself together with difficulty .  the strain of working with william and of watching the robot fumble was more than he could bear .     i   m going to resign  william .  the whole job .  i   m sorry .  .  .  . it   s not you .        but it is i  anthony .        it isn   t all you  william .  it   s failure .  we won   t make it .  you see how clumsily the robot handles himself  even though he   s on earth  only a thousand miles away  with the signal round trip only a tiny fraction of a second in time .  on mercury  there will be minutes of delay  minutes for which the mercury computer will have to allow .  it   s madness to think it will work .     william said     don   t resign  anthony .  you can   t resign now .  i suggest we have the robot sent to mercury .  i   m convinced he   s ready .     anthony laughed loudly and insultingly .     you   re crazy  william .        i   m not .  you seem to think it will be harder on mercury  but it won   t be .  it   s harder on earth .  this robot is designed for one third earth normal gravity  and he   s working in arizona at full gravity .  he   s designed for       c  and he   s got       c .  he   s designed for vacuum and he   s working in an atmospheric soup .        that robot can take the difference .        the metal structure can  i suppose  but what about the computer right here .  it doesn   t work well with a robot that isn   t in the environment he   s designed for .  .  .  . look  anthony  if you want a computer that is as complex as a brain  you have to allow for idiosyncrasies .  .  .  . come  let   s make a deal .  if you will push  with me  to have the robot sent to mercury  that will take six months  and i will take a sabbatical for that period .  you will be rid of me .        who   ll take care of the mercury computer .        by now you understand how it works  and i   ll have my two men here to help you .     anthony shook his head defiantly .     i can   t take the responsibility for the computer  and i won   t take the responsibility for suggesting that the robot be sent to mercury .  it won   t work .        i   m sure it will .        you can   t be sure .  and the responsibility is mine .  i   m the one who   ll bear the blame .  it will be nothing to you .     anthony later remembered this as a crucial moment .  william might have let it go .  anthony would have resigned .  all would have been lost .  but william said     nothing to me .  look  dad had this thing about mom .  all right .  i   m sorry  too .  i   m as sorry as anyone can be  but it   s done  and there   s something funny that has resulted .  when i speak of dad  i mean your dad  too  and there   s lots of pairs of people who can say that  two brothers  two sisters  a brother and sister .  and then when i say mom  i mean your mom  and there are lots of pairs who can say that  too .  but i don   t know any other pair  nor have i heard of any other pair  who can share both dad and mom .        i know that     said anthony grimly .     yes  but look at it from my standpoint     said william hurriedly .     i   m a homologist .  i work with gene patterns .  have you ever thought of our gene patterns .  we share both parents  which means that our gene patterns are closer together than any other pair on this planet .  our very faces show it .        i know that  too .        so that if this project were to work  and if you were to gain glory from it  it would be your gene pattern that would have been proven highly useful to mankind  and that would mean very much my gene pattern as well .  .  .  . don   t you see  anthony .  i share your parents  your face  your gene pattern  and therefore either your glory or your disgrace .  it is mine almost as much as yours  and if any credit or blame adheres to me  it is yours almost as much as mine  too .  i   ve got to be interested in your success .  i   ve a motive for that which no one else on earth has   a purely selfish one  one so selfish you can be sure it   s there .  i   m on your side  anthony  because you   re very nearly me .     they looked at each other for a long time  and for the first time  anthony did so without noticing the face he shared .  william said     so let us ask that the robot be sent to mercury .     and anthony gave in .  and after dmitri had approved the request    he had been waiting to  after all   anthony spent much of the day in deep thought .  then he sought out william and said     listen .     there was a long pause which william did not break .  anthony said again     listen .     william waited patiently .  anthony said     there   s really no need for you to leave .  i   m sure you wouldn   t like to have the mercury computer tended by anyone but yourself .     william said     you mean you intend to leave .     anthony said     no  i   ll stay  too .     william said     we needn   t see much of each other .     all of this had been  for anthony  like speaking with a pair of hands clenched about his windpipe .  the pressure seemed to tighten now  but he managed the hardest statement of all .     we don   t have to avoid each other .  we don   t have to .     william smiled rather uncertainly .  anthony didn   t smile at all  he left quickly .     .   william looked up from his book .  it was at least a month since he had ceased being vaguely surprised at having anthony enter .  he said      anything wrong .        who can say .  they   re coming in for the soft landing .  is the mercury computer in action .     william knew anthony knew the computer status perfectly  but he said     by tomorrow morning  anthony .         and there are no problems .        none at all .        then we have to wait for the soft landing .        yes .     anthony said     something will go wrong .        rocketry is surely an old hand at this .  nothing will go wrong .        so much work wasted .        it   s not wasted yet .  it won   t be .     anthony said     maybe you   re right .     hands deep in his pockets  he drifted away  stopping at the door just before touching contact .     thanks .        for what  anthony .        for being   comforting .     william smiled wryly and was relieved his emotions didn   t show .      .   virtually the entire body of personnel of the mercury project was on hand for the crucial moment .  anthony  who had no tasks to perform  remained well to the rear  his eyes on the monitors .  the robot had been activated and there were visual messages being returned .  at least they came out as the equivalent of visual  and they showed as yet nothing but a dim glow of light which was  presumably  mercury   s surface .  shadows flitted across the screen  probably irregularities on that surface .  anthony couldn   t tell by eye alone  but those at the controls  who were analyzing the data by methods more subtle than could be disposed of by unaided eye  seemed calm .  none of the little red lights that might have betokened emergency were lighting .  anthony was watching the key observers rather than the screen .  he should be down with william and the others at the computer .  it was going to be thrown in only when the soft landing was made .  he should be .  he couldn   t be .  the shadows flitted across the screen more rapidly .  the robot was descending   too quickly .  surely  too quickly .  there was a last blur and a steadiness  a shift of focus in which the blur grew darker  then fainter .  a sound was heard and there were perceptible seconds before anthony realized what it was the sound was saying     soft landing achieved .  soft landing achieved .     then a murmur arose and became an excited hum of self congratulation until one more change took place on the screen and the sound of human words and laughter was stopped as though there had been a smash collision against a wall of silence .  for the screen changed  changed and grew sharp .  in the brilliant  brilliant sunlight  blazing through the carefully filtered screen  they could now see a boulder clear  burning white on one side  ink on ink on the other .  it shifted right  then back to left  as though a pair of eyes were looking left  then right .  a metal hand appeared on the screen as though the eyes were looking at part of itself .  it was anthony   s voice that cried out at last     the computer   s been thrown in .     he heard the words as though someone else had shouted them and he raced out and down the stairs and through a corridor  leaving the babble of voices to rise behind him .     william     he cried as he burst into the computer room     it   s perfect  it   s      but william   s hand was upraised .     shh .  please .  i don   t want any violent sensations entering except those from the robot .        you mean we can be heard .     whispered anthony .     maybe not  but i don   t know .     there was another screen  a smaller one  in the room with the mercury computer .  the scene on it was different  and changing  the robot was moving .  william said     the robot is feeling its way .  those steps have got to be clumsy .  there   s a seven minute delay between stimulus and response and that has to be allowed for .        but already he   s walking more surely than he ever did in arizona .  don   t you think so  william .  don   t you think so .     anthony was gripping william   s shoulder  shaking it  eyes never leaving the screen .  william said     i   m sure of it  anthony .     the sun burned down in a warm contrasting world of white and black  of white sun against black sky and white rolling ground mottled with black shadow .  the bright sweet smell of the sun on every exposed square centimeter of metal contrasting with the creeping death of aroma on the other side .  he lifted his hand and stared at it  counting the fingers .  hot hot hot  turning  putting each finger  one by one  into the shadow of the others and the hot slowly dying in a change in tactility that made him feel the clean  comfortable vacuum .  yet not entirely vacuum .  he straightened and lifted both arms over his head  stretching them out  and the sensitive spots on either wrist felt the vapors   the thin  faint touch of tin and lead rolling through the cloy of mercury .  the thicker taste rose from his feet  the silicates of each variety  marked by the clear separate and together touch and tang of each metal ion .  he moved one foot slowly through the crunchy  caked dust  and felt the changes like a soft  not quite random symphony .  and over all the sun .  he looked up at it  large and fat and bright and hot  and heard its joy .  he watched the slow rise of prominences around its rim and listened to the crackling sound of each  and to the other happy noises over the broad face .  when he dimmed the background light  the red of the rising wisps of hydrogen showed in bursts of mellow contralto  and the deep bass of the spots amid the muted whistling of the wispy  moving faculae  and the occasional thin keening of a flare  the ping pong ticking of gamma rays and cosmic particles  and over all in every direction the soft  fainting  and ever renewed sigh of the sun   s substance rising and retreating forever in a cosmic wind which reached out and bathed him in glory .  he jumped  and rose slowly in the air with a freedom he had never felt  and jumped again when he landed  and ran  and jumped  and ran again  with a body that responded perfectly to this glorious world  this paradise in which he found himself .  a stranger so long and so lost   in paradise at last .  william said     it   s all right .        but what   s he doing .     cried out anthony .     it   s all right .  the programming is working .  he has tested his senses .  he has been making the various visual observations .  he has dimmed the sun and studied it .  he has tested for atmosphere and for the chemical nature of the soil .  it all works .        but why is he running .        i rather think that   s his own idea  anthony .  if you want to program a computer as complicated as a brain  you   ve got to expect it to have ideas of its own .        running .  jumping .     anthony turned an anxious face to william .     he   ll hurt himself .  you can handle the computer .  override .  make him stop .     and william said sharply     no .  i won   t .  i   ll take the chance of his hurting himself .  don   t you understand .  he   s happy .  he was on earth  a world he was never equipped to handle .  now he   s on mercury with a body perfectly adapted to its environment  as perfectly adapted as a hundred specialized scientists could make it be .  it   s paradise for him  let him enjoy it .        enjoy .  he   s a robot .        i   m not talking about the robot .  i   m talking about the brain  the brain  that   s living here .     the mercury computer  enclosed in glass  carefully and delicately wired  its integrity most subtly preserved  breathed and lived .     it   s randall who   s in paradise     said william .     he   s found the world for whose sake he autistically fled this one .  he has a world his new body fits perfectly in exchange for the world his old body did not fit at all .     anthony watched the screen in wonder .     he seems to be quieting .        of course     said william     and he   ll do his job all the better for his joy .     anthony smiled and said     we   ve done it  then  you and i .  shall we join the rest and let them fawn on us  william .     william said     together .     and anthony linked arms .     together  brother .      light verse  the very last person anyone would expect to be a murderer was mrs .  avis lardner .  widow of the great astronaut martyr  she was a philanthropist  an art collector  a hostess extraordinary  and  everyone agreed  an artistic genius .  but above all  she was the gentlest and kindest human being one could imagine .  her husband  william j .  lardner  died  as we all know  of the effects of radiation from a solar flare  after he had deliberately remained in space so that a passenger vessel might make it safely to space station   .  mrs .  lardner had received a generous pension for that  and she had then invested wisely and well .  by late middle age she was very wealthy .  her house was a showplace  a veritable museum  containing a small but extremely select collection of extraordinarily beautiful jeweled objects .  from a dozen different cultures she had obtained relics of almost every conceivable artifact that could be embedded with jewels and made to serve the aristocracy of that culture .  she had one of the first jeweled wristwatches manufactured in america  a jeweled dagger from cambodia  a jeweled pair of spectacles from italy  and so on almost endlessly .  all was open for inspection .  the artifacts were not insured  and there were no ordinary security provisions .  there was no need for anything conventional  for mrs .  lardner maintained a large staff of robot servants  all of whom could be relied on to guard every item with imperturbable concentration  irreproachable honesty  and irrevocable efficiency .  everyone knew the existence of those robots and there is no record of any attempt at theft  ever .  and then  of course  there was her light sculpture .  how mrs .  lardner discovered her own genius at the art  no guest at her many lavish entertainments could guess .  on each occasion  however  when her house was thrown open to guests  a new symphony of light shone throughout the rooms  three dimensional curves and solids in melting color  some pure and some fusing in startling  crystalline effects that bathed every guest in wonder and somehow always adjusted itself so as to make mrs .  lardner   s blue white hair and soft  unlined face gently beautiful .  it was for the light sculpture more than anything else that the guests came .  it was never the same twice  and never failed to explore new experimental avenues of art .  many people who could afford light consoles prepared light sculptures for amusement  but no one could approach mrs .  lardner   s expertise .  not even those who considered themselves professional artists .  she herself was charmingly modest about it .     no  no     she would protest when someone waxed lyrical .     i wouldn   t call it    poetry in light .     that   s far too kind .  at most  i would say it was mere    light verse .        and everyone smiled at her gentle wit .  though she was often asked  she would never create light sculpture for any occasion but her own parties .     that would be commercialization     she said .  she had no objection  however  to the preparation of elaborate holograms of her sculptures so that they might be made permanent and reproduced in museums of art an over the world .  nor was there ever a charge for any use that might be made of her light sculptures .     i couldn   t ask a penny     she said  spreading her arms wide .     it   s free to all .  after all  i have no further use for it myself .     it was truer she never used the same light sculpture twice .  when the holograms were taken  she was cooperation itself .  watching benignly at every step  she was always ready to order her robot servants to help .     please  courtney     she would say     would you be so kind as to adjust the step ladder .     it was her fashion .  she always addressed her robots with the most formal courtesy .  once  years before  she had been almost scolded by a government functionary from the bureau of robots and mechanical men .     you can   t do that     he said severely .     it interferes with their efficiency .  they are constructed to follow orders  and the more clearly you give those orders  the more efficiently they follow them .  when you ask with elaborate politeness  it is difficult for them to understand that an order is being given .  they react more slowly .     mrs .  lardner lifted her aristocratic head .     i do not ask for speed and efficiency     she said .     i ask goodwill .  my robots love me .     the government functionary might have explained that robots cannot love  but he withered under her hurt but gentle glance .  it was notorious that mrs .  lardner never even returned a robot to the factory for adjustment .  their positronic brains are enormously complex  and once in ten times or so the adjustment is not perfect as it leaves the factory .  sometimes the error does not show up for a period of time  but whenever it does  u .  s .  robots and mechanical men  inc .   always makes the adjustment free of charge .  mrs .  lardner shook her head .     once a robot is in my house     she said     and has performed his duties  any minor eccentricities must be borne with .  i will not have him manhandled .     it was the worse thing possible to try to explain that a robot was but a machine .  she would say very stiffly     nothing that is as intelligent as a robot can ever be but a machine .  i treat them as people .     and that was that .  she kept even max  although he was almost helpless .  he could scarcely understand what was expected of him .  mrs .  lardner denied that strenuously  however .     not at all     she would say firmly .     he can take hats and coats and store them very well  indeed .  he can hold objects for me .  he can do many things .        but why not have him adjusted .     asked a friend  once .     oh  i couldn   t .  he   s himself .  he   s very lovable  you know .  after all  a positronic brain is so complex that no one can ever tell in just what way it   s off .  if he were made perfectly normal there would be no way to adjust him back to the lovability he now has .  i won   t give that up .        but if he   s maladjusted     said the friend  looking at max nervously     might he not be dangerous .        never     laughed mrs .  lardner .     i   ve had him for years .  he   s completely harmless and quite a dear .     actually he looked like all the other robots  smooth  metallic  vaguely human but expressionless .  to the gentle mrs .  lardner  however  they were all individual  all sweet  all lovable .  it was the kind of woman she was .  how could she commit murder .   the very last person anyone would expect to be murdered would be john semper travis .  introverted and gentle  he was in the world but not of it .  he had that peculiar mathematical turn of mind that made it possible for him to work out in his mind the complicated tapestry of the myriad positronic brain paths in a robot   s mind .  he was chief engineer of u . s .  robots and mechanical men  inc .  but he was also an enthusiastic amateur in light sculpture .  he had written a book on the subject  trying to show that the type of mathematics he used in working out positronic brain paths might be modified into a guide to the production of aesthetic light sculpture .  his attempt at putting theory into practice was a dismal failure  however .  the sculptures he himself produced  following his mathematical principles  were stodgy  mechanical  and uninteresting .  it was the only reason for unhappiness in his quiet  introverted  and secure life  and yet it was reason enough for him to be very unhappy indeed .  he knew his theories were right  yet he could not make them work .  if he could but produce one great piece of light sculpture   naturally  he knew of mrs .  lardner   s light sculpture .  she was universally hailed as a genius  yet travis knew she could not understand even the simplest aspect of robotic mathematics .  he had corresponded with her but she consistently refused to explain her methods  and he wondered if she had any at all .  might it not be mere intuition .    but even intuition might be reduced to mathematics .  finally he managed to receive an invitation to one of her parties .  he simply had to see her .  mr .  travis arrived rather late .  he had made one last attempt at a piece of light sculpture and had failed dismally .  he greeted mrs .  lardner with a kind of puzzled respect and said     that was a peculiar robot who took my hat and coat .        that is max     said mrs .  lardner .     he is quite maladjusted  and he   s a fairly old model .  how is it you did not return it to the factory .        oh  no     said mrs .  lardner .     it would be too much trouble .        none at all  mrs .  lardner     said travis .     you would be surprised how simple a task it was .  since i am with u .  s .  robots  i took the liberty of adjusting him myself .  it took no time and you   ll find he is now in perfect working order .     a queer change came over mrs .  lardner   s face .  fury found a place on it for the first time in her gentle life  and it was as though the lines did not know how to form .     you adjusted him .     she shrieked .     but it was he who created my light sculptures .  it was the maladjustment  the maladjustment  which you can never restore  that  that      it was really unfortunate that she had been showing her collection at the time and that the jeweled dagger from cambodia was on the marble tabletop before her .  travis   s face was also distorted .     you mean if i had studied his uniquely maladjusted positronic brain paths i might have learned      she lunged with the knife too quickly for anyone to stop her and he did not try to dodge .  some said he came to meet it  as though he wanted to die .   segregationist  the surgeon looked up without expression .     is he ready .        ready is a relative term     said the med eng .     we   re ready .  he   s restless .        they always are .   .   .   .  well  it   s a serious operation .        serious or not  he should be thankful .  he   s been chosen for it over an enormous number of possibles and frankly  i don   t think  .   .   .        don   t say it     said the surgeon .     the decision is not ours to make .        we accept it .  but do we have to agree .        yes     said the surgeon  crisply .     we agree .  completely and wholeheartedly .  the operation is entirely too intricate to approach with mental reservations .  this man has proven his worth in a number of ways and his profile is suitable for the board of mortality .        all right     said the med eng  unmollified .  the surgeon said     i   ll see him right in here  i think .  it is small enough and personal enough to be comforting .        it won   t help .  he   s nervous  and he   s made up his mind .        has he indeed .        yes .  he wants metal  they always do .     the surgeon   s face did not change expression .  he stared at his hands .     sometimes one can talk them out of it .        why bother .     said the med eng  indifferently .     if he wants metal  let it be metal .        you don   t care .        why should i .     the med eng said it almost brutally .     either way it   s a medical engineering problem and i   m a medical engineer .  either way  i can handle it .  why should i go beyond that .     the surgeon said stolidly     to me  it is a matter of the fitness of things .        fitness .  you can   t use that as an argument .  what does the patient care about the fitness of things .        i care .        you care in a minority .  the trend is against you .  you have no chance .        i have to try .     the surgeon waved the med eng into silence with a quick wave of his hand  no impatience to it  merely quickness .  he had already informed the nurse and he had already been signaled concerning her approach .  he pressed a small button and the double door pulled swiftly apart .  the patient moved inward in his motorchair  the nurse stepping briskly along beside him .     you may go  nurse     said the surgeon     but wait outside .  i will be calling you .     he nodded to the med eng  who left with the nurse  and the door closed behind them .  the man in the chair looked over his shoulder and watched them go .  his neck was scrawny and there were fine wrinkles about his eyes .  he was freshly shaven and the fingers of his hands  as they gripped the arms of the chair tightly  showed manicured nails .  he was a high priority patient and he was being taken care of .   .  .  .  but there was a look of settled peevishness on his face .  he said     will we be starting today .     the surgeon nodded .     this afternoon  senator .        i understand it will take weeks .        not for the operation itself  senator .  but there are a number of subsidiary points to be taken care of .  there are some circulatory renovations that must be carried through  and hormonal adjustments .  these are tricky things .        are they dangerous .     then  as though feeling the need for establishing a friendly relationship  but patently against his will  he added      .   .   .  doctor .     the surgeon paid no attention to the nuances of expression .  he said  flatly     everything is dangerous .  we take our time in order that it be less dangerous .  it is the time required  the skill of many individuals united  the equipment  that makes such operations available to so few .  .  .        i know that     said the patient  restlessly .     i refuse to feel guilty about that .  or are you implying improper pressure .        not at all  senator .  the decisions of the board have never been questioned .  i mention the difficulty and intricacy of the operation merely to explain my desire to have it conducted in the best fashion possible .        well  do so  then .  that is my desire  also .        then i must ask you to make a decision .  it is possible to supply you with either of two types of cyber hearts  metal or  .   .   .        plastic .     said the patient  irritably .     isn   t that the alternative you were going to offer  doctor .  cheap plastic .  i don   t want that .  i   ve made my choice .  i want the metal .        but  .   .   .        see here .  i   ve been told the choice rests with me .  isn   t that so .     the surgeon nodded .     where two alternate procedures are of equal value from a medical standpoint  the choice rests with the patient .  in actual practice  the choice rests with the patient even when the alternate procedures are not of equal value  as in this case .     the patient   s eyes narrowed .     are you trying to tell me the plastic heart is superior .        it depends on the patient .  in my opinion  in your individual case  it is .  and we prefer not to use the term  plastic .  it is a fibrous cyber heart .        it   s plastic as far as i am concerned .        senator     said the surgeon  infinitely patient     the material is not plastic in the ordinary sense of the word .  it is a polymeric material true  but one that is far more complex than ordinary plastic .  it is a complex protein like fibre designed to imitate  as closely as possible  the natural structure of the human heart you now have within your chest .        exactly  and the human heart i now have within my chest is worn out although i am not yet sixty years old .  i don   t want another one like it  thank you .  i want something better .        we all want something better for you  senator .  the fibrous cyber heart will be better .  it has a potential life of centuries .  it is absolutely non allergenic  .  .  .        isn   t that so for the metallic heart  too .        yes  it is     said the surgeon .     the metallic cyber is of titanium alloy that  .   .   .        and it doesn   t wear out .  and it is stronger than plastic .  or fibre or whatever you want to call it .        the metal is physically stronger  yes  but mechanical strength is not a point at issue .  its mechanical strength does you no particular good since the heart is well protected .  anything capable of reaching the heart will kill you for other reasons even if the heart stands up under manhandling .     the patient shrugged .     if i ever break a rib  i   ll have that replaced by titanium  also .  replacing bones is easy .  anyone can have that done anytime .  i   ll be as metallic as i want to be  doctor .        that is your right  if you so choose .  however  it is only fair to tell you that although no metallic cyber heart has ever broken down mechanically  a number have broken down electronically .        what does that mean .        it means that every cyber heart contains a pacemaker as part of its structure .  in the case of the metallic variety  this is an electronic device that keeps the cyber in rhythm .  it means an entire battery of miniaturized equipment must be included to alter the heart   s rhythm to suit an individual   s emotional and physical state .  occasionally something goes wrong there and people have died before that wrong could be corrected .        i never heard of such a thing .        i assure you it happens .        are you telling me it happens often .        not at all .  it happens very rarely .        well  then  i   ll take my chance .  what about the plastic heart .  doesn   t that contain a pacemaker .        of course it does  senator .  but the chemical structure of a fibrous cyber heart is quite close to that of human tissue .  it can respond to the ionic and hormonal controls of the body itself .  the total complex that need be inserted is far simpler than in the case of the metal cyber .        but doesn   t the plastic heart ever pop out of hormonal control .        none has ever yet done so .        because you haven   t been working with them long enough .  isn   t that so .     the surgeon hesitated .     it is true that the fibrous cybers have not been used nearly as long as the metallic .        there you are .  what is it anyway  doctor .  are you afraid i   m making myself into a robot  .   .   .  into a metallo  as they call them since citizenship went through .        there is nothing wrong with a metallo as a metallo .  as you say  they are citizens .  but you   re not a metallo .  you   re a human being .  why not stay a human being .        because i want the best and that   s a metallic heart .  you see to that .     the surgeon nodded .     very well .  you will be asked to sign the necessary permissions and you will then be fitted with a metal heart .        and you   ll be the surgeon in charge .  they tell me you   re the best .        i will do what i can to make the changeover an easy one .     the door opened and the chair moved the patient out to the waiting nurse .  the med eng came in  looking over his shoulder at the receding patient until the doors had closed again .  he turned to the surgeon .     well  i can   t tell what happened just by looking at you .  what was his decision .     the surgeon bent over his desk  punching out the final items for his records .     what you predicted .  he insists on the metallic cyber heart .        after all  they are better .        not significantly .  they   ve been around longer  no more than that .  it   s this mania that   s been plaguing humanity ever since metallos have become citizens .  men have this odd desire to make metallos out of themselves .  they yearn for the physical strength and endurance one associates with them .        it isn   t one sided  doc .  you don   t work with metallos but i do  so i know .  the last two who came in for repairs have asked for fibrous elements .        did they get them .        in one case  it was just a matter of supplying tendons  it didn   t make much difference there  metal or fibre .  the other wanted a blood system or its equivalent .  i told him i couldn   t  not without a complete rebuilding of the structure of his body in fibrous material .   .  .  .  i suppose it will come to that some day .  metallos that aren   t really metallos at all  but a kind of flesh and blood .        you don   t mind that thought .        why not .  and metallized human beings  too .  we have two varieties of intelligence on earth now and why bother with two .  let them approach each other and eventually we won   t be able to tell the difference .  why should we want to .  we   d have the best of both worlds  the advantages of man combined with those of robot .        you   d get a hybrid     said the surgeon  with something that approached fierceness .     you   d get something that is not both  but neither .  isn   t it logical to suppose an individual would be too proud of his structure and identity to want to dilute it with something alien .  would he want mongrelization .        that   s segregationist talk .        then let it be that .     the surgeon said with calm emphasis     i believe in being what one is .  i wouldn   t change a bit of my own structure for any reason .  if some of it absolutely required replacement  i would have that replacement as close to the original in nature as could possibly be managed .  i am myself  well pleased to be myself  and would not be anything else .     he had finished now and had to prepare for the operation .  he placed his strong hands into the heating oven and let them reach the dull red hot glow that would sterilize them completely .  for all his impassioned words  his voice had never risen  and on his burnished metal face there was  as always  no sign of expression .   robbie     ninety eight   ninety nine   one hundred .     gloria withdrew her chubby little forearm from before her eyes and stood for a moment  wrinkling her nose and blinking in the sunlight .  then  trying to watch in all directions at once  she withdrew a few cautious steps from the tree against which she had been leaning .  she craned her neck to investigate the possibilities of a clump of bushes to the right and then withdrew farther to obtain a better angle for viewing its dark recesses .  the quiet was profound except for the incessant buzzing of insects and the occasional chirrup of some hardy bird  braving the midday sun .  gloria pouted     i bet he went inside the house  and i   ve told him a million times that that   s not fair .     with tiny lips pressed together tightly and a severe frown crinkling her forehead  she moved determinedly toward the two story building up past the driveway .  too late she heard the rustling sound behind her  followed by the distinctive and rhythmic clump clump of robbie   s metal feet .  she whirled about to see her triumphing companion emerge from hiding and make for the home tree at full speed .  gloria shrieked in dismay .     wait  robbie .  that wasn   t fair  robbie .  you promised you wouldn   t run until i found you .     her little feet could make no headway at all against robbie   s giant strides .  then  within ten feet of the goal  robbie   s pace slowed suddenly to the merest of crawls  and gloria  with one final burst of wild speed  dashed pantingly past him to touch the welcome bark of home tree first .  gleefully  she turned on the faithful robbie  and with the basest of ingratitude  rewarded him for his sacrifice by taunting him cruelly for a lack of running ability .     robbie can   t run     she shouted at the top of her eight year old voice .     i can beat him any day .  i can beat him any day .     she chanted the words in a shrill rhythm .  robbie didn   t answer  of course    not in words .  he pantomimed running instead  inching away until gloria found herself running after him as he dodged her narrowly  forcing her to veer in helpless circles  little arms outstretched and fanning at the air .     robbie     she squealed     stand still .        and the laughter was forced out of her in breathless jerks .  until he turned suddenly and caught her up  whirling her round  so that for her the world fell away for a moment with a blue emptiness beneath  and green trees stretching hungrily downward toward the void .  then she was down in the grass again  leaning against robbie   s leg and still holding a hard  metal finger .  after a while  her breath returned .  she pushed uselessly at her disheveled hair in vague imitation of one of her mother   s gestures and twisted to see if her dress were torn .  she slapped her hand against robbie   s torso     bad boy .  i   ll spank you .     and robbie cowered  holding his hands over his face so that she had to add     no  i won   t  robbie .  i won   t spank you .  but anyway  it   s my turn to hide now because you   ve got longer legs and you promised not to run till i found you .     robbie nodded his head    a small parallelepiped with rounded edges and corners attached to a similar but much larger parallelepiped that served as torso by means of a short  flexible stalk    and obediently faced the tree .  a thin  metal film descended over his glowing eyes and from within his body came a steady  resonant ticking .     don   t peek now    and don   t skip any numbers     warned gloria  and scurried for cover .  with unvarying regularity  seconds were ticked off  and at the hundredth  up went the eyelids  and the glowing red of robbie   s eyes swept the prospect .  they rested for a moment on a bit of colorful gingham that protruded from behind a boulder .  he advanced a few steps and convinced himself that it was gloria who squatted behind it .  slowly  remaining always between gloria and home tree  he advanced on the hiding place  and when gloria was plainly in sight and could no longer even theorize to herself that she was not seen  he extended one arm toward her  slapping the other against his leg so that it rang again .  gloria emerged sulkily .     you peeked .     she exclaimed  with gross unfairness .     besides i   m tired of playing hide and seek .  i want a ride .     but robbie was hurt at the unjust accusation  so he seated himself carefully and shook his head ponderously from side to side .  gloria changed her tone to one of gentle coaxing immediately     come on  robbie .  i didn   t mean it about the peeking .  give me a ride .     robbie was not to be won over so easily  though .  he gazed stubbornly at the sky  and shook his head even more emphatically .     please  robbie  please give me a ride .     she encircled his neck with rosy arms and hugged tightly .  then  changing moods in a moment  she moved away .     if you don   t  i   m going to cry     and her face twisted appallingly in preparation .  hard hearted robbie paid scant attention to this dreadful possibility  and shook his head a third time .  gloria found it necessary to play her trump card .     if you don   t     she exclaimed warmly     i won   t tell you any more stories  that   s all .  not one     robbie gave in immediately and unconditionally before this ultimatum  nodding his head vigorously until the metal of his neck hummed .  carefully  he raised the little girl and placed her on his broad  flat shoulders .  gloria   s threatened tears vanished immediately and she crowed with delight .  robbie   s metal skin  kept at a constant temperature of seventy by the high resistance coils within  felt nice and comfortable  while the beautifully loud sound her heels made as they bumped rhythmically against his chest was enchanting .     you   re an air coaster  robbie  you   re a big  silver aircoaster .  hold out your arms straight .     you got to  robbie  if you   re going to be an aircoaster .     the logic was irrefutable .  robbie   s arms were wings catching the air currents and he was a silver    coaster .  gloria twisted the robot   s head and leaned to the right .  he banked sharply .  gloria equipped the    coaster with a motor that went    br r r    and then with weapons that went    powie    and    sh sh shshsh .     pirates were giving chase and the ship   s blasters were coming into play .  the pirates dropped in a steady rain .     got another one .  two more     she cried .  then    faster  men     gloria said pompously     we   re running out of ammunition .     she aimed over her shoulder with undaunted courage and robbie was a blunt nosed spaceship zooming through the void at maximum acceleration .  clear across the field he sped  to the patch of tall grass on the other side  where he stopped with a suddenness that evoked a shriek from his flushed rider  and then tumbled her onto the soft  green carpet .  gloria gasped and panted  and gave voice to intermittent whispered exclamations of    that was nice .     robbie waited until she had caught her breath and then pulled gently at a lock of hair .     you want something .     said gloria  eyes wide in an apparently artless complexity that fooled her huge    nursemaid    not at all .  he pulled the curl harder .     oh  i know .  you want a story .     robbie nodded rapidly .     which one .     robbie made a semi circle in the air with one finger .  the little girl protested     again .  i   ve told you cinderella a million times .  aren   t you tired of it .   it   s for babies .     another semi circle .     oh  well     gloria composed herself  ran over the details of the tale in her mind  together with her own elaborations  of which she had several  and began     are you ready .  well    once upon a time there was a beautiful little girl whose name was ella .  and she had a terribly cruel step mother and two very ugly and very cruel step sisters and      gloria was reaching the very climax of the tale    midnight was striking and everything was changing back to the shabby originals lickety split  while robbie listened tensely with burning eyes    when the interruption came .     gloria .     it was the high pitched sound of a woman who has been calling not once  but several times  and had the nervous tone of one in whom anxiety was beginning to overcome impatience .     mamma   s calling me     said gloria  not quite happily .     you   d better carry me back to the house  robbie .     robbie obeyed with alacrity for somehow there was that in him which judged it best to obey mrs .  weston  without as much as a scrap of hesitation .  gloria   s father was rarely home in the daytime except on sunday    today  for instance    and when he was  he proved a genial and understanding person .  gloria   s mother  however  was a source of uneasiness to robbie and there was always the impulse to sneak away from her sight .  mrs .  weston caught sight of them the minute they rose above the masking tufts of long grass and retired inside the house to wait .     i   ve shouted myself hoarse  gloria     she said  severely .     where were you .        i was with robbie     quavered gloria .     i was telling him cinderella  and i forgot it was dinner time .        well  it   s a pity robbie forgot  too .     then  as if that reminded her of the robot   s presence  she whirled upon him .     you may go  robbie .  she doesn   t need you now .     then  brutally     and don   t come back till i call you .     robbie turned to go  but hesitated as gloria cried out in his defense     wait  mamma  you got to let him stay .  i didn   t finish cinderella for him .  i said i would tell him cinderella and i   m not finished .        gloria .        honest and truly  mamma  he   ll stay so quiet  you won   t even know he   s here .  he can sit on the chair in the corner  and he won   t say a word  i mean he won   t do anything .  will you  robbie .     robbie  appealed to  nodded his massive head up and down once .     gloria  if you don   t stop this at once  you shan   t see robbie for a whole week .     the girl   s eyes fell     all right .  but cinderella is his favorite story and i didn   t finish it .    and he likes it so much .     the robot left with a disconsolate step and gloria choked back a sob .   george weston was comfortable .  it was a habit of his to be comfortable on sunday afternoons .  a good  hearty dinner below the hatches  a nice  soft  dilapidated couch on which to sprawl  a copy of the times  slippered feet and shirtless chest  how could anyone help but be comfortable .  he wasn   t pleased  therefore  when his wife walked in .  after ten years of married life  be still was so unutterably foolish as to love her  and there was no question that he was always glad to see her    still sunday afternoons just after dinner were sacred to him and his idea of solid comfort was to be left in utter solitude for two or three hours .  consequently  he fixed his eye firmly upon the latest reports of the lefebre yoshida expedition to mars  this one was to take off from lunar base and might actually succeed  and pretended she wasn   t there .  mrs .  weston waited patiently for two minutes  then impatiently for two more  and finally broke the silence .     george .        hmpph .        george  i say .  will you put down that paper and look at me .     the paper rustled to the floor and weston turned a weary face toward his wife     what is it  dear .        you know what it is  george .  it   s gloria and that terrible machine .        what terrible machine .        now don   t pretend you don   t know what i   m talking about .  it   s that robot gloria calls robbie .  he doesn   t leave her for a moment .        well  why should he .  he   s not supposed to .  and he certainly isn   t a terrible machine .  he   s the best darn robot money can buy and i   m damned sure he set me back half a year   s income .  he   s worth it  though    darn sight cleverer than half my office staff .      he made a move to pick up the paper again  but his wife was quicker and snatched it away .     you listen to me  george .  i won   t have my daughter entrusted to a machine    and i don   t care how clever it is .  it has no soul  and no one knows what it may be thinking .  a child just isn   t made to be guarded by a thing of metal .     weston frowned     when did you decide this .  he   s been with gloria two years now and i haven   t seen you worry till now .        it was different at first .  it was a novelty  it took a load off me  and    and it was a fashionable thing to do .  but now i don   t know .  the neighbors        well  what have the neighbors to do with it .  now  look .  a robot is infinitely more to be trusted than a human nursemaid .  robbie was constructed for only one purpose really    to be the companion of a little child .  his entire    mentality    has been created for the purpose .  he just can   t help being faithful and loving and kind .  he   s a machine made so .  that   s more than you can say for humans .        but something might go wrong .  some  some     mrs .  weston was a bit hazy about the insides of a robot     some little jigger will come loose and the awful thing will go berserk and  and     she couldn   t bring herself to complete the quite obvious thought .     nonsense     weston denied  with an involuntary nervous shiver .     that   s completely ridiculous .  we had a long discussion at the time we bought robbie about the first law of robotics .  you know that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human being  that long before enough can go wrong to alter that first law  a robot would be completely inoperable .  it   s a mathematical impossibility .  besides i have an engineer from u .  s .  robots here twice a year to give the poor gadget a complete overhaul .  why  there   s no more chance of any thing at all going wrong with robbie than there is of you or i suddenly going loony    considerably less  in fact .  besides  how are you going to take him away from gloria .     he made another futile stab at the paper and his wife tossed it angrily into the next room .     that   s just it  george .  she won   t play with anyone else .  there are dozens of little boys and girls that she should make friends with  but she won   t .  she won   t go near them unless i make her .  that   s no way for a little girl to grow up .  you want her to be normal  don   t you .  you want her to be able to take her part in society .        you   re jumping at shadows  grace .  pretend robbie   s a dog .  i   ve seen hundreds of children who would rather have their dog than their father .        a dog is different  george .  we must get rid of that horrible thing .  you can sell it back to the company .  i   ve asked  and you can .        you   ve asked .  now look here  grace  let   s not go off the deep end .  we   re keeping the robot until gloria is older and i don   t want the subject brought up again .     and with that he walked out of the room in a huff .   mrs .  weston met her husband at the door two evenings later .     you   ll have to listen to this  george .  there   s bad feeling in the village .        about what .     asked weston .  he stepped into the washroom and drowned out any possible answer by the splash of water .  mrs .  weston waited .  she said     about robbie .     weston stepped out  towel in hand  face red and angry     what are you talking about .        oh  it   s been building up and building up .  i   ve tried to close my eyes to it  but i   m not going to any more .  most of the villagers consider robbie dangerous .  children aren   t allowed to go near our place in the evenings .        we trust our child with the thing .        well  people aren   t reasonable about these things .        then to hell with them .        saying that doesn   t solve the problem .  i   ve got to do my shopping down there .  i   ve got to meet them every day .  and it   s even worse in the city these days when it comes to robots .  new york has just passed an ordinance keeping all robots off the streets between sunset and sunrise .        all right  but they can   t stop us from keeping a robot in our home .  grace  this is one of your campaigns .  i recognize it .  but it   s no use .  the answer is still  no .  we   re keeping robbie .      and yet he loved his wife    and what was worse  his wife knew it .  george weston  after all  was only a man    poor thing    and his wife made full use of every device which a clumsier and more scrupulous sex has learned  with reason and futility  to fear .  ten times in the ensuing week  he cried     robbie stays  and that   s final .     and each time it was weaker and accompanied by a louder and more agonized groan .  came the day at last  when weston approached his daughter guiltily and suggested a    beautiful    visivox show in the village .  gloria clapped her hands happily     can robbie go .        no  dear     he said  and winced at the sound of his voice     they won   t allow robots at the visivox    but you can tell him all about it when you get home .     he stumbled all over the last few words and looked away .  gloria came back from town bubbling over with enthusiasm  for the visivox had been a gorgeous spectacle indeed .  she waited for her father to maneuver the jet car into the sunken garage     wait till i tell robbie  daddy .  he would have liked it like anything .  especially when francis fran was backing away so o o quietly  and backed right into one of the leopard men and had to run .     she laughed again     daddy  are there really leopard men on the moon .        probably not     said weston absently .     it   s just funny make believe .     he couldn   t take much longer with the car .  he   d have to face it .  gloria ran across the lawn .     robbie .    robbie .     then she stopped suddenly at the sight of a beautiful collie which regarded her out of serious brown eyes as it wagged its tail on the porch .     oh  what a nice dog .     gloria climbed the steps  approached cautiously and patted it .     is it for me  daddy .     her mother had joined them .     yes  it is  gloria .  isn   t it nice    soft and furry .  it   s very gentle .  it likes little girls .        can he play games .        surely .  he can do any number of tricks .  would you like to see some .        right away .  i want robbie to see him  too .  robbie .     she stopped  uncertainly  and frowned     i   ll bet he   s just staying in his room because he   s mad at me for not taking him to the visivox .  you   ll have to explain to him  daddy .  he might not believe me  but he knows if you say it  it   s so .     weston   s lip grew tighter .  he looked toward his wife but could not catch her eye .  gloria turned precipitously and ran down the basement steps  shouting as she went     robbie   come and see what daddy and mamma brought me .  they brought me a dog  robbie .     in a minute she had returned  a frightened little girl .     mamma  robbie isn   t in his room .  where is he .     there was no answer and george weston coughed and was suddenly extremely interested in an aimlessly drifting cloud .  gloria   s voice quavered on the verge of tears     where   s robbie  mamma .     mrs .  weston sat down and drew her daughter gently to her     don   t feel bad  gloria .  robbie has gone away  i think .        gone away .  where .  where   s he gone away  mamma .        no one knows  darling .  he just walked away .  we   ve looked and we   ve looked and we   ve looked for him  but we can   t find him .        you mean he   ll never come back again .     her eyes were round with horror .     we may find him soon .  we   ll keep looking for him .  and meanwhile you can play with your nice new doggie .  look at him .  his name is lightning and he can     but gloria   s eyelids had overflown     i don   t want the nasty dog    i want robbie .  i want you to find me robbie .     her feelings became too deep for words  and she spluttered into a shrill wail .  mrs .  weston glanced at her husband for help  but he merely shuffled his feet morosely and did not withdraw his ardent stare from the heavens  so she bent to the task of consolation     why do you cry  gloria .  robbie was only a machine  just a nasty old machine .  he wasn   t alive at all .        he was not no machine .     screamed gloria  fiercely and ungrammatically .     he was a person just like you and me and he was my friend .  i want him back .  oh  mamma  i want him back .     her mother groaned in defeat and left gloria to her sorrow .     let her have her cry out     she told her husband .     childish griefs are never lasting .  in a few days  she   ll forget that awful robot ever existed .     but time proved mrs .  weston a bit too optimistic .  to be sure  gloria ceased crying  but she ceased smiling  too  and the passing days found her ever more silent and shadowy .  gradually  her attitude of passive unhappiness wore mrs .  weston down and all that kept her from yielding was the impossibility of admitting defeat to her husband .  then  one evening  she flounced into the living room  sat down  folded her arms and looked boiling mad .  her husband stretched his neck in order to see her over his newspaper     what now  grace .        it   s that child  george .  i   ve had to send back the dog today .  gloria positively couldn   t stand the sight of him  she said .  she   s driving me into a nervous breakdown .     weston laid down the paper and a hopeful gleam entered his eye     maybe   maybe we ought to get robbie back .  it might be done  you know .  i can get in touch with        no .     she replied  grimly .     i won   t hear of it .  we   re not giving up that easily .  my child shall not be brought up by a robot if it takes years to break her of it .     weston picked up his paper again with a disappointed air .     a year of this will have me prematurely gray .        you   re a big help  george     was the frigid answer .     what gloria needs is a change of environment .  of course she can   t forget robbie here .  how can she when every tree and rock reminds her of him .  it is really the silliest situation i have ever heard of .  imagine a child pining away for the loss of a robot .        well  stick to the point .  what   s the change in environment you   re planning .        we   re going to take her to new york .        the city .  in august .  say  do you know what new york is like in august .  it   s unbearable .        millions do bear it .        they don   t have a place like this to go to .  if they didn   t have to stay in new york  they wouldn   t .        well  we have to .  i say we   re leaving now    or as soon as we can make the arrangements .  in the city  gloria will find sufficient interests and sufficient friends to perk her up and make her forget that machine .        oh  lord     groaned the lesser half     those frying pavements .        we have to     was the unshaken response .     gloria has lost five pounds in the last month and my little girl   s health is more important to me than your comfort .        it   s a pity you didn   t think of your little girl   s health before you deprived her of her pet robot     he muttered    but to himself .   gloria displayed immediate signs of improvement when told of the impending trip to the city .  she spoke little of it  but when she did  it was always with lively anticipation .  again  she began to smile and to eat with something of her former appetite .  mrs .  weston hugged herself for joy and lost no opportunity to triumph over her still skeptical husband .     you see  george  she helps with the packing like a little angel  and chatters away as if she hadn   t a care in the world .  it   s just as i told you    all we need do is substitute other interests .        hmpph     was the skeptical response     i hope so .     preliminaries were gone through quickly .  arrangements were made for the preparation of their city home and a couple were engaged as housekeepers for the country home .  when the day of the trip finally did come  gloria was all but her old self again  and no mention of robbie passed her lips at all .  in high good humor the family took a taxi gyro to the airport  weston would have preferred using his own private    gyro  but it was only a two seater with no room for baggage  and entered the waiting liner .     come  gloria     called mrs .  weston .     i   ve saved you a seat near the window so you can watch the scenery .     gloria trotted down the aisle cheerily  flattened her nose into a white oval against the thick clear glass  and watched with an intentness that increased as the sudden coughing of the motor drifted backward into the interior .  she was too young to be frightened when the ground dropped away as if let through a trap door and she herself suddenly became twice her usual weight  but not too young to be mightily interested .  it wasn   t until the ground had changed into a tiny patchwork quilt that she withdrew her nose  and faced her mother again .     will we soon be in the city  mamma .     she asked  rubbing her chilled nose  and watching with interest as the patch of moisture which her breath had formed on the pane shrank slowly and vanished .     in about half an hour  dear .     then  with just the faintest trace of anxiety     aren   t you glad we   re going .  don   t you think you   ll be very happy in the city with all the buildings and people and things to see .  we   ll go to the visivox every day and see shows and go to the circus and the beach and        yes  mamma     was gloria   s unenthusiastic rejoinder .  the liner passed over a bank of clouds at the moment  and gloria was instantly absorbed in the usual spectacle of clouds underneath one .  then they were over clear sky again  and she turned to her mother with a sudden mysterious air of secret knowledge .     i know why we   re going to the city  mamma .        do you .     mrs .  weston was puzzled .     why  dear .        you didn   t tell me because you wanted it to be a surprise  but i know .     for a moment  she was lost in admiration at her own acute penetration  and then she laughed gaily .     we   re going to new york so we can find robbie  aren   t we .    with detectives .     the statement caught george weston in the middle of a drink of water  with disastrous results .  there was a sort of strangled gasp  a geyser of water  and then a bout of choking coughs .  when all was over  he stood there  a red faced  water drenched and very  very annoyed person .  mrs .  weston maintained her composure  but when gloria repeated her question in a more anxious tone of voice  she found her temper rather bent .     maybe     she retorted  tartly .     now sit and be still  for heaven   s sake .      new york city       a . d .   was a paradise for the sightseer more than ever in its history .  gloria   s parents realized this and made the most of it .  on direct orders from his wife  george weston arranged to have his business take care of itself for a month or so  in order to be free to spend the time in what he termed     dissipating gloria to the verge of ruin .     like everything else weston did  this was gone about in an efficient  thorough  and business like way .  before the month had passed  nothing that could be done had not been done .  she was taken to the top of the half mile tall roosevelt building  to gaze down in awe upon the jagged panorama of rooftops that blended far off in the fields of long island and the flatlands of new jersey .  they visited the zoos where gloria stared in delicious fright at the    real live lion     rather disappointed that the keepers fed him raw steaks  instead of human beings  as she had expected   and asked insistently and peremptorily to see    the whale .     the various museums came in for their share of attention  together with the parks and the beaches and the aquarium .  she was taken halfway up the hudson in an excursion steamer fitted out in the archaism of the mad twenties .  she traveled into the stratosphere on an exhibition trip  where the sky turned deep purple and the stars came out and the misty earth below looked like a huge concave bowl .  down under the waters of the long island sound she was taken in a glass walled sub sea vessel  where in a green and wavering world  quaint and curious sea things ogled her and wiggled suddenly away .  on a more prosaic level  mrs .  weston took her to the department stores where she could revel in another type of fairyland .  in fact  when the month had nearly sped  the westons were convinced that everything conceivable had been done to take gloria   s mind once and for all off the departed robbie    but they were not quite sure they had succeeded .  the fact remained that wherever gloria went  she displayed the most absorbed and concentrated interest in such robots as happened to be present .  no matter how exciting the spectacle before her  nor how novel to her girlish eyes  she turned away instantly if the corner of her eye caught a glimpse of metallic movement .  mrs .  weston went out of her way to keep gloria away from all robots .  and the matter was finally climaxed in the episode at the museum of science and industry .  the museum had announced a special    children   s program    in which exhibits of scientific witchery scaled down to the child mind were to be shown .  the westons  of course  placed it upon their list of    absolutely .     it was while the westons were standing totally absorbed in the exploits of a powerful electro magnet that mrs .  weston suddenly became aware of the fact that gloria was no longer with her .  initial panic gave way to calm decision and  enlisting the aid of three attendants  a careful search was begun .  gloria  of course  was not one to wander aimlessly  however .  for her age  she was an unusually determined and purposeful girl  quite full of the maternal genes in that respect .  she had seen a huge sign on the third floor  which had said     this way to the talking robot    having spelled it out to herself and having noticed that her parents did not seem to wish to move in the proper direction  she did the obvious thing .  waiting for an opportune moment of parental distraction  she calmly disengaged herself and followed the sign .   the talking robot was a tour de force  a thoroughly impractical device  possessing publicity value only .  once an hour  an escorted group stood before it and asked questions of the robot engineer in charge in careful whispers .  those the engineer decided were suitable for the robot   s circuits were transmitted to the talking robot .  it was rather dull .  it may be nice to know that the square of fourteen is one hundred ninety six  that the temperature at the moment is    degrees fahrenheit  and the air pressure    .    inches of mercury  that the atomic weight of sodium is     but one doesn   t really need a robot for that .  one especially does not need an unwieldy  totally immobile mass of wires and coils spreading over twenty five square yards .  few people bothered to return for a second helping  but one girl in her middle teens sat quietly on a bench waiting for a third .  she was the only one in the room when gloria entered .  gloria did not look at her .  to her at the moment  another human being was but an inconsiderable item .  she saved her attention for this large thing with the wheels .  for a moment  she hesitated in dismay .  it didn   t look like any robot she had ever seen .  cautiously and doubtfully she raised her treble voice     please  mr .  robot  sir  are you the talking robot  sir .     she wasn   t sure  but it seemed to her that a robot that actually talked was worth a great deal of politeness .   the girl in her mid teens allowed a look of intense concentration to cross her thin  plain face .  she whipped out a small notebook and began writing in rapid pothooks .   there was an oily whir of gears and a mechanically timbered voice boomed out in words that lacked accent and intonation     i  am  the  robot  that  talks .     gloria stared at it ruefully .  it did talk  but the sound came from inside somewheres .  there was no face to talk to .  she said     can you help me  mr .  robot  sir .     the talking robot was designed to answer questions  and only such questions as it could answer had ever been put to it .  it was quite confident of its ability  therefore     i  can  help  you .        thank you  mr .  robot  sir .  have you seen robbie .        who  is robbie .        he   s a robot  mr .  robot  sir .     she stretched to tiptoes .     he   s about so high  mr .  robot  sir  only higher  and he   s very nice .  he   s got a head  you know .  i mean you haven   t  but he has  mr .  robot  sir .     the talking robot had been left behind     a  robot .        yes  mr .  robot  sir .  a robot just like you  except he can   t talk  of course  and    looks like a real person .        a  robot  like  me .        yes  mr .  robot  sir .     to which the talking robot   s only response was an erratic splutter and an occasional incoherent sound .  the radical generalization offered it  i . e .   its existence  not as a particular object  but as a member of a general group  was too much for it .  loyally  it tried to encompass the concept and half a dozen coils burnt out .  little warning signals were buzzing .   the girl in her mid teens left at that point .  she had enough for her physics   paper on    practical aspects of robotics .     this paper was susan calvin   s first of many on the subject .   gloria stood waiting  with carefully concealed impatience  for the machine   s answer when she heard the cry behind her of    there she is     and recognized that cry as her mother   s .     what are you doing here  you bad girl .     cried mrs .  weston  anxiety dissolving at once into anger .     do you know you frightened your mamma and daddy almost to death .  why did you run away .     the robot engineer had also dashed in  tearing his hair  and demanding who of the gathering crowd had tampered with the machine .     can   t anybody read signs .     he yelled .     you   re not allowed in here without an attendant .     gloria raised her grieved voice over the din     i only came to see the talking robot  mamma .  i thought he might know where robbie was because they   re both robots .     and then  as the thought of robbie was suddenly brought forcefully home to her  she burst into a sudden storm of tears     and i got to find robbie  mamma .  i got to .     mrs .  weston strangled a cry  and said     oh  good heavens .  come home  george .  this is more than i can stand .     that evening  george weston left for several hours  and the next morning  he approached his wife with something that looked suspiciously like smug complacence .     i   ve got an idea  grace .        about what .     was the gloomy  uninterested query .     about gloria .        you   re not going to suggest buying back that robot .        no  of course not .        then go ahead .  i might as well listen to you .  nothing i   ve done seems to have done any good .        all right .  here   s what i   ve been thinking .  the whole trouble with gloria is that she thinks of robbie as a person and not as a machine .  naturally  she can   t forget him .  now if we managed to convince her that robbie was nothing more than a mess of steel and copper in the form of sheets and wires with electricity its juice of life  how long would her longings last .  it   s the psychological attack  if you see my point .        how do you plan to do it .        simple .  where do you suppose i went last night .  i persuaded robertson of u .  s .  robots and mechanical men  inc .  to arrange for a complete tour of his premises tomorrow .  the three of us will go  and by the time we   re through  gloria will have it drilled into her that a robot is not alive .     mrs .  weston   s eyes widened gradually and something glinted in her eyes that was quite like sudden admiration     why  george  that   s a good idea .     and george weston   s vest buttons strained .     only kind i have     he said .   mr .  struthers was a conscientious general manager and naturally inclined to be a bit talkative .  the combination  therefore  resulted in a tour that was fully explained  perhaps even over abundantly explained  at every step .  however  mrs .  weston was not bored .  indeed  she stopped him several times and begged him to repeat his statements in simpler language so that gloria might understand .  under the influence of this appreciation of his narrative powers  mr .  struthers expanded genially and became ever more communicative  if possible .  george weston  himself  showed a gathering impatience .     pardon me  struthers     he said  breaking into the middle of a lecture on the photoelectric cell     haven   t you a section of the factory where only robot labor is employed .        eh .  oh  yes .  yes  indeed .     he smiled at mrs .  weston .     a vicious circle in a way  robots creating more robots .  of course  we are not making a general practice out of it .  for one thing  the unions would never let us .  but we can turn out a very few robots using robot labor exclusively  merely as a sort of scientific experiment .  you see     he tapped his pince nez into one palm argumentatively     what the labor unions don   t realize    and i say this as a man who has always been very sympathetic with the labor movement in general    is that the advent of the robot  while involving some dislocation to begin with  will inevitably        yes  struthers     said weston     but about that section of the factory you speak of    may we see it .  it would be very interesting  i   m sure .        yes .  yes  of course .     mr .  struthers replaced his pince nez in one convulsive movement and gave vent to a soft cough of discomfiture .     follow me  please .     he was comparatively quiet while leading the three through a long corridor and down a flight of stairs .  then  when they had entered a large well lit room that buzzed with metallic activity  the sluices opened and the flood of explanation poured forth again .     there you are .     he said with pride in his voice .     robots only .  five men act as overseers and they don   t even stay in this room .  in five years  that is  since we began this project  not a single accident has occurred .  of course  the robots here assembled are comparatively simple  but .  .  .     the general manager   s voice had long died to a rather soothing murmur in gloria   s ears .  the whole trip seemed rather dull and pointless to her  though there were many robots in sight .  none were even remotely like robbie  though  and she surveyed them with open contempt .  in this room  there weren   t any people at all  she noticed .  then her eyes fell upon six or seven robots busily engaged at a round table halfway across the room .  they widened in incredulous surprise .  it was a big room .  she couldn   t see for sure  but one of the robots looked like    looked like    it was .     robbie .     her shriek pierced the air  and one of the robots about the table faltered and dropped the tool he was holding .  gloria went almost mad with joy .  squeezing through the railing before either parent could stop her  she dropped lightly to the floor a few feet below  and ran toward her robbie  arms waving and hair flying .  and the three horrified adults  as they stood frozen in their tracks  saw what the excited little girl did not see     a huge  lumbering tractor bearing blindly down upon its appointed track .  it took split seconds for weston to come to his senses  and those split seconds meant everything  for gloria could not be overtaken .  although weston vaulted the railing in a wild attempt  it was obviously hopeless .  mr .  struthers signaled wildly to the overseers to stop the tractor  but the overseers were only human and it took time to act .  it was only robbie that acted immediately and with precision .  with metal legs eating up the space between himself and his little mistress he charged down from the opposite direction .  everything then happened at once .  with one sweep of an arm  robbie snatched up gloria  slackening his speed not one iota  and  consequently  knocking every breath of air out of her .  weston  not quite comprehending all that was happening  felt  rather than saw  robbie brush past him  and came to a sudden bewildered halt .  the tractor intersected gloria   s path half a second after robbie had  rolled on ten feet further and came to a grinding  long drawn out stop .  gloria regained her breath  submitted to a series of passionate hugs on the part of both her parents and turned eagerly toward robbie .  as far as she was concerned  nothing had happened except that she had found her friend .  but mrs .  weston   s expression had changed from one of relief to one of dark suspicion .  she turned to her husband  and  despite her disheveled and undignified appearance  managed to look quite formidable     you engineered this  didn   t you .  george weston swabbed at a hot forehead with his handkerchief .  his hand was unsteady  and his lips could curve only into a tremulous and exceedingly weak smile .  mrs .  weston pursued the thought     robbie wasn   t designed for engineering or construction work .  he couldn   t be of any use to them .  you had him placed there deliberately so that gloria would find him .  you know you did .        well  i did     said weston .     but  grace  how was i to know the reunion would be so violent .  and robbie has saved her life  you   ll have to admit that .  you can   t send him away again .     grace weston considered .  she turned toward gloria and robbie and watched them abstractedly for a moment .  gloria had a grip about the robot   s neck that would have asphyxiated any creature but one of metal  and was prattling nonsense in half hysterical frenzy .  robbie   s chrome steel arms  capable of bending a bar of steel two inches in diameter into a pretzel  wound about the little girl gently and lovingly  and his eyes glowed a deep  deep red .     well     said mrs .  weston  at last     i guess he can stay with us until he rusts .      some humanoid robots  in science fiction it is not uncommon to have a robot built with a surface  at least  of synthetic flesh  and an appearance that is  at best  indistinguishable from the human being .  sometimes such humanoid robots are called    androids     from a greek term meaning    manlike     and some writers are meticulous in making the distinction .  i am not .  to me a robot is a robot .  but then  karel capek   s play r . u . r .   which introduced the term    robot    to the world in       did not involve robots in the strictest sense of the word .  the robots manufactured by rossum   s universal robots  the    r . u . r .     of the title  were androids .  one of the three stories in this section     let   s get together     is the only story in the book in which robots don   t actually appear  and    mirror image    is a sequel  of sorts  to my robot novels the caves of steel and the naked sun .   let   s get together  a kind of peace had endured for a century and people had forgotten what anything else was like .  they would scarcely have known how to react had they discovered that a kind of war had finally come .  certainly  elias lynn  chief of the bureau of robotics  wasn   t sure how he ought to react when he finally found out .  the bureau of robotics was headquartered in cheyenne  in line with the century old trend toward decentralization  and lynn stared dubiously at the young security officer from washington who had brought the news .  elias lynn was a large man  almost charmingly homely  with pale blue eyes that bulged a bit .  men weren   t usually comfortable under the stare of those eyes  but the security officer remained calm .  lynn decided that his first reaction ought to be incredulity .  hell  it was incredulity .  he just didn   t believe it .  he eased himself back in his chair and said     how certain is the information .     the security officer  who had introduced himself as ralph g .  breckenridge and had presented credentials to match  had the softness of youth about him  full lips  plump cheeks that flushed easily  and guileless eyes .  his clothing was out of line with cheyenne but it suited a universally air conditioned washington  where security  despite everything  was still centered .  breckenridge flushed and said     there   s no doubt about it .        you people know all about them  i suppose     said lynn and was unable to keep a trace of sarcasm out of his tone .  he was not particularly aware of his use of a slightly stressed pronoun in his reference to the enemy  the equivalent of capitalization in print .  it was a cultural habit of this generation and the one preceding .  no one said the    east    or the    reds    or the    soviets    or the    russians    any more .  that would have been too confusing  since some of them weren   t of the east  weren   t reds  soviets  and especially not russians .  it was much simpler to say we and they  and much more precise .  travelers had frequently reported that they did the same in reverse .  over there  they were    we     in the appropriate language  and we were    they .     scarcely anyone gave thought to such things any more .  it was all quite comfortable and casual .  there was no hatred  even .  at the beginning  it had been called a cold war .  now it was only a game  almost a good natured game  with unspoken rules and a kind of decency about it .  lynn said abruptly     why should they want to disturb the situation .     he rose and stood staring at a wall map of the world  split into two regions with faint edgings of color .  an irregular portion on the left of the map was edged in a mild green .  a smaller  but just as irregular  portion on the right of the map was bordered in a washed out pink .  we and they .  the map hadn   t changed much in a century .  the loss of formosa and the gain of east germany some eighty years before had been the last territorial switch of importance .  there had been another change  though  that was significant enough and that was in the colors .  two generations before  their territory had been a brooding  bloody red  ours a pure and undefiled white .  now there was a neutrality about the colors .  lynn had seen their maps and it was the same on their side .     they wouldn   t do it     he said .     they are doing it      said breckenridge     and you had better accustom yourself to the fact .  of course  sir  i realize that it isn   t pleasant to think that they may be that far ahead of us in robotics .     his eyes remained as guileless as ever  but the hidden knife edges of the words plunged deep  and lynn quivered at the impact .  of course  that would account for why the chief of robotics learned of this so late and through a security officer at that .  he had lost caste in the eyes of the government  if robotics had really failed in the struggle  lynn could expect no political mercy .  lynn said wearily     even if what you say is true  they   re not far ahead of us .  we could build humanoid robots .        have we  sir .        yes .  as a matter of fact  we have built a few models for experimental purposes .        they were doing so ten years ago .  they   ve made ten years    progress since .     lynn was disturbed .  he wondered if his incredulity concerning the whole business was really the result of wounded pride and fear for his job and reputation .  he was embarrassed by the possibility that this might be so  and yet he was forced into defense .  he said     look  young man  the stalemate between them and us was never perfect in every detail  you know .  they have always been ahead in one facet or another and we in some other facet or another .  if they   re ahead of us right now in robotics  it   s because they   ve placed a greater proportion of their effort into robotics than we have .  and that means that some other branch of endeavor has received a greater share of our efforts than it has to theirs .  it would mean we   re ahead in force field research or in hyperatomics  perhaps .     lynn felt distressed at his own statement that the stalemate wasn   t perfect .  it was true enough  but that was the one great danger threatening the world .  the world depended on the stalemate being as perfect as possible .  if the small unevennesses that always existed overbalanced too far in one direction or the other almost at the beginning of what had been the cold war  both sides had developed thermonuclear weapons  and war became unthinkable .  competition switched from the military to the economic and psychological and had stayed there ever since .  but always there was the driving effort on each side to break the stalemate  to develop a parry for every possible thrust  to develop a thrust that could not be parried in time  something that would make war possible again .  and that was not because either side wanted war so desperately  but because both were afraid that the other side would make the crucial discovery first .  for a hundred years each side had kept the struggle even .  and in the process  peace had been maintained for a hundred years while  as byproducts of the continuously intensive research  force fields had been produced and solar energy and insect control and robots .  each side was making a beginning in the understanding of mentalics  which was the name given to the biochemistry and biophysics of thought .  each side had its outposts on the moon and on mars .  mankind was advancing in giant strides under forced draft .  it was even necessary for both sides to be as decent and humane as possible among themselves  lest through cruelty and tyranny  friends be made for the other side .  it couldn   t be that the stalemate would now be broken and that there would be war .  lynn said     i want to consult one of my men .  i want his opinion .     is he trustworthy .     lynn looked disgusted .     good lord  what man in robotics has not been investigated and cleared to death by your people .  yes  i vouch for him .  if you can   t trust a man like humphrey carl laszlo  then we   re in no position to face the kind of attack you say they are launching  no matter what else we do .        i   ve heard of laszlo     said breckenridge .     good .  does he pass .        yes .        then  i   ll have him in and we   ll find out what he thinks about the possibility that robots could invade the u  . s . a .        not exactly     said breckenridge  softly .     you still don   t accept the full truth .  find out what he thinks about the fact that robots have already invaded the u . s . a .     laszlo was the grandson of a hungarian who had broken through what had then been called the iron curtain  and he had a comfortable above suspicion feeling about himself because of it .  he was thick set and balding with a pugnacious look graven forever on his snub face  but his accent was clear harvard and he was almost excessively soft spoken .  to lynn  who was conscious that after years of administration he was no longer expert in the various phases of modem robotics  laszlo was a comforting receptacle for complete knowledge .  lynn felt better because of the man   s mere presence .  lynn said     what do you think .     a scowl twisted laszlo   s face ferociously .     that they   re that far ahead of us .  completely incredible .  it would mean they   ve produced humanoids that could not be told from humans at close quarters .  it would mean a considerable advance in robo mentalics .        you   re personally involved     said breckenridge  coldly .     leaving professional pride out of account  exactly why is it impossible that they be ahead of us .     laszlo shrugged .     i assure you that i   m well acquainted with their literature on robotics .  i know approximately where they are .        you know approximately where they want you to think they are  is what you really mean     corrected breckenridge .     have you ever visited the other side .        i haven   t     said laszlo  shortly .     nor you  dr .  lynn .     lynn said     no  i haven   t  either .     breckenridge said     has any robotics man visited the other side in twenty five years .     he asked the question with a kind of confidence that indicated he knew the answer .  for a matter of seconds  the atmosphere was heavy with thought .  discomfort crossed lazlo   s broad face .  he said     as a matter of fact  they haven   t held any conferences on robotics in a long time .        in twenty five years     said breckenridge .     isn   t that significant .        maybe     said laszlo  reluctantly .     something else bothers me  though .  none of them have ever come to our conferences on robotics .  none that i can remember .        were they invited .     asked breckenridge .  lynn  staring and worried  interposed quickly     of course .     breckenridge said     do they refuse attendance to any other types of scientific conferences we hold .        i don   t know     said laszlo .  he was pacing the floor now .     i haven   t heard of any cases .  have you  chief .        no     said lynn .  breckenridge said     wouldn   t you say it was as though they didn   t want to be put in the position of having to return any such invitation .  or as though they were afraid one of their men might talk too much .     that was exactly how it seemed  and lynn felt a helpless conviction that security   s story was true after all steal over him .  why else had there been no contact between sides on robotics .  there had been a cross fertilizing trickle of researchers moving in both directions on a strictly one for one basis for years  dating back to the days of eisenhower and krushchev .  there were a great many good motives for that  an honest appreciation of the supranational character of science  impulses of friendliness that are hard to wipe out completely in the individual human being  the desire to be exposed to a fresh and interesting outlook and to have your own slightly stale notions greeted by others as fresh and interesting .  the governments themselves were anxious that this continue .  there was always the obvious thought that by learning all you could and telling as little as you could  your own side would gain by the exchange .  but not in the case of robotics .  not there .  such a little thing to carry conviction .  and a thing  moreover  they had known all along .  lynn thought darkly  we   ve taken the complacent way out .  because the other side had done nothing publicly on robotics  it had been tempting to sit back smugly and be comfortable in the assurance of superiority .  why hadn   t it seemed possible  even likely  that they were hiding superior cards  a trump hand  for the proper time .  laszlo said shakenly     what do we do .     it was obvious that the same line of thought had carried the same conviction to him .     do .     parroted lynn .  it was hard to think right now of anything but the complete horror that came with conviction .  there were ten humanoid robots somewhere in the united states  each one carrying a fragment of a tc bomb .  tc .  the race for sheer horror in bombery had ended there .  tci total conversion .  the sun was no longer a synonym one could use .  total conversion made the sun a penny candle .  ten humanoids  each completely harmless in separation  could  by the simple act of coming together  exceed critical mass and lynn rose to his feet heavily  the dark pouches under his eyes  which ordinarily lent his ugly face a look of savage foreboding  more prominent than ever .     it   s going to be up to us to figure out ways and means of telling a humanoid from a human and then finding the humanoids .        how quickly .     muttered laszlo .     not later than five minutes before they get together     barked lynn     and i don   t know when that will be .     breckenridge nodded .     i   m glad you   re with us now  sir  i   m to bring you back to washington for conference  you know .     lynn raised his eyebrows .     all right .     he wondered if  had he delayed longer in being convinced  he might not have been replaced forthwith  if some other chief of the bureau of robotics might not be conferring in washington .  he suddenly wished earnestly that exactly that had come to pass .  the first presidential assistant was there  the secretary of science  the secretary of security  lynn himself  and breckenridge .  five of them sitting about a table in the dungeons of an underground fortress near washington .  presidential assistant jeffreys was an impressive man  handsome in a white haired and just a trifle jowly fashion  solid  thoughtful and as unobtrusive  politically  as a presidential assistant ought to be .  he spoke incisively .     there are three questions that face us as i see it .  first  when are the humanoids going to get together .  second  where are they going to get together .  third  how do we stop them before they get together .     secretary of science amberley nodded convulsively at that .  he had been dean of northwestern engineering before his appointment .  he was thin  sharp featured and noticeably edgy .  his forefinger traced slow circles on the table    as far as when they   ll get together     he said .     i suppose it   s definite that it won   t be for some time .        why do you say that .     asked lynn sharply .     they   ve been in the u . s .  at least a month already .  so security says .     lynn turned automatically to look at breckenridge  and secretary of security macalaster intercepted the glance .  macalaster said     the information is reliable .  don   t let breckenridge   s apparent youth fool you  dr .  lynn .  that   s part of his value to us .  actually  he   s thirty four and has been with the department for ten years .  he has been in moscow for nearly a year and without him  none of this terrible danger would be known to us .  as it is  we have most of the details .        not the crucial ones     said lynn .  macalaster of security smiled frostily .  his heavy chin and close set eyes were well known to the public but almost nothing else about him was .  he said     we are all finitely human  dr .  lynn .  agent breckenridge has done a great deal .     presidential assistant jeffreys cut in .     let us say we have a certain amount of time .  if action at the instant were necessary  it would have happened before this .  it seems likely that they are waiting for a specific time .  if we knew the place  perhaps the time would become self evident .     if they are going to tc a target  they will want to cripple us as much as possible  so it would seem that a major city would have to be it .  in any case  a major metropolis is the only target worth a tc bomb .  i think there are four possibilities  washington  as the administrative center  new york  as the financial center  and detroit and pittsburgh as the two chief industrial centers .     macalaster of security said     i vote for new york .  administration and industry have both been decentralized to the point where the destruction of anyone particular city won   t prevent instant retaliation .        then why new york .     asked amberly of science  perhaps more sharply than he intended .     finance has been decentralized as well .        a question of morale .  it may be they intend to destroy our will to resist  to induce surrender by the sheer horror of the first blow .  the greatest destruction of human life would be in the new york metropolitan area         pretty cold blooded     muttered lynn .     i know     said macalaster of security     but they   re capable of it  if they thought it would mean final victory at a stroke .  wouldn   t we      presidential assistant jeffreys brushed back his white hair .     let   s assume the worst .  let   s assume that new york will be destroyed some time during the winter  preferably immediately after a serious blizzard when communications are at their worst and the disruption of utilities and food supplies in fringe areas will be most serious in their effect .  now  how do we stop them .     amberley of science could only say     finding ten men in two hundred and twenty million is an awfully small needle in an awfully large haystack .     jeffreys shook his head .     you have it wrong .  ten humanoids among two hundred twenty million humans .        no difference     said amberley of science .     we don   t know that a humanoid can be differentiated from a human at sight .  probably not .     he looked at lynn .  they all did .  lynn said heavily     we in cheyenne couldn   t make one that would pass as human in the daylight .        but they can     said macalaster of security     and not only physically .  we   re sure of that .  they   ve advanced mentalic procedures to the point where they can reel off the micro electronic pattern of the brain and focus it on the positronic pathways of the robot .     lynn stared .     are you implying that they can create the replica of a human being complete with personality and memory .        i am .        of specific human beings .        that   s right .        is this also based on agent breckenridge   s findings .        yes .  the evidence can   t be disputed .     lynn bent his head in thought for a moment .  then he said     then ten men in the united states are not men but humanoids .  but the originals would have had to be available to them .  they couldn   t be orientals  who would be too easy to spot  so they would have to be east europeans .  how would they be introduced into this country  then .  with the radar network over the entire world border as tight as a drum  how could they introduce any individual  human or humanoid  without our knowing it .     macalaster of security said     it can be done .  there are certain legitimate seepages across the border .  businessmen  pilots  even tourists .  they   re watched  of course  on both sides .  still ten of them might have been kidnaped and used as models for humanoids .  the humanoids would then be sent back in their place .  since we wouldn   t expect such a substitution  it would pass us by .  if they were americans to begin with  there would be no difficulty in their getting into this country .  it   s as simple as that .        and even their friends and family could not tell the difference .        we must assume so .  believe me  we   ve been waiting for any report that might imply sudden attacks of amnesia or troublesome changes in personality .  we   ve checked on thousands .     amberley of science stared at his finger tips .     i think ordinary measures won   t work .  the attack must come from the bureau of robotics and i depend on the chief of that bureau .     again eyes turned sharply  expectantly  on lynn .  lynn felt bitterness rise .  it seemed to him that this was what the conference came to and was intended for .  nothing that had been said had not been said before .  he was sure of that .  there was no solution to the problem  no pregnant suggestion .  it was a device for the record  a device on the part of men who gravely feared defeat and who wished the responsibility for it placed clearly and unequivocally on someone else .  and yet there was justice in it .  it was in robotics that we had fallen short .  and lynn was not lynn merely .  he was lynn of robotics and the responsibility had to be his .  he said     i will do what i can .     he spent a wakeful night and there was a haggardness about both body and soul when he sought and attained another interview with presidential assistant jeffreys the next morning .  breckenridge was there  and though lynn would have preferred a private conference  he could see the justice in the situation .  it was obvious that breckenridge had attained enormous influence with the government as a result of his successful intelligence work .  well  why not .  lynn said     sir  i am considering the possibility that we are hopping uselessly to enemy piping .        in what way .        i   m sure that however impatient the public may grow at times  and however legislators sometimes find it expedient to talk  the government at least recognizes the world stalemate to be beneficial .  they must recognize it also .  ten humanoids with one tc bomb is a trivial way of breaking the stalemate .        the destruction of fifteen million human beings is scarcely trivial .        it is from the world power standpoint .  it would not so demoralize us to make us surrender or so cripple us as to convince us we could not win .  there would just be the same old planetary death war that both sides have avoided so long and so successfully .  and all they would have accomplished is to force us to fight minus one city .  it   s not enough .        what do you suggest .     said jeffreys coldly .     that they do not have ten humanoids in our country .  that there is not a tc bomb waiting to get together .        i   ll agree that those things are here  but perhaps for some reason greater than just midwinter bomb madness .        such as .        it may be that the physical destruction resulting from the humanoids getting together is not the worst thing that can happen to us .  what about the moral and intellectual destruction that comes of their being here at all .  with all due respect to agent breckenridge  what if they intended for us to find out about the humanoids  what if the humanoids are never supposed to get together  but merely to remain separate in order to give us something to worry about .        why .        tell me this .  what measures have already been taken against the humanoids .  i suppose that security is going through the files of all citizens who have ever been across the border or close enough to it to make kidnapping possible .  i know  since macalaster mentioned it yesterday  that they are following up suspicious psychiatric cases .  what else .     jeffreys said     small x ray devices are being installed in key places in the large cities .  in the mass arenas  for instance         where ten humanoids might slip in among a hundred thousand spectators of a football game or an air polo match .        exactly .        and concert halls and churches .        we must start somewhere .  we can   t do it all at once .        particularly when panic must be avoided     said lynn .     isn   t that so .  it wouldn   t do to have the public realize that at any unpredictable moment  some unpredictable city and its human contents would suddenly cease to exist .        i suppose that   s obvious .  what are you driving at .     lynn said strenuously     that a growing fraction of our national effort will be diverted entirely into the nasty problem of what amberley called finding a very small needle in a very large haystack .  we   ll be chasing our tails madly  while they increase their research lead to the point where we find we can no longer catch up  when we must surrender without the chance even of snapping our fingers in retaliation .     consider further that this news will leak out as more and more people become involved in our countermeasures and more and more people begin to guess what we   re doing .  then what .  the panic might do us more harm than anyone tc bomb .     the presidential assistant said irritably     in heaven   s name  man  what do you suggest we do  then .        nothing     said lynn .     call their bluff .  live as we have lived and gamble that they won   t dare break the stalemate for the sake of a one bomb head start .        impossible .     said jeffreys .     completely impossible .  the welfare of all of us is very largely in my hands  and doing nothing is the one thing i cannot do .  i agree with you  perhaps  that x ray machines at sports arenas are a kind of skin deep measure that won   t be effective  but it has to be done so that people  in the aftermath  do not come to the bitter conclusion that we tossed our country away for the sake of a subtle line of reasoning that encouraged donothingism .  in fact  our counter gambit will be active indeed .        in what way .     presidential assistant jeffreys looked at breckenridge .  the young security officer  hitherto calmly silent  said     it   s no use talking about a possible future break in the stalemate when the stalemate is broken now .  it doesn   t matter whether these humanoids explode or do not .  maybe they are only a bait to divert us  as you say .  but the fact remains that we are a quarter of a century behind in robotics  and that may be fatal .  what other advances in robotics will there be to surprise us if war does start .  the only answer is to divert our entire force immediately  now  into a crash program of robotics research  and the first problem is to find the humanoids .  call it an exercise in robotics  if you will  or call it the prevention of the death of fifteen million men  women and children .     lynn shook his head helplessly .     you can   t .  you   d be playing into their hands .  they want us lured into the one blind alley while they   re free to advance in all other directions .     jeffreys said impatiently     that   s your guess .  breckenridge has made his suggestion through channels and the government has approved  and we will begin with an all science conference .        all science .     breckenridge said     we have listed every important scientist of every branch of natural science .  they   ll all be at cheyenne .  there will be only one point on the agenda  how to advance robotics .  the major specific subheading under that will be  how to develop a receiving device for the electromagnetic fields of the cerebral cortex that will be sufficiently delicate to distinguish between a protoplasmic human brain and a positronic humanoid brain .     jeffreys said     we had hoped you would be willing to be in charge of the conference .        i was not consulted in this .        obviously time was short  sir .  do you agree to be in charge .     lynn smiled briefly .  it was a matter of responsibility again .  the responsibility must be clearly that of lynn of robotics .  he had the feeling it would be breckenridge who would really be in charge .  but what could he do .  he said     i agree .     breckenridge and lynn returned together to cheyenne  where that evening laszlo listened with a sullen mistrust to lynn   s description of coming events .  laszlo said     while you were gone  chief  i   ve started putting five experimental models of humanoid structure through the testing procedures .  our men are on a twelve hour day  with three shifts overlapping .  if we   ve got to arrange a conference  we   re going to be crowded and red taped out of everything .  work will come to a halt .     breckenridge said     that will be only temporary .  you will gain more than you lose .     laszlo scowled .     a bunch of astrophysicists and geochemists around won   t help a damn toward robotics .        views from specialists of other fields may be helpful .        are you sure .  how do we know that there is any way of detecting brain waves or that  even if we can  there is a way of differentiating human and humanoid by wave pattern .  who set up the project  anyway .        i did     said breckenridge .     you did .  are you a robotics man .     the young security agent said calmly     i have studied robotics .        that   s not the same thing .        i   ve had access to text material dealing with russian robotics  in russian .  top secret material well in advance of anything you have here .     lynn said ruefully     he has us there  laszlo .        it was on the basis of that material     breckenridge went on     that i suggested this particular line of investigation .  it is reasonably certain that in copying off the electromagnetic pattern of a specific human mind into a specific positronic brain  a perfectly exact duplicate cannot be made .  for one thing  the most complicated positronic brain small enough to fit into a human sized skull is hundreds of times less complex than the human brain .  it can   t pick up all the overtones  therefore  and there must be some way to take advantage of that fact .     laszlo looked impressed despite himself and lynn smiled grimly .  it was easy to resent breckenridge and the coming intrusion of several hundred scientists of nonrobotics specialties  but the problem itself was an intriguing one .  there was that consolation  at least .  it came to him quietly .  lynn found he had nothing to do but sit in his office alone  with an executive position that had grown merely titular .  perhaps that helped .  it gave him time to think  to picture the creative scientists of half the world converging on cheyenne .  it was breckenridge who  with cool efficiency  was handling the details of preparation .  there had been a kind of confidence in the way he said     let   s get together and we   ll lick them .     let   s get together .  it came to lynn so quietly that anyone watching lynn at that moment might have seen his eyes blink slowly twice  but surely nothing more .  he did what he had to do with a whirling detachment that kept him calm when he felt that  by all rights  he ought to be going mad .  he sought out breckenridge in the other   s improvised quarters .  breckenridge was alone and frowning .     is anything wrong  sir .     lynn said wearily     everything   s right  i think .  i   ve invoked martial law .        what .        as chief of a division i can do so if i am of the opinion the situation warrants it .  over my division i can then be dictator .  chalk up one for the beauties of decentralization .        you will rescind that order immediately .     breckenridge took a step forward .     when washington hears this  you will be ruined .        i   m ruined anyway .  do you think i don   t realize that i   ve been set up for the role of the greatest villain in american history  the man who let them break the stalemate .  i have nothing to lose  and perhaps a great deal to gain .     he laughed a little wildly .     what a target the division of robotics will be  eh  breckenridge .  only a few thousand men to be killed by a tc bomb capable of wiping out three hundred square miles in one micro second .  but five hundred of those men would be our greatest scientists .  we would be in the peculiar position of having to fight a war with our brains shot out  or surrendering .  i think we   d surrender .        but this is impossible .  lynn  do you hear me .  do you understand .  how could the humanoids pass our security provisions .  how could they get together .        but they are getting together .  we   re helping them to do so .  we   re ordering them to do so .  our scientists visit the other side  breckenridge .  they visit them regularly .  you made a point of how strange it was that no one in robotics did .  well  ten of those scientists are still there and in their place  ten humanoids are converging on cheyenne .        that   s a ridiculous guess .        i think it   s a good one  breckenridge .  but it wouldn   t work unless we knew humanoids were in america so that we would call the conference in the first place .  quite a coincidence that you brought the news of the humanoids and suggested the conference and suggested the agenda and are running the show and know exactly which scientists were invited .  did you make sure the right ten were included .        dr .  lynn .     cried breckenridge in outrage .  he poised to rush forward .  lynn said     don   t move .  i   ve got a blaster here .  well just wait for the scientists to get here one by one .  one by one we   ll x ray them .  one by one  we   ll monitor them for radioactivity .  no two will get together without being checked  and if all five hundred are clear  i   ll give you my blaster and surrender to you .  only i think we   ll find the ten humanoids .  sit down  breckenridge .     they both sat .  lynn said     we wait .  when i   m tired  laszlo will spell me .  we wait .     professor manuelo jiminez of the institute of higher studies of buenos aires exploded while the stratospheric jet on which he traveled was three miles above the amazon valley .  it was a simple chemical explosion but it was enough to destroy the plane .  dr .  herman liebowitz of m . i . t .  exploded in a monorail  killing twenty people and injuring a hundred others .  in similar manner  dr .  auguste marin of l    institut nucleonique of montreal and seven others died at various stages of their journey to cheyenne .  laszlo hurtled in  pale faced and stammering  with the first news of it .  it had only been two hours that lynn had sat there  facing breckenridge  blaster in hand .  laszlo said     i thought you were nuts  chief  but you were right .  they were humanoids .  they had to be .     he turned to stare with hate filled eyes at breckenridge .     only they were warned .  he warned them  and now there won   t be one left intact .  not one to study .        god .     cried lynn and in a frenzy of haste thrust his blaster out toward breckenridge and fired .  the security man   s neck vanished  the torso fell  the head dropped  thudded against the floor and rolled crookedly .  lynn moaned     i didn   t understand  i thought he was a traitor .  nothing more .     and laszlo stood immobile  mouth open  for the moment incapable of speech .  lynn said wildly     sure  he warned them .  but how could he do so while sitting in that chair unless he were equipped with built in radio transmission .  don   t you see it .  breckenridge had been in moscow .  the real breckenridge is still there .  oh my god  there were eleven of them .     laszlo managed a hoarse squeak .     why didn   t he explode .        he was hanging on  i suppose  to make sure the others had received his message and were safely destroyed .  lord  lord  when you brought the news and i realized the truth  i couldn   t shoot fast enough .  god knows by how few seconds i may have beaten him to it .     laszlo said shakily     at least  we   ll have one to study .     he bent and put his fingers on the sticky fluid trickling out of the mangled remains at the neck end of the headless body .  not blood  but high grade machine oil .   mirror image  the three laws of robotics   .  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .    .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .    .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .   lije baley had just decided to relight his pipe  when the door of his office opened without a preliminary knock  or announcement  of any kind .  baley looked up in pronounced annoyance and then dropped his pipe .  it said a good deal for the state of his mind that he left it lie where it had fallen .     r .  daneel olivaw     he said  in a kind of mystified excitement .     jehoshaphat .  it is you  isn   t it .        you are quite right      said the tall  bronzed newcomer  his even features never flicking for a moment out of their accustomed calm .     i regret surprising you by entering without warning  but the situation is a delicate one and there must be as little involvement as possible on the part of the men and robots even in this place .  i am  in any case  pleased to see you again  friend elijah .     and the robot held out his right hand in a gesture as thoroughly human as was his appearance .  it was baley who was so unmanned by his astonishment as to stare at the hand with a momentary lack of understanding .  but then he seized it in both his  feeling its warm firmness .     but daneel  why .  you   re welcome any time  but  what is this situation that is a delicate one .  are we in trouble again .  earth  i mean .        no  friend elijah  it does not concern earth .  the situation to which i refer as a delicate one is  to outward appearances  a small thing .  a dispute between mathematicians  nothing more .  as we happened  quite by accident  to be within an easy jump of earth         this dispute took place on a starship  then .        yes  indeed .  a small dispute  yet to the humans involved astonishingly large .     baley could not help but smile .     i   m not surprised you find humans astonishing .  they do not obey the three laws .        that is  indeed  a shortcoming     said r .  daneel  gravely     and i think humans themselves are puzzled by humans .  it may be that you are less puzzled than are the men of other worlds because so many more human beings live on earth than on the spacer worlds .  if so  and i believe it is so  you could help us .     r .  daneel paused momentarily and then said  perhaps a shade too quickly     and yet there are rules of human behavior which i have learned .  it would seem  for instance  that i am deficient in etiquette  by human standards  not to have asked after your wife and child .        they are doing well .  the boy is in college and jessie is involved in local politics .  the amenities are taken care of .  now tell me how you come to be here .         as i said  we were within an easy j ump of earth     said r .  daneel     so i suggested to the captain that we consult you .        and the captain agreed .     baley had a sudden picture of the proud and autocratic captain of a spacer starship consenting to make a landing on earth  of all worlds  and to consult an earthman  of all people .     i believe     said r .  daneel     that he was in a position where he would have agreed to anything .  in addition  i praised you very highly  although  to be sure  i stated only the truth .  finally  i agreed to conduct all negotiations so that none of the crew  or passengers  would need to enter any of the earthman cities .        and talk to any earthman  yes .  but what has happened .        the passengers of the starship  eta carina  included two mathematicians who were traveling to aurora to attend an interstellar conference on neurobiophysics .  it is about these mathematicians  alfred ban humboldt and gennao sabbat  that the dispute centers .  have you perhaps  friend elijah  heard of one  or both  of them .        neither one     said baley  firmly .     i know nothing about mathematics .  look  daneel  surely you haven   t told anyone i   m a mathematics buff or         not at all  friend elijah .  i know you are not .  nor does it matter  since the exact nature of the mathematics involved is in no way relevant to the point at issue .        well  then  go on .        since you do not know either man  friend elijah  let me tell you that dr .  humboldt is well into his twenty seventh decade  pardon me  friend elijah .        nothing .  nothing     said baley  irritably .  he had merely muttered to himself  more or less incoherently  in a natural reaction to the extended life spans of the spacers .     and he   s still active  despite his age .  on earth  mathematicians after thirty or so .     daneel said  calmly     dr .  humboldt is one of the top three mathematicians  by long established repute  in the galaxy .  certainly he is still active .  dr .  sabbat  on the other hand  is quite young  not yet fifty  but he has already established himself as the most remarkable new talent in the most abstruse branches of mathematics .        they   re both great  then     said baley .  he remembered his pipe and picked it up .  he decided there was no point in lighting it now and knocked out the dottle .     what happened .  is this a murder case .  did one of them apparently kill the other .        of these two men of great reputation  one is trying to destroy that of the other .  by human values  i believe this may be regarded as worse than physical murder .        sometimes  i suppose .  which one is trying to destroy the other .        why  that  friend elijah  is precisely the point at issue .  which .        go on .        dr .  humboldt tells the story clearly .  shortly before he boarded the starship  he had an insight into a possible method for analyzing neural pathways from changes in microwave absorption patterns of local cortical areas .  the insight was a purely mathematical technique of extraordinary subtlety  but i cannot  of course  either understand or sensibly transmit the details .  these do not  however  matter .  dr .  humboldt considered the matter and was more convinced each hour that he had something revolutionary on hand  something that would dwarf all his previous accomplishments in mathematics .  then he discovered that dr .  sabbat was on board .        ah .  and he tried it out on young sabbat .        exactly .  the two had met at professional meetings before and knew each other thoroughly by reputation .  humboldt went into it with sabbat in great detail .  sabbat backed humboldt   s analysis completely and was unstinting in his praise of the importance of the discovery and of the ingenuity of the discoverer .  heartened and reassured by this  humboldt prepared a paper outlining  in summary  his work and  two days later  prepared to have it forwarded subetherically to the co chairmen of the conference at aurora  in order that he might officially establish his priority and arrange for possible discussion before the sessions were closed .  to his surprise  he found that sabbat was ready with a paper of his own  essentially the same as humboldt   s  and sabbat was also preparing to have it subetherized to aurora .        i suppose humboldt was furious .        quite .        and sabbat .  what was his story .        precisely the same as humboldt   s .  word for word .        then just what is the problem .        except for the mirror image exchange of names .  according to sabbat  it was he who had the insight  and he who consulted humboldt  it was humboldt who agreed with the analysis and praised it .        then each one claims the idea is his and that the other stole it .  it doesn   t sound like a problem to me at all .  in matters of scholarship  it would seem only necessary to produce the records of research  dated and initialed .  judgment as to priority can be made from that .  even if one is falsified  that might be discovered through internal inconsistencies .        ordinarily  friend elijah  you would be right  but this is mathematics  and not in an experimental science .  dr .  humboldt claims to have worked out the essentials in his head .  nothing was put in writing until the paper itself was prepared .  dr .  sabbat  of course  says precisely the same .        well  then  be more drastic and get it over with  for sure .  subject each one to a psychic probe and find out which of the two is lying .     r .  daneel shook his head slowly     friend elijah  you do not understand these men .  they are both of rank and scholarship  fellows of the imperial academy .  as such  they cannot be subjected to trial of professional conduct except by a jury of their peers  their professional peers  unless they personally and voluntarily waive that right .        put it to them  then .  the guilty man won   t waive the right because he can   t afford to face the psychic probe .  the innocent man will waive it at once .  you won   t even have to use the probe .        it does not work that way  friend elijah .  to waive the right in such a case  to be investigated by laymen  is a serious and perhaps irrecoverable blow to prestige .  both men steadfastly refuse to waive the right to special trial  as a matter of pride .  the question of guilt  or innocence  is quite subsidiary .        in that case  let it go for now .  put the matter in cold storage until you get to aurora .  at the neurobiophysical conference  there will be a huge supply of professional peers  and then         that would mean a tremendous blow to science itself  friend elijah .  both men would suffer for having been the instrument of scandal .  even the innocent one would be blamed for having been party to a situation so distasteful .  it would be felt that it should have been settled quietly out of court at all costs .        all right .  i   m not a spacer  but i   ll try to imagine that this attitude makes sense .  what do the men in question say .        humboldt agrees thoroughly .  he says that if sabbat will admit theft of the idea and allow humboldt to proceed with transmission of the paper  or at least its delivery at the conference  he will not press charges .  sabbat   s misdeed will remain secret with him  and  of course  with the captain  who is the only other human to be party to the dispute .        but young sabbat will not agree .        on the contrary  he agreed with dr .  humboldt to the last detail  with the reversal of names .  still the mirror image .        so they just sit there  stalemated .        each  i believe  friend elijah  is waiting for the other to give in and admit guilt .        well  then  wait .        the captain has decided this cannot be done .  there are two alternatives to waiting  you see .  the first is that both will remain stubborn so that when the starship lands on aurora  the intellectual scandal will break .  the captain  who is responsible for justice on board ship will suffer disgrace for not having been able to settle the matter quietly and that  to him  is quite insupportable .        and the second alternative .        is that one  or the other  of the mathematicians will indeed admit to wrongdoing .  but will the one who confesses do so out of actual guilt  or out of a noble desire to prevent the scandal .  would it be right to deprive of credit one who is sufficiently ethical to prefer to lose that credit than to see science as a whole suffer .  or else  the guilty party will confess at the last moment  and in such a way as to make it appear he does so only for the sake of science  thus escaping the disgrace of his deed and casting its shadow upon the other .  the captain will be the only man to know all this but he does not wish to spend the rest of his life wondering whether he has been a party to a grotesque miscarriage of justice .     baley sighed .     a game of intellectual chicken .  who   ll break first as aurora comes nearer and nearer .  is that the whole story now  daneel .        not quite .  there are witnesses to the transaction .         jehoshaphat .  why didn   t you say so at once .  what witnesses .     dr .  humboldt   s personal servant         a robot  i suppose .        yes  certainly .  he is called r .  preston .  this servant  r .  preston  was present during the initial conference and he bears out dr .  humboldt in every detail .        you mean he says that the idea was dr .  humboldt   s to begin with  that dr .  humboldt detailed it to dr .  sabbat  that dr .  sabbat praised the idea  and so on .        yes  in full detail .        i see .  does that settle the matter or not .  presumably not .        you are quite right .  it does not settle the matter  for there is a second witness .  dr .  sabbat also has a personal servant  r .  idda  another robot of  as it happens  the same model as r .  preston  made  i believe  in the same year in the same factory .  both have been in service for an equal period of time .     an odd coincidence  very odd .        a fact  i am afraid  and it makes it difficult to arrive at any judgment based on obvious differences between the two servants .        r .  idda  then  tells the same story as r .  preston .        precisely the same story  except for the mirror image reversal of the names .        r .  idda stated  then  that young sabbat  the one not yet fifty     lije baley did not entirely keep the sardonic note out of his voice  he himself was not yet fifty and he felt far from young     had the idea to begin with  that he detailed it to dr .  humboldt  who was loud in his praises  and so on .        yes  friend elijah .        and one robot is lying  then .        so it would seem .        it should be easy to tell which .  i imagine even a superficial examination by a good roboticist         a roboticist is not enough in this case  friend elijah .  only a qualified robopsychologist would carry weight enough and experience enough to make a decision in a case of this importance .  there is no one so qualified on board ship .  such an examination can be performed only when we reach aurora         and by then the crud hits the fan .  well  you   re here on earth .  we can scare up a robopsychologist  and surely anything that happens on earth will never reach the ears of aurora and there will be no scandal .        except that neither dr .  humboldt  nor dr .  sabbat  will allow his servant to be investigated by a robopsychologist of earth .  the earthman would have to      he paused .  lije baley said stolidly     he   d have to touch the robot .        these are old servants  well thought of         and not to be sullied by the touch of earthman .  then what do you want me to do  damn it .     he paused  grimacing .     i   m sorry  r .  daneel  but i see no reason for your having involved me .             i was on the ship on a mission utterly irrelevant to the problem at hand .  the captain turned to me because he had to turn to someone .  i seemed human enough to talk to  and robot enough to be a safe recipient of confidences .  he told me the whole story and asked what i would do .  i realized the next jump could take us as easily to earth as to our target .  i told the captain that  although i was at as much a loss to resolve the mirror image as he was  there was on earth one who might help .        jehoshaphat .     muttered baley under his breath .     consider  friend elijah  that if you succeed in solving this puzzle  it would do your career good and earth itself might benefit .  the matter could not be publicized  of course  but the captain is a man of some influence on his home world and he would be grateful .        you just put a greater strain on me .        i have every confidence     said r .  daneel  stolidly     that you already have some idea as to what procedure ought to be followed .        do you .  i suppose that the obvious procedure is to interview the two mathematicians  one of whom would seem to be a thief .        i   m afraid  friend elijah  that neither one will come into the city .  nor would either one be willing to have you come to them .        and there is no way of forcing a spacer to allow contact with an earthman  no matter what the emergency .  yes  i understand that  daneel  but i was thinking of an interview by closed circuit television .        nor that .  they will not submit to interrogation by an earthman .        then what do they want of me .  could i speak to the robots .        they would not allow the robots to come here  either .        jehoshaphat  daneel .  you   ve come .        that was my own decision .  i have permission  while on board ship  to make decisions of that sort without veto by any human being but the captain himself  and he was eager to establish the contact .  i  having known you  decided that television contact was insufficient .  i wished to shake your hand .     lije baley softened .     i appreciate that  daneel  but i still honestly wish you could have refrained from thinking of me at all in this case .  can i talk to the robots by television at least .        that .  i think  can be arranged .        something  at least .  that means i would be doing the work of a robopsychologist  in a crude sort of way .        but you are a detective  friend elijah  not a robopsychologist .        well  let it pass .  now before i see them  let   s think a bit .  tell me  is it possible that both robots are telling the truth .  perhaps the conversation between the two mathematicians was equivocal .  perhaps it was of such a nature that each robot could honestly believe its own master was proprietor of the idea .  or perhaps one robot heard only one portion of the discussion and the other another portion  so that each could suppose its own master was proprietor of the idea .        that is quite impossible  friend elijah .  both robots repeat the conversation in identical fashion .  and the two repetitions are fundamentally inconsistent .        then it is absolutely certain that one of the robots is lying .        yes .        will i be able to see the transcript of all evidence given so far in the presence of the captain  if i should want to .        i thought you would ask that and i have copies with me .        another blessing .  have the robots been cross examined at all  and is that cross examination included in the transcript .        the robots have merely repeated their tales .  cross examination would be conducted only by robopsychologists .        or by myself .        you are a detective  friend elijah  not a         all right  r .  daneel .  i   ll try to get the spacer psychology straight .  a detective can do it because he isn   t a robopsychologist .  let   s think further .  ordinarily a robot will not lie  but he will do so if necessary to maintain the three laws .  he might lie to protect  in legitimate fashion  his own existence in accordance with the third law .  he is more apt to lie if that is necessary to follow a legitimate order given him by a human being in accordance with the second law .  he is most apt to lie if that is necessary to save a human life  or to prevent harm from coming to a human in accordance with the first law .        yes .        and in this case  each robot would be defending the professional reputation of his master  and would lie if it were necessary to do so .  under the circumstances  the professional reputation would be nearly equivalent to life and there might be a near first law urgency to the lie .        yet by the lie  each servant would be harming the professional reputation of the other   s master  friend elijah .        so it would  but each robot might have a clearer conception of the value of its own master   s reputation and honestly judge it to be greater than that of the other   s .  the lesser harm would be done by his lie  he would suppose  than by the truth .     having said that  lije baley remained quiet for a moment .  then he said     a l right  then  can you arrange to have me talk to one of the robots  to r .  idda first  i think .        dr .  sabbat   s robot .        yes     said baley  dryly     the young fellow   s robot .        it will take me but a few minutes     said r .  daneel .     i have a micro receiver outfitted with a projector .  i will need merely a blank wall and i think this one will do if you will allow me to move some of these film cabinets .        go ahead .  will i have to talk into a microphone of some sort .        no  you will be able to talk in an ordinary manner .  please pardon me  friend elijah  for a moment of further delay .  i will have to contact the ship and arrange for r .  idda to be interviewed .        if that will take some time  daneel  how about giving me the transcripted material of the evidence so far .      lije baley lit his pipe while r .  daneel set up the equipment  and leafed through the flimsy sheets he had been handed .  the minutes passed and r .  daneel said     if you are ready  friend elijah  r .  idda is .  or would you prefer a few more minutes with the transcript .        no     sighed baley     i   m not learning anything new .  put him on and arrange to have the interview recorded and transcribed .     r .  idda  unreal in two dimensional projection against the wall  was basically metallic in structure  not at all the humanoid creature that r .  daneel was .  his body was tall but blocky  and there was very little to distinguish him from the many robots baley had seen  except for minor structural details .  baley said     greetings  r .  idda .        greetings  sir     said r .  idda  in a muted voice that sounded surprisingly humanoid .     you are the personal servant of gennao sabbat  are you not .        i am sir .        for how long  boy .        for twenty two years  sir .        and your master   s reputation is valuable to you .        yes  sir .        would you consider it of importance to protect that reputation .        yes  sir .        as important to protect his reputation as his physical life .        no  sir .        as important to protect his reputation as the reputation of another .     r .  idda hesitated .  he said     such cases must be decided on their individual merit  sir .  there is no way of establishing a general rule .      baley hesitated .  these spacer robots spoke more smoothly and intellectually than earth models did .  he was not at all sure he could outthink one .  he said     if you decided that the reputation of your master were more important than that of another  say  that of alfred barr humboldt  would you lie to protect your master   s reputation .        i would  sir .        did you lie in your testimony concerning your master in his controversy with dr .  humboldt .        no  sir .        but if you were lying  you would deny you were lying in order to protect that lie  wouldn   t you .        yes  sir .        well  then     said baley     let   s consider this .  your master  gennao sabbat  is a young man of great reputation in mathematics  but he is a young man .  if  in this controversy with dr .  humboldt  he had succumbed to temptation and had acted unethically  he would suffer a certain eclipse of reputation  but he is young and would have ample time to recover .  he would have many intellectual triumphs ahead of him and men would eventually look upon this plagiaristic attempt as the mistake of a hot blooded youth  deficient in judgment .  it would be something that would be made up for in the future .     if  on the other hand  it were dr .  humboldt who succumbed to temptation  the matter would be much more serious .  he is an old man whose great deeds have spread over centuries .  his reputation has been unblemished hitherto .  all of that  however  would be forgotten in the light of this one crime of his later years  and he would have no opportunity to make up for it in the comparatively short time remaining to him .  there would be little more that he could accomplish .  there would be so many more years of work ruined in humboldt   s case than in that of your master and so much less opportunity to win back his position .  you see  don   t you  that humboldt faces the worse situation and deserves the greater consideration .     there was a long pause .  then r .  idda said  with unmoved voice     my evidence was a lie .  it was dr .  humboldt whose work it was  and my master has attempted  wrongfully  to appropriate the credit .     baley said     very well  boy .  you are instructed to say nothing to anyone about this until given permission by the captain of the ship .  you are excused .     the screen blanked out and baley puffed at his pipe .     do you suppose the captain heard that  daneel .        i am sure of it .  he is the only witness  except for us .        good .  now for the other .        but is there any point to that  friend elijah  in view of what r .  idda has confessed .        of course there is .  r .  idda   s confession means nothing .        nothing .        nothing at all .  i pointed out that dr .  humboldt   s position was the worse .  naturally  if he were lying to protect sabbat  he would switch to the truth as  in fact  he claimed to have done .  on the other hand  if he were telling the truth  he would switch to a lie to protect humboldt .  it   s still mirror image and we haven   t gained anything .        but then what will we gain by questioning r .  preston .        nothing  if the minor image were perfect  but it is not .  after all  one of the robots is telling the truth to begin with  and one is lying to begin with  and that is a point of asymmetry .  let me see r .  preston .  and if the transcription of r .  idda   s examination is done  let me have it .   the projector came into use again .  r .  preston stared out of it  identical with r .  idda in every respect  except for some trivial chest design .  baley said     greetings  r .  preston .     he kept the record of r .  idda   s examination before him as he spoke .     greetings  sir     said r .  preston .  his voice was identical with that of r .  idda .     you are the personal servant of alfred ban humboldt are you not .        i am  sir .        for how long  boy .        for twenty two years  sir .        and your master   s reputation is valuable to you .        yes  sir .        would you consider it of importance to protect that reputation .        yes  sir .        as important to protect his reputation as his physical life .        no  sir .        as important to protect his reputation as the reputation of another .     r .  preston hesitated .  he said     such cases must be decided on their individual merit  sir .  there is no way of establishing a general rule .     baley said     if you decided that the reputation of your master were more important than that of another  say  that of gennao sabbat  would you lie to protect your master   s reputation .        i would  sir .        did you lie in your testimony concerning your master in his controversy with dr .  sabbat .        no  sir .        but if you were lying  you would deny you were lying  in order to protect that lie  wouldn   t you .        yes  sir .        well  then     said baley     let   s consider this .  your master  alfred barr humboldt  is an old man of great reputation in mathematics  but he is an old man .  if  in this controversy with dr .  sabbat  he had succumbed to temptation and had acted unethically  he would suffer a certain eclipse of reputation  but his great age and his centuries of accomplishments would stand against that and would win out .  men would look upon this plagiaristic attempt as the mistake of a perhaps sick old man  no longer certain in judgment .     if  on the other hand  it were dr .  sabbat who had succumbed to temptation  the matter would be much more serious .  he is a young man  with a far less secure reputation .  he would ordinarily have centuries ahead of him in which he might accumulate knowledge and achieve great things .  this will be closed to him  now  obscured by one mistake of his youth .  he has a much longer future to lose than your master has .  you see  don   t you  that sabbat faces the worse situation and deserves the greater consideration .     there was a long pause .  then r .  preston said  with unmoved voice     my evidence was as i      at that point  he broke off and said nothing more .  baley said     please continue  r .  preston .     there was no response .  r .  daneel said     i am afraid  friend elijah  that r .  preston is in stasis .  he is out of commission .        well  then     said baley     we have finally produced an asymmetry .  from this  we can see who the guilty person is .        in what way  friend elijah .        think it out .  suppose you were a person who had committed no crime and that your personal robot were a witness to that .  there would be nothing you need do .  your robot would tell the truth and bear you out .  if  however  you were a person who had committed the crime  you would have to depend on your robot to lie .  that would be a somewhat riskier position  for although the robot would lie  if necessary  the greater inclination would be to tell the truth  so that the lie would be less firm than the truth would be .  to prevent that  the crime committing person would very likely have to order the robot to lie .  in this way  first law would be strengthened by second law  perhaps very substantially strengthened .        that would seem reasonable     said r .  daneel .     suppose we have one robot of each type .  one robot would switch from truth  unreinforced  to the lie  and could do so after some hesitation  without serious trouble .  the other robot would switch from the lie  strongly reinforced  to the truth  but could do so only at the risk of burning out various positronic track ways in his brain and falling into stasis .        and since r .  preston went into stasis         r .  preston   s master  dr .  humboldt  is the man guilty of plagiarism .  if you transmit this to the captain and urge him to face dr .  humboldt with the matter at once  he may force a confession .  if so  i hope you will tell me immediately .        i will certainly do so .  you will excuse me  friend elijah .  i must talk to the captain privately .        certainly .  use the conference room .  it is shielded .      baley could do no work of any kind in r .  daneel   s absence .  he sat in uneasy silence .  a great deal would depend on the value of his analysis  and he was acutely aware of his lack of expertise in robotics .  r .  daneel was back in half an hour  very nearly the longest half hour of baley   s life .  there was no use  of course  in trying to determine what had happened from the expression of the humanoid   s impassive face .  baley tried to keep his face impassive .     yes  r .  daneel .     he asked .     precisely as you said  friend elijah .  dr .  humboldt has confessed .  he was counting  he said  on dr .  sabbat giving way and allowing dr .  humboldt to have this one last triumph .  the crisis is over and you will find the captain grateful .  he has given me permission to tell you that he admires your subtlety greatly and i believe that i  myself  will achieve favor for having suggested you .        good     said baley  his knees weak and his forehead moist now that his decision had proven correct     but jehoshaphat  r .  daneel  don   t put me on the spot like that again  will you .        i will try not to  friend elijah .  all will depend  of course  on the importance of a crisis  on your nearness  and on certain other factors .  meanwhile  i have a question         yes .        was it not possible to suppose that passage from a lie to the truth was easy  while passage from the truth to a lie was difficult .  and in that case  would not the robot in stasis have been going from a truth to a lie  and since r .  preston was in stasis  might one not have drawn the conclusion that it was dr .  humboldt who was innocent and dr .  sabbat who was guilty .        yes  r .  daneel .  it was possible to argue that way  but it was the other argument that proved right .  humboldt did confess  didn   t he .        he did .  but with arguments possible in both directions  how could you  friend elijah  so quickly pick the correct one .     for a moment  baley   s lips twitched .  then he relaxed and they curved into a smile .     because  r .  daneel  i took into account human reactions  not robotic ones .  i know more about human beings than about robots .  in other words  i had an idea as to which mathematician was guilty before i ever interviewed the robots .  once i provoked an asymmetric response in them  i simply interpreted it in such a way as to place the guilt on the one i already believed to be guilty .  the robotic response was dramatic enough to break down the guilty man  my own analysis of human behavior might not have been sufficient to do so .        i am curious to know what your analysis of human behavior was .        jehoshaphat  r .  daneel  think  and you won   t have to ask .  there is another point of asymmetry in this tale of mirror image besides the matter of true and false .  there is the matter of the age of the two mathematicians  one is quite old and one is quite young .        yes  of course  but what then .        why  this .  i can see a young man  flushed with a sudden  startling and revolutionary idea  consulting in the matter an old man whom he has  from his early student days  thought of as a demigod in the field .  i can not see an old man  rich in honors and used to triumphs  coming up with a sudden  startling and revolutionary idea  consulting a man centuries his junior whom he is bound to think of as a young whippersnapper  or whatever term a spacer would use .  then  too  if a young man had the chance  would he try to steal the idea of a revered demigod .  it would be unthinkable .  on the other hand  an old man  conscious of declining powers  might well snatch at one last chance of fame and consider a baby in the field to have no rights he was bound to observe .  in short  it was not conceivable that sabbat steal humboldt   s idea  and from both angles  dr .  humboldt was guilty .     r .  daneel considered that for a long time .  then he held out his hand .     i must leave now  friend elijah .  it was good to see you .  may we meet again soon .     baley gripped the robot   s hand  warmly     if you don   t mind  r .  daneel     he said     not too soon .      the tercentenary incident  july          and for the third time the accident of the conventional system of numeration  based on powers of ten  had brought the last two digits of the year back to the fateful    that had seen the birth of the nation .  it was no longer a nation in the old sense  it was rather a geographic expression  part of a greater whole that made up the federation of all of humanity on earth  together with its offshoots on the moon and in the space colonies .  by culture and heritage  however  the name and the idea lived on  and that portion of the planet signified by the old name was still the most prosperous and advanced region of the world .  .  .  . and the president of the united states was still the most powerful single figure in the planetary council .  lawrence edwards watched the small figure of the president from his height of two hundred feet .  he drifted lazily above the crowd  his flotron motor making a barely heard chuckle on his back  and what he saw looked exactly like what anyone would see on a holovision scene .  how many times had he seen little figures like that in his living room  little figures in a cube of sunlight  looking as real as though they were living homunculi  except that you could put your hand through them .  you couldn   t put your hand through those spreading out in their tens of thousands over the open spaces surrounding the washington monument .  and you couldn   t put your hand through the president .  you could reach out to him instead  touch him  and shake his hand .  edwards thought sardonically of the uselessness of that added element of tangibility and wished himself a hundred miles away  floating in air over some isolated wilderness  instead of here where he had to watch for any sign of disorder .  there wouldn   t be any necessity for his being here but for the mythology of the value of    pressing the flesh .     edwards was not an admirer of the president  hugo allen winkler  fifty seventh of the line .  to edwards  president winkler seemed an empty man  a charmer  a vote grabber  a promiser .  he was a disappointing man to have in office now after all the hopes of those first months of his administration .  the world federation was in danger of breaking up long before its job had been completed and winkler could do nothing about it .  one needed a strong hand now  not a glad hand  a hard voice  not a honey voice .  there he was now  shaking hands  a space forced around him by the service  with edwards himself  plus a few others of the service  watching from above .  the president would be running for re election certainly  and there seemed a good chance he might be defeated .  that would just make things worse  since the opposition party was dedicated to the destruction of the federation .  edwards sighed .  it would be a miserable four years coming up  maybe a miserable forty  and all he could do was float in the air  ready to reach every service agent on the ground by laser phone if there was the slightest he didn   t see the slightest .  there was no sign of disturbance .  just a little puff of white dust  hardly visible  just a momentary glitter in the sunlight  up and away  gone as soon as he was aware of it .  where was the president .  he had lost sight of him in the dust .  he looked about in the vicinity of where he had seen him last .  the president could not have moved far .  then he became aware of disturbance .  first it was among the service agents themselves  who seemed to have gone off their heads and to be moving this way and that jerkily .  then those among the crowd near them caught the contagion and then those farther off .  the noise rose and became a thunder .  edwards didn   t have to hear the words that made up the rising roar .  it seemed to carry the news to him by nothing more than its mass clamorous urgency .  president winkler had disappeared .  he had been there one moment and had turned into a handful of vanishing dust the next .  edwards held his breath in an agony of waiting during what seemed a drug ridden eternity  for the long moment of realization to end and for the mob to break into a mad  rioting stampede .    when a resonant voice sounded over the gathering din  and at its sound  the noise faded  died  and became a silence .  it was as though it were all a holovision program after all and someone had turned the sound down and out .  edwards thought  my god  it   s the president .  there was no mistaking the voice .  winkler stood on the guarded stage from which he was to give his tercentenary speech  and from which he had left but ten minutes ago to shake hands with some in the crowd .  how had he gotten back there .  edwards listened    nothing has happened to me  my fellow americans .  what you have seen just now was the breakdown of a mechanical device .  it was not your president  so let us not allow a mechanical failure to dampen the celebration of the happiest day the world has yet seen .  .  .  . my fellow americans  give me your attention      and what followed was the tercentenary speech  the greatest speech winkler had ever made  or edwards had ever heard .  edwards found himself forgetting his supervisory job in his eagerness to listen .  winkler had it right .  he understood the importance of the federation and he was getting it across .  deep inside  though  another part of him was remembering the persistent rumors that the new expertise in robotics had resulted in the construction of a look alike president  a robot who could perform the purely ceremonial functions  who could shake hands with the crowd  who could be neither bored nor exhausted  nor assassinated .  edwards thought  in obscure shock  that that was how it had happened .  there had been such a look alike robot indeed  and in a way  it had been assassinated .  october          edwards looked up as the waist high robot guide approached and said mellifluously     mr .  janek will see you now .     edwards stood up  feeling tall as he towered above the stubby  metallic guide .  he did not feel young  however .  his face had gathered lines in the last two years or so and he was aware of it .  he followed the guide into a surprisingly small room  where  behind a surprisingly small desk  there sat francis janek  a slightly paunchy and incongruously young looking man .  janek smiled and his eyes were friendly as he rose to shake hands .     mr .  edwards .     edwards muttered     i   m glad to have the opportunity  sir      edwards had never seen janek before  but then the job of personal secretary to the president is a quiet one and makes little news .  janek said     sit down .  sit down .  would you care for a soya stick .     edwards smiled a polite negative  and sat down .  janek was clearly emphasizing his youth .  his ruffied shirt was open and the hairs on his chest had been dyed a subdued but definite violet .  janek said     i know you have been trying to reach me for some weeks now .  i   m sorry for the delay .  i hope you understand that my time is not entirely my own .  however  we   re here now .  .  .  . i have referred to the chief of the service  by the way  and he gave you very high marks .  he regrets your resignation .     edwards said  eyes downcast     it seemed better to carry on my investigations without danger of embarrassment to the service .     janek   s smile flashed .     your activities  though discreet  have not gone unnoticed  however .  the chief explains that you have been investigating the tercentenary incident  and i must admit it was that which persuaded me to see you as soon as i could .  you   ve given up your position for that .  you   re investigating a dead issue .        how can it be a dead issue  mr .  janek .  your calling it an incident doesn   t alter the fact that it was an assassination attempt .        a matter of semantics .  why use a disturbing phrase .        only because it would seem to represent a disturbing truth .  surely you would say that someone tried to kill the president .     janek spread his hands .     if that is so  the plot did not succeed .  a mechanical device was destroyed .  nothing more .  in fact  if we look at it properly  the incident  whatever you choose to call it  did the nation and the world an enormous good .  as we all know  the president was shaken by the incident and the nation as well .  the president and all of us realized what a return to the violence of the last century might mean and it produced a great turnaround .        i can   t deny that .        of course you can   t .  even the president   s enemies will grant that the last two years have seen great accomplishments .  the federation is far stronger today than anyone could have dreamed it would be on that tercentenary day .  we might even say that a breakup of the global economy has been prevented .     edwards said cautiously     yes  the president is a changed man .  everyone says so .     janek said     he was a great man always .  the incident made him concentrate on the great issues with a fierce intensity  however .        which he didn   t do before .        perhaps not quite as intensely .  .  .  . in effect then  the president  and all of us  would like the incident forgotten .  my main purpose in seeing you  mr .  edwards  is to make that plain to you .  this is not the twentieth century and we can   t throw you in jail for being inconvenient to us  or hamper you in any way  but even the global charter doesn   t forbid us to attempt persuasion .  do you understand me .        i understand you  but i do not agree with you .  can we forget the incident when the person responsible has never been apprehended .        perhaps that is just as well  too  sir .  far better that some  uh  unbalanced person escape than that the matter be blown out of proportion and the stage set  possibly  for a return to the days of the twentieth century .        the official story even states that the robot spontaneously exploded  which is impossible  and which has been an unfair blow to the robot industry .        a robot is not the term i would use  mr .  edwards .  it was a mechanical device .  no one has said that robots are dangerous  per se  certainly not the workaday metallic ones .  the only reference here is to the unusually complex manlike devices that seem flesh and blood and that we might call androids .  actually  they are so complex that perhaps they might explode at that  i am not an expert in the field .  the robotics industry will recover .        nobody in the government     said edwards stubbornly     seems to care whether we reach the bottom of the matter or not .        i   ve already explained that there have been no consequences but good ones .  why stir the mud at the bottom  when the water above is clear .        and the use of the disintegrator .     for a moment  janek   s hand  which had been slowly turning the container of soya sticks on his desk  held still  then it returned to its rhythmic movement .  he said lightly     what   s that .     edwards said intently     mr .  janek  i think you know what i mean .  as part of the service         to which you no longer belong  of course        nevertheless  as part of the service  i could not help but hear things that were not always  i suppose  for my ears .  i had heard of a new weapon  and i saw something happen at the tercentenary which would require one .  the object everyone thought was the president disappeared into a cloud of very fine dust .  it was as though every atom within the object had had its bonds to other atoms loosed .  the object had become a cloud of individual atoms  which began to combine again of course  but which dispersed too quickly to do more than appear a momentary glitter of dust .        very science fictionish .        i certainly don   t understand the science behind it  mr .  janek  but i do see that it would take considerable energy to accomplish such bond breaking .  this energy would have to be withdrawn from the environment .  those people who were standing near the device at the time  and whom i could locate  and who would agree to talk  were unanimous in reporting a wave of coldness washing over them .     janek put the soya stick container to one side with a small click of transite against cellulite .  he said     suppose just for argument that there is such a thing as a disintegrator .        you need not argue .  there is .        i won   t argue .  i know of no such thing myself  but in my office  i am not likely to know of anything so security bound as new weaponry .  but if a disintegrator exists and is as secret as all that  it must be an american monopoly  unknown to the rest of the federation .  it would then not be something either you or i should talk about .  it could be a more dangerous war weapon than the nuclear bombs  precisely because  if what you say is so  it produces nothing more than disintegration at the point of impact and cold in the immediate neighborhood .  no blast  no fire  no deadly radiation .  without these distressing side effects  there would be no deterrent to its use  yet for all we know it might be made large enough to destroy the planet itself .        i go along with all of that     said edwards .     then you see that if there is no disintegrator  it is foolish to talk about one  and if there is a disintegrator  then it is criminal to talk about one .        i haven   t discussed it  except to you  just now  because i   m trying to persuade you of the seriousness of the situation .  if one had been used  for instance  ought not the government be interested in deciding how it came to be used  if another unit of the federation might be in possession .     janek shook his head .     i think that we can rely on appropriate organs of this government to take such a thing into consideration .  you had better not concern yourself with the matter .     edwards said  in barely controlled impatience     can you assure me that the united states is the only government that has such a weapon at its disposal .        i can   t tell you  since i know nothing about such a weapon  and should not know .  you should not have spoken of it to me .  even if no such weapon exists  the rumor of its existence could be damaging .        but since i have told you and the damage is done  please hear me out .  let me have the chance of convincing you that you  and no one else  hold the key to a fearful situation that perhaps i alone see .        you alone see .  i alone hold the key .        does that sound paranoid .  let me explain and then judge for yourself .        i will give you a little more time  sir  but what i have said stands .  you must abandon this  this hobby of yours  this investigation .  it is terribly dangerous .        it is its abandonment that would be dangerous .  don   t you see that if the disintegrator exists and if the united states has the monopoly of it  then it follows that the number of people who could have access to one would be sharply limited .  as an ex member of the service  i have some practical knowledge of this and i tell you that the only person in the world who could manage to abstract a disintegrator from our top secret arsenals would be the president .  .  .  . only the president of the united states  mr .  janek  could have arranged that assassination attempt .     they stared at each other for a moment and then janek touched a contact at his desk .  he said     added precaution .  no one can overhear us now by any means .  mr .  edwards  do you realize the danger of that statement .  to yourself .  you must not overestimate the power of the global charter .  a government has the right to take reasonable measures for the protection of its stability .     edwards said     i   m approaching you  mr .  janek  as someone i presume to be a loyal american citizen .  i come to you with news of a terrible crime that affects all americans and the entire federation .  a crime that has produced a situation that perhaps only you can right .  why do you respond with threats .     janek said     that   s the second time you have tried to make it appear that i am a potential savior of the world .  i can   t conceive of myself in that role .  you understand  i hope  that i have no unusual powers .        you are the secretary to the president .        that does not mean i have special access to him or am in some intimately confidential relationship to him .  there are times  mr .  edwards  when i suspect others consider me to be nothing more than a flunky  and there are even times when i find myself in danger of agreeing with them .        nevertheless  you see him frequently  you see him informally  you see him      janek said impatiently     i see enough of him to be able to assure you that the president would not order the destruction of that mechanical device on tercentenary day .        is it in your opinion impossible  then .        i did not say that .  i said he would not .  after all  why should he .  why should the president want to destroy a look alike android that had been a valuable adjunct to him for over three years of his presidency .  and if for some reason he wanted it done  why on earth should he do it in so incredibly public a way  at the tercentenary  no less  thus advertising its existence  risking public revulsion at the thought of shaking hands with a mechanical device  to say nothing of the diplomatic repercussions of having had representatives of other parts of the federation treat with one .  he might  instead  simply have ordered it disassembled in private .  no one but a few highly placed members of the administration would have known .        there have not  however  been any undesirable consequences for the president as a result of the incident  have there .        he has had to cut down on ceremony .  he is no longer as accessible as he once was .        as the robot once was .        well     said janek uneasily .     yes  i suppose that   s right .     edwards said     and  as a matter of fact  the president was re elected and his popularity has not diminished even though the destruction was public .  the argument against public destruction is not as powerful as you make it sound .        but the re election came about despite the incident .  it was brought about by the president   s quick action in stepping forward and delivering what you will have to admit was one of the great speeches of american history .  it was an absolutely amazing performance  you will have to admit that .        it was a beautifully staged drama .  the president  one might think  would have counted on that .     janek sat back in his chair .     if i understand you  edwards  you are suggesting an involuted storybook plot .  are you trying to say that the president had the device destroyed  just as it was  in the middle of a crowd  at precisely the time of the tercentenary celebration  with the world watching  so that he could win the admiration of all by his quick action .  are you suggesting that he arranged it all so that he could establish himself as a man of unexpected vigor and strength under extremely dramatic circumstances and thus turn a losing campaign into a winning one .   .  .  . mr .  edwards  you   ve been reading fairy tales .     edwards said     if i were trying to claim all this  it would indeed be a fairy tale  but i am not .  i never suggested that the president ordered the killing of the robot .  i merely asked if you thought it were possible and you have stated quite strongly that it wasn   t .  i   m glad you did  because i agree with you .        then what is all this .  i   m beginning to think you   re wasting my time .        another moment  please .  have you ever asked yourself why the job couldn   t have been done with a laser beam  with a field deactivator  with a sledgehammer  for god   s sake .  why should anyone go to the incredible trouble of getting a weapon guarded by the strongest possible government security to do a job that didn   t require such a weapon .  aside from the difficulty of getting it  why risk revealing the existence of a disintegrator to the rest of the world .        this whole business of a disintegrator is just a theory of yours .        the robot disappeared completely before my eyes .  i was watching .  i rely on no secondhand evidence for that .  it doesn   t matter what you call the weapon  whatever name you give it  it had the effect of taking the robot apart atom by atom and scattering all those atoms irretrievably .  why should this be done .  it was tremendous overkill .        i don   t know what was in the mind of the perpetrator .        no .  yet it seems to me that there is only one logical reason for a complete powdering when something much simpler would have carried through the destruction .  the powdering left no trace behind of the destroyed object .  it left nothing to indicate what it had been  whether robot or anything else .     janek said     but there is no question of what it was .        isn   t there .  i said only the president could have arranged for a disintegrator to be obtained and used .  but  considering the existence of a look alike robot  which president did the arranging .     janek said harshly     i don   t think we can carry on this conversation .  you are mad .     edwards said     think it through .  for god   s sake  think it through .  the president did not destroy the robot .  your arguments there are convincing .  what happened was that the robot destroyed the president .  president winkler was killed in the crowd on july         .  a robot resembling president winkler then gave the tercentenary speech  ran for re election  was re elected  and still serves as president of the united states .        madness .        i   ve come to you  to you because you can prove this  and correct it  too .        it is simply not so .  the president is  the president .     janek made as though to rise and conclude the interview .     you yourself say he   s changed     said edwards quickly and urgently .     the tercentenary speech was beyond the powers of the old winkler .  haven   t you been yourself amazed at the accomplishments of the last two years .  truthfully  could the winkler of the first term have done all this .        yes  he could have  because the president of the second term is the president of the first term .        do you deny he   s changed .  i put it to you .  you decide and i   ll abide by your decision .        he   s risen to meet the challenge  that is all .  it   s happened before this in american history .     but janek sank back into his seat .  he looked uneasy .     he doesn   t drink     said edwards .     he never did  very much .        he no longer womanizes .  do you deny he did so in the past .        a president is a man .  for the last two years  however  he   s felt dedicated to the matter of the federation .        it   s a change for the better  i admit     said edwards     but it   s a change .  of course  if he had a woman  the masquerade could not be carried on  could it .     janek said     too bad he doesn   t have a wife .     he pronounced the archaic word a little self consciously .     the whole matter wouldn   t arise if he did .        the fact that he doesn   t made the plot more practical .  yet he has fathered two children .  i don   t believe they have been in the white house  either one of them  since the tercentenary .        why should they be .  they are grown  with lives of their own .        are they invited .  is the president interested in seeing them .  you   re his private secretary .  you would know .  are they .     janek said     you   re wasting time .  a robot can   t kill a human being .  you know that that is the first law of robotics .        i know it .  but no one is saying that the robot winkler killed the human winkler directly .  when the human winkler was in the crowd  the robot winkler was on the stand and i doubt that a disintegrator could be aimed from that distance without doing more widespread damage .  maybe it could  but more likely the robot winkler had an accomplice  a hit man  if that is the correct twentieth century jargon .     janek frowned .  his plump face puckered and looked pained .  he said     you know  madness must be catching .  i   m actually beginning to consider the insane notion you   ve brought here .  fortunately  it doesn   t hold water .  after all  why would an assassination of the human winkler be arranged in public .  all the arguments against destroying the robot in public hold against the killing of a human president in public .  don   t you see that ruins the whole theory .        it does not      began edwards .     it does .  no one except for a few officials knew that the mechanical device existed at all .  if president winkler were killed privately and his body disposed of  the robot could easily take over without suspicion  without having roused yours  for instance .        there would always be a few officials who would know  mr .  janek .  the assassinations would have to broaden .     edwards leaned forward earnestly .     see here  ordinarily there couldn   t have been any danger of confusing the human being and the machine .  i imagine the robot wasn   t in constant use  but was pulled out only for specific purposes  and there would always be key individuals  perhaps quite a number of them  who would know where the president was and what he was doing .  if that were so  the assassination would have to be carried out at a time when those officials actually thought the president was really the robot .        i don   t follow you .        see here .  one of the robot   s tasks was to shake hands with the crowd  press the flesh .  when this was taking place  the officials in the know would be perfectly aware that the hand shaker was  in truth  the robot .        exactly .  you   re making sense now .  it was the robot .        except that it was the tercentenary  and except that president winkler could not resist .  i suppose it would be more than human to expect a president  particularly an empty crowd pleaser and applause hunter like winkler  to give up the adulation of the crowd on this day of all days  and let it go to a machine .  and perhaps the robot carefully nurtured this impulse so that on this one tercentenary day  the president would have ordered the robot to remain behind the podium  while he himself went out to shake hands and to be cheered .        secretly .        of course secretly .  if the president had told anyone in the service  or any of his aides  or you  would he have been allowed to do it .  the official attitude concerning the possibility of assassination has been practically a disease since the events of the late twentieth century .  so with the encouragement of an obviously clever robot         you assume the robot to be clever because you assume he is now serving as president .  that is circular reasoning .  if he is not president  there is no reason to think he is clever  or that he were capable of working out this plot .  besides  what motive could possibly drive a robot to plot an assassination .  even if it didn   t kill the president directly  the taking of a human life indirectly is also forbidden by the first law  which states     a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .        edwards said     the first law is not absolute .  what if harming a human being saves the lives of two others  or three others  or even three billion others .  the robot may have thought that saving the federation took precedence over the saving of one life .  it was no ordinary robot  after all .  it was designed to duplicate the properties of the president closely enough to deceive anyone .  suppose it had the understanding of president winkler  without his weaknesses  and suppose it knew that it could save the federation where the president could not .        you can reason so  but how do you know a mechanical device would .        it is the only way to explain what happened .        i think it is a paranoid fantasy .     edwards said     then tell me why the object that was destroyed was powdered into atoms .  what else would make sense than to suppose that that was the only way to hide the fact that it was a human being and not a robot that was destroyed .  give me an alternate explanation .     janek reddened .     i won   t accept it .        but you can prove the whole matter  or disprove it .  it   s why i have come to you  to you .        how can i prove it .  or disprove it either .        no one sees the president at unguarded moments as you do .  it is with you  in default of family  that he is most informal .  study him .        i have .  i tell you he isn   t         you haven   t .  you suspected nothing wrong  little signs meant nothing to you .  study him now  being aware that he might be a robot  and you will see .     janek said sardonically     i can knock him down and probe for metal with an ultrasonic detector .  even an android has a platinum iridium brain .        no drastic action will be necessary .  just observe him and you will see that he is so radically not the man he was that he cannot be a man .     janek looked at the clock calendar on the wall .  he said     we have been here over an hour .        i   m sorry to have taken up so much of your time  but you see the importance of all this  i hope .        importance .     said janek .  then he looked up and what had seemed a despondent air turned suddenly into something of hope .     but is it  in fact  important .  really  i mean .        how can it not be important .  to have a robot as president of the united states .  that   s not important .        no  that   s not what i mean .  forget what president winkler might be .  just consider this .  someone serving as president of the united states has saved the federation  he has held it together and  at the present moment  he runs the council in the interests of peace and of constructive compromise .  you   ll admit all that .     edwards said     of course  i admit all that .  but what of the precedent established .  a robot in the white house for a very good reason now may lead to a robot in the white house twenty years from now for a very bad reason  and then to robots in the white house for no reason at all but only as a matter of course .  don   t you see the importance of muffling a possible trumpet call for the end of humanity at the time of its first uncertain note .     janek shrugged .     suppose i find out he   s a robot .  do we broadcast it to all the world .  do you know how that will affect the federation .  do you know what it will do to the world   s financial structure .  do you know         i do know .  that is why i have come to you privately  instead of trying to make it public .  it is up to you to check out the matter and come to a definite conclusion .  it is up to you  next  having found the supposed president to be a robot  which i am certain you will do  to persuade him to resign .        and by your version of his reaction to the first law  he will then have me killed since i will be threatening his expert handling of the greatest global crisis of the twenty first century .     edwards shook his head .     the robot acted in secret before  and no one tried to counter the arguments he used with himself .  you will be able to reinforce a stricter interpretation of the first law with your arguments .  if necessary  we can get the aid of some official from u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation who constructed the robot in the first place .  once he resigns  the vice president will succeed .  if the robot winkler has put the old world on the right track  good  it can now be kept on the right track by the vice president  who is a decent and honorable woman .  but we can   t have a robot ruler  and we mustn   t ever again .     what if the president is human .        i   ll leave that to you .  you will know .     janek said     i am not that confident of myself .  what if i can   t decide .  if i can   t bring myself to .  if i don   t dare to .  what are your plans .     edwards looked tired .     i don   t know .  i may have to go to u .  s .  robots .  but i don   t think it will come to that .  i   m quite confident that now that i   ve laid the problem in your lap  you won   t rest till it   s settled .  do you want to be ruled by a robot .     he stood up  and janek let him go .  they did not shake hands .  janek sat there in the gathering twilight in deep shock .  a robot .  the man had walked in and had argued  in perfectly rational manner  that the president of the united states was a robot .  it should have been easy to fight that off .  yet though janek had tried every argument he could think of  they had all been useless  and the man had not been shaken in the least .  a robot as president .  edwards had been certain of it  and he would stay certain of it .  and if janek insisted that the president was human  edwards would go to u .  s .  robots .  he wouldn   t rest .  janek frowned as he thought of the twenty seven months since the tercentenary and of how well all had gone in the face of the probabilities .  and now .  he remained lost in somber thought .  he still had the disintegrator but surely it would not be necessary to use it on a human being  the nature of whose body was not in question .  a silent laser stroke in some lonely spot would do .  it had been hard to maneuver the president into the earlier job  but in this present case  it wouldn   t even have to know .   powell and donovan  the second robot story i wrote     reason     included in this section   dealt with the two field testers  gregory powell and michael donovan .  they were modeled on certain stories john campbell wrote  which i admired extravagantly  about a pair of interplanetary explorers  penton and blake .  if campbell ever noted the similarity  he said nothing about it to me .   by the way  i must warn you that the first story in this section     first law     was written as a spoof and is not meant to be taken seriously .   first law  mike donovan looked at his empty beer mug  felt bored  and decided he had listened long enough .  he said  loudly     if we   re going to talk about unusual robots  i once knew one that disobeyed the first law .     and since that was completely impossible  everyone stopped talking and turned to look at donovan .  donovan regretted his big mouth at once and changed the subject .     i heard a good one yesterday     he said  conversationally     about      macfarlane in the chair next to donovan   s said     you mean you knew a robot that harmed a human being .     that was what disobedience to first law meant  of course .     in a way     said donovan .     i say i heard one about         tell us about it     ordered macfarlane .  some of the others banged their beer mugs on the table .  donovan made the best of it .     it happened on titan about ten years ago     he said  thinking rapidly .     yes  it was in twenty five .  we had just recently received a shipment of three new model robots  specially designed for titan .  they were the first of the ma models .  we called them emma one  two and three .     he snapped his fingers for another beer and stared earnestly after the waiter .  let   s see  what came next .  macfarlane said     i   ve been in robotics half my life  mike .  i never heard of an ma serial order .        that   s because they took the ma   s off the assembly lines immediately after  after what i   m going to tell you .  don   t you remember .        no .     donovan continued hastily .     we put the robots to work at once .  you see  until then  the base had been entirely useless during the stormy season  which lasts eighty percent of titan   s revolution about saturn .  during the terrific snows  you couldn   t find the base if it were only a hundred yards away .  compasses aren   t any use  because titan hasn   t any magnetic field .     the virtue of these ma robots  however  was that they were equipped with vibro detectors of a new design so that they could make a beeline for the base through anything  and that meant mining could become a through the revolution affair .  and don   t say a word  mac .  the vibro detectors were taken off the market also  and that   s why you haven   t heard of them .     donovan coughed .     military secret  you understand .     he went on .     the robots worked fine during the first stormy season  then at the start of the calm season  emma two began acting up .  she kept wandering off into corners and under bales and had to be coaxed out .  finally she wandered off base altogether and didn   t come back .  we decided there had been a flaw in her manufacture and got along with the other two .  still  it meant we were shorthanded  or short roboted anyway  so when toward the end of the calm season  someone had to go to kornsk  i volunteered to chance it without a robot .  it seemed safe enough  the storms weren   t due for two days and i   d be back in twenty hours at the outside .     i was on the way back  a good ten miles from base  when the wind started blowing and the air thickening .  i landed my air car immediately before the wind could smash it  pointed myself toward the base and started running .  i could run the distance in the low gravity all right  but could i run a straight line .  that was the question .  my air supply was ample and my suit heat coils were satisfactory  but ten miles in a titanian storm is infinity .     then  when the snow streams changed everything to a dark  gooey twilight  with even saturn dimmed out and the sun only a pale pimple  i stopped short and leaned against the wind .  there was a little dark object right ahead of me .  i could barely make it out but i knew what it was .  it was a storm pup  the only living thing that could stand a titanian storm  and the most vicious living thing anywhere .  i knew my space suit wouldn   t protect me  once it made for me  and in the bad light  i had to wait for a point blank aim or i didn   t dare shoot .  one miss and he would be at me .     i backed away slowly and the shadow followed .  it closed in and i was raising my blaster  with a prayer  when a bigger shadow loomed over me suddenly  and i yodeled with relief .  it was emma two  the missing ma robot .  i never stopped to wonder what had happened to it or worry why it had .  i just howled     emma  baby  get that storm pup  and then get me back to base .        it just looked at me as if it hadn   t heard and called out     master  don   t shoot .  don   t shoot .        it made for that storm pup at a dead run .         get that damned pup  emma     i shouted .  it got the pup  all right .  it scooped it right up and kept on going .  i yelled myself hoarse but it never came back .  it left me to die in the storm .      donovan paused dramatically     of course  you know the first law  a robot may not injure a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .  well  emma two just ran off with that storm pup and left me to die .  it broke first law .     luckily  i pulled through safely .  half an hour later  the storm died down .  it had been a premature gust  and a temporary one .  that happens sometimes .  i hot footed it for base and the storms really broke next day .  emma two returned two hours after i did  and  of course  the mystery was then explained and the ma models were taken off the market immediately .        and just what     demanded macfarlane     was the explanation .     donovan regarded him seriously .     it   s true i was a human being in danger of death  mac  but to that robot there was something else that came first  even before me  before the first law .  don   t forget these robots were of the ma series and this particular ma robot had been searching out private nooks for some time before disappearing .  it was as though it expected something special  and private  to happen to it .  apparently  something special had .     donovan   s eyes turned upward reverently and his voice trembled .     that storm pup was no storm pup .  we named it emma junior when emma two brought it back .  emma two had to protect it from my gun .  what is even first law compared with the holy ties of mother love .      runaround  it was one of gregory powell   s favorite platitudes that nothing was to be gained from excitement  so when mike donovan came leaping down the stairs toward him  red hair matted with perspiration  powell frowned .     what   s wrong .     he said .     break a fingernail .        yaaaah     snarled donovan  feverishly .     what have you been doing in the sublevels all day .     he took a deep breath and blurted out     speedy never returned .     powell   s eyes widened momentarily and he stopped on the stairs  then he recovered and resumed his upward steps .  he didn   t speak until he reached the head of the flight  and then     you sent him after the selenium .        yes .        and how long has he been out .        five hours now .     silence .  this was a devil of a situation .  here they were  on mercury exactly twelve hours    and already up to the eyebrows in the worst sort of trouble .  mercury had long been the jinx world of the system  but this was drawing it rather strong    even for a jinx .  powell said     start at the beginning  and let   s get this straight .     they were in the radio room now    with its already subtly antiquated equipment  untouched for the ten years previous to their arrival .  even ten years  technologically speaking  meant so much .  compare speedy with the type of robot they must have had back in      .  but then  advances in robotics these days were tremendous .  powell touched a still gleaming metal surface gingerly .  the air of disuse that touched everything about the room    and the entire station    was infinitely depressing .  donovan must have felt it .  he began     i tried to locate him by radio  but it was no go .  radio isn   t any good on the mercury sunside    not past two miles  anyway .  that   s one of the reasons the first expedition failed .  and we can   t put up the ultrawave equipment for weeks yet         skip all that .  what did you get .        i located the unorganized body signal in the short wave .  it was no good for anything except his position .  i kept track of him that way for two hours and plotted the results on the map .     there was a yellowed square of parchment in his hip pocket    a relic of the unsuccessful first expedition    and he slapped it down on the desk with vicious force  spreading it flat with the palm of his hand .  powell  hands clasped across his chest  watched it at long range .  donovan   s pencil pointed nervously .     the red cross is the selenium pool .  you marked it yourself .        which one is it .     interrupted powell .     there were three that macdougal located for us before he left .        i sent speedy to the nearest  naturally  seventeen miles away .  but what difference does that make .     there was tension in his voice .     there are the penciled dots that mark speedy   s position .     and for the first time powell   s artificial aplomb was shaken and his hands shot forward for the map .     are you serious .  this is impossible .        there it is     growled donovan .  the little dots that marked the position formed a rough circle about the red cross of the selenium pool .  and powell   s fingers went to his brown mustache  the unfailing signal of anxiety .  donovan added     in the two hours i checked on him  he circled that damned pool four times .  it seems likely to me that he   ll keep that up forever .  do you realize the position we   re in .     powell looked up shortly  and said nothing .  oh  yes  he realized the position they were in .  it worked itself out as simply as a syllogism .  the photocell banks that alone stood between the full power of mercury   s monstrous sun and themselves were shot to hell .  the only thing that could save them was selenium .  the only thing that could get the selenium was speedy .  if speedy didn   t come back  no selenium .  no selenium  no photocell banks .  no photo banks    well  death by slow broiling is one of the more unpleasant ways of being done in .  donovan rubbed his red mop of hair savagely and expressed himself with bitterness .     we   ll be the laughingstock of the system  greg .  how can everything have gone so wrong so soon .  the great team of powell and donovan is sent out to mercury to report on the advisability of reopening the sunside mining station with modern techniques and robots and we ruin everything the first day .  a purely routine job  too .  we   ll never live it down .        we won   t have to  perhaps     replied powell  quietly .     if we don   t do something quickly  living anything down    or even just plain living    will be out of the question .        don   t be stupid .  if you feel funny about it  greg  i don   t .  it was criminal  sending us out here with only one robot .  and it was your bright idea that we could handle the photocell banks ourselves .        now you   re being unfair .  it was a mutual decision and you know it .  all we needed was a kilogram of selenium  a stillhead dielectrode plate and about three hours    time and there are pools of pure selenium all over sunside .  macdougal   s spectroreflector spotted three for us in five minutes  didn   t it .  what the devil .  we couldn   t have waited for next conjunction .        well  what are we going to do .  powell  you   ve got an idea .  i know you have  or you wouldn   t be so calm .  you   re no more a hero than i am .  go on  spill it .        we can   t go after speedy ourselves  mike    not on the sunside .  even the new insosuits aren   t good for more than twenty minutes in direct sunlight .  but you know the old saying     set a robot to catch a robot    look  mike  maybe things aren   t so bad .  we   ve got six robots down in the sublevels  that we may be able to use  if they work .  if they work .     there was a glint of sudden hope in donovan   s eyes .     you mean six robots from the first expedition .  are you sure .  they may be subrobotic machines .  ten years is a long time as far as robot types are concerned  you know .        no  they   re robots .  i   ve spent all day with them and i know .  they   ve got positronic brains  primitive  of course .     he placed the map in his pocket .     let   s go down .      the robots were on the lowest sublevel    all six of them surrounded by musty packing cases of uncertain content .  they were large  extremely so  and even though they were in a sitting position on the floor  legs straddled out before them  their heads were a good seven feet in the air .  donovan whistled .     look at the size of them  will you .  the chests must be ten feet around .        that   s because they   re supplied with the old mcguffy gears .  i   ve been over the insides    crummiest set you   ve ever seen .        have you powered them yet .        no .  there wasn   t any reason to .  i don   t think there   s anything wrong with them .  even the diaphragm is in reasonable order .  they might talk .     he had unscrewed the chest plate of the nearest as he spoke  inserted the two inch sphere that contained the tiny spark of atomic energy that was a robot   s life .  there was difficulty in fitting it  but he managed  and then screwed the plate back on again in laborious fashion .  the radio controls of more modern models had not been heard of ten years earlier .  and then to the other five .  donovan said uneasily     they haven   t moved .        no orders to do so     replied powell  succinctly .  he went back to the first in the line and struck him on the chest .     you .  do you hear me .     the monster   s head bent slowly and the eyes fixed themselves on powell .  then  in a harsh  squawking voice    like that of a medieval phonograph  he grated     yes  master .     powell grinned humorlessly at donovan .     did you get that .  those were the days of the first talking robots when it looked as if the use of robots on earth would be banned .  the makers were fighting that and they built good  healthy slave complexes into the damned machines .        it didn   t help them     muttered donovan .     no  it didn   t  but they sure tried .     he turned once more to the robot .     get up .     the robot towered upward slowly and donovan   s head craned and his puckered lips whistled .  powell said     can you go out upon the surface .  in the light .     there was consideration while the robot   s slow brain worked .  then     yes  master .        good .  do you know what a mile is .     another consideration  and another slow answer .     yes  master .        we will take you up to the surface then  and indicate a direction .  you will go about seventeen miles  and somewhere in that general region you will meet another robot  smaller than yourself .  you understand so far .        yes  master .        you will find this robot and order him to return .  if he does not wish to  you are to bring him back by force .     donovan clutched at powell   s sleeve .     why not send him for the selenium direct .        because i want speedy back  nitwit .  i want to find out what   s wrong with him .     and to the robot     all right  you  follow me .     the robot remained motionless and his voice rumbled     pardon  master  but i cannot .  you must mount first .     his clumsy arms had come together with a thwack  blunt fingers interlacing .  powell stared and then pinched at his mustache .     uh .  .  .  oh .     donovan   s eyes bulged .     we   ve got to ride him .  like a horse .        i guess that   s the idea .  i don   t know why  though .  i can   t see    yes  i do .  i told you they were playing up robot safety in those days .  evidently  they were going to sell the notion of safety by not allowing them to move about  without a mahout on their shoulders all the time .  what do we do now .        that   s what i   ve been thinking     muttered donovan .     we can   t go out on the surface  with a robot or without .  oh  for the love of pete       and he snapped his fingers twice .  he grew excited .     give me that map you   ve got .  i haven   t studied it for two hours for nothing .  this is a mining station .  what   s wrong with using the tunnels .     the mining station was a black circle on the map  and the light dotted lines that were tunnels stretched out about it in spider web fashion .  donovan studied the list of symbols at the bottom of the map .     look     he said     the small black dots are openings to the surface  and here   s one maybe three miles away from the selenium pool .  there   s a number here    you   d think they   d write larger      a .  if the robots know their way around here     powell shot the question and received the dull    yes  master     in reply .     get your insosuit     he said with satisfaction .  it was the first time either had worn the insosuits    which marked one time more than either had expected to upon their arrival the day before    and they tested their limb movements uncomfortably .  the insosuit was far bulkier and far uglier than the regulation spacesuit  but withal considerably lighter  due to the fact that they were entirely nonmetallic in composition .  composed of heat resistant plastic and chemically treated cork layers  and equipped with a desiccating unit to keep the air bone dry  the insosuits could withstand the full glare of mercury   s sun for twenty minutes .  five to ten minutes more  as well  without actually killing the occupant .  and still the robot   s hands formed the stirrup  nor did he betray the slightest atom of surprise at the grotesque figure into which powell had been converted .  powell   s radio harshened voice boomed out     are you ready to take us to exit   a .        yes  master .     good  thought powell  they might lack radio control but at least they were fitted for radio reception .     mount one or the other  mike     he said to donovan .  he placed a foot in the improvised stirrup and swung upward .  he found the seat comfortable  there was the humped back of the robot  evidently shaped for the purpose  a shallow groove along each shoulder for the thighs and two elongated    ears    whose purpose now seemed obvious .  powell seized the ears and twisted the head .  his mount turned ponderously .     lead on  macduff .     but he did not feel at all lighthearted .  the gigantic robots moved slowly  with mechanical precision  through the doorway that cleared their heads by a scant foot  so that the two men had to duck hurriedly  along a narrow corridor in which their unhurried footsteps boomed monotonously and into the  air lock .  the long  airless tunnel that stretched to a pinpoint before them brought home forcefully to powell the exact magnitude of the task accomplished by the first expedition  with their crude robots and their start from scratch necessities .  they might have been a failure  but their failure was a good deal better than the usual run of the system   s successes .  the robots plodded onward with a pace that never varied and with footsteps that never lengthened .  powell said     notice that these tunnels are blazing with lights and that the temperature is earth normal .  it   s probably been like this all the ten years that this place has remained empty .        how   s that .        cheap energy  cheapest in the system .  sunpower  you know  and on mercury   s sunside  sunpower is something .  that   s why the station was built in the sunlight rather than in the shadow of a mountain .  it   s really a huge energy converter .  the heat is turned into electricity  light  mechanical work and what have you  so that energy is supplied and the station is cooled in a simultaneous process .        look     said donovan .     this is all very educational  but would you mind changing the subject .  it so happens that this conversion of energy that you talk about is carried on by the photocell banks mainly    and that is a tender subject with me at the moment .     powell grunted vaguely  and when donovan broke the resulting silence  it was to change the subject completely .     listen  greg .  what the devil   s wrong with speedy  anyway .  i can   t understand it .     it   s not easy to shrug shoulders in an insosuit  but powell tried it .     i don   t know  mike .  you know he   s perfectly adapted to a mercurian environment .  heat doesn   t mean anything to him and he   s built for the light gravity and the broken ground .  he   s foolproof    or  at least  he should be .     silence fell .  this time  silence that lasted .     master     said the robot     we are here .        eh .     powell snapped out of a semidrowse .     well  get us out of here    out to the surface .     they found themselves in a tiny substation  empty  airless  ruined .  donovan had inspected a jagged hole in the upper reaches of one of the walls by the light of his pocket flash .     meteorite  do you suppose .     he had asked .  powell shrugged .     to hell with that .  it doesn   t matter .  let   s get out .     a towering cliff of a black  basaltic rock cut off the sunlight  and the deep night shadow of an airless world surrounded them .  before them  the shadow reached out and ended in knife edge abruptness into an all but unbearable blaze of white light  that glittered from myriad crystals along a rocky ground .     space .     gasped donovan .     it looks like snow .     and it did .  powell   s eyes swept the jagged glitter of mercury to the horizon and winced at the gorgeous brilliance .     this must be an unusual area     he said .     the general albedo of mercury is low and most of the soil is gray pumice .  something like the moon  you know .  beautiful  isn   t it .     he was thankful for the light filters in their visiplates .  beautiful or not  a look at the sunlight through straight glass would have blinded them inside of half a minute .  donovan was looking at the spring thermometer on his wrist .     holy smokes  the temperature is eighty centigrade .     powell checked his own and said     um m m .  a little high .  atmosphere  you know .        on mercury .  are you nuts .        mercury isn   t really airless     explained powell  in absentminded fashion .  he was adjusting the binocular attachments to his visiplate  and the bloated fingers of the insosuit were clumsy at it .     there is a thin exhalation that clings to its surface    vapors of the more volatile elements and compounds that are heavy enough for mercurian gravity to retain .  you know  selenium  iodine  mercury  gallium  potassium  bismuth  volatile oxides .  the vapors sweep into the shadows and condense  giving up heat .  it   s a sort of gigantic still .  in fact  if you use your flash  you   ll probably find that the side of the cliff is covered with  say  hoar sulphur  or maybe quicksilver dew .     it doesn   t matter  though .  our suits can stand a measly eighty indefinitely .     powell had adjusted the binocular attachments  so that he seemed as eye stalked as a snail .  donovan watched tensely .     see anything .     the other did not answer immediately  and when he did  his voice was anxious and thoughtful .     there   s a dark spot on the horizon that might be the selenium pool .  it   s in the right place .  but i don   t see speedy .     powell clambered upward in an instinctive striving for better view  till he was standing in unsteady fashion upon his robot   s shoulders .  legs straddled wide  eyes straining  he said     i think .  .  .  i think    yes  it   s definitely he .  he   s coming this way .     donovan followed the pointing finger .  he had no binoculars  but there was a tiny moving dot  black against the blazing brilliance of the crystalline ground .     i see him     he yelled .     let   s get going .     powell had hopped down into a sitting position on the robot again  and his suited hand slapped against the gargantuan   s barrel chest .     get going .        giddy ap     yelled donovan  and thumped his heels  spur fashion .  the robots started off  the regular thudding of their footsteps silent in the airlessness  for the nonmetallic fabric of the insosuits did not transmit sound .  there was only a rhythmic vibration just below the border of actual hearing .     faster     yelled donovan .  the rhythm did not change .     no use     cried powell  in reply .     these junk heaps are only geared to one speed .  do you think they   re equipped with selective flexors .     they had burst through the shadow  and the sunlight came down in a white hot wash and poured liquidly about them .  donovan ducked involuntarily .     wow .  is it imagination or do i feel heat .        you   ll feel more presently     was the grim reply .     keep your eye on speedy .     robot spd    was near enough to be seen in detail now .  his graceful  streamlined body threw out blazing highlights as he loped with easy speed across the broken ground .  his name was derived from his serial initials  of course  but it was apt  nevertheless  for the spd models were among the fastest robots turned out by the united states robot   mechanical men corp .     hey  speedy     howled donovan  and waved a frantic hand .     speedy .     shouted powell .     come here .     the distance between the men and the errant robot was being cut down momentarily    more by the efforts of speedy than the slow plodding of the fifty year old antique mounts of donovan and powell .  they were close enough now to notice that speedy   s gait included a peculiar rolling stagger  a noticeable side to side lurch    and then  as powell waved his hand again and sent maximum juice into his compact headset radio sender  in preparation for another shout  speedy looked up and saw them .  speedy hopped to a halt and remained standing for a moment with just a tiny  unsteady weave  as though he were swaying in a light wind .  powell yelled     all right  speedy .  come here  boy .     whereupon speedy   s robot voice sounded in powell   s earphones for the first time .  it said     hot dog  let   s play games .  you catch me and i catch you  no love can cut our knife in two .  for i   m little buttercup  sweet little buttercup .  whoops .     turning on his heel  he sped off in the direction from which he had come  with a speed and fury that kicked up gouts of baked dust .  and his last words as he receded into the distance were     there grew a little flower    neath a great oak tree     followed by a curious metallic clicking that might have been a robotic equivalent of a hiccup .  donovan said weakly     where did he pick up the gilbert and sullivan .  say  greg  he .  .  .  he   s drunk or something .        if you hadn   t told me     was the bitter response     i   d never realize it .  let   s get back to the cliff .  i   m roasting .     it was powell who broke the desperate silence .     in the first place     he said     speedy isn   t drunk    not in the human sense    because he   s a robot  and robots don   t get drunk .  however  there   s something wrong with him which is the robotic equivalent of drunkenness       to me  he   s drunk     stated donovan  emphatically     and all i know is that he thinks we   re playing games .  and we   re not .  it   s a matter of life and very gruesome death .        all right .  don   t hurry me .  a robot   s only a robot .  once we find out what   s wrong with him  we can fix it and go on .        once     said donovan  sourly .  powell ignored him .     speedy is perfectly adapted to normal mercurian environment .  but this region       and his arm swept wide       is definitely abnormal .  there   s our clue .  now where do these crystals come from .  they might have formed from a slowly cooling liquid  but where would you get liquid so hot that it would cool in mercury   s sun .        volcanic action     suggested donovan  instantly  and powell   s body tensed .     out of the mouths of sucklings     he said in a small  strange voice and remained very still for five minutes .  then  he said     listen  mike  what did you say to speedy when you sent him after the selenium .     donovan was taken aback .     well damn it    i don   t know .  i just told him to get it .        yes  i know  but how .  try to remember the exact words .        i said .  .  .  uh .  .  .  i said     speedy  we need some selenium .  you can get it such and such a place .  go get it    that   s all .  what more did you want me to say .        you didn   t put any urgency into the order  did you .        what for .  it was pure routine .     powell sighed .     well  it can   t be helped now    but we   re in a fine fix .     he had dismounted from his robot  and was sitting  back against the cliff .  donovan joined him and they linked arms  in the distance the burning sunlight seemed to wait cat and mouse for them  and just next them  the two giant robots were invisible but for the dull red of their photoelectric eyes that stared down at them  unblinking  unwavering and unconcerned .  unconcerned .  as was all this poisonous mercury  as large in jinx as it was small in size .  powell   s radio voice was tense in donovan   s ear     now  look  let   s start with the three fundamental rules of robotics    the three rules that are built most deeply into a robot   s positronic brain .     in the darkness  his gloved fingers ticked off each point .     we have  one  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .        right .        two     continued powell     a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .        right       and three  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .        right .  now where are we .        exactly at the explanation .  the conflict between the various rules is ironed out by the different positronic potentials in the brain .  we   ll say that a robot is walking into danger and knows it .  the automatic potential that rule   sets up turns him back .  but suppose you order him to walk into that danger .  in that case  rule   sets up a counterpotential higher than the previous one and the robot follows orders at the risk of existence .        well  i know that .  what about it .        let   s take speedy   s case .  speedy is one of the latest models  extremely specialized  and as expensive as a battleship .  it   s not a thing to be lightly destroyed       so .        so rule   has been strengthened    that was specifically mentioned  by the way  in the advance notices on the spd models    so that his allergy to danger is unusually high .  at the same time  when you sent him out after the selenium  you gave him his order casually and without special emphasis  so that the rule   potential set up was rather weak .  now  hold on  i   m just stating facts .        all right  go ahead .  i think i get it .        you see how it works  don   t you .  there   s some sort of danger centering at the selenium pool .  it increases as he approaches  and at a certain distance from it the rule   potential  unusually high to start with  exactly balances the rule   potential  unusually low to start with .     donovan rose to his feet in excitement .      and it strikes an equilibrium .  i see .  rule   drives him back and rule   drives him forward        so he follows a circle around the selenium pool  staying on the locus of all points of potential equilibrium .  and unless we do something about it  he   ll stay on that circle forever  giving us the good old runaround .     then  more thoughtfully     and that  by the way  is what makes him drunk .  at potential equilibrium  half the positronic paths of his brain are out of kilter .  i   m not a robot specialist  but that seems obvious .  probably he   s lost control of just those parts of his voluntary mechanism that a human drunk has .  ve e ery pretty .        but what   s the danger .  if we knew what he was running from     .     you suggested it .  volcanic action .  somewhere right above the selenium pool is a seepage of gas from the bowels of mercury .  sulphur dioxide  carbon dioxide    and carbon monoxide .  lots of it and at this temperature .     donovan gulped audibly .     carbon monoxide plus iron gives the volatile iron carbonyl .        and a robot     added powell     is essentially iron .     then  grimly     there   s nothing like deduction .  we   ve determined everything about our problem but the solution .  we can   t get the selenium ourselves .  it   s still too far .  we can   t send these robot horses  because they can   t go themselves  and they can   t carry us fast enough to keep us from crisping .  and we can   t catch speedy  because the dope thinks we   re playing games  and he can run sixty miles to our four .        if one of us goes     began donovan  tentatively     and comes back cooked  there   ll still be the other .        yes     came the sarcastic reply     it would be a most tender sacrifice    except that a person would be in no condition to give orders before he ever reached the pool  and i don   t think the robots would ever turn back to the cliff without orders .  figure it out .  we   re two or three miles from the pool    call it two    the robot travels at four miles an hour  and we can last twenty minutes in our suits .  it isn   t only the heat  remember .  solar radiation out here in the ultraviolet and below is poison .        um m m     said donovan     ten minutes short .        as good as an eternity .  and another thing  in order for rule   potential to have stopped speedy where it did  there must be an appreciable amount of carbon monoxide in the metal vapor atmosphere    and there must be an appreciable corrosive action therefore .  he   s been out hours now    and how do we know when a knee joint  for instance  won   t be thrown out of kilter and keel him over .  it   s not only a question of thinking    we   ve got to think fast .     deep  dark  dank  dismal silence .  donovan broke it  voice trembling in an effort to keep itself emotionless .  he said     as long as we can   t increase rule   potential by giving further orders  how about working the other way .  if we increase the danger  we increase rule   potential and drive him backward .     powell   s visiplate had turned toward him in a silent question .     you see     came the cautious explanation     all we need to do to drive him out of his rut is to increase the concentration of carbon monoxide in his vicinity .  well  back at the station there   s a complete analytical laboratory .        naturally     assented powell .     it   s a mining station .        all right .  there must be pounds of oxalic acid for calcium precipitations .        holy space .  mike  you   re a genius .        so so     admitted donovan  modestly .     it   s just a case of remembering that oxalic acid on heating decomposes into carbon dioxide  water  and good old carbon monoxide .  college chem  you know .     powell was on his feet and had attracted the attention of one of the monster robots by the simple expedient of pounding the machine   s thigh .     hey     he shouted     can you throw .        master .        never mind .     powell damned the robot   s molasses slow brain .  he scrabbled up a jagged brick size rock .     take this     he said     and hit the patch of bluish crystals just across the crooked fissure .  you see it .     donovan pulled at his shoulder .     too far  greg .  it   s almost half a mile off .        quiet     replied powell .     it   s a case of mercurian gravity and a steel throwing arm .  watch  will you .     the robot   s eyes were measuring the distance with machinely accurate stereoscopy .  his arm adjusted itself to the weight of the missile and drew back .  in the darkness  the robot   s motions went unseen  but there was a sudden thumping sound as he shifted his weight  and seconds later the rock flew blackly into the sunlight .  there was no air resistance to slow it down  nor wind to turn it aside    and when it hit the ground it threw up crystals precisely in the center of the    blue patch .     powell yelled happily and shouted     let   s go back after the oxalic acid  mike .     and as they plunged into the ruined substation on the way back to the tunnels  donovan said grimly     speedy   s been hanging about on this side of the selenium pool  ever since we chased after him .  did you see him .        yes .        i guess he wants to play games .  well  we   ll play him games .      they were back hours later  with three liter jars of the white chemical and a pair of long faces .  the photocell banks were deteriorating more rapidly than had seemed likely .  the two steered their robots into the sunlight and toward the waiting speedy in silence and with grim purpose .  speedy galloped slowly toward them .     here we are again .  whee .  i   ve made a little list  the piano organist  all people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face .        we   ll puff something in your face     muttered donovan .     he   s limping  greg .        i noticed that     came the low  worried response .     the monoxide   ll get him yet  if we don   t hurry .     they were approaching cautiously now  almost sidling  to refrain from setting off the thoroughly irrational robot .  powell was too far off to tell  of course  but even already he could have sworn the crack brained speedy was setting himself for a spring .     let her go     he gasped .     count three .  one  two     two steel arms drew back and snapped forward simultaneously and two glass jars whirled forward in towering parallel arcs  gleaming like diamonds in the impossible sun .  and in a pair of soundless puffs  they hit the ground behind speedy in crashes that sent the oxalic acid flying like dust .  in the full heat of mercury   s sun  powell knew it was fizzing like soda water .  speedy turned to stare  then backed away from it slowly    and as slowly gathered speed .  in fifteen seconds  he was leaping directly toward the two humans in an unsteady canter .  powell did not get speedy   s words just then  though he heard something that resembled     lover   s professions when uttered in hessians .     he turned away .     back to the cliff  mike .  he   s out of the rut and he   ll be taking orders now .  i   m getting hot .     they jogged toward the shadow at the slow monotonous pace of their mounts  and it was not until they had entered it and felt the sudden coolness settle softly about them that donovan looked back .     greg .     powell looked and almost shrieked .  speedy was moving slowly now    so slowly    and in the wrong direction .  he was drifting  drifting back into his rut  and he was picking up speed .  he looked dreadfully close  and dreadfully unreachable  in the binoculars .  donovan shouted wildly     after him .     and thumped his robot into its pace  but powell called him back .     you won   t catch him  mike    it   s no use .     he fidgeted on his robot   s shoulders and clenched his fist in tight impotence .     why the devil do i see these things five seconds after it   s all over .  mike  we   ve wasted hours .        we need more oxalic acid     declared donovan  stolidly .     the concentration wasn   t high enough .        seven tons of it wouldn   t have been enough    and we haven   t the hours to spare to get it  even if it were  with the monoxide chewing him away .  don   t you see what it is  mike .     and donovan said flatly     no .        we were only establishing new equilibriums .  when we create new monoxide and increase rule   potential  he moves backward till he   s in balance again    and when the monoxide drifted away  he moved forward  and again there was balance .     powell   s voice sounded thoroughly wretched .     it   s the same old runaround .  we can push at rule   and pull at rule   and we can   t get anywhere    we can only change the position of balance .  we   ve got to get outside both rules .     and then he pushed his robot closer to donovan   s so that they were sitting face to face  dim shadows in the darkness  and he whispered     mike .        is it the finish .        dully .     i suppose we go back to the station  wait for the banks to fold  shake hands  take cyanide  and go out like gentlemen .     he laughed shortly .     mike     repeated powell earnestly     we   ve got to get speedy .        i know .        mike     once more  and powell hesitated before continuing .     there   s always rule   .  i thought of it    earlier    but it   s desperate .     donovan looked up and his voice livened .     we   re desperate .        all right .  according to rule    a robot can   t see a human come to harm because of his own inaction .  two and   can   t stand against it .  they can   t  mike .        even when the robot is half cra  well  he   s drunk .  you know he is .        it   s the chances you take .        cut it .  what are you going to do .        i   m going out there now and see what rule   will do .  if it won   t break the balance  then what the devil    it   s either now or three four days from now .        hold on  greg .  there are human rules of behavior  too .  you don   t go out there just like that .  figure out a lottery  and give me my chance .        all right .  first to get the cube of fourteen goes .     and almost immediately     twenty seven forty four .     donovan felt his robot stagger at a sudden push by powell   s mount and then powell was off into the sunlight .  donovan opened his mouth to shout  and then clicked it shut .  of course  the damn fool had worked out the cube of fourteen in advance  and on purpose .  just like him .   the sun was hotter than ever and powell felt a maddening itch in the small of his back .  imagination  probably  or perhaps hard radiation beginning to tell even through the insosuit .  speedy was watching him  without a word of gilbert and sullivan gibberish as greeting .  thank god for that .  but he daren   t get too close .  he was three hundred yards away when speedy began backing  a step at a time  cautiously    and powell stopped .  he jumped from his robot   s shoulders and landed on the crystalline ground with a light thump and a flying of jagged fragments .  he proceeded on foot  the ground gritty and slippery to his steps  the low gravity causing him difficulty .  the soles of his feet tickled with warmth .  he cast one glance over his shoulder at the blackness of the cliff   s shadow and realized that he had come too far to return    either by himself or by the help of his antique robot .  it was speedy or nothing now  and the knowledge of that constricted his chest .  far enough .  he stopped .     speedy     he called .     speedy .     the sleek  modern robot ahead of him hesitated and halted his backward steps  then resumed them .  powell tried to put a note of pleading into his voice  and found it didn   t take much acting .     speedy  i   ve got to get back to the shadow or the sun   ll get me .  it   s life or death  speedy .  i need you .     speedy took one step forward and stopped .  he spoke  but at the sound powell groaned  for it was     when you   re lying awake with a dismal headache and repose is tabooed     it trailed off there  and powell took time out for some reason to murmur     iolanthe .     it was roasting hot .  he caught a movement out of the corner of his eye  and whirled dizzily  then stared in utter astonishment  for the monstrous robot on which he had ridden was moving    moving toward him  and without a rider .  he was talking     pardon  master .  i must not move without a master upon me  but you are in danger .     of course  rule   potential above everything .  but he didn   t want that clumsy antique  he wanted speedy .  he walked away and motioned frantically     i order you to stay away .  i order you to stop .     it was quite useless .  you could not beat rule   potential .  the robot said stupidly     you are in danger  master .     powell looked about him desperately .  he couldn   t see clearly .  his brain was in a heated whirl  his breath scorched when he breathed  and the ground all about him was a shimmering haze .  he called a last time  desperately     speedy .  i   m dying  damn you .  where are you .  speedy  i need you .     he was still stumbling backward in a blind effort to get away from the giant robot he didn   t want  when he felt steel fingers on his arms  and a worried  apologetic voice of metallic timbre in his ears .     holy smokes  boss  what are you doing here .  and what am i doing    i   m so confused          never mind     murmured powell  weakly .     get me to the shadow of the cliff    and hurry .     there was one last feeling of being lifted into the air and a sensation of rapid motion and burning heat  and he passed out .   he woke with donovan bending over him and smiling anxiously .     how are you  greg .        fine .     came the response     where   s speedy .        right here .  i sent him out to one of the other selenium pools    with orders to get that selenium at all cost this time .  he got it back in forty two minutes and three seconds .  i timed him .  he still hasn   t finished apologizing for the runaround he gave us .  he   s scared to come near you for fear of what you   ll say .        drag him over     ordered powell .     it wasn   t his fault .     he held out a hand and gripped speedy   s metal paw .     it   s o . k .   speedy .     then  to donovan     you know  mike  i was just thinking        yes .        well        he rubbed his face    the air was so delightfully cool     you know that when we get things set up here and speedy put through his field tests  they   re going to send us to the space stations next        no .        yes .  at least that   s what old lady calvin told me just before we left  and i didn   t say anything about it  because i was going to fight the whole idea .        fight it .     cried donovan .     but         i know .  it   s all right with me now .  two hundred seventy three degrees centigrade below zero .  won   t it be a pleasure .        space station     said donovan     here i come .      reason  half a year later  the boys had changed their minds .  the flame of a giant sun had given way to the soft blackness of space but external variations mean little in the business of checking the workings of experimental robots .  whatever the background  one is face to face with an inscrutable positronic brain  which the slide rule geniuses say should work thus and so .  except that they don   t .  powell and donovan found that out after they had been on the station less than two weeks .  gregory powell spaced his words for emphasis     one week ago  donovan and i put you together .     his brows furrowed doubtfully and he pulled the end of his brown mustache .  it was quiet in the officer   s room on solar station       except for the soft purring of the mighty beam director somewhere far below .  robot qt   sat immovable .  the burnished plates of his body gleamed in the luxites and the glowing red of the photoelectric cells that were his eyes  were fixed steadily upon the earthman at the other side of the table .  powell repressed a sudden attack of nerves .  these robots possessed peculiar brains .  oh  the three laws of robotics held .  they had to .  all of u .  s .  robots  from robertson himself to the new floor sweeper  would insist on that .  so qt   was safe .  and yet the qt models were the first of their kind  and this was the first of the qt   s .  mathematical squiggles on paper were not always the most comforting protection against robotic fact .  finally  the robot spoke .  his voice carried the cold timbre inseparable from a metallic diaphragm     do you realize the seriousness of such a statement  powell .        something made you  cutie     pointed out powell .     you admit yourself that your memory seems to spring full grown from an absolute blankness of a week ago .  i   m giving you the explanation .  donovan and i put you together from the parts shipped us .     cutie gazed upon his long  supple fingers in an oddly human attitude of mystification     it strikes me that there should be a more satisfactory explanation than that .  for you to make me seems improbable .     the earthman laughed quite suddenly     in earth   s name  why .        call it intuition .  that   s all it is so far .  but i intend to reason it out  though .  a chain of valid reasoning can end only with the determination of truth  and i   ll stick till i get there .     powell stood up and seated himself at the table   s edge next to the robot .  he felt a sudden strong sympathy for this strange machine .  it was not at all like the ordinary robot  attending to his specialized task at the station with the intensity of a deeply ingrooved positronic path .  he placed a hand upon cutie   s steel shoulder and the metal was cold and hard to the touch .     cutie     he said     i   m going to try to explain something to you .  you   re the first robot who   s ever exhibited curiosity as to his own existence    and i think the first that   s really intelligent enough to understand the world outside .  here  come with me .     the robot rose erect smoothly and his thickly sponge rubber soled feet made no noise as he followed powell .  the earthman touched a button and a square section of the wall flickered aside .  the thick  clear glass revealed space    star speckled .     i   ve seen that in the observation ports in the engine room     said cutie .     i know     said powell .     what do you think it is .        exactly what it seems    a black material just beyond this glass that is spotted with little gleaming dots .  i know that our director sends out beams to some of these dots  always to the same ones    and also that these dots shift and that the beams shift with them .  that is all .        good .  now i want you to listen carefully .  the blackness is emptiness vast emptiness stretching out infinitely .  the little  gleaming dots are huge masses of energy filled matter .  they are globes  some of them millions of miles in diameter and for comparison  this station is only one mile across .  they seem so tiny because they are incredibly far off .     the dots to which our energy beams are directed are nearer and much smaller .  they are cold and hard and human beings like myself live upon their surfaces    many billions of them .  it is from one of these worlds that donovan and i come .  our beams feed these worlds energy drawn from one of those huge incandescent globes that happens to be near us .  we call that globe the sun and it is on the other side of the station where you can   t see it .     cutie remained motionless before the port  like a steel statue .  his head did not turn as he spoke     which particular dot of light do you claim to come from .     powell searched     there it is  the very bright one in the corner  we call it earth .     he grinned .     good old earth .  there are three billions of us there  cutie    and in about two weeks i   ll be back there with them    and then  surprisingly enough  cutie hummed abstractedly .  there was no tune to it  but it possessed a curious twanging quality as of plucked strings .  it ceased as suddenly as it had begun     but where do i come in  powell .  you haven   t explained my existence .        the rest is simple .  when these stations were first established to feed solar energy to the planets  they were run by humans .  however  the heat  the hard solar radiations  and the electron storms made the post a difficult one .  robots were developed to replace human labor and now only two human executives are required for each station .  we are trying to replace even those  and that   s where you come in .  you   re the highest type of robot ever developed and if you show the ability to run this station independently  no human need ever come here again except to bring parts for repairs .     his hand went up and the metal visi lid snapped back into place .  powell returned to the table and polished an apple upon his sleeve before biting into it .  the red glow of the robot   s eyes held him .     do you expect me     said cutie slowly     to believe any such complicated  implausible hypothesis as you have just outlined .  what do you take me for .     powell sputtered apple fragments onto the table and turned red .     why damn you  it wasn   t a hypothesis .  those were facts    cutie sounded grim     globes of energy millions of miles across .  worlds with three billion humans on them .  infinite emptiness .  sorry  powell  but i don   t believe it .  i   ll puzzle this thing out for myself .  good by .     he turned and stalked out of the room .  he brushed past michael donovan on the threshold with a grave nod and passed down the corridor  oblivious to the astounded stare that followed him .  mike donovan rumpled his red hair and shot an annoyed glance at powell     what was that walking junk yard talking about .  what doesn   t he believe .     the other dragged at his mustache bitterly .     he   s a skeptic     was the bitter response .     he doesn   t believe we made him or that earth exists or space or stars .        sizzling saturn  we   ve got a lunatic robot on our hands .        he says he   s going to figure it all out for himself .        well  now     said donovan sweetly     i do hope he   ll condescend to explain it all to me after he   s puzzled everything out    then  with sudden rage     listen .  if that metal mess gives me any lip like that  i   ll knock that chromium cranium right off its torso .     he seated himself with a jerk and drew a paper backed mystery novel out of his inner jacket pocket     that robot gives me the willies anyway    too damned inquisitive .      mike donovan growled from behind a huge lettuce and tomato sandwich as cutie knocked gently and entered .     is powell here .     donovan   s voice was muffled  with pauses for mastication     he   s gathering data on electronic stream functions .  we   re heading for a storm  looks like .     gregory powell entered as he spoke  eyes on the graphed paper in his hands  and dropped into a chair .  he spread the sheets out before him and began scribbling calculations .  donovan stared over his shoulder  crunching lettuce and dribbling breadcrumbs .  cutie waited silently .  powell looked up     the zeta potential is rising  but slowly .  just the same  the stream functions are erratic and i don   t know what to expect .  oh  hello  cutie .  i thought you were supervising the installation of the new drive bar .        it   s done     said the robot quietly     and so i   ve come to have a talk with the two of you       oh .     powell looked uncomfortable .     well  sit down .  no  not that chair .  one of the legs is weak and you   re no lightweight .     the robot did so and said placidly     i have come to a decision .     donovan glowered and put the remnants of his sandwich aside .     if it   s on any of that screwy     the other motioned impatiently for silence     go ahead  cutie .  we   re listening .        i have spent these last two days in concentrated introspection     said cutie     and the results have been most interesting .  i began at the one sure assumption i felt permitted to make .  i  myself  exist  because i think     powell groaned     oh  jupiter  a robot descartes .        who   s descartes .     demanded donovan .     listen  do we have to sit here and listen to this metal maniac        keep quiet  mike .     cutie continued imperturbably     and the question that immediately arose was  just what is the cause of my existence .     powell   s jaw set lumpily .     you   re being foolish .  i told you already that we made you .        and if you don   t believe us     added donovan     we   ll gladly take you apart .     the robot spread his strong hands in a deprecatory gesture     i accept nothing on authority .  a hypothesis must be backed by reason  or else it is worthless    and it goes against all the dictates of logic to suppose that you made me .     powell dropped a restraining arm upon donovan   s suddenly bunched fist .     just why do you say that .     cutie laughed .  it was a very inhuman laugh    the most machine like utterance he had yet given vent to .  it was sharp and explosive  as regular as a metronome and as uninflected .     look at you     he said finally .     i say this in no spirit of contempt  but look at you .  the material you are made of is soft and flabby  lacking endurance and strength  depending for energy upon the inefficient oxidation of organic material    like that .     he pointed a disapproving finger at what remained of donovan   s sandwich .     periodically you pass into a coma and the least variation in temperature  air pressure  humidity  or radiation intensity impairs your efficiency .  you are makeshift .     i  on the other hand  am a finished product .  i absorb electrical energy directly and utilize it with an almost one hundred percent efficiency .  i am composed of strong metal  am continuously conscious  and can stand extremes of environment easily .  these are facts which  with the self evident proposition that no being can create another being superior to itself  smashes your silly hypothesis to nothing .      donovan   s muttered curses rose into intelligibility as he sprang to his feet  rusty eyebrows drawn low .     all right  you son of a hunk of iron ore  if we didn   t make you  who did .     cutie nodded gravely .     very good  donovan .  that was indeed the next question .  evidently my creator must be more powerful than myself and so there was only one possibility .     the earthmen looked blank and cutie continued     what is the center of activities here in the station .  what do we all serve .  what absorbs all our attention .     he waited expectantly .  donovan turned a startled look upon his companion .     i   ll bet this tinplated screwball is talking about the energy converter itself .        is that right  cutie .     grinned powell .     i am talking about the master     came the cold  sharp answer .  it was the signal for a roar of laughter from donovan  and powell himself dissolved into a half suppressed giggle .  cutie had risen to his feet and his gleaming eyes passed from one earthman to the other .     it is so just the same and i don   t wonder that you refuse to believe .  you two are not long to stay here  i   m sure .  powell himself said that at first only men served the master  that there followed robots for the routine work  and  finally  myself for the executive labor .  the facts are no doubt true  but the explanation entirely illogical .  do you want the truth behind it all .        go ahead  cutie .  you   re amusing .        the master created humans first as the lowest type  most easily formed .  gradually  he replaced them by robots  the next higher step  and finally he created me to take the place of the last humans .  from now on  i serve the master .        you   ll do nothing of the sort     said powell sharply .     you   ll follow our orders and keep quiet  until we   re satisfied that you can run the converter .  get that .  the converter    not the master .  if you don   t satisfy us  you will be dismantled .  and now    if you don   t mind    you can leave .  and take this data with you and file it properly .     cutie accepted the graphs handed him and left without another word .  donovan leaned back heavily in his chair and shoved thick fingers through his hair .     there   s going to be trouble with that robot .  he   s pure nuts .      the drowsy hum of the converter is louder in the control room and mixed with it is the chuckle of the geiger counters and the erratic buzzing of half a dozen little signal lights .  donovan withdrew his eye from the telescope and flashed the luxites on .     the beam from station    caught mars on schedule .  we can break ours now .     powell nodded abstractedly .     cutie   s down in the engine room .  i   ll flash the signal and he can take care of it .  look  mike  what do you think of these figures .     the other cocked an eye at them and whistled .     boy  that   s what i call gamma ray intensity .  old sol is feeling his oats  all right .        yeah     was the sour response     and we   re in a bad position for an electron storm  too .  our earth beam is right in the probable path .     he shoved his chair away from the table pettishly .     nuts .  if it would only hold off till relief got here  but that   s ten days off .  say  mike  go on down and keep an eye on cutie  will you .        o . k .  throw me some of those almonds .     he snatched at the bag thrown him and headed for the elevator .  it slid smoothly downward  and opened onto a narrow catwalk in the huge engine room .  donovan leaned over the railing and looked down .  the huge generators were in motion and from the l tubes came the low pitched whir that pervaded the entire station .  he could make out cutie   s large  gleaming figure at the martian l tube  watching closely as the team of robots worked in close knit unison .  and then donovan stiffened .  the robots  dwarfed by the mighty l tube  lined up before it  heads bowed at a stiff angle  while cutie walked up and down the line slowly .  fifteen seconds passed  and then  with a clank heard above the clamorous purring all about  they fell to their knees .  donovan squawked and raced down the narrow staircase .  he came charging down upon them  complexion matching his hair and clenched fists beating the air furiously .     what the devil is this  you brainless lumps .  come on .  get busy with that l tube .  if you don   t have it apart  cleaned  and together again before the day is out  i   ll coagulate your brains with alternating current .     not a robot moved .  even cutie at the far end    the only one on his feet    remained silent  eyes fixed upon the gloomy recesses of the vast machine before him .  donovan shoved hard against the nearest robot .     stand up .     he roared .  slowly  the robot obeyed .  his photoelectric eyes focused reproachfully upon the earthman .     there is no master but the master     he said     and qt   is his prophet .        huh .     donovan became aware of twenty pairs of mechanical eyes fixed upon him and twenty stiff timbered voices declaiming solemnly     there is no master but the master and qt   is his prophet .        i   m afraid     put in cutie himself at this point     that my friends obey a higher one than you  now .        the hell they do .  you get out of here .  i   ll settle with you later and with these animated gadgets right now .     cutie shook his heavy head slowly .     i   m sorry  but you don   t understand .  these are robots    and that means they are reasoning beings .  they recognize the master  now that i have preached truth to them .  all the robots do .  they call me the prophet .     his head drooped .     i am unworthy    but perhaps     donovan located his breath and put it to use .     is that so .  now  isn   t that nice .  now  isn   t that just fine .  just let me tell you something  my brass baboon .  there isn   t any master and there isn   t any prophet and there isn   t any question as to who   s giving the orders .  understand .     his voice shot to a roar .     now  get out .        i obey only the master .        damn the master .     donovan spat at the l tube .     that for the master .  do as i say .     cutie said nothing  nor did any other robot  but donovan became aware of a sudden heightening of tension .  the cold  staring eyes deepened their crimson  and cutie seemed stiffer than ever .     sacrilege     he whispered    voice metallic with emotion .  donovan felt the first sudden touch of fear as cutie approached .  a robot could not feel anger    but cutie   s eyes were unreadable .     i am sorry  donovan     said the robot     but you can no longer stay here after this .  henceforth powell and you are barred from the control room and the engine room .     his hand gestured quietly and in a moment two robots had pinned donovan   s arms to his sides .  donovan had time for one startled gasp as he felt himself lifted from the floor and carried up the stairs at a pace rather better than a canter .   gregory powell raced up and down the officer   s room  fist tightly balled .  he cast a look of furious frustration at the closed door and scowled bitterly at donovan .     why the devil did you have to spit at the l tube .     mike donovan  sunk deep in his chair  slammed at its arms savagely .     what did you expect me to do with that electrified scarecrow .  i   m not going to knuckle under to any do jigger i put together myself .        no     came back sourly     but here you are in the officer   s room with two robots standing guard at the door .  that   s not knuckling under  is it .     donovan snarled .     wait till we get back to base .  someone   s going to pay for this .  those robots must obey us .  it   s the second law .        what   s the use of saying that .  they aren   t obeying us .  and there   s probably some reason for it that we   ll figure out too late .  by the way  do you know what   s going to happen to us when we get back to base .     he stopped before donovan   s chair and stared savagely at him .     what .        oh  nothing .  just back to mercury mines for twenty years .  or maybe ceres penitentiary .        what are you talking about .        the electron storm that   s coming up .  do you know it   s heading straight dead center across the earth beam .  i had just figured that out when that robot dragged me out of my chair .     donovan was suddenly pale .     sizzling saturn .        and do you know what   s going to happen to the beam    because the storm will be a lulu .  it   s going to jump like a flea with the itch .  with only cutie at the controls  it   s going to go out of focus and if it does  heaven help earth    and us .     donovan was wrenching at the door wildly  when powell was only half through .  the door opened  and the earthman shot through to come up hard against an immovable steel arm .  the robot stared abstractedly at the panting  struggling earthman .     the prophet orders you to remain .  please do .     his arm shoved  donovan reeled backward  and as he did so  cutie turned the corner at the far end of the corridor .  he motioned the guardian robots away  entered the officer   s room and closed the door gently .  donovan whirled on cutie in breathless indignation .     this has gone far enough .  you   re going to pay for this farce .        please  don   t be annoyed     replied the robot mildly .     it was bound to come eventually  anyway .  you see  you two have lost your function .        i beg your pardon     powell drew himself up stiffly .     just what do you mean  we   ve lost our function .        until i was created     answered cube     you tended the master .  that privilege is mine now and your only reason for existence has vanished .  isn   t that obvious .        not quite     replied powell bitterly     but what do you expect us to do now .     cutie did not answer immediately .  he remained silent  as if in thought  and then one arm shot out and draped itself about powell   s shoulder .  the other grasped donovan   s wrist and drew him closer .     i like you two .  you   re inferior creatures  with poor reasoning faculties  but i really feel a sort of affection for you .  you have served the master well  and he will reward you for that .  now that your service is over  you will probably not exist much longer  but as long as you do  you shall be provided food  clothing and shelter  so long as you stay out of the control room and the engine room .        he   s pensioning us off  greg .     yelled donovan .     do something about it .  it   s humiliating .        look here  cutie  we can   t stand for this .  we   re the bosses .  this station is only a creation of human beings like me    human beings that live on earth and other planets .  this is only an energy relay .  you   re only    aw  nuts .      cutie shook his head gravely .     this amounts to an obsession .  why should you insist so on an absolutely false view of life .  admitted that non robots lack the reasoning faculty  there is still the problem of     his voice died into reflective silence  and donovan said with whispered intensity     if you only had a flesh and blood face  i would break it in .     powell   s fingers were in his mustache and his eyes were slitted .     listen  cutie  if there is no such thing as earth  how do you account for what you see through a telescope .        pardon me .     the earthman smiled .     i   ve got you  eh .  you   ve made quite a few telescopic observations since being put together  cutie .  have you noticed that several of those specks of light outside become disks when so viewed .        oh  that .  why certainly .  it is simple magnification    for the purpose of more exact aiming of the beam .        why aren   t the stars equally magnified then .        you mean the other dots .  well  no beams go to them so no magnification is necessary .  really  powell  even you ought to be able to figure these things out .     powell stared bleakly upward .     but you see more stars through a telescope .  where do they come from .  jumping jupiter  where do they come from .     cutie was annoyed .     listen  powell  do you think i   m going to waste my time trying to pin physical interpretations upon every optical illusion of our instruments .  since when is the evidence of our senses any match for the clear light of rigid reason .        look     clamored donovan  suddenly  writhing out from under cutie   s friendly  but metal heavy arm     let   s get to the nub of the thing .  why the beams at all .  we   re giving you a good  logical explanation .  can you do better .        the beams     was the stiff reply     are put out by the master for his own purposes .  there are some things       he raised his eyes devoutly upward    that are not to be probed into by us .  in this matter  i seek only to serve and not to question .     powell sat down slowly and buried his face in shaking hands .     get out of here  cutie .  get out and let me think .        i   ll send you food     said cutie agreeably .  a groan was the only answer and the robot left .     greg     was donovan   s huskily whispered observation     this calls for strategy .  we   ve got to get him when he isn   t expecting it and short circuit him .  concentrated nitric acid in his joints        don   t be a dope  mike .  do you suppose he   s going to let us get near him with acid in our hands .  we   ve got to talk to him  i tell you .  we   ve got to argue him into letting us back into the control room inside of forty eight hours or our goose is broiled to a crisp .     he rocked back and forth in an agony of impotence .     who the heck wants to argue with a robot .  it   s .  .  .  it   s        mortifying     finished donovan .     worse .        say .     donovan laughed suddenly .     why argue .  let   s show him .  let   s build us another robot right before his eyes .  he   ll have to eat his words then .     a slowly widening smile appeared on powell   s face .  donovan continued     and think of that screwball   s face when he sees us do it .      robots are  of course  manufactured on earth  but their shipment through apace is much simpler if it can be done in parts to be put together at their place of use .  it also  incidentally  eliminates the possibility of robots  in complete adjustment  wandering off while still on earth and thus bringing u .  s .  robots face to face with the strict laws against robots on earth .  still  it placed upon men such as powell and donovan the necessity of synthesis of complete robots     a grievous and complicated task .  powell and donovan were never so aware of that fact as upon that particular day when  in the assembly room  they undertook to create a robot under the watchful eyes of qt    prophet of the master .  the robot in question  a simple mc model  lay upon the table  almost complete .  three hours    work left only the head undone  and powell paused to swab his forehead and glanced uncertainly at cutie .  the glance was not a reassuring one .  for three hours  cutie had sat  speechless and motionless  and his face  inexpressive at all times  was now absolutely unreadable .  powell groaned .     let   s get the brain in now  mike .     donovan uncapped the tightly sealed container and from the oil bath within he withdrew a second cube .  opening this in turn  he removed a globe from its sponge rubber casing .  he handled it gingerly  for it was the most complicated mechanism ever created by man .  inside the thin platinum plated    skin    of the globe was a positronic brain  in whose delicately unstable structure were enforced calculated neuronic paths  which imbued each robot with what amounted to a pre natal education .  it fitted snugly into the cavity in the skull of the robot on the table .  blue metal closed over it and was welded tightly by the tiny atomic flare .  photoelectric eyes were attached carefully  screwed tightly into place and covered by thin  transparent sheets of steel hard plastic .  the robot awaited only the vitalizing flash of high voltage electricity  and powell paused with his hand on the switch .     now watch this  cutie .  watch this carefully .     the switch rammed home and there was a crackling hum .  the two earthmen bent anxiously over their creation .  there was vague motion only at the outset    a twitching of the joints .  the head lifted  elbows propped it up  and the mc model swung clumsily off the table .  its footing was unsteady and twice abortive grating sounds were all it could do in the direction of speech .  finally  its voice  uncertain and hesitant  took form .     i would like to start work .  where must i go .     donovan sprang to the door .     down these stairs     he said .     you will be told what to do .     the mc model was gone and the two earthmen were alone with the still unmoving cutie .     well     said powell  grinning     now do you believe that we made you .     cutie   s answer was curt and final .     no .     he said .  powell   s grin froze and then relaxed slowly .  donovan   s mouth dropped open and remained so .     you see     continued cutie  easily     you have merely put together parts already made .  you did remarkably well    instinct  i suppose    but you didn   t really create the robot .  the parts were created by the master .        listen     gasped donovan hoarsely     those parts were manufactured back on earth and sent here .        well  well     replied cutie soothingly     we won   t argue .        no  i mean it .     the earthman sprang forward and grasped the robot   s metal arm .     if you were to read the books in the library  they could explain it so that there could be no possible doubt .        the books .  i   ve read them    all of them .  they   re most ingenious .     powell broke in suddenly .     if you   ve read them  what else is there to say .  you can   t dispute their evidence .  you just can   t .     there was pity in cutie   s voice .     please  powell  i certainly don   t consider them a valid source of information .  they  too  were created by the master    and were meant for you  not for me .        how do you make that out .     demanded powell .     because i  a reasoning being  am capable of deducing truth from a priori causes .  you  being intelligent  but unreasoning  need an explanation of existence supplied to you  and this the master did .  that he supplied you with these laughable ideas of far off worlds and people is  no doubt  for the best .  your minds are probably too coarsely grained for absolute truth .  however  since it is the master   s will that you believe your books  i won   t argue with you any more .     as he left  he turned  and said in a kindly tone     but don   t feel badly .  in the master   s scheme of things there is room for all .  you poor humans have your place and though it is humble  you will be rewarded if you fill it well .     he departed with a beatific air suiting the prophet of the master and the two humans avoided each other   s eyes .  finally powell spoke with an effort .     let   s go to bed  mike .  i give up .     donovan said in a hushed voice     say  greg  you don   t suppose he   s right about all this  do you .  he sounds so confident that i     powell whirled on him .     don   t be a fool .  you   d find out whether earth exists when relief gets here next week and we have to go back to face the music .        then  for the love of jupiter  we   ve got to do something .     donovan was half in tears .     he doesn   t believe us  or the books  or his eyes .        no     said powell bitterly     he   s a reasoning robot    damn it .  he believes only reason  and there   s one trouble with that     his voice trailed away .     what   s that .     prompted donovan .     you can prove anything you want by coldly logical reason    if you pick the proper postulates .  we have ours and cutie has his .        then let   s get at those postulates in a hurry .  the storm   s due tomorrow .     powell sighed wearily .     that   s where everything falls down .  postulates are based on assumption and adhered to by faith .  nothing in the universe can shake them .  i   m going to bed .        oh  hell .  i can   t sleep .        neither can i .  but i might as well try    as a matter of principle .      twelve hours later  sleep was still just that    a matter of principle  unattainable in practice .  the storm had arrived ahead of schedule  and donovan   s florid face drained of blood as he pointed a shaking finger .  powell  stubble jawed and dry lipped  stared out the port and pulled desperately at his mustache .  under other circumstances  it might have been a beautiful sight .  the stream of high speed electrons impinging upon the energy beam fluoresced into ultra spicules of intense light .  the beam stretched out into shrinking nothingness  a glitter with dancing  shining motes .  the shaft of energy was steady  but the two earthmen knew the value of naked eyed appearances .  deviations in arc of a hundredth of a millisecond    invisible to the eye    were enough to send the beam wildly out of focus    enough to blast hundreds of square miles of earth into incandescent ruin .  and a robot  unconcerned with beam  focus  or earth  or anything but his master was at the controls .  hours passed .  the earthmen watched in hypnotized silence .  and then the darting dotlets of light dimmed and went out .  the storm had ended .  powell   s voice was flat .     it   s over .     donovan had fallen into a troubled slumber and powell   s weary eyes rested upon him enviously .  the signal flash glared over and over again  but the earthman paid no attention .  it all was unimportant .  all .  perhaps cutie was right    and he was only an inferior being with a made to order memory and a life that had outlived its purpose .  he wished he were .  cutie was standing before him .     you didn   t answer the flash  so i walked in .     his voice was low .     you don   t look at all well  and i   m afraid your term of existence is drawing to an end .  still  would you like to see some of the readings recorded today .     dimly  powell was aware that the robot was making a friendly gesture  perhaps to quiet some lingering remorse in forcibly replacing the humans at the controls of the station .  he accepted the sheets held out to him and gazed at them unseeingly .  cutie seemed pleased .     of course  it is a great privilege to serve the master .  you mustn   t feel too badly about my having replaced you .     powell grunted and shifted from one sheet to the other mechanically until his blurred sight focused upon a thin red line that wobbled its way across the ruled paper .  he stared    and stared again .  he gripped it hard in both fists and rose to his feet  still staring .  the other sheets dropped to the floor  unheeded .     mike  mike .     he was shaking the other madly .     he held it steady .     donovan came to life .     what .  wh where     and he  too  gazed with bulging eyes upon the record before him .  cutie broke in .     what is wrong .        you kept it in focus     stuttered powell .     did you know that .        focus .  what   s that .        you kept the beam directed sharply at the receiving station    to within a ten thousandth of a millisecond of arc .        what receiving station .        on earth .  the receiving station on earth     babbled powell .     you kept it in focus .     cutie turned on his heel in annoyance .     it is impossible to perform any act of kindness toward you two .  always the same phantasm .  i merely kept all dials at equilibrium in accordance with the will of the master .     gathering the scattered papers together  he withdrew stiffly  and donovan said  as he left     well  i   ll be damned .     he turned to powell .     what are we going to do now .     powell felt tired  but uplifted .     nothing .  he   s just shown he can run the station perfectly .  i   ve never seen an electron storm handled so well .        but nothing   s solved .  you heard what he said of the master .  we can   t        look  mike  he follows the instructions of the master by means of dials  instruments  and graphs .  that   s all we ever followed .  as a matter of fact  it accounts for his refusal to obey us .  obedience is the second law .  no harm to humans is the first .  how can he keep humans from harm  whether he knows it or not .  why  by keeping the energy beam stable .  he knows he can keep it more stable than we can  since he insists he   s the superior being  so he must keep us out of the control room .  it   s inevitable if you consider the laws of robotics .        sure  but that   s not the point .  we can   t let him continue this nitwit stuff about the master .        why not .        because whoever heard of such a damned thing .  how are we going to trust him with the station  if he doesn   t believe in earth .        can he handle the station .        yes  but        then what   s the difference what he believes .     powell spread his arms outward with a vague smile upon his face and tumbled backward onto the bed .  he was asleep .   powell was speaking while struggling into his lightweight space jacket .     it would be a simple job     he said .     you can bring in new qt models one by one  equip them with an automatic shutoff switch to act within the week  so as to allow them enough time to learn the .  .  .  uh .  .  .  cult of the master from the prophet himself  then switch them to another station and revitalize them .  we could have two qt   s per     donovan unclasped his glassite visor and scowled .     shut up  and let   s get out of here .  relief is waiting and i won   t feel right until i actually see earth and feel the ground under my feet    just to make sure it   s really there .     the door opened as he spoke and donovan  with a smothered curse  clicked the visor to  and turned a sulky back upon cutie .  the robot approached softly and there was sorrow in his voice .     you are going .     powell nodded curtly .     there will be others in our place .     cutie sighed  with the sound of wind humming through closely spaced wires .     your term of service is over and the time of dissolution has come .  i expected it  but    well  the master   s will be done .     his tone of resignation stung powell .     save the sympathy  cube .  we   re heading for earth  not dissolution .        it is best that you think so     cutie sighed again .     i see the wisdom of the illusion now .  i would not attempt to shake your faith  even if i could .     he departed    the picture of commiseration .  powell snarled and motioned to donovan .  sealed suitcases in hand  they headed for the air lock .  the relief ship was on the outer landing and franz muller  his relief man  greeted them with stiff courtesy .  donovan made scant acknowledgment and passed into the pilot room to take over the controls from sam evans .  powell lingered .     how   s earth .     it was a conventional enough question and muller gave the conventional answer     still spinning .     powell said     good .     muller looked at him     the boys back at the u .  s .  robots have dreamed up a new one  by the way .  a multiple robot .        a what .        what i said .  there   s a big contract for it .  it must be just the thing for asteroid mining .  you have a master robot with six sub robots under it .    like your fingers .        has it been field tested .     asked powell anxiously .  muller smiled     waiting for you  i hear .     powell   s fist balled     damn it  we need a vacation .        oh  you   ll get it .  two weeks  i think .     he was donning the heavy space gloves in preparation for his term of duty here  and his thick eyebrows drew close together .     how is this new robot getting along .  it better be good  or i   ll be damned if i let it touch the controls .     powell paused before answering .  his eyes swept the proud prussian before him from the close cropped hair on the sternly stubborn head  to the feet standing stiffly at attention    and there was a sudden glow of pure gladness surging through him .     the robot is pretty good     he said slowly .     i don   t think you   ll have to bother much with the controls .     he grinned    and went into the ship .  muller would be here for several weeks .   catch that rabbit  the vacation was longer than two weeks  that  mike donovan had to admit .  it had been six months  with pay .  he admitted that  too .  but that  as he explained furiously  was fortuitous .  u .  s .  robots had to get the bugs out of the multiple robots  and there were plenty of bugs  and there are always at least half a dozen bugs left for the field testing .  so they waited and relaxed until the drawing board men and the slide rule boys had said    ok .     and now he and powell were out on the asteroid and it was not ok .  he repeated that a dozen times  with a face that had gone beety     for the love of pete  greg  get realistic .  what   s the use of adhering to the letter of the specifications and watching the test go to pot .  it   s about time you got the red tape out of your pants and went to work .        i   m only saying     said gregory powell  patiently  as one explaining electronics to an idiot child     that according to spec  those robots are equipped for asteroid mining without supervision .  we   re not supposed to watch them .        all right .  look    logic .     he lifted his hairy fingers and pointed .     one  that new robot passed every test in the home laboratories .  two  united states robots guaranteed their passing the test of actual performance on an asteroid .  three  the robots are not passing said tests .  four  if they don   t pass  united states robots loses ten million credits in cash and about one hundred million in reputation .  five  if they don   t pass and we can   t explain why they don   t pass  it is just possible two good jobs may have to be bidden a fond farewell .     powell groaned heavy behind a noticeably insincere smile .  the unwritten motto of united states robot and mechanical men corp .  was well known     no employee makes the same mistake twice .  he is fired the first time .     aloud he said     you   re as lucid as euclid with everything except the facts .  you   ve watched that robot group for three shifts  you redhead  and they did their work perfectly .  you said so yourself .  what else can we do .        find out what   s wrong  that   s what we can do .  so they did work perfectly when i watched them .  but on three different occasions when i didn   t watch them  they didn   t bring in any ore .  they didn   t even come back on schedule .  i had to go after them .        and was anything wrong .        not a thing .  not a thing .  everything was perfect .  smooth and perfect as the luminiferous ether .  only one little insignificant detail disturbed me    there was no ore .     powell scowled at the ceiling and pulled at his brown mustache .     i   ll tell you what  mike .  we   ve been stuck with pretty lousy jobs in our time  but this takes the iridium asteroid .  the whole business is complicated past endurance .  look  that robot  dv    has six robots under it .  and not just under it    they   re part of it .        i know that        shut up .     said powell  savagely     i know you know it  but i   m just describing the hell of it .  those six subsidiaries are part of dv   like your fingers are part of you and it gives them their orders neither by voice nor radio  but directly through positronic fields .  now    there isn   t a roboticist back at united states robots that knows what a positronic field is or how it works .  and neither do i .  neither do you .        the last     agreed donovan  philosophically     i know .        then look at our position .  if everything works    fine .  if anything goes wrong    we   re out of our depth and there probably isn   t a thing we can do  or anybody else .  but the job belongs to us and not to anyone else so we   re on the spot  mike .     he blazed away for a moment in silence .  then     all right  have you got him outside .        yes .        is everything normal now .        well he hasn   t got religious mania  and he isn   t running around in a circle spouting gilbert and sullivan  so i suppose he   s normal .     donovan passed out the door  shaking his head viciously .   powell reached for the    handbook of robotics    that weighed down one side of his desk to a near founder and opened it reverently .  he had once jumped out of the window of a burning house dressed only in shorts and the    handbook .     in a pinch  he would have skipped the shorts .  the    handbook    was propped up before him  when robot dv   entered  with donovan kicking the door shut behind him .  powell said somberly     hi  dave .  how do you feel .        fine     said the robot .     mind if i sit down .     he dragged up the specially reinforced chair that was his  and folded gently into it .  powell regarded dave    laymen might think of robots by their serial numbers  roboticists never    with approval .  it was not over massive by any means  in spite of its construction as thinking unit of an integrated seven unit robot team .  it was seven feet tall  and a half ton of metal and electricity .  a lot .  not when that half ton has to be a mass of condensers  circuits  relays  and vacuum cells that can handle practically any psychological reaction known to humans .  and a positronic brain  which with ten pounds of matter and a few quintillions of positrons runs the whole show .  powell groped in his shirt pocket for a loose cigarette .     dave     he said     you   re a good fellow .  there   s nothing flighty or prima donnaish about you .  you   re a stable  rockbottom mining robot  except that you   re equipped to handle six subsidiaries in direct coordination .  as far as i know  that has not introduced any unstable paths in your brain path map .     the robot nodded     that makes me feel swell  but what are you getting at  boss .     he was equipped with an excellent diaphragm  and the presence of overtones in the sound unit robbed him of much of that metallic flatness that marks the usual robot voice .     i   m going to tell you .  with all that in your favor  what   s going wrong with your job .  for instance  today   s b shift .     dave hesitated     as far as i know  nothing .        you didn   t produce any ore .        i know .        well  then     dave was having trouble     i can   t explain that  boss .  it   s been giving me a case of nerves  or it would if i let it    my subsidiaries worked smoothly .  i know i did .     he considered  his photoelectric eyes glowing intensely .  then     i don   t remember .  the day ended and there was mike and there were the ore cars  mostly empty .     donovan broke in     you didn   t report at shift end those days  dave .  you know that .        i know .  but as to why     he shook his head slowly and ponderously .  powell had the queasy feeling that if the robot   s face were capable of expression  it would be one of pain and mortification .  a robot  by its very nature  cannot bear to fail its function .  donovan dragged his chair up to powell   s desk and leaned over     amnesia  do you think .        can   t say .  but there   s no use in trying to pin disease names on this .  human disorders apply to robots only as romantic analogies .  they   re no help to robotic engineering .     he scratched his neck     i hate to put him through the elementary brain reaction tests .  it won   t help his self respect any .     he looked at dave thoughtfully and then at the field test outline given in the    handbook .     he said     see here  dave  what about sitting through a test .  it would be the wise thing to do .     the robot rose     if you say so  boss .     there was pain in his voice .   it started simply enough .  robot dv   multiplied five place figures to the heartless ticking of a stopwatch .  he recited the prime numbers between a thousand and ten thousand .  he extracted cube roots and integrated functions of varying complexity .  he went through mechanical reactions in order of increasing difficulty .  and  finally  worked his precise mechanical mind over the highest function of the robot world    the solutions of problems in judgment and ethics .  at the end of two hours  powell was copiously besweated .  donovan had enjoyed a none too nutritious diet of fingernail and the robot said     how does it look  boss .     powell said     i   ve got to think it over  dave .  snap judgments won   t help much .  suppose you go back to the c shift .  take it easy .  don   t press too hard for quota just for a while    and we   ll fix things up .     the robot left .  donovan looked at powell .     well     powell seemed determined to push up his mustache by the roots .  he said     there is nothing wrong with the currents of his positronic brain .        i   d hate to be that certain .        oh  jupiter  mike .  the brain is the surest part of a robot .  it   s quintuple checked back on earth .  if they pass the field test perfectly  the way dave did  there just isn   t a chance of brain misfunction .  that test covered every key path in the brain .        so where are we .        don   t rush me .  let me work this out .  there   s still the possibility of a mechanical breakdown in the body .  that leaves about fifteen hundred condensers  twenty thousand individual electric circuits  five hundred vacuum cells  a thousand relays  and upty ump thousand other individual pieces of complexity that can be wrong .  and these mysterious positron is fields no one knows anything about .        listen  greg     donovan grew desperately urgent .     i   ve got an idea .  that robot may be lying .  he never        robots can   t knowingly lie  you fool .  now if we had the mccormack wesley tester  we could check each individual item in his body within twenty four to forty eight hours  but the only two m w testers existing are on earth  and they weigh ten tons  are on concrete foundations and can   t be moved .  isn   t that peachy .     donovan pounded the desk     but  greg  he only goes wrong when we   re not around .  there   s something    sinister    about    that .     he punctuated the sentence with slams of fist against desk .     you     said powell  slowly     make me sick .  you   ve been reading adventure novels .        what i want to know     shouted donovan     is what we   re going to do about it .        i   ll tell you .  i   m going to install a visiplate right over my desk .  right on the wall over there  see .     he jabbed a vicious finger at the spot .     then i   m going to focus it at whatever part of the mine is being worked  and i   m going to watch .  that   s all .        that   s all .  greg     powell rose from his chair and leaned his balled fists on the desk     mike  i   m having a hard time .     his voice was weary .     for a week  you   ve been plaguing me about dave .  you say he   s gone wrong .  do you know how he   s gone wrong .  no .  do you know what shape this wrongness takes .  no .  do you know what brings it on .  no .  do you know what snaps him out .  no .  do you know anything about it .  no .  do i know anything about it .  no .  so what do you want me to do .     donovan   s arm swept outward in a vague  grandiose gesture     you got me .        so i tell you again .  before we do anything toward a cure  we   ve got to find out what the disease is in the first place .  the first step in cooking rabbit stew is catching the rabbit .  well  we   ve got to catch that rabbit .  now get out of here .      donovan stared at the preliminary outline of his field report with weary eyes .  for one thing  he was tired and for another  what was there to report while things were unsettled .  he felt resentful .  he said     greg  we   re almost a thousand tons behind schedule .        you     replied powell  never looking up     are telling me something i don   t know .        what i want to know     said donovan  in sudden savagery     is why we   re always tangled up with new type robots .  i   ve finally decided that the robots that were good enough for my great uncle on my mother   s side are good enough for me .  i   m for what   s tried and true .  the test of time is what counts    good  solid  old fashioned robots that never go wrong .     powell threw a book with perfect aim  and donovan went tumbling off his seat .     your job     said powell  evenly     for the last five years has been to test new robots under actual working conditions for united states robots .  because you and i have been so injudicious as to display proficiency at the task  we   ve been rewarded with the dirtiest jobs .  that     he jabbed holes in the air with his finger in donovan   s direction     is your work .  you   ve been griping about it  from personal memory  since about five minutes after united states robots signed you up .  why don   t you resign .        well  i   ll tell you .     donovan rolled onto his stomach  and took a firm grip on his wild  red hair to hold his head up .     there   s a certain principle involved .  after all  as a troubleshooter  i   ve played a part in the development of new robots .  there   s the principle of aiding scientific advance .  but don   t get me wrong .  it   s not the principle that keeps me going  it   s the money they pay us .  greg .     powell jumped at donovan   s wild shout  and his eyes followed the redhead   s to the visiplate  when they goggled in fixed horror .  he whispered     holy    howling    jupiter .     donovan scrambled breathlessly to his feet     look at them  greg .  they   ve gone nuts .     powell said     get a pair of suits .  we   re going out there .     he watched the posturings of the robots on the visiplate .  they were bronzy gleams of smooth motion against the shadowy crags of the airless asteroid .  there was a marching formation now  and in their own dim body light  the roughhewn walls of the mine tunnel swam past noiselessly  checkered with misty erratic blobs of shadow .  they marched in unison  seven of them  with dave at the head .  they wheeled and turned in macabre simultaneity  and melted through changes of formation with the weird ease of chorus dancers in lunar bowl .  donovan was back with the suits     they   ve gone jingo on us  greg .  that   s a military march .        for all you know     was the cold response     it may be a series of callisthenic exercises .  or dave may be under the hallucination of being a dancing master .  just you think first  and don   t bother to speak afterward  either .     donovan scowled and slipped a detonator into the empty side holster with an ostentatious shove .  he said     anyway  there you are .  so we work with new model robots .  it   s our job  granted .  but answer me one question .  why .  .  .  why does something invariably go wrong with them .        because     said powell  somberly     we are accursed .  let   s go .      far ahead through the thick velvety blackness of the corridors that reached past the illuminated circles of their flashlights  robot light twinkled .     there they are     breathed donovan .  powell whispered tensely     i   ve been trying to get him by radio but he doesn   t answer .  the radio circuit is probably out .        then i   m glad the designers haven   t worked out robots who can work in total darkness yet .  i   d hate to have to find seven mad robots in a black pit without radio communication  if they weren   t lit up like blasted radioactive christmas trees .        crawl up on the ledge above  mike .  they   re coming this way  and i want to watch them at close range .  can you make it .     donovan made the jump with a grunt .  gravity was considerably below earth normal  but with a heavy suit  the advantage was not too great  and the ledge meant a near ten foot jump .  powell followed .  the column of robots was trailing dave single file .  in mechanical rhythm  they converted to double and returned to single in different order .  it was repeated over and over again and dave never turned his head .  dave was within twenty feet when the play acting ceased .  the subsidiary robots broke formation  waited a moment  then clattered off into the distance    very rapidly .  dave looked after them  then slowly sat down .  he rested his head in one hand in a very human gesture .  his voice sounded in powell   s earphones     are you here  boss .     powell beckoned to donovan and hopped off the ledge .     o . k .   dave  what   s been going on .     the robot shook his head     i don   t know .  one moment i was handling a tough outcropping in tunnel     and the next i was aware of humans close by  and i found myself half a mile down main stem .        where are the subsidiaries now .     asked donovan .     back at work  of course .  how much time has been lost .        not much .  forget it .     then to donovan  powell added     stay with him the rest of the shift .  then  come back .  i   ve got a couple of ideas .      it was three hours before donovan returned .  he looked tired .  powell said     how did it go .     donovan shrugged wearily     nothing ever goes wrong when you watch them .  throw me a butt  will you .     the redhead lit it with exaggerated care and blew a careful smoke ring .  he said     i   ve been working it out  greg .  you know  dave has a queer background for a robot .  there are six others under him in an extreme regimentation .  he   s got life and death power over those subsidiary robots and it must react on his mentality .  suppose he finds it necessary to emphasize this power as a concession to his ego .        get to the point .        it   s right here .  suppose we have militarism .  suppose he   s fashioning himself an army .  suppose    he   s training them in military maneuvers .  suppose        suppose you go soak your head .  your nightmares must be in technicolor .  you   re postulating a major aberration of the positronic brain .  if your analysis were correct  dave would have to break down the first law of robotics  that a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to be injured .  the type of militaristic attitude and domineering ego you propose must have as the end point of its logical implications  domination of humans .        all right .  how do you know that isn   t the fact of the matter .        because any robot with a brain like that would  one  never have left the factory  and two  be spotted immediately if it ever was .  i tested dave  you know .     powell shoved his chair back and put his feet on the desk .     no .  we   re still in the position where we can   t make our stew because we haven   t the slightest notion as to what   s wrong .  for instance  if we could find out what that dance macabre we witnessed was all about  we would be on the way out .     he paused     now listen  mike  how does this sound to you .  dave goes wrong only when neither of us is present .  and when he is wrong  the arrival of either of us snaps him out of it .        i once told you that was sinister .        don   t interrupt .  how is a robot different when humans are not present .  the answer is obvious .  there is a larger requirement of personal initiative .  in that case  look for the body parts that are affected by the new requirements .        golly .     donovan sat up straight  then subsided .     no  no .  not enough .  it   s too broad .  it doesn   t cut the possibilities much .        can   t help that .  in any case  there   s no danger of not making quota .  we   ll take shifts watching those robots through the visor .  any time anything goes wrong  we get to the scene of action immediately .  that will put them right .        but the robots will fail spec anyway  greg .  united states robots can   t market dv models with a report like that .        obviously .  we   ve got to locate the error in make up and correct it    and we   ve got ten days to do it in .     powell scratched his head .     the trouble is .  .  .  well  you had better look at the blueprints yourself .     the blueprints covered the floor like a carpet and donovan crawled over the face of them following powell   s erratic pencil .  powell said     here   s where you come in  mike .  you   re the body specialist  and i want you to check me .  i   ve been trying to cut out all circuits not involved in the personal initiative hookup .  right here  for instance  is the trunk artery involving mechanical operations .  i cut out all routine side routes as emergency divisions     he looked up     what do you think .     donovan had a very bad taste in his mouth     the job   s not that simple  greg .  personal initiative isn   t an electric circuit you can separate from the rest and study .  when a robot is on his own  the intensity of the body activity increases immediately on almost all fronts .  there isn   t a circuit entirely unaffected .  what must be done is to locate the particular condition    a very specific condition    that throws him off  and then start eliminating circuits .     powell got up and dusted himself     hmph .  all right .  take away the blueprints and burn them .     donovan said     you see when activity intensifies  anything can happen  given one single faulty part .  insulation breaks down  a condenser spills over  a connection sparks  a coil overheats .  and if you work blind  with the whole robot to choose from  you   ll never find the bad spot .  if you take dave apart and test every point of his body mechanism one by one  putting him together each time  and trying him out       all right .  all right .  i can see through a porthole  too .     they faced each other hopelessly  and then powell said cautiously     suppose we interview one of the subsidiaries .     neither powell nor donovan had ever had previous occasion to talk to a    finger .     it could talk  it wasn   t quite the perfect analogy to a human finger .  in fact  it had a fairly developed brain  but that brain was tuned primarily to the reception of orders via positronic field  and its reaction to independent stimuli was rather fumbling .  nor was powell certain as to its name .  its serial number was dv      but that was not very useful .  he compromised .     look  pal     he said     i   m going to ask you to do some hard thinking and then you can go back to your boss .     the    finger    nodded its head stiffly  but did not exert its limited brainpower on speech .     now on four occasions recently     powell said     your boss deviated from brain scheme .  do you remember those occasions .        yes  sir .     donovan growled angrily     he remembers .  i tell you there is something very sinister        oh  go bash your skull .  of course  the    finger    remembers .  there is nothing wrong with him .     powell turned back to the robot     what were you doing each time .  .  .  i mean the whole group    the    finger    had a curious air of reciting by rote  as if he answered questions by the mechanical pressure of his brainpan  but without any enthusiasm whatever .  he said     the first time we were at work on a difficult outcropping in tunnel     level b .  the second time we were buttressing the roof against a possible cave in .  the third time we were preparing accurate blasts in order to tunnel farther without breaking into a subterranean fissure .  the fourth time was just after a minor cave in       what happened at these times .        it is difficult to describe .  an order would be issued  but before we could receive and interpret it  a new order came to march in queer formation .     powell snapped out     why .        i don   t know .     donovan broke in tensely     what was the first order .  .  .  the one that was superseded by the marching directions .        i don   t know .  i sensed that an order was sent  but there was never time to receive it .        could you tell us anything about it .  was it the same order each time .     the    finger    shook his head unhappily     i don   t know .     powell leaned back     all right  get back to your boss .     the    finger    left  with visible relief .  donovan said     well  we accomplished a lot that time .  that was real sharp dialogue all the way through .  listen  dave and that imbecile    finger    are both holding out on us .  there is too much they don   t know and don   t remember .  we   ve got to stop trusting them  greg .     powell brushed his mustache the wrong way     so help me  mike  another fool remark out of you  and i   ll take away your rattle and teething ring .        all right .  you   re the genius of the team .  i   m just a poor sucker .  where do we stand .        right behind the eight ball .  i tried to work it backward through the    finger     and couldn   t .  so we   ve got to work it forward .        a great man     marveled donovan .     how simple that makes it .  now translate that into english  master .        translating it into baby talk would suit you better .  i mean that we   ve got to find out what order it is that dave gives just before everything goes black .  it would be the key to the business .        and how do you expect to do that .  we can   t get close to him because nothing will go wrong as long as we are there .  we can   t catch the orders by radio because they are transmitted via this positronic field .  that eliminates the close range and the long range method  leaving us a neat  cozy zero .        by direct observation  yes .  there   s still deduction .        huh .        we   re going on shifts  mike .     powell smiled grimly .     and we are not taking our eyes off the visiplate .  we   re going to watch every action of those steel headaches .  when they go off into their act  we   re going to see what happened immediately before and we   re going to deduce the order .     donovan opened his mouth and left it that way for a full minute .  then he said in strangled tones     i resign .  i quit .        you have ten days to think up something better     said powell wearily .  which  for eight days  donovan tried mightily to do .  for eight days  on alternate four hour shifts  he watched with aching and bleary eyes those glinty metallic forms move against the vague background .  and for eight days in the four hour in betweens  he cursed united states robots  the dv models  and the day he was born .  and then on the eighth day  when powell entered with an aching head and sleepy eyes for his shift  donovan stood up and with very careful and deliberate aim launched a heavy bookend for the exact center of the visiplate .  there was a very appropriate splintering noise .  powell gasped     what did you do that for .        because     said donovan  almost calmly     i   m not watching it any more .  we   ve got two days left and we haven   t found out a thing .  dv   is a lousy loss .  he   s stopped five times since i   ve been watching and three times on your shift  and i can   t make out what orders he gave  and you couldn   t make it out .  and i don   t believe you could ever make it out because i know i couldn   t ever .        jumping space  how can you watch six robots at the same time .  one makes with the hands  and one with the feet and one like a windmill and another is jumping up and down like a maniac .  and the other two .  .  .  devil knows what they are doing .  and then they all stop .  so .  so .        greg  we   re not doing it right .  we got to get up close .  we   ve got to watch what they   re doing from where we can see the details .     powell broke a bitter silence .     yeah  and wait for something to go wrong with only two days to go .        is it any better watching from here .        it   s more comfortable .        ah    but there   s something you can do there that you can   t do here .        what   s that .        you can make them stop    at whatever time you choose and while you   re prepared and watching to see what goes wrong .     powell startled into alertness     howzzat .        well  figure it out  yourself .  you   re the brains you say .  ask yourself some questions .  when does dv   go out of whack .  when did that    finger    say he did .  when a cave in threatened  or actually occurred  when delicately measured explosives were being laid down  when a difficult seam was hit .        in other words  during emergencies     powell was excited .     right .  when did you expect it to happen .  it   s the personal initiative factor that   s giving us the trouble .  and it   s just during emergencies in the absence of a human being that personal initiative is most strained .  now what is the logical deduction .  how can we create our own stoppage when and where we want it .     he paused triumphantly    he was beginning to enjoy his role    and answered his own question to forestall the obvious answer on powell   s tongue .     by creating our own emergency .     powell said     mike    you   re right .        thanks  pal .  i knew i   d do it some day .        all right  and skip the sarcasm .  we   ll save it for earth  and preserve it in jars for future long  cold winters .  meanwhile  what emergency can we create .        we could flood the mines  if this weren   t an airless asteroid .        a witticism  no doubt     said powell .     really  mike  you   ll incapacitate me with laughter .  what about a mild cave in .     donovan pursed his lips and said     o . k .  by me .        good .  let   s get started .     powell felt uncommonly like a conspirator as he wound his way over the craggy landscape .  his sub gravity walk teetered across the broken ground  kicking rocks to right and left under his weight in noiseless puffs of gray dust .  mentally  though  it was the cautious crawl of the plotter .  he said     do you know where they are .        i think so  greg .        all right     powell said gloomily     but if any    finger    gets within twenty feet of us  we   ll be sensed whether we are in the line of sight or not .  i hope you know that .        when i need an elementary course in robotics  i   ll file an application with you formally  and in triplicate .  down through here .     they were in the tunnels now  even the starlight was gone .  the two hugged the walls  flashes flickering out the way in intermittent bursts .  powell felt for the security of his detonator .     do you know this tunnel  mike .        not so good .  it   s a new one .  i think i can make it out from what i saw in the visiplate  though     interminable minutes passed  and then mike said     feel that .     there was a slight vibration thrumming the wall against the fingers of powell   s metal incased hand .  there was no sound  naturally .     blasting .  we   re pretty close .        keep your eyes open     said powell .  donovan nodded impatiently .  it was upon them and gone before they could seize themselves    just a bronze glint across the field of vision .  they clung together in silence .  powell whispered     think it sensed us .        hope not .  but we   d better flank them .  take the first side tunnel to the right .        suppose we miss them altogether .        well what do you want to do .  go back .     donovan grunted fiercely .     they   re within a quarter of a mile .  i was watching them through the visiplate  wasn   t i .  and we   ve got two days        oh  shut up .  you   re wasting your oxygen .  is this a side passage here .     the flash flicked .     it is .  let   s go .     the vibration was considerably more marked and the ground below shuddered uneasily .     this is good     said donovan     if it doesn   t give out on us  though .     he flung his light ahead anxiously .  they could touch the roof of the tunnel with a half upstretched hand  and the bracings had been newly placed .  donovan hesitated     dead end  let   s go back .        no .  hold on .     powell squeezed clumsily past .     is that light ahead .        light .  i don   t see any .  where would there be light down here .        robot light .     he was scrambling up a gentle incline on hands and knees .  his voice was hoarse and anxious in donovan   s ears .     hey  mike  come up here .     there was light .  donovan crawled up and over powell   s outstretched legs .     an opening .        yes .  they must be working into this tunnel from the other side now i think .     donovan felt the ragged edges of the opening that looked out into what the cautious flashlight showed to be a larger and obviously main stem tunnel .  the hole was too small for a man to go through  almost too small for two men to look through simultaneously .  there   s nothing there     said donovan .     well  not now .  but there must have been a second ago or we wouldn   t have seen light .  watch out .     the walls rolled about them and they felt the impact .  a fine dust showered down .  powell lifted a cautious head and looked again .     all right  mike .  they   re there .     the glittering robots clustered fifty feet down the main stem .  metal arms labored mightily at the rubbish heap brought down by the last blast .  donovan urged eagerly     don   t waste time .  it won   t be long before they get through  and the next blast may get us .        for pete   s sake  don   t rush me .     powell unlimbered the detonator  and his eyes searched anxiously across the dusky background where the only light was robot light and it was impossible to tell a projecting boulder from a shadow .     there   s a spot in the roof  see it  almost over them .  the last blast didn   t quite get it .  if you can get it at the base  half the roof will cave in .     powell followed the dim finger     check .  now fasten your eye on the robots and pray they don   t move too far from that part of the tunnel .  they   re my light sources .  are all seven there .     donovan counted     all seven .        well  then  watch them .  watch every motion .     his detonator was lifted and remained poised while donovan watched and cursed and blinked the sweat out of his eye .  it flashed .  there was a jar  a series of hard vibrations  and then a jarring thump that threw powell heavily against donovan .  donovan yowled     greg  you threw me off .  i didn   t see a thing .     powell stared about wildly     where are they .     donovan fell into a stupid silence .  there was no sign of the robots .  it was dark as the depths of the river styx .     think we buried them .     quavered donovan .     let   s get down there .  don   t ask me what i think .     powell crawled backward at tumbling speed .     mike .     donovan paused in the act of following .     what   s wrong now .        hold on .     powell   s breathing was rough and irregular in donovan   s ears .     mike .  do you hear me  mike .        i   m right here .  what is it .        we   re blocked in .  it wasn   t the ceiling coming down fifty feet away that knocked us over .  it was our own ceiling .  the shock   s tumbled it .        what .     donovan scrambled up against a hard barrier .     turn on the flash .     powell did so .  at no point was there room for a rabbit to squeeze through .  donovan said softly     well  what do you know .      they wasted a few moments and some muscular power in an effort to move the blocking barrier .  powell varied this by wrenching at the edges of the original hole .  for a moment  powell lifted his blaster .  but in those close quarters  a flash would be suicide and he knew it .  he sat down .     you know  mike     he said     we   ve really messed this up .  we are no nearer finding out what   s wrong with dave .  it was a good idea but it blew up in our face .     donovan   s glance was bitter with an intensity totally wasted on the darkness     i hate to disturb you  old man  but quite apart from what we know or don   t know of dave  we   re slightly trapped .  if we don   t get loose  fella  we   re going to die .  d i e  die .  how much oxygen have we anyway .  not more than six hours .        i   ve thought of that .     powell   s fingers went up to his long suffering mustache and clanged uselessly against the transparent visor .     of course  we could get dave to dig us out easily in that time  except that our precious emergency must have thrown him off  and his radio circuit is out .        and isn   t that nice .     donovan edged up to the opening and managed to get his metal incased head out .  it was an extremely tight fit .     hey  greg .        what .        suppose we get dave within twenty feet .  he   ll snap to normal .  that will save us .        sure  but where is he .        down the corridor    way down .  for pete   s sake  stop pulling before you drag my head out of its socket .  i   ll give you your chance to look .     powell maneuvered his head outside     we did it all right .  look at those saps .  that must be a ballet they   re doing .        never mind the side remarks .  are they getting any closer .        can   t tell yet .  they   re too far away .  give me a chance .  pass me my flash  will you .  i   ll try to attract their attention that way .     he gave up after two minutes     not a chance .  they must be blind .  uh oh  they   re starting toward us .  what do you know .     donovan said     hey  let me see .     there was a silent scuffle .  powell said     all right .     and donovan got his head out .  they were approaching .  dave was high stepping the way in front and the six    fingers    were a weaving chorus line behind him .  donovan marveled     what are they doing .  that   s what i want to know .  it looks like the virginia reel    and dave   s a major domo  or i never saw one .        oh  leave me alone with your descriptions     grumbled powell .     how near are they .        within fifty feet and coming this way .  we   ll be out in fifteen min  uh huh huh hey y .        what   s going on .     it took powell several seconds to recover from his stunned astonishment at donovan   s vocal gyrations .     come on  give me a chance at that hole .  don   t be a hog about it .     he fought his way upward  but donovan kicked wildly     they did an about face  greg .  they   re leaving .  dave .  hey  da a ave .     powell shrieked     what   s the use of that  you fool .  sound won   t carry .        well  then     panted donovan     kick the walls  slam them  get some vibration started .  we   ve got to attract their attention somehow  greg  or we   re through .      he pounded like a madman .  powell shook him     wait  mike  wait .  listen  i   ve got an idea .  jumping jupiter  this is a fine time to get around to the simple solutions .  mike .        what do you want .     donovan pulled his head in .     let me in there fast before they get out of range .        out of range .  what are you going to do .  hey  what are you going to do with that detonator .     he grabbed powell   s arm .  powell shook off the grip violently .     i   m going to do a little shooting .        why .        that   s for later .  let   s see if it works first .  if it doesn   t  then    get out of the way and let me shoot .      the robots were flickers  small and getting smaller  in the distance .  powell lined up the sights tensely  and pulled the trigger three times .  he lowered the guns and peered anxiously .  one of the subsidiaries was down .  there were only six gleaming figures now .  powell called into his transmitter uncertainly .     dave .     a pause  then the answer sounded to both men     boss .  where are you .  my third subsidiary has had his chest blown in .  he   s out of commission .        never mind your subsidiary     said powell .     we   re trapped in a cave in where you were blasting .  can you see our flashlight .        sure .  we   ll be right there .     powell sat back and relaxed     that  my fran     is that    donovan said very softly with tears in his voice     all right  greg .  you win .  i beat my forehead against the ground before your feet .  now don   t feed me any bull .  just tell me quietly what it   s all about .        easy .  it   s just that all through we missed the obvious    as usual .  we knew it was the personal initiative circuit  and that it always happened during emergencies  but we kept looking for a specific order as the cause .  why should it be an order .        why not .        well  look  why not a type of order .  what type of order requires the most initiative .  what type of order would occur almost always only in an emergency .        don   t ask me  dreg .  tell me .        i   m doing it .  it   s the six way order .  under all ordinary conditions  one or more of the    fingers    would be doing routine tasks requiring no close supervision    in the sort of offhand way our bodies handle the routine walking motions .  but in an emergency  all six subsidiaries must be mobilized immediately and simultaneously .  dave must handle six robots at a time and something gives .  the rest was easy .  any decrease in initiative required  such as the arrival of humans  snaps him back .  so i destroyed one of the robots .  when i did  he was transmitting only five way orders .  initiative decreases    he   s normal       how did you get all that .     demanded donovan .     just logical guessing .  i tried it and it worked .     the robot   s voice was in their ears again     here i am .  can you hold out half an hour .        easy .     said powell .  then  to donovan  he continued     and now the job should be simple .  we   ll go through the circuits  and check off each part that gets an extra workout in a six way order as against a five way .  how big a field does that leave us .     donovan considered     not much  i think .  if dave is like the preliminary model we saw back at the factory  there   s a special coordinating circuit that would be the only section involved .     he cheered up suddenly and amazingly     say  that wouldn   t be bad at all .  there   s nothing to that .        all right .  you think it over and we   ll check the blueprints when we get back .  and now  till daves reaches us  i   m relaxing .        hey  wait .  just tell me one thing .  what were those queer shifting marches  those funny dance steps  that the robots went through every time they went screwy .        that .  i don   t know .  but i   ve got a notion .  remember  those subsidiaries were dave   s    fingers .     we were always saying that  you know .  well  it   s my idea that in all these interludes  whenever dave became a psychiatric case  he went off into a moronic maze  spending his time twiddling his fingers .      susan calvin  the third robot story i wrote     liar .     introduced susan calvin  with whom i promptly fell in love .  she so dominated my thoughts thereafter that  little by little  she ousted powell and donovan from their position .  those two appeared only in the three stories included in the previous section  and in a forth     escape .     in which they appear with susan calvin .  somehow the impression i get as i look back on my career is that i must have included dear susan in innumerable stories  but the fact is that she appeared in only ten stories  all of which are listed in this section .  in the tenth     feminine intuition     she emerges from retirement as an old lady who  however  has lost none of her acid charm .  you will note  by the way  that although most of the susan calvin stories were written at a time when male chauvinism was taken for granted in science fiction  susan asks no favors and beats the men at their own game .  to be sure  she remains sexually unfulfilled  but you can   t have everything .   liar .   alfred lanning lit his cigar carefully  but the tips of his fingers were trembling slightly .  his gray eyebrows hunched low as he spoke between puffs .     it reads minds all right damn little doubt about that .  but why .     he looked at mathematician peter bogert     well .     bogert flattened his black hair down with both hands     that was the thirty fourth rb model we   ve turned out  lanning .  all the others were strictly orthodox .     the third man at the table frowned .  milton ashe was the youngest officer of u .  s .  robot   mechanical men  inc .   and proud of his post .     listen  bogert .  there wasn   t a hitch in the assembly from start to finish .  i guarantee that .     bogert   s thick lips spread in a patronizing smile     do you .  if you can answer for the entire assembly line  i recommend your promotion .  by exact count  there are seventy five thousand  two hundred and thirty four operations necessary for the manufacture of a single positronic brain  each separate operation depending for successful completion upon any number of factors  from five to a hundred and five .  if any one of them goes seriously wrong  the    brain    is ruined .  i quote our own information folder  ashe .     milton ashe flushed  but a fourth voice cut off his reply .     if we   re going to start by trying to fix the blame on one another  i   m leaving .     susan calvin   s hands were folded tightly in her lap  and the little lines about her thin  pale lips deepened     we   ve got a mind reading robot on our hands and it strikes me as rather important that we find out just why it reads minds .  we   re not going to do that by saying     your fault .  my fault .         her cold gray eyes fastened upon ashe  and he grinned .  lanning grinned too  and  as always at such times  his long white hair and shrewd little eyes made him the picture of a biblical patriarch     true for you  dr .  calvin .     his voice became suddenly crisp     here   s everything in pill concentrate form .  we   ve produced a positronic brain of supposedly ordinary vintage that   s got the remarkable property of being able to tune in on thought waves .  it would mark the most important advance in robotics in decades  if we knew how it happened .  we don   t  and we have to find out .  is that clear .        may i make a suggestion .     asked bogert .     go ahead .        i   d say that until we do figure out the mess    and as a mathematician i expect it to be a very devil of a mess    we keep the existence of rd    a secret .  i mean even from the other members of the staff .  as heads of the departments  we ought not to find it an insoluble problem  and the fewer know about it        bogert is right     said dr .  calvin .     ever since the interplanetary code was modified to allow robot models to be tested in the plants before being shipped out to space  antirobot propaganda has increased .  if any word leaks out about a robot being able to read minds before we can announce complete control of the phenomenon  pretty effective capital could be made out of it .     lanning sucked at his cigar and nodded gravely .  he turned to ashe     i think you said you were alone when you first stumbled on this thought reading business .        i   ll say i was alone    i got the scare of my life .  rb    had just been taken off the assembly table and they sent him down to me .  obermann was off somewheres  so i took him down to the testing rooms myself    at least i started to take him down .     ashe paused  and a tiny smile tugged at his lips     say  did any of you ever carry on a thought conversation without knowing it .     no one bothered to answer  and he continued     you don   t realize it at first  you know .  he just spoke to me    as logically and sensibly as you can imagine    and it was only when i was most of the way down to the testing rooms that i realized that i hadn   t said anything .  sure  i thought lots  but that isn   t the same thing  is it .  i locked that thing up and ran for lanning .  having it walking beside me  calmly peering into my thoughts and picking and choosing among them gave me the willies .        i imagine it would     said susan calvin thoughtfully .  her eyes fixed themselves upon ashe in an oddly intent manner .     we are so accustomed to considering our own thoughts private .     lanning broke in impatiently     then only the four of us know .  all right .  we   ve got to go about this systematically .  ashe  i want you to check over the assembly line from beginning to end   everything .  you   re to eliminate all operations in which there was no possible chance of an error  and list all those where there were  together with its nature and possible magnitude .        tall order     grunted ashe .     naturally .  of course  you   re to put the men under you to work on this    every single one if you have to  and i don   t care if we go behind schedule  either .  but they   re not to know why  you understand .        hm m m  yes .     the young technician grinned wryly .     it   s still a lulu of a job .     lanning swiveled about in his chair and faced calvin     you   ll have to tackle the job from the other direction .  you   re the robo psychologist of the plant  so you   re to study the robot itself and work backward .  try to find out how he ticks .  see what else is tied up with his telepathic powers  how far they extend  how they warp his outlook  and just exactly what harm it has done to his ordinary rb properties .  you   ve got that .     lanning didn   t wait for dr .  calvin to answer .     i   ll co ordinate the work and interpret the findings mathematically .     he puffed violently at his cigar and mumbled the rest through the smoke     bogert will help me there  of course .     bogert polished the nails of one pudgy hand with the other and said blandly     i dare say .  i know a little in the line .        well .  i   ll get started .     ashe shoved his chair back and rose .  his pleasantly youthful face crinkled in a grin     i   ve got the darnedest job of any of us  so i   m getting out of here and to work .     he left with a slurred     b    seein    ye .     susan calvin answered with a barely perceptible nod  but her eyes followed him out of sight and she did not answer when lanning grunted and said     do you want to go up and see rb    now  dr .  calvin .      rb      s photoelectric eyes lifted from the book at the muffled sound of binges turning and he was upon his feet when susan calvin entered .  she paused to readjust the huge    no entrance    sign upon the door and then approached the robot .     i   ve brought you the texts upon hyperatomic motors  herbie    a few anyway .  would you care to look at them .     rb       otherwise known as herbie    lifted the three heavy books from her arms and opened to the title page of one     hm m m .     theory of hyperatomics .         he mumbled inarticulately to himself as he flipped the pages and then spoke with an abstracted air     sit down  dr .  calvin .  this will take me a few minutes .     the psychologist seated herself and watched herbie narrowly as he took a chair at the other side of the table and went through the three books systematically .  at the end of half an hour  he put them down     of course  i know why you brought these .     the corner of dr .  calvin   s lip twitched     i was afraid you would .  it   s difficult to work with you  herbie .  you   re always a step ahead of me .        it   s the same with these books  you know  as with the others .  they just don   t interest me .  there   s nothing to your textbooks .  your science is just a mass of collected data plastered together by makeshift theory    and all so incredibly simple  that it   s scarcely worth bothering about .     it   s your fiction that interests me .  your studies of the interplay of human motives and emotions       his mighty hand gestured vaguely as he sought the proper words .  dr .  calvin whispered     i think i understand .        i see into minds  you see     the robot continued     and you have no idea how complicated they are .  i can   t begin to understand everything because my own mind has so little in common with them    but i try  and your novels help .        yes  but i   m afraid that after going through some of the harrowing emotional experiences of our present day sentimental novel       there was a tinge of bitterness in her voice       you find real minds like ours dull and colorless .        but i don   t .     the sudden energy in the response brought the other to her feet .  she felt herself reddening  and thought wildly     he must know .     herbie subsided suddenly  and muttered in a low voice from which the metallic timbre departed almost entirely .     but  of course  i know about it  dr .  calvin .  you think of it always  so how can i help but know .     her face was hard .     have you    told anyone .        of course not .     this  with genuine surprise     no one has asked me .        well  then     she flung out     i suppose you think i am a fool .        no .  it is a normal emotion .        perhaps that is why it is so foolish .     the wistfulness in her voice drowned out everything else .  some of the woman peered through the layer of doctorhood .     i am not what you would call    attractive .        if you are referring to mere physical attraction  i couldn   t judge .  but i know  in any case  that there are other types of attraction .        nor young .     dr .  calvin had scarcely heard the robot .     you are not yet forty .     an anxious insistence had crept into herbie   s voice .     thirty eight as you count the years  a shriveled sixty as far as my emotional outlook on life is concerned .  am i a psychologist for nothing .     she drove on with bitter breathlessness     and he   s barely thirty five and looks and acts younger .  do you suppose he ever sees me as anything but .  .  .  but what i am .        you are wrong .     herbie   s steel fist struck the plastic topped table with a strident clang .     listen to me     but susan calvin whirled on him now and the hunted pain in her eyes became a blaze     why should i .  what do you know about it all  anyway  you .  .  .  you machine .  i   m just a specimen to you  an interesting bug with a peculiar mind spread eagled for inspection .  it   s a wonderful example of frustration  isn   t it .  almost as good as your books .     her voice  emerging in dry sobs  choked into silence .  the robot cowered at the outburst .  he shook his head pleadingly .     won   t you listen to me  please .  i could help you if you would let me .        how .     her lips curled .     by giving me good advice .        no  not that .  it   s just that i know what other people think    milton ashe  for instance .     there was a long silence  and susan calvin   s eyes dropped .     i don   t want to know what he thinks     she gasped .     keep quiet .        i think you would want to know what he thinks    her head remained bent  but her breath came more quickly .     you are talking nonsense     she whispered .     why should i .  i am trying to help .  milton ashe   s thoughts of you     he paused .  and then the psychologist raised her head     well .     the robot said quietly     he loves you .     for a full minute  dr .  calvin did not speak .  she merely stared .  then     you are mistaken .  you must be .  why should he .        but he does .  a thing like that cannot be hidden  not from me .        but i am so .  .  .  so     she stammered to a halt .     he looks deeper than the skin  and admires intellect in others .  milton ashe is not the type to marry a head of hair and a pair of eyes .     susan calvin found herself blinking rapidly and waited before speaking .  even then her voice trembled     yet he certainly never in any way indicated        have you ever given him a chance .        how could i .  i never thought that        exactly .     the psychologist paused in thought and then looked up suddenly .     a girl visited him here at the plant half a year ago .  she was pretty  i suppose    blond and slim .  and  of course  could scarcely add two and two .  he spent all day puffing out his chest  trying to explain how a robot was put together .     the hardness had returned     not that she understood .  who was she .     herbie answered without hesitation     i know the person you are referring to .  she is his first cousin  and there is no romantic interest there  i assure you .     susan calvin rose to her feet with a vivacity almost girlish .     now isn   t that strange .  that   s exactly what i used to pretend to myself sometimes  though i never really thought so .  then it all must be true .     she ran to herbie and seized his cold  heavy hand in both hers .     thank you  herbie .     her voice was an urgent  husky whisper .     don   t tell anyone about this .  let it be our secret    and thank you again .     with that  and a convulsive squeeze of herbie   s unresponsive metal fingers  she left .  herbie turned slowly to his neglected novel  but there was no one to read his thoughts .   milton ashe stretched slowly and magnificently  to the tune of cracking joints and a chorus of grunts  and then glared at peter bogert  ph . d .     say     he said     i   ve been at this for a week now with just about no sleep .  how long do i have to keep it up .  i thought you said the positronic bombardment in vac chamber d was the solution .     bogert yawned delicately and regarded his white hands with interest .     it is .  i   m on the track .        i know what that means when a mathematician says it .  how near the end are you .        it all depends .        on what .     ashe dropped into a chair and stretched his long legs out before him .     on lanning .  the old fellow disagrees with me .     he sighed     a bit behind the times  that   s the trouble with him .  he clings to matrix mechanics as the all in all  and this problem calls for more powerful mathematical tools .  he   s so stubborn .     ashe muttered sleepily     why not ask herbie and settle the whole affair .        ask the robot .     bogert   s eyebrows climbed .     why not .  didn   t the old girl tell you .        you mean calvin .        yeah .  susie herself .  that robot   s a mathematical wiz .  he knows all about everything plus a bit on the side .  he does triple integrals in his head and eats up tensor analysis for dessert .     the mathematician stared skeptically     are you serious .        so help me .  the catch is that the dope doesn   t like math .  he would rather read slushy novels .  honest .  you should see the tripe susie keeps feeding him     purple passion    and    love in space .            dr .  calvin hasn   t said a word of this to us .        well  she hasn   t finished studying him .  you know how she is .  she likes to have everything just so before letting out the big secret .        she   s told you .        we sort of got to talking .  i have been seeing a lot of her lately .     he opened his eyes wide and frowned     say  bogie  have you been noticing anything queer about the lady lately .     bogert relaxed into an undignified grin     she   s using lipstick  if that   s what you mean .        hell  i know that .  rouge  powder and eye shadow  too .  she   s a sight .  but it   s not that .  i can   t put my finger on it .  it   s the way she talks    as if she were happy about something .     he thought a little  and then shrugged .  the other allowed himself a leer  which  for a scientist past fifty  was not a bad job     maybe she   s in love .     ashe allowed his eyes to close again     you   re nuts  bogie .  you go speak to herbie  i want to stay here and go to sleep .        right .  not that i particularly like having a robot tell me my job  nor that i think he can do it .     a soft snore was his only answer .       herbie listened carefully as peter bogert  hands in pockets  spoke with elaborate indifference .     so there you are .  i   ve been told you understand these things  and i am asking you more in curiosity than anything else .  my line of reasoning  as i have outlined it  involves a few doubtful steps  i admit  which dr .  lanning refuses to accept  and the picture is still rather incomplete .     the robot didn   t answer  and bogert said     well .        i see no mistake     herbie studied the scribbled figures .     i don   t suppose you can go any further than that .        i daren   t try .  you are a better mathematician than i  and    well  i   d hate to commit myself .     there was a shade of complacency in bogert   s smile     i rather thought that would be the case .  it is deep .  we   ll forget it .     he crumpled the sheets  tossed them down the waste shaft  turned to leave  and then thought better of it .     by the way     the robot waited .  bogert seemed to have difficulty .     there is something    that is  perhaps you can       he stopped .  herbie spoke quietly .     your thoughts are confused  but there is no doubt at all that they concern dr .  lanning .  it is silly to hesitate  for as soon as you compose yourself  i   ll know what it is you want to ask .     the mathematician   s hand went to his sleek hair in the familiar smoothing gesture .     lanning is nudging seventy     he said  as if that explained everything .     i know that .        and he   s been director of the plant for almost thirty years .     herbie nodded .     well  now     bogert   s voice became ingratiating     you would know whether .  .  .  whether he   s thinking of resigning .  health  perhaps  or some other        quite     said herbie  and that was all .     well  do you know .        certainly .        then uh could you tell me .        since you ask  yes .     the robot was quite matter of fact about it .     he has already resigned .        what .     the exclamation was an explosive  almost inarticulate  sound .  the scientist   s large head hunched forward     say that again .        he has already resigned     came the quiet repetition     but it has not yet taken effect .  he is waiting  you see  to solve the problem of    er    myself .  that finished  he is quite ready to turn the office of director over to his successor .     bogert expelled his breath sharply     and this successor .  who is he .     he was quite close to herbie now  eyes fixed fascinatedly on those unreadable dull red photoelectric cells that were the robot   s eyes .  words came slowly     you are the next director .     and bogert relaxed into a tight smile     this is good to know .  i   ve been hoping and waiting for this .  thanks  herbie .      peter bogert was at his desk until five that morning and he was back at nine .  the shelf just over the desk emptied of its row of reference books and tables  as he referred to one after the other .  the pages of calculations before him increased microscopically and the crumpled sheets at his feet mounted into a hill of scribbled paper .  at precisely noon  he stared at the final page  rubbed a blood shot eye  yawned and shrugged .     this is getting worse each minute .  damn .     he turned at the sound of the opening door and nodded at lanning  who entered  cracking the knuckles of one gnarled hand with the other .  the director took in the disorder of the room and his eyebrows furrowed together .     new lead .     he asked .     no     came the defiant answer .     what   s wrong with the old one .     lanning did not trouble to answer  nor to do more than bestow a single cursory glance at the top sheet upon bogert   s desk .  he spoke through the flare of a match as he lit a cigar .     has calvin told you about the robot .  it   s a mathematical genius .  really remarkable .     the other snorted loudly     so i   ve heard .  but calvin had better stick to robopsychology .  i   ve checked herbie on math  and he can scarcely struggle through calculus .        calvin didn   t find it so .        she   s crazy .        and i don   t find it so .     the director   s eyes narrowed dangerously .     you .     bogert   s voice hardened .     what are you talking about .        i   ve been putting herbie through his paces all morning  and he can do tricks you never heard of .        is that so .        you sound skeptical .     lanning flipped a sheet of paper out of his vest pocket and unfolded it .     that   s not my handwriting  is it .     bogert studied the large angular notation covering the sheet     herbie did this .        right .  and if you   ll notice  he   s been working on your time integration of equation    .  it comes       lanning tapped a yellow fingernail upon the last step       to the identical conclusion i did  and in a quarter the time .  you had no right to neglect the linger effect in positronic bombardment .        i didn   t neglect it .  for heaven   s sake  lanning  get it through your head that it would cancel out        oh  sure  you explained that .  you used the mitchell translation equation  didn   t you .  well    it doesn   t apply .        why not .        because you   ve been using hyper imaginaries  for one thing .        what   s that to do with .        mitchell   s equation won   t hold when        are you crazy .  if you   ll reread mitchell   s original paper in the transactions of the far        i don   t have to .  i told you in the beginning that i didn   t like his reasoning  and herbie backs me in that .        well  then     bogert shouted     let that clockwork contraption solve the entire problem for you .  why bother with nonessentials .        that   s exactly the point .  herbie can   t solve the problem .  and if he can   t  we can   t    alone .  i   m submitting the entire question to the national board .  it   s gotten beyond us .     bogert   s chair went over backward as he jumped up a snarl  face crimson .     you   re doing nothing of the sort .     lanning flushed in his turn     are you telling me what i can   t do .        exactly     was the gritted response .     i   ve got the problem beaten and you   re not to take it out of my hands  understand .  don   t think i don   t see through you  you desiccated fossil .  you   d cut your own nose off before you   d let me get the credit for solving robotic telepathy .        you   re a damned idiot  bogert  and in one second i   ll have you suspended for insubordination       lanning   s lower lip trembled with passion .     which is one thing you won   t do  lanning .  you haven   t any secrets with a mind reading robot around  so don   t forget that i know all about your resignation .     the ash on lanning   s cigar trembled and fell  and the cigar itself followed     what .  .  .  what     bogert chuckled nastily     and i   m the new director  be it understood .  i   m very aware of that  don   t think i   m not .  damn your eyes  lanning  i   m going to give the orders about here or there will be the sweetest mess that you   ve ever been in .     lanning found his voice and let it out with a roar .     you   re suspended  d   ye hear .  you   re relieved of all duties .  you   re broken  do you understand .     the smile on the other   s face broadened     now  what   s the use of that .  you   re getting nowhere .  i   m holding the trumps .  i know you   ve resigned .  herbie told me  and he got it straight from you .     lanning forced himself to speak quietly .  he looked an old  old man  with tired eyes peering from a face in which the red had disappeared  leaving the pasty yellow of age behind     i want to speak to herbie .  he can   t have told you anything of the sort .  you   re playing a deep game  bogert  but i   m calling your bluff .  come with me .     bogert shrugged     to see herbie .  good .  damned good .      it was also precisely at noon that milton ashe looked up from his clumsy sketch and said     you get the idea .  i   m not too good at getting this down  but that   s about how it looks .  it   s a honey of a house  and i can get it for next to nothing .     susan calvin gazed across at him with melting eyes .     it   s really beautiful     she sighed .     i   ve often thought that i   d like to     her voice trailed away .     of course     ashe continued briskly  putting away his pencil     i   ve got to wait for my vacation .  it   s only two weeks off  but this herbie business has everything up in the air .     his eyes dropped to his fingernails     besides  there   s another point    but it   s a secret .        then don   t tell me .        oh  i   d just as soon  i   m just busting to tell someone    and you   re just about the best  er  confidante i could find here .     he grinned sheepishly .  susan calvin   s heart bounded  but she did not trust herself to speak .     frankly     ashe scraped his chair closer and lowered his voice into a confidential whisper     the house isn   t to be only for myself .  i   m getting married .     and then he jumped out of his seat     what   s the matter .        nothing .     the horrible spinning sensation had vanished  but it was hard to get words out .     married .  you mean        why  sure .  about time  isn   t it .  you remember that girl who was here last summer .  that   s she .  but you are sick .  you        headache .     susan calvin motioned him away weakly .     i   ve .  .  .  i   ve been subject to them lately .  i want to .  .  .  to congratulate you  of course .  i   m very glad     the inexpertly applied rouge made a pair of nasty red splotches upon her chalk white face .  things had begun spinning again .     pardon me    please     the words were a mumble  as she stumbled blindly out the door .  it had happened with the sudden catastrophe of a dream    and with all the unreal horror of a dream .  but how could it be .  herbie had said  and herbie knew .  he could see into minds .  she found herself leaning breathlessly against the doorjamb  staring into herbie   s metal face .  she must have climbed the two flights of stairs  but she had no memory of it .  the distance had been covered in an instant  as in a dream .  as in a dream .  and still herbie   s unblinking eyes stared into hers and their dull red seemed to expand into dimly shining nightmarish globes .  he was speaking  and she felt the cold glass pressing against her lips .  she swallowed and shuddered into a pertain awareness of her surroundings .  still herbie spoke  and there was agitation in his voice    as if he were hurt and frightened and pleading .  the words were beginning to make sense .     this is a dream     he was saying     and you mustn   t believe in it .  you   ll wake into the real world soon and laugh at yourself .  he loves you  i tell you .  he does  he does .  but not here .  not now .  this is an illusion .     susan calvin nodded  her voice a whisper     yes .  yes .     she was clutching herbie   s arm  clinging to it  repeating over and over     it isn   t true  is it .  it isn   t  is it .     just how she came to her senses  she never knew    but it was like passing from a world of misty unreality to one of harsh sunlight .  she pushed him away from her  pushed hard against that steely arm  and her eyes were wide .     what are you trying to do .     her voice rose to a harsh scream .     what are you trying to do .     herbie backed away     i want to help    the psychologist stared     help .  by telling me this is a dream .  by trying to push me into schizophrenia .     a hysterical tenseness seized her     this is no dream .  i wish it were .     she drew her breath sharply     wait .  why .  .  .  why  i understand .  merciful heavens  it   s so obvious .     there was horror in the robot   s voice     i had to .        and i believed you .  i never thought       loud voices outside the door brought her to a halt .  she turned away  fists clenching spasmodically  and when bogert and lanning entered  she was at the far window .  neither of the men paid her the slightest attention .  they approached herbie simultaneously  lanning angry and impatient  bogert  coolly sardonic .  the director spoke first .     here now  herbie .  listen to me .     the robot brought his eyes sharply down upon the aged director     yes  dr .  lanning .        have you discussed me with dr .  bogert .        no  sir .     the answer came slowly  and the smile on bogert   s face flashed off .     what   s that .     bogert shoved in ahead of his superior and straddled the ground before the robot .     repeat what you told me yesterday .        i said that     herbie fell silent .  deep within him his metallic diaphragm vibrated in soft discords .     didn   t you say he had resigned .     roared bogert .     answer me .     bogert raised his arm frantically  but lanning pushed him aside     are you trying to bully him into lying .        you heard him  lanning .  he began to say    yes    and stopped .  get out of my way .  i want the truth out of him  understand .        i   ll ask him .     lanning turned to the robot .     all right  herbie  take it easy .  have i resigned .     herbie stared  and lanning repeated anxiously     have i resigned .     there was the faintest trace of a negative shake of the robot   s head .  a long wait produced nothing further .  the two men looked at each other and the hostility in their eyes was all but tangible .     what the devil     blurted bogert     has the robot gone mute .  can   t you speak  you monstrosity .        i can speak     came the ready answer .     then answer the question .  didn   t you tell me lanning had resigned .  hasn   t he resigned .     and again there was nothing but dull silence  until from the end of the room susan calvin   s laugh rang out suddenly  high pitched and semi hysterical .  the two mathematicians jumped  and bogerts eyes narrowed     you here .  what   s so funny .        nothing   s funny .     her voice was not quite natural .     it   s just that i   m not the only one that   s been caught .  there   s irony in three of the greatest experts in robotics in the world falling into the same elementary trap  isn   t there .     her voice faded  and she put a pale hand to her forehead     but it isn   t funny .     this time the look that passed between the two men was one of raised eyebrows .     what trap are you talking about .     asked lansing stiffly .     is something wrong with herbie .        no     she approached them slowly     nothing is wrong with him    only with us .     she whirled suddenly and shrieked at the robot     get away from me .  go to the other end of the room and don   t let me look at you .     herbie cringed before the fury of her eyes and stumbled away in a clattering trot .  lanning   s voice was hostile     what is all this  dr .  calvin .     she faced them and spoke sarcastically     surely you know the fundamental first law of robotics .     the other two nodded together .     certainly     said bogert  irritably     a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow him to come to harm       how nicely put     sneered calvin .     but what kind of harm .        why    any kind .        exactly .  any kind .  but what about hurt feelings .  what about deflation of one   s ego .  what about the blasting of one   s hopes .  is that injury .     lanning frowned     what would a robot know about     and then he caught himself with a gasp .     you   ve caught on  have you .  this robot reads minds .  do you suppose it doesn   t know everything about mental injury .  do you suppose that if asked a question  it wouldn   t give exactly that answer that one wants to hear .  wouldn   t any other answer hurt us  and wouldn   t herbie know that .        good heavens .     muttered bogert .  the psychologist cast a sardonic glance at him     i take it you asked him whether lanning had resigned .  you wanted to hear that he had resigned and so that   s what herbie told you .        and i suppose that is why     said lanning  tonelessly     it would not answer a little while ago .  it couldn   t answer either way without hurting one of us .     there was a short pause in which the men looked thoughtfully across the room at the robot  crouching in the chair by the bookcase  head resting in one hand .  susan calvin stared steadfastly at the floor     he knew of all this .  that .  .  .  that devil knows everything    including what went wrong in his assembly .     her eyes were dark and brooding .  lanning looked up     you   re wrong there  dr .  calvin .  he doesn   t know what went wrong .  i asked him .        what does that mean .     cried calvin .     only that you didn   t want him to give you the solution .  it would puncture your ego to have a machine do what you couldn   t .  did you ask him .     she shot at bogert .     in a way .     bogert coughed and reddened .     he told me he knew very little about mathematics .     lanning laughed  not very loudly and the psychologist smiled caustically .  she said     i   ll ask him .  a solution by him won   t hurt my ego    she raised her voice into a cold  imperative     come here .     herbie rose and approached with hesitant steps .     you know  i suppose     she continued     just exactly at what point in the assembly an extraneous factor was introduced or an essential one left out .        yes     said herbie  in tones barely heard .     hold on     broke in bogert angrily .     that   s not necessary true .  you want to hear that  that   s all .        don   t be a fool     replied calvin .     he certainly knows as much math as you and lanning together  since he can read minds .  give him his chance .     the mathematician subsided  and calvin continued     all right  then  herbie  give .  we   re waiting .     and in an aside     get pencils and paper  gentlemen .     but herbie remained silent  and there was triumph in the psychologist   s voice     why don   t you answer  herbie .     the robot blurted out suddenly     i cannot .  you know i cannot .  dr .  bogert and dr .  lanning don   t want me to .        they want the solution .        but not from me .     lanning broke in  speaking slowly and distinctly     don   t be foolish  herbie .  we do want you to tell us .     bogert nodded curtly .  herbie   s voice rose to wild heights     what   s the use of saying that .  don   t you suppose that i can see past the superficial skin of your mind .  down below  you don   t want me to .  i   m a machine  given the imitation of life only by virtue of the positronic interplay in my brain    which is man   s device .  you can   t lose face to me without being hurt .  that is deep in your mind and won   t be erased .  i can   t give the solution .        we   ll leave     said dr .  lanning .     tell calvin .        that would make no difference     cried herbie     since you would know anyway that it was i that was supplying the answer .     calvin resumed     but you understand  herbie  that despite that  drs .  lanning and bogert want that solution .        by their own efforts .     insisted herbie .     but they want it  and the fact that you have it and won   t give it hurts them .  you see that  don   t you .        yes .  yes .        and if you tell them that will hurt them  too       yes .  yes .     herbie was retreating slowly  and step by step susan calvin advanced .  the two men watched in frozen bewilderment .     you can   t tell them     droned the psychologist slowly     because that would hurt and you mustn   t hurt .  but if you don   t tell them  you hurt  so you must tell them .  and if you do  you will hurt and you mustn   t  so you can   t tell them  but if you don   t  you hurt  so you must  but if you do  you hurt  so you mustn   t  but if you don   t  you hurt  so you must  but if you do  you     herbie was up against the wall  and here he dropped to his knees .     stop .     he shrieked .     close your mind .  it is full of pain and frustration and hate .  i didn   t mean it  i tell you .  i tried to help .  i told you what you wanted to hear .  i had to .     the psychologist paid no attention .     you must tell them  but if you do  you hurt  so you mustn   t  but if you don   t  you hurt  so you must  but     and herbie screamed .  it was like the whistling of a piccolo many times magnified    shrill and shriller till it keened with the terror of a lost soul and filled the room with the piercingness of itself .  and when it died into nothingness  herbie collapsed into a huddled heap of motionless metal .  bogert   s face was bloodless     he   s dead .        no .     susan calvin burst into body racking gusts of wild laughter     not dead    merely insane .  i confronted him with the insoluble dilemma  and he broke down .  you can scrap him now    because he   ll never speak again .     lanning was on his knees beside the thing that had been herbie .  his fingers touched the cold  unresponsive metal face and he shuddered .     you did that on purpose .     he rose and faced her  face contorted .     what if i did .  you can   t help it now .     and in a sudden access of bitterness     he deserved it .     the director seized the paralyzed  motionless bogert by the wrist     what   s the difference .  come  peter .     he sighed     a thinking robot of this type is worthless anyway .     his eyes were old and tired  and he repeated     come  peter .     it was minutes after the two scientists left that dr .  susan calvin regained part of her mental equilibrium .  slowly  her eyes turned to the living dead herbie and the tightness returned to her face .  long she stared while the triumph faded and the helpless frustration returned    and of all her turbulent thoughts only one infinitely bitter word passed her lips .     liar .      satisfaction guaranteed  tony was tall and darkly handsome  with an incredibly patrician air drawn into every line of his unchangeable expression  and claire belmont regarded him through the crack in the door with a mixture of horror and dismay .     i can   t  larry .  i just can   t have him in the house .     feverishly  she was searching her paralyzed mind for a stronger way of putting it  some way that would make sense and settle things  but she could only end with a simple repetition .     well  i can   t .     larry belmont regarded his wife stiffly  and there was that spark of impatience in his eyes that claire hated to see  since she felt her own incompetence mirrored in it .     we   re committed  claire     he said     and i can   t have you backing out now .  the company is sending me to washington on this basis  and it probably means a promotion .  it   s perfectly safe and you know it .  what   s your objection .     she frowned helplessly .     it just gives me the chills .  i couldn   t bear him .        he   s as human as you or i  almost .  so  no nonsense .  come  get out there .     his hand was in the small of her back  shoving  and she found herself in her own living room  shivering .  it was there  looking at her with a precise politeness  as though appraising his hostess to be of the next three weeks .  dr .  susan calvin was there  too  sitting stiffly in thin lipped abstraction .  she had the cold  faraway look of someone who has worked with machines so long that a little of the steel had entered the blood .     hello     crackled claire in general  and ineffectual  greeting .  but larry was busily saving the situation with a spurious gaiety .     here  claire  i want you to meet tony  a swell guy .  this is my wife  claire  tony  old boy .     larry   s hand draped itself amiably over tony   s shoulder  but tony remained unresponsive and expressionless under the pressure .  he said     how do you do  mrs .  belmont .     and claire jumped at tony   s voice .  it was deep and mellow  smooth as the hair on his head or the skin on his face .  before she could stop herself  she said     oh  my  you talk .        why not .  did you expect that i didn   t .     but claire could only smile weakly .  she didn   t really know what she had expected .  she looked away  then let him slide gently into the comer of her eye .  his hair was smooth and black  like polished plastic  or was it really composed of separate hairs .  and was the even  olive skin of his hands and face continued on past the obscurement of his formally cut clothing .  she was lost in the shuddering wonder of it  and had to force her thoughts back into place to meet dr .  calvin   s flat  unemotional voice .     mrs .  belmont  i hope you appreciate the importance of this experiment .  your husband tells me he has given you some of the background .  i would like to give you more  as the senior psychologist of the u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .     tony is a robot .  his actual designation on the company files is tn    but he will answer to tony .  he is not a mechanical monster  nor simply a calculating machine of the type that were developed during world war ii  fifty years ago .  he has an artificial brain nearly as complicated as our own .  it is an immense telephone switchboard on an atomic scale  so that billions of possible    telephone connections    can be compressed into an instrument that will fit inside a skull .     such brains are manufactured for each model of robot specifically .  each contains a precalculated set of connections so that each robot knows the english language to start with and enough of anything else that may be necessary to perform his job .     until now  u . s .  robots has confined its manufacturing activity to industrial models for use in places where human labor is impractical  in deep mines  for instance  or in underwater work .  but we want to invade the city and the home .  to do so  we must get the ordinary man and woman to accept these robots without fear .  you understand that there is nothing to fear .        there isn   t  claire     interposed larry earnestly .     take my word for it .  it   s impossible for him to do any harm .  you know i wouldn   t leave him with you otherwise .     claire cast a quick  secret glance at tony and lowered her voice .     what if i make him angry .        you needn   t whisper     said dr .  calvin calmly .     he can   t get angry with you  my dear .  i told you that the switchboard connections of his brain were predetermined .  well  the most important connection of all is what we call the first law of robotics     and it is merely this     no robot can harm a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     all robots are built so .  no robot can be forced in any way to do harm to any human .  so  you see  we need you and tony as a preliminary experiment for our own guidance  while your husband is in washington to arrange for government supervised legal tests .        you mean all this isn   t legal .     larry cleared his throat .     not just yet  but it   s all right .  he won   t leave the house  and you mustn   t let anyone see him .  that   s all .  .  .  .  and  claire  i   d stay with you  but i know too much about the robots .  we must have a completely inexperienced tester so that we can have severe conditions .  it   s necessary .        oh  well     muttered claire .  then  as a thought struck her     but what does he do .        housework     said dr .  calvin shortly .  she got up to leave  and it was larry who saw her to the front door .  claire stayed behind drearily .  she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror above the mantelpiece  and looked away hastily .  she was very tired of her small  mousy face and her dim  unimaginative hair .  then she caught tony   s eyes upon her and almost smiled before she remembered .  .  .  .  he was only a machine .   larry belmont was on his way to the airport when he caught a glimpse of gladys claffern .  she was the type of woman who seemed made to be seen in glimpses .  .  .  .  perfectly and precisely manufactured  dressed with thoughtful hand and eye  too gleaming to be stared at .  the little smile that preceded her and the faint scent that trailed her were a pair of beckoning fingers .  larry felt his stride break  he touched his hat  then hurried on .  as always he felt that vague anger .  if claire could only push her way into the claffern clique  it would help so much .  but what was the use .  claire .  the few times she had come face to face with gladys  the little fool had been tongue tied .  he had no illusions .  the testing of tony was his big chance  and it was in claire   s hands .  how much safer it would be in the hands of someone like gladys claffern .   claire woke the second morning to the sound of a subdued knock on the bedroom door .  her mind clamored  then went icy .  she had avoided tony the first day  smiling thinly when she met him and brushing past with a wordless sound of apology .     is that you  tony .        yes  mrs .  belmont .  may i enter .     she must have said yes  because he was in the room  quite suddenly and noiselessly .  her eyes and nose were simultaneously aware of the tray he was carrying .     breakfast .     she said .     if you please .     she wouldn   t have dared to refuse  so she pushed herself slowly into a sitting position and received it  poached eggs  buttered toast  coffee .     i have brought the sugar and cream separately     said tony .     i expect to learn your preference with time  in this and in other things .     she waited .  tony  standing there straight and pliant as a metal rule  asked  after a moment     would you prefer to eat in privacy .        yes .  .  .  .  i mean  if you don   t mind .        will you need help later in dressing .        oh  my  no .     she clutched frantically at the sheet  so that the coffee hovered at the edge of catastrophe .  she remained so  in rigor  then sank helplessly back against the pillow when the door closed him out of her sight again .  she got through breakfast somehow .  .  .  .  he was only a machine  and if it were only more visible that he were it wouldn   t be so frightening .  or if his expression would change .  it just stayed there  nailed on .  you couldn   t tell what went on behind those dark eyes and that smooth  olive skin stuff .  the coffee cup beat a faint castanet for a moment as she set it back  empty  on the tray .  then she realized that she had forgotten to add the sugar and cream after all  and she did so hate black coffee .   she burned a straight path from bedroom to kitchen after dressing .  it was her house  after all  and there wasn   t anything frippy about her  but she liked her kitchen clean .  he should have waited for supervision .  .  .  .  but when she entered  she found a kitchen that might have been minted fire new from the factory the moment before .  she stopped  stared  turned on her heel and nearly ran into tony .  she yelped .     may i help .     he asked .     tony     and she scraped the anger off the edges of her mind   s panic     you must make some noise when you walk .  i can   t have you stalking me  you know .  .  .  .  didn   t you use this kitchen .        i did  mrs .  belmont .        it doesn   t look it .        i cleaned up afterward .  isn   t that customary .     claire opened her eyes wide .  after all  what could one say to that .  she opened the oven compartment that held the pots  took a quick  unseeing look at the metallic glitter inside  then said with a tremor     very good .  quite satisfactory .     if at the moment  he had beamed  if he had smiled  if he had quirked the corner of his mouth the slightest bit  she felt that she could have warmed to him .  but he remained an english lord in repose  as he said     thank you  mrs .  belmont .  would you come into the living room .     she did  and it struck her at once .     have you been polishing the furniture .        is it satisfactory  mrs .  belmont .        but when .  you didn   t do it yesterday .        last night  of course .        you burned the lights all night .        oh  no .  that wouldn   t have been necessary .  i   ve a built in ultra violet source .  i can see in ultraviolet .  and  of course  i don   t require sleep .     he did require admiration  though .  she realized that  then .  he had to know that he was pleasing her .  but she couldn   t bring herself to supply that pleasure for him .  she could only say sourly     your kind will put ordinary houseworkers out of business .        there is work of much greater importance they can be put to in the world  once they are freed of drudgery .  after all  mrs .  belmont  things like myself can be manufactured .  but nothing yet can imitate the creativity and versatility of a human brain  like yours .     and though his face gave no hint  his voice was warmly surcharged with awe and admiration  so that claire flushed and muttered     my brain .  you can have it .     tony approached a little and said     you must be unhappy to say such a thing .  is there anything i can do .     for a moment  claire felt like laughing .  it was a ridiculous situation .  here was an animated carpet sweeper  dishwasher  furniture polisher  general factotum  rising from the factory table  and offering his services as consoler and confidant .  yet she said suddenly  in a burst of woe and voice     mr .  belmont doesn   t think i have a brain  if you must know .  .  .  .  and i suppose i haven   t .     she couldn   t cry in front of him .  she felt  for some reason  that she had the honor of the human race to support against this mere creation .     it   s lately     she added .     it was all right when he was a student  when he was just starting .  but i can   t be a big man   s wife  and he   s getting to be a big man .  he wants me to be a hostess and an entry into social life for him  like g  guh  guh  gladys claffern .     her nose was red  and she looked away .  but tony wasn   t watching her .  his eyes wandered about the room .     i can help you run the house .        but it   s no good     she said fiercely .     it needs a touch i can   t give it .  i can only make it comfortable  i can   t ever make it the kind they take pictures of for the home beautiful magazines .        do you want that kind .        does it do any good  wanting .     tony   s eyes were on her  full .     i could help .        do you know anything about interior decoration .        is it something a good housekeeper should know .        oh  yes .        then i have the potentialities of learning it .  can you get me books on the subject .     something started then .   claire  clutching her hat against the brawling liberties of the wind  had manipulated two fat volumes on the home arts back from the public library .  she watched tony as he opened one of them and flipped the pages .  it was the first time she had watched his fingers flicker at anything like fine work .  i don   t see how they do it  she thought  and on a sudden impulse reached for his hand and pulled it toward herself .  tony did not resist  but let it lie limp for inspection .  she said     it   s remarkable .  even your fingernails look natural .        that   s deliberate  of course     said tony .  then  chattily     the skin is a flexible plastic  and the skeletal framework is a light metal alloy .  does that amuse you .        oh  no .     she lifted her reddened face .     i just feel a little embarrassed at sort of poking into your insides .  it   s none of my business .  you don   t ask me about mine .        my brain paths don   t include that type of curiosity .  i can only act within my limitations  you know .     and claire felt something tighten inside her in the silence that followed .  why did she keep forgetting he was a machine .  now the thing itself had to remind her .  was she so starved for sympathy that she would even accept a robot as equal  because he sympathized .  she noticed tony was still flipping the pages  almost helplessly  and there was a quick  shooting sense of relieved superiority within her .     you can   t read  can you .     tony looked up at her  his voice calm  unreproachful .     i am reading  mrs .  belmont .        but      she pointed at the book in a meaningless gesture .     i am scanning the pages  if that   s what you mean .  my sense of reading is photographic .     it was evening then  and when claire eventually went to bed tony was well into the second volume  sitting there in the dark  or what seemed dark to claire   s limited eyes .  her last thought  the one that clamored at her just as her mind let go and tumbled  was a queer one .  she remembered his hand again  the touch of it .  it had been warm and soft  like a human being   s .  how clever of the factory  she thought  and softly ebbed to sleep .   it was the library continuously  thereafter  for several days .  tony suggested the fields of study  which branched out quickly .  there were books on color matching and on cosmetics  on carpentry and on fashions  on art and on the history of costumes .  he turned the pages of each book before his solemn eyes  and  as quickly as he turned  he read  nor did he seem capable of forgetting .  before the end of the week  he had insisted on cutting her hair  introducing her to a new method of arranging it  adjusting her eyebrow line a bit and changing the shade of her powder and lipstick .  she had palpitated in nervous dread for half an hour under the delicate touch of his inhuman fingers and then looked in the mirror .     there is more that can be done     said tony     especially in clothes .  how do you find it for a beginning .     and she hadn   t answered  not for quite a while .  not until she had absorbed the identity of the stranger in the glass and cooled the wonder at the beauty of it all .  then she had said chokingly  never once taking her eyes from the warming image     yes  tony  quite good  for a beginning .     she said nothing of this in her letters to larry .  let him see it all at once .  and something in her realized that it wasn   t only the surprise she would enjoy .  it was going to be a kind of revenge .   tony said one morning     it   s time to start buying  and i   m not allowed to leave the house .  if i write out exactly what we must have  can i trust you to get it .  we need drapery  and furniture fabric  wallpaper  carpeting  paint  clothing  and any number of small things .        you can   t get these things to your own specifications at a stroke   s notice     said claire doubtfully .     you can get fairly close  if you go through the city and if money is no object .        but  tony  money is certainly an object .        not at all .  stop off at u . s .  robots in the first place .  i   ll write a note for you .  you see dr .  calvin  and tell her that i said it was part of the experiment .      dr .  calvin  somehow  didn   t frighten her as on that first evening .  with her new face and a new hat  she couldn   t be quite the old claire .  the psychologist listened carefully  asked a few questions  nodded  and then claire found herself walking out  armed with an unlimited charge account against the assets of u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .  it is wonderful what money will do .  with a store   s contents at her feet  a saleslady   s dictum was not necessarily a voice from above  the uplifted eyebrow of a decorator was not anything like jove   s thunder .  and once  when an exalted plumpness at one of the most lordly of the garment salons had insistently poohed her description of the wardrobe she must have with counterpronouncements in accents of the purest fifty seventh street french  she called up tony  then held the phone out to monsieur .     if you don   t mind     voice firm  but fingers twisting a bit     i   d like you to talk to my  uh  secretary .     pudgy proceeded to the phone with a solemn arm crooked behind his back .  he lifted the phone in two fingers and said delicately     yes .     a short pause  another    yes     then a much longer pause  a squeaky beginning of an objection that perished quickly  another pause  a very meek    yes     and the phone was restored to its cradle .     if madam will come with me     he said  hurt and distant     i will try to supply her needs .        just a second .     claire rushed back to the phone  and dialed again .     hello  tony .  i don   t know what you said  but it worked .  thanks .  you   re a      she struggled for the appropriate word  gave up and ended in a final little squeak       a  a dear .     it was gladys claffern looking at her when she turned from the phone again .  a slightly amused and slightly amazed gladys claffern  looking at her out of a face tilted a bit to one side .     mrs .  belmont .     it all drained out of claire  just like that .  she could only nod  stupidly  like a marionette .  gladys smiled with an insolence you couldn   t put your finger on .     i didn   t know you shopped here .     as if the place had  in her eyes  definitely lost caste through the fact .     i don   t  usually     said claire humbly .     and haven   t you done something to your hair .  it   s quite  quaint .  .  .  .  oh  i hope you   ll excuse me  but isn   t your husband   s name lawrence .  it seems to me that it   s lawrence .     claire   s teeth clenched  but she had to explain .  she had to .     tony is a friend of my husband   s .  he   s helping me select some things .        i understand .  and quite a dear about it  i imagine .     she passed on smiling  carrying the light and the warmth of the world with her .   claire did not question the fact that it was to tony that she turned for consolation .  ten days had cured her of reluctance .  and she could weep before him  weep and rage .     i was a complete f fool     she stormed  wrenching at her water togged handkerchief .     she does that to me .  i don   t know why .  she just does .  i should have  kicked her .  i should have knocked her down and stamped on her .        can you hate a human being so much .     asked tony  in puzzled softness .     that part of a human mind is closed to me .        oh  it isn   t she     she moaned .     it   s myself  i suppose .  she   s everything i want to be  on the outside  anyway .  .  .  .  and i can   t be .     tony   s voice was forceful and low in her ear .     you can be  mrs .  belmont .  you can be .  we have ten days yet  and in ten days the house will no longer be itself .  haven   t we been planning that .        and how will that help me  with her .        invite her here .  invite her friends .  have it the evening before i  before i leave .  it will be a housewarming  in a way .        she won   t come .        yes  she will .  she   ll come to laugh .  .  .  .  and she won   t be able to .        do you really think so .  oh  tony  do you think we can do it .     she had both his hands in hers .  .  .  .  and then  with her face flung aside     but what good would it be .  it won   t be i  it will be you that   s doing it .  i can   t ride your back .        nobody lives in splendid singleness     whispered tony .     they   ve put that knowledge in me .  what you  or anyone  see in gladys claffern is not just gladys claffern .  she rides the back of all that money and social position can bring .  she doesn   t question that .  why should you .   .  .  .  and look at it this way  mrs .  belmont .  i am manufactured to obey  but the extent of my obedience is for myself to determine .  i can follow orders niggardly or liberally .  for you  it is liberal  because you are what i have been manufactured to see human beings as .  you are kind  friendly  unassuming .  mrs .  claffern  as you describe her  is not  and i wouldn   t obey her as i would you .  so it is you  and not i  mrs .  belmont  that is doing all this .     he withdrew his hands from hers then  and claire looked at that expressionless face no one could read  wondering .  she was suddenly frightened     again in a completely new way .  she swallowed nervously and stared at her hands  which were still tingling     with the pressure of his fingers .  she hadn   t imagined it  his fingers had pressed hers  gently  tenderly  just before they moved away .  no .  its fingers  .  .  .  its fingers .  .  .  .  she ran to the bathroom and scrubbed her hands  blindly  uselessly .   she was a bit shy of him the next day  watching him narrowly  waiting to see what might follow  and for a while nothing did .  tony was working .  if there was any difficulty in technique in putting up wallpaper  or utilizing the quick drying paint  tony   s activity did not show it .  his hands moved precisely  his fingers were deft and sure .  he worked all night .  she never heard him  but each morning was a new adventure .  she couldn   t count the number of things that had been done  and by evening she was still finding new touches  and another night had come .  she tried to help only once and her human clumsiness marred that .  he was in the next room  and she was hanging a picture in the spot marked by tony   s mathematical eyes .  the little mark was there  the picture was there  and a revulsion against idleness was there .  but she was nervous  or the ladder was rickety .  it didn   t matter .  she felt it going  and she cried out .  it tumbled without her  for tony  with far more than flesh and blood quickness  had been under her .  his calm  dark eyes said nothing at all  and his warm voice said only words .     are you hurt  mrs .  belmont .     she noticed for an instant that her falling hand must have mussed that sleek hair of his  because for the first time she could see for herself that it was composed of distinct strands  fine black hairs .  and then  all at once  she was conscious of his arms about her shoulders and under her knees  holding her tightly and warmly .  she pushed  and her scream was loud in her own ears .  she spent the rest of the day in her room  and thereafter she slept with a chair upended against the doorknob of her bedroom door .   she had sent out the invitations  and  as tony had said  they were accepted .  she had only to wait for the last evening .  it came  too  after the rest of them  in its proper place .  the house was scarcely her own .  she went through it one last time  and every room had been changed .  she  herself  was in clothes she would never have dared wear before .  .  .  .  and when you put them on  you put on pride and confidence with them .  she tried a polite look of contemptuous amusement before the minor  and the mirror sneered back at her masterfully .  what would larry say .   .  .  .  it didn   t matter  somehow .  the exciting days weren   t coming with him .  they were leaving with tony .  now wasn   t that strange .  she tried to recapture her mood of three weeks before and failed completely .   the clock shrieked eight at her in eight breathless installments  and she turned to tony .     they   ll be here soon  tony .  you   d better get into the basement .  we can   t let them      she stared a moment  then said weakly     tony .     and more strongly     tony .     and nearly a scream     tony .     but his arms were around her now  his face was close to hers  the pressure of his embrace was relentless .  she heard his voice through a haze of emotional jumble .     claire     the voice said     there are many things i am not made to understand  and this must be one of them .  i am leaving tomorrow  and i don   t want to .  i find that there is more in me than just a desire to please you .  isn   t it strange .     his face was closer  his lips were warm  but with no breath behind them   for machines do not breathe .  they were almost on hers .   .  .  .  and the bell sounded .  for a moment  she struggled breathlessly  and then he was gone and nowhere in sight  and the bell was sounding again .  its intermittent shrillness was insistent .  the curtains on the front windows had been pulled open .  they had been closed fifteen minutes earlier .  she knew that .  they must have seen  then .  they must all have seen  everything .   they came in so politely  all in a bunch  the pack come to howl  with their sharp  darting eyes piercing everywhere .  they had seen .  why else would gladys ask in her jabbingest manner after larry .  and claire was spurred to a desperate and reckless defiance .  yes  he is away .  he   ll be back tomorrow  i suppose .  no  i haven   t been lonely here myself .  not a bit .  i   ve had an exciting time .  and she laughed at them .  why not .  what could they do .  larry would know the truth  if it ever came to him  the story of what they thought they saw .  but they didn   t laugh .  she could read that in the fury in gladys claffern   s eyes  in the false sparkle of her words  in her desire to leave early .  and as she parted with them  she caught one last  anonymous whisper  disjointed .      .  .  .  never saw anything like  .  .  .  so handsome      and she knew what it was that had enabled her to finger snap them so .  let each cat mew  and let each cat know  that she might be prettier than claire belmont  and grander  and richer  but not one  not one  could have so handsome a lover .  and then she remembered again  again  again  that tony was a machine  and her skin crawled .     go away .  leave me be .     she cried to the empty room and ran to her bed .  she wept wakefully all that night and the next morning  almost before dawn  when the streets were empty  a car drew up to the house and took tony away .   lawrence belmont passed dr .  calvin   s office  and  on impulse  knocked .  he found her with mathematician peter bogert  but did not hesitate on that account .  he said     claire tells me that u . s .  robots paid for all that was done at my house         yes     said dr .  calvin .     we   ve written it off  as a valuable and necessary part of the experiment .  with your new position as associate engineer  you   ll be able to keep it up  i think .        that   s not what i   m worried about .  with washington agreeing to the tests  we   ll be able to get a tn model of our own by next year  i think .     he turned hesitantly  as though to go  and as hesitantly turned back again .     well  mr .  belmont .     asked dr .  calvin  after a pause .     i wonder      began larry .     i wonder what really happened there .  she   claire  i mean  seems so different .  it   s not just her looks  though  frankly  i   m amazed .     he laughed nervously .     it   s her .  she   s not my wife  really  i can   t explain it .        why try .  are you disappointed with any part of the change .        on the contrary .  but it   s a little frightening  too  you see         i wouldn   t worry  mr .  belmont .  your wife has handled herself very well .  frankly  i never expected to have the experiment yield such a thorough and complete test .  we know exactly what corrections must be made in the tn model  and the credit belongs entirely to mrs .  belmont .  if you want me to be very honest  i think your wife deserves your promotion more than you do .     larry flinched visibly at that .     as long as it   s in the family     he murmured unconvincingly and left .   susan calvin looked after him     i think that hurt  i hope .  .  .  .  have you read tony   s report  peter .        thoroughly     said bogert .     and won   t the tn   model need changes .        oh  you think so  too .     questioned calvin sharply .     what   s your reasoning .     bogert frowned .     i don   t need any .  it   s obvious on the face of it that we can   t have a robot loose which makes love to his mistress  if you don   t mind the pun .        love .  peter  you sicken me .  you really don   t understand .  that machine had to obey the first law .  he couldn   t allow harm to come to a human being  and harm was coming to claire belmont through her own sense of inadequacy .  so he made love to her  since what woman would fail to appreciate the compliment of being able to stir passion in a machine  in a cold  soulless machine .  and he opened the curtains that night deliberately  that the others might see and envy  without any risk possible to claire   s marriage .  i think it was clever of tony         do you .  what   s the difference whether it was pretense or not  susan .  it still has its horrifying effect .  read the report again .  she avoided him .  she screamed when he held her .  she didn   t sleep that last night  in hysterics .  we can   t have that .        peter  you   re blind .  you   re as blind as i was .  the tn model will be rebuilt entirely  but not for your reason .  quite otherwise  quite otherwise .  strange that i overlooked it in the first place     her eyes were opaquely thoughtful     but perhaps it reflects a shortcoming in myself .  you see  peter  machines can   t fall in love  but  even when it   s hopeless and horrifying   women can .      lenny  united states robots and mechanical men corporation had a problem .  the problem was people .  peter bogert  senior mathematician  was on his way to assembly when he encountered alfred lanning  research director .  lanning was bending his ferocious white eyebrows together and staring down across the railing into the computer room .  on the floor below the balcony  a trickle of humanity of both sexes and various ages was looking about curiously  while a guide intoned a set speech about robotic computing .     this computer you see before you     he said     is the largest of its type in the world .  it contains five million three hundred thousand cryotrons and is capable of dealing simultaneously with over one hundred thousand variables .  with its help  u .  s .  robots is able to design with precision the positronic brains of new models .     the requirements are fed in on tape which is perforated by the action of this keyboard  something like a very complicated typewriter or linotype machine  except that it does not deal with letters but with concepts .  statements are broken down into the symbolic logic equivalents and those in turn converted to perforation patterns .     the computer can  in less than one hour  present our scientists with a design for a brain which will give all the necessary positronic paths to make a robot .  .  .     alfred lanning looked up at last and noticed the other .     ah  peter     he said .  bogert raised both hands to smooth down his already perfectly smooth and glossy head of black hair .  he said     you don   t look as though you think much of this  alfred .     lanning grunted .  the idea of public guided tours of u .  s .  robots was of fairly recent origin  and was supposed to serve a dual function .  on the one hand  the theory went  it allowed people to see robots at close quarters and counter their almost instinctive fear of the mechanical objects through increased familiarity .  and on the other hand  it was supposed to interest at least an occasional person in taking up robotics research as a life work .     you know i don   t     lanning said finally .     once a week  work is disrupted .  considering the man hours lost  the return is insufficient .        still no rise in job applications  then .        oh  some  but only in the categories where the need isn   t vital .  it   s research men that are needed .  you know that .  the trouble is that with robots forbidden on earth itself  there   s something unpopular about being a roboticist .        the damned frankenstein complex     said bogert  consciously imitating one of the other   s pet phrases .  lanning missed the gentle jab .  he said     i ought to be used to it  but i never will .  you   d think that by now every human being on earth would know that the three laws represented a perfect safeguard  that robots are simply not dangerous .  take this bunch .     he glowered down .     look at them .  most of them go through the robot assembly room for the thrill of fear  like riding a roller coaster .  then when they enter the room with the mec model  damn it  peter  a mec model that will do nothing on god   s green earth but take two steps forward  say    pleased to meet you  sir     shake hands  then take two steps back  they back away and mothers snatch up their kids .  how do we expect to get brainwork out of such idiots .     bogert had no answer .  together  they stared down once again at the line of sightseers  now passing out of the computer room and into the positronic brain assembly section .  then they left .  they did not  as it turned out  observe mortimer w .  jacobson  age     who  to do him complete justice  meant no harm whatever .   in fact  it could not even be said to be mortimer   s fault .  the day of the week on which the tour took place was known to all workers .  all devices in its path ought to have been carefully neutralized or locked  since it was unreasonable to expect human beings to withstand the temptation to handle knobs  keys  handles and pushbuttons .  in addition  the guide ought to have been very carefully on the watch for those who succumbed .  but  at the time  the guide had passed into the next room and mortimer was tailing the line .  he passed the keyboard on which instructions were fed into the computer .  he had no way of suspecting that the plans for a new robot design were being fed into it at that moment  or  being a good kid  he would have avoided the keyboard .  he had no way of knowing that  by what amounted to almost criminal negligence  a technician had not inactivated the keyboard .  so mortimer touched the keys at random as though he were playing a musical instrument .  he did not notice that a section of perforated tape stretched itself out of the instrument in another part of the room  soundlessly  unobtrusively .  nor did the technician  when he returned  discover any signs of tampering .  he felt a little uneasy at noticing that the keyboard was live  but did not think to check .  after a few minutes  even his first trifling uneasiness was gone  and he continued feeding data into the computer .  as for mortimer  neither then  nor ever afterward  did he know what he had done .   the new lne model was designed for the mining of boron in the asteroid belt .  the boron hydrides were increasing in value yearly as primers for the proton micropiles that carried the ultimate load of power production on spaceships  and earth   s own meager supply was running thin .  physically  that meant that the lne robots would have to be equipped with eyes sensitive to those lines prominent in the spectroscopic analysis of boron ores and the type of limbs most useful for the working up of ore to finished product .  as always  though  the mental equipment was the major problem .  the first lne positronic brain had been completed now .  it was the prototype and would join all other prototypes in u .  s .  robots    collection .  when finally tested  others would then be manufactured for leasing  never selling  to mining corporations .  lne prototype was complete now .  tall  straight  polished  it looked from outside like any of a number of not too specialized robot models .  the technician in charge  guided by the directions for testing in the handbook of robotics  said     how are you .     the indicated answer was to have been     i am well and ready to begin my functions .  i trust you are well  too     or some trivial modification thereof .  this first exchange served no purpose but to show that the robot could hear  understand a routine question  and make a routine reply congruent with what one would expect of a robotic attitude .  beginning from there  one could pass on to more complicated matters that would test the different laws and their interaction with the specialized knowledge of each particular model .  so the technician said     how are you .     he was instantly jolted by the nature of lne prototype   s voice .  it had a quality like no robotic voice he had ever heard  and he had heard many  .  it formed syllables like the chimes of a low pitched celeste .  so surprising was this that it was only after several moments that the technician heard  in retrospect  the syllables that had been formed by those heavenly tones .  they were     da  da  da  goo .     the robot still stood tall and straight but its right hand crept upward and a finger went into its mouth .  the technician stared in absolute horror and bolted .  he locked the door behind him and  from another room  put in an emergency call to dr .  susan calvin .   dr .  susan calvin was u .  s .  robots     and  virtually  mankind   s  only robopsychologist .  she did not have to go very far in her testing of lne prototype before she called very peremptorily for a transcript of the computer drawn plans of the positronic brain paths and the taped instructions that had directed them .  after some study  she  in turn  sent for bogert .  her iron gray hair was drawn severely back  her cold face  with its strong vertical lines marked off by the horizontal gash of the pale  thin lipped mouth  turned intensely upon him .     what is this  peter .     bogert studied the passages she pointed out with increasing stupefaction and said     good lord  susan  it makes no sense .        it most certainly doesn   t .  how did it get into the instructions .     the technician in charge  called upon  swore in all sincerity that it was none of his doing  and that he could not account for it .  the computer checked out negative for all attempts at flaw finding .     the positronic brain     said susan calvin  thoughtfully     is past redemption .  so many of the higher functions have been cancelled out by these meaningless directions that the result is very like a human baby .     bogert looked surprised  and susan calvin took on a frozen attitude at once  as she always did at the least expressed or implied doubt of her word .  she said     we make every effort to make a robot as mentally like a man as possible .  eliminate what we call the adult functions and what is naturally left is a human infant  mentally speaking .  why do you look so surprised  peter .     lne prototype  who showed no signs of understanding any of the things that were going on around it  suddenly slipped into a sitting position and began a minute examination of its feet .  bogert stared at it .     it   s a shame to have to dismantle the creature .  it   s a handsome job .        dismantle it .     said the robopsychologist forcefully .     of course  susan .  what   s the use of this thing .  good lord  if there   s one object completely and abysmally useless it   s a robot without a job it can perform .  you don   t pretend there   s a job this thing can do  do you .        no  of course not .        well  then .     susan calvin said  stubbornly     i want to conduct more tests .     bogert looked at her with a moment   s impatience  then shrugged .  if there was one person at u .  s .  robots with whom it was useless to dispute  surely that was susan calvin .  robots were all she loved  and long association with them  it seemed to bogert  had deprived her of any appearance of humanity .  she was no more to be argued out of a decision than was a triggered micropile to be argued out of operating .     what   s the use .     he breathed  then aloud  hastily     will you let us know when your tests are complete .        i will     she said .     come  lenny .      lne  thought bogert .  that becomes lenny .  inevitable .   susan calvin held out her hand but the robot only stared at it .  gently  the robopsychologist reached for the robot   s hand and took it .  lenny rose smoothly to its feet  its mechanical coordination  at least  worked well  .  together they walked out  robot topping woman by two feet .  many eyes followed them curiously down the long corridors .   one wall of susan calvin   s laboratory  the one opening directly off her private office  was covered with a highly magnified reproduction of a positronic path chart .  susan calvin had studied it with absorption for the better part of a month .  she was considering it now  carefully  tracing the blunted paths through their contortions .  behind her  lenny sat on the floor  moving its legs apart and together  crooning meaningless syllables to itself in a voice so beautiful that one could listen to the nonsense and be ravished .  susan calvin turned to the robot     lenny  lenny      she repeated this patiently until finally lenny looked up and made an inquiring sound .  the robopsychologist allowed a glimmer of pleasure to cross her face fleetingly .  the robot   s attention was being gained in progressively shorter intervals .  she said     raise your hand  lenny .  hand up .  hand up .     she raised her own hand as she said it  over and over .  lenny followed the movement with its eyes .  up  down  up  down .  then it made an abortive gesture with its own hand and chimed     eh uh .        very good  lenny     said susan calvin  gravely .     try it again .  hand up .     very gently  she reached out her own hand  took the robot   s  and raised it  lowered it .     hand up .  hand up .     a voice from her office called and interrupted .     susan .     calvin halted with a tightening of her lips .     what is it  alfred .     the research director walked in  and looked at the chart on the wall and at the robot .     still at it .        i   m at my work  yes .        well  you know  susan .  .  .     he took out a cigar  staring at it hard  and made as though to bite off the end .  in doing so  his eyes met the woman   s stern look of disapproval  and he put the cigar away and began over .     well  you know  susan  the lne model is in production now .        so i   ve heard .  is there something in connection with it you wish of me .        no o .  still  the mere fact that it is in production and is doing well means that working with this messed up specimen is useless .  shouldn   t it be scrapped .        in short  alfred  you are annoyed that i am wasting my so valuable time .  feel relieved .  my time is not being wasted .  i am working with this robot .        but the work has no meaning .        i   ll be the judge of that  alfred .     her voice was ominously quiet  and lanning thought it wiser to shift his ground .     will you tell me what meaning it has .  what are you doing with it right now  for instance .        i   m trying to get it to raise its hand on the word of command .  i   m trying to get it to imitate the sound of the word .     as though on cue  lenny said     eh uh   and raised its hand waveringly .  lanning shook his head .     that voice is amazing .  how does it happen .     susan calvin said     i don   t quite know .  its transmitter is a normal one .  it could speak normally  i   m sure .  it doesn   t  however  it speaks like this as a consequence of something in the positronic paths that i have not yet pinpointed .        well  pinpoint it  for heaven   s sake .  speech like that might be useful .        oh  then there is some possible use in my studies on lenny .     lanning shrugged in embarrassment .     oh  well  it   s a minor point .        i   m sorry you don   t see the major points  then     said susan calvin with asperity     which are much more important  but that   s not my fault .  would you leave now  alfred  and let me go on with my work .      lanning got to his cigar  eventually  in bogert   s office .  he said  sourly     that woman is growing more peculiar daily .     bogert understood perfectly .  in the u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation  there was only one    that woman .     he said     is she still scuffing about with that pseudo robot  that lenny of hers .        trying to get it to talk  so help me .     bogert shrugged .     points up the company problem .  i mean  about getting qualified personnel for research .  if we had other robopsychologists  we could retire susan .  incidentally  i presume the directors    meeting scheduled for tomorrow is for the purpose of dealing with the procurement problem .     lanning nodded and looked at his cigar as though it didn   t taste good .     yes .  quality  though  not quantity .  we   ve raised wages until there   s a steady stream of applicants  those who are interested primarily in money .  the trick is to get those who are interested primarily in robotics  a few more like susan calvin .        hell  no .  not like her .        well  not like her personally .  but you   ll have to admit  peter  that she   s single minded about robots .  she has no other interest in life .        i know .  and that   s exactly what makes her so unbearable .     lanning nodded .  he had lost count of the many times it would have done his soul good to have fired susan calvin .  he had also lost count of the number of millions of dollars she had at one time or another saved the company .  she was a truly indispensable woman and would remain one until she died  or until they could lick the problem of finding men and women of her own high caliber who were interested in robotics research .  he said     i think we   ll cut down on the tour business .     peter shrugged .     if you say so .  but meanwhile  seriously  what do we do about susan .  she can easily tie herself up with lenny indefinitely .  you know how she is when she gets what she considers an interesting problem .        what can we do .     said lanning .     if we become too anxious to pull her off  she   ll stay on out of feminine contrariness .  in the last analysis  we can   t force her to do anything .     the dark haired mathematician smiled .     i wouldn   t ever apply the adjective    feminine    to any part of her .        oh  well     said lanning  grumpily .     at least  it won   t do anyone any actual harm .     in that  if in nothing else  he was wrong .  the emergency signal is always a tension making thing in any large industrial establishment .  such signals had sounded in the history of u .  s .  robots a dozen times  for fire  flood  riot and insurrection .  but one thing had never occurred in all that time .  never had the particular signal indicating    robot out of control    sounded .  no one ever expected it to sound .  it was only installed at government insistence .      damn the frankenstein complex     lanning would mutter on those rare occasions when he thought of it .   now  finally  the shrill siren rose and fell at ten second intervals  and practically no worker from the president of the board of directors down to the newest janitor   s assistant recognized the significance of the strange sound for a few moments .  after those moments passed  there was a massive convergence of armed guards and medical men to the indicated area of danger and u .  s .  robots was struck with paralysis .  charles randow  computing technician  was taken off to hospital level with a broken arm .  there was no other damage .  no other physical damage .     but the moral damage     roared lanning     is beyond estimation .     susan calvin faced him  murderously calm .     you will do nothing to lenny .  nothing .  do you understand .        do you understand  susan .     that thing has hurt a human being .  it has broken first law .  don   t you know what first law is .        you will do nothing to lenny .        for god   s sake  susan  do i have to tell you first law .  a robot may not harm a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .  our entire position depends on the fact that first law is rigidly observed by all robots of all types .  if the public should hear  and they will hear  that there was an exception  even one exception  we might be forced to close down altogether .  our only chance of survival would be to announce at once that the robot involved had been destroyed  explain the circumstances  and hope that the public can be convinced that it will never happen again .        i would like to find out exactly what happened     said susan calvin .     i was not present at the time and i would like to know exactly what the randow boy was doing in my laboratories without my permission .        the important thing that happened     said lanning     is obvious .  your robot struck randow and the damn fool flashed the    robot out of control    button and made a case of it .  but your robot struck him and inflicted damage to the extent of a broken arm .  the truth is your lenny is so distorted it lacks first law and it must be destroyed .        it does not lack first law .  i have studied its brainpaths and know it does not lack it .        then how could it strike a man .     desperation turned him to sarcasm .     ask lenny .  surely you have taught it to speak by now .     susan calvin   s cheeks bushed a painful pink .  she said     i prefer to interview the victim .  and in my absence  alfred  i want my offices sealed tight  with lenny inside .  i want no one to approach him .  if any harm comes to him while i am gone  this company will not see me again under any circumstances .        will you agree to its destruction  if it has broken first law .        yes     said susan calvin     because i know it hasn   t .      charles randow lay in bed with his arm set and in a cast .  his major suffering was still from the shock of those few moments in which he thought a robot was advancing on him with murder in its positronic mind .  no other human had ever had such reason to fear direct robotic harm as he had had just then .  he had had a unique experience .  susan calvin and alfred lanning stood beside his bed now  peter bogert  who had met them on the way  was with them .  doctors and nurses had been shooed out .  susan calvin said     now  what happened .     randow was daunted .  he muttered     the thing hit me in the arm .  it was coming at me .     calvin said     move further back in the story .  what were you doing in my laboratory without authorization .     the young computer swallowed  and the adam   s apple in his thin neck bobbed noticeably .  he was high cheekboned and abnormally pale .  he said     we all knew about your robot .  the word is you were trying to teach it to talk like a musical instrument .  there were bets going as to whether it talked or not .  some said  uh  you could teach a gatepost to talk .        i suppose     said susan calvin  freezingly     that is meant as a compliment .  what did that have to do with you .        i was supposed to go in there and settle matters  see if it would talk  you know .  we swiped a key to your place and i waited till you were gone and went in .  we had a lottery on who was to do it .  i lost .        then .        i tried to get it to talk and it hit me .        what do you mean  you tried to get it to talk .  how did you try .        i  i asked it questions  but it wouldn   t say anything  and i had to give the thing a fair shake  so i kind of  yelled at it  and         and .     there was a long pause .  under susan calvin   s unwavering stare  randow finally said     i tried to scare it into saying something .     he added defensively     i had to give the thing a fair shake .        how did you try to scare it .        i pretended to take a punch at it .        and it brushed your arm aside .        it hit my arm .        very well .  that   s all .     to lanning and bogert  she said     come  gentlemen .     at the doorway  she turned back to randow .     i can settle the bets going around  if you are still interested .  lenny can speak a few words quite well .      they said nothing until they were in susan calvin   s office .  its walls were lined with her books  some of which she had written herself .  it retained the patina of her own frigid  carefully ordered personality .  it had only one chair in it and she sat down .  lanning and bogert remained standing .  she said     lenny only defended itself .  that is the third law  a robot must protect its own existence .        except     said lanning forcefully     when this conflicts with the first or second laws .  complete the statement .  lenny had no right to defend itself in any way at the cost of harm  however minor  to a human being .        nor did it     shot back calvin     knowingly .  lenny has an aborted brain .  it had no way of knowing its own strength or the weakness of humans .  in brushing aside the threatening arm of a human being it could not know the bone would break .  in human terms  no moral blame can be attached to an individual who honestly cannot differentiate good and evil .     bogert interrupted  soothingly     now  susan  we don   t blame .  we understand that lenny is the equivalent of a baby  humanly speaking  and we don   t blame it .  but the public will .  u .  s .  robots will be closed down .        quite the opposite .  if you had the brains of a flea  peter  you would see that this is the opportunity u .  s .  robots is waiting for .  that this will solve its problems .     lanning hunched his white eyebrows low .  he said  softly     what problems  susan .        isn   t the corporation concerned about maintaining our research personnel at the present  heaven help us  high level .        we certainly are .        well  what are you offering prospective researchers .  excitement .  novelty .  the thrill of piercing the unknown .  no .  you offer them salaries and the assurance of no problems .     bogert said     how do you mean  no problems .        are there problems .     shot back susan calvin .     what kind of robots do we turn out .  fully developed robots  fit for their tasks .  an industry tells us what it needs  a computer designs the brain  machinery forms the robot  and there it is  complete and done .  peter  some time ago  you asked me with reference to lenny what its use was .  what   s the use  you said  of a robot that was not designed for any job .  now i ask you  what   s the use of a robot designed for only one job .  it begins and ends in the same place .  the lne models mine boron .  if beryllium is needed  they are useless .  if boron technology enters a new phase  they become useless .  a human being so designed would be sub human .  a robot so designed is sub robotic .        do you want a versatile robot .     asked lanning  incredulously .     why not .     demanded the robopsychologist .     why not .  i   ve been handed a robot with a brain almost completely stultified .  i   ve been teaching it  and you  alfred  asked me what was the use of that .  perhaps very little as far as lenny itself is concerned  since it will never progress beyond the five year old level on a human scale .  but what   s the use in general .  a very great deal  if you consider it as a study in the abstract problem of learning how to teach robots .  i have learned ways to short circuit neighboring pathways in order to create new ones .  more study will yield better  more subtle and more efficient techniques of doing so .        well .        suppose you started with a positronic brain that had all the basic pathways carefully outlined but none of the secondaries .  suppose you then started creating secondaries .  you could sell basic robots designed for instruction  robots that could be modeled to a job  and then modeled to another  if necessary .  robots would become as versatile as human beings .  robots could learn .     they stared at her .  she said  impatiently     you still don   t understand  do you .        i understand what you are saying     said lanning .     don   t you understand that with a completely new field of research and completely new techniques to be developed  with a completely new area of the unknown to be penetrated  youngsters will feel a new urge to enter robotics .  try it and see .        may i point out     said bogert  smoothly     that this is dangerous .  beginning with ignorant robots such as lenny will mean that one could never trust first law  exactly as turned out in lenny   s case .        exactly .  advertise the fact .        advertise it .        of course .  broadcast the danger .  explain that you will set up a new research institute on the moon  if earth   s population chooses not to allow this sort of thing to go on upon earth  but stress the danger to the possible applicants by all means .     lanning said     for god   s sake  why .        because the spice of danger will add to the lure .  do you think nuclear technology involves no danger and spationautics no peril .  has your lure of absolute security been doing the trick for you .  has it helped you to cater to the frankenstein complex you all despise so .  try something else then  something that has worked in other fields .     there was a sound from beyond the door that led to calvin   s personal laboratories .  it was the chiming sound of lenny .  the robopsychologist broke off instantly  listening .  she said     excuse me .  i think lenny is calling me .        can it call you .     said lanning .     i said i   ve managed to teach it a few words .     she stepped toward the door  a little flustered .     if you will wait for me      they watched her leave and were silent for a moment .  then lanning said     do you think there   s anything to what she says  peter .        just possibly  alfred     said bogert .     just possibly .  enough for us to bring the matter up at the directors    meeting and see what they say .  after all  the fat is in the fire .  a robot has harmed a human being and knowledge of it is public .  as susan says  we might as well try to turn the matter to our advantage .  of course  i distrust her motives in all this .        how do you mean .        even if all she has said is perfectly true  it is only rationalization as far as she is concerned .  her motive in all this is her desire to hold on to this robot .  if we pressed her     and the mathematician smiled at the incongruous literal meaning of the phrase     she would say it was to continue learning techniques of teaching robots  but i think she has found another use for lenny .  a rather unique one that would fit only susan of all women .        i don   t get your drift .     bogert said     did you hear what the robot was calling .        well  no  i didn   t quite      began lanning  when the door opened suddenly  and both men stopped talking at once .  susan calvin stepped in again  looking about uncertainly .     have either of you seen  i   m positive i had it somewhere about  oh  there it is .     she ran to a corner of one bookcase and picked up an object of intricate metal webbery  dumbbell shaped and hollow  with variously shaped metal pieces inside each hollow  just too large to be able to fallout of the webbing .  as she picked it up  the metal pieces within moved and struck together  clicking pleasantly .  it struck lanning that the object was a kind of robotic version of a baby rattle .  as susan calvin opened the door again to pass through  lenny   s voice chimed again from within .  this time  lanning heard it clearly as it spoke the words susan calvin had taught it .  in heavenly celeste like sounds  it called out     mommie  i want you .  i want you  mommie .     and the footsteps of susan calvin could be heard hurrying eagerly across the laboratory floor toward the only kind of baby she could ever have or love .   galley slave  the united states robots and mechanical men corporation  as defendants in the case  had influence enough to force a closed doors trial without a jury .  nor did northeastern university try hard to prevent it .  the trustees knew perfectly well how the public might react to any issue involving misbehavior of a robot  however rarefied that misbehavior might be .  they also had a clearly visualized notion of how an antirobot riot might become an antiscience riot without warning .  the government  as represented in this case by justice harlow shane  was equally anxious for a quiet end to this mess .  both u .  s .  robots and the academic world were bad people to antagonize .  justice shane said     since neither press  public nor jury is present  gentlemen  let us stand on as little ceremony as we can and get to the facts .     he smiled stiffly as he said this  perhaps without much hope that his request would be effective  and hitched at his robe so that he might sit more comfortably .  his face was pleasantly rubicund  his chin round and soft  his nose broad and his eyes light in color and wide set .  all in all  it was not a face with much judicial majesty and the judge knew it .  barnabas h .  goodfellow  professor of physics at northeastern u .   was sworn in first  taking the usual vow with an expression that made mincemeat of his name .  after the usual opening gambit questions  prosecution shoved his hands deep into his pockets and said     when was it  professor  that the matter of the possible employ of robot ez    was first brought to your attention  and how .     professor goodfellow   s small and angular face set itself into an uneasy expression  scarcely more benevolent than the one it replaced .  he said     i have had professional contact and some social acquaintance with dr .  alfred lanning  director of research at u .  s .  robots .  i was inclined to listen with some tolerance then when i received a rather strange suggestion from him on the third of march of last year         of      .        that   s right .        excuse me for interrupting .  please proceed .     the professor nodded frostily  scowled to fix the facts in his mind  and began to speak .   professor goodfellow looked at the robot with a certain uneasiness .  it had been carried into the basement supply room in a crate  in accordance with the regulations governing the shipment of robots from place to place on the earth   s surface .  he knew it was coming  it wasn   t that he was unprepared .  from the moment of dr .  lanning   s first phone call on march    he had felt himself giving way to the other   s persuasiveness  and now  as an inevitable result  he found himself face to face with a robot .  it looked uncommonly large as it stood within arm   s reach .  alfred lanning cast a hard glance of his own at the robot  as though making certain it had not been damaged in transit .  then he turned his ferocious eyebrows and his mane of white hair in the professor   s direction .     this is robot ez     first of its model to be available for public use .     he turned to the robot .     this is professor goodfellow  easy .     easy spoke impassively  but with such suddenness that the professor shied .     good afternoon  professor .     easy stood seven feet tall and had the general proportions of a man  always the prime selling point of u .  s .  robots .  that and the possession of the basic patents on the positronic brain had given them an actual monopoly on robots and a near monopoly on computing machines in general .  the two men who had uncrated the robot had left now and the professor looked from lanning to the robot and back to lanning .     it is harmless  i   m sure .     he didn   t sound sure .     more harmless than i am     said lanning .     i could be goaded into striking you .  easy could not be .  you know the three laws of robotics  i presume .        yes  of course     said goodfellow .     they are built into the positronic patterns of the brain and must be observed .  the first law  the prime rule of robotic existence  safeguards the life and well being of all humans .     he paused  rubbed at his cheek  then added     it   s something of which we would like to persuade all earth if we could .        it   s just that he seems formidable .        granted .  but whatever he seems  you   ll find that he is useful .        i   m not sure in what way .  our conversations were not very helpful in that respect .  still  i agreed to look at the object and i   m doing it .        we   ll do more than look  professor .  have you brought a book .        i have .        may i see it .     professor goodfellow reached down without actually taking his eyes off the metal in human shape that confronted him .  from the briefcase at his feet  he withdrew a book .  lanning held out his hand for it and looked at the backstrip .     physical chemistry of electrolytes in solution .  fair enough  sir .  you selected this yourself  at random .  it was no suggestion of mine  this particular text .  am i right .        yes .     lanning passed the book to robot ez    .   the professor jumped a little .     no .  that   s a valuable book .     lanning raised his eyebrows and they looked like shaggy coconut icing .  he said     easy has no intention of tearing the book in two as a feat of strength  i assure you .  it can handle a book as carefully as you or i .  go ahead  easy .        thank you  sir     said easy .  then  turning its metal bulk slightly  it added     with your permission  professor goodfellow .     the professor stared  then said     yes  yes  of course .     with a slow and steady manipulation of metal fingers  easy turned the pages of the book  glancing at the left page  then the right  turning the page  glancing left  then right  turning the page and so on for minute after minute .  the sense of its power seemed to dwarf even the large cement walled room in which they stood and to reduce the two human watchers to something considerably less than life size .  goodfellow muttered     the light isn   t very good .        it will do .     then  rather more sharply     but what is he doing .        patience  sir .     the last page was turned eventually .  lanning asked     well  easy .     the robot said     it is a most accurate book and there is little to which i can point .  on line    of page     the word    positive    is spelled p o i s t i v e .  the comma in line   of page    is superfluous  whereas one should have been used on line    of page    .  the plus sign in equation xiv   on page     should be a minus sign if it is to be consistent with the previous equations         wait .  wait .     cried the professor .     what is he doing .        doing .     echoed lanning in sudden irascibility .     why  man  he has already done it .  he has proofread that book .        proofread it .        yes .  in the short time it took him to turn those pages  he caught every mistake in spelling  grammar and punctuation .  he has noted errors in word order and detected inconsistencies .  and he will retain the information  letter perfect  indefinitely .     the professor   s mouth was open .  he walked rapidly away from lanning and easy and as rapidly back .  he folded his arms across his chest and stared at them .  finally he said     you mean this is a proofreading robot .     lanning nodded .     among other things .        but why do you show it to me .        so that you might help me persuade the university to obtain it for use .        to read proof .        among other things     lanning repeated patiently .  the professor drew his pinched face together in a kind of sour disbelief .     but this is ridiculous .        why .        the university could never afford to buy this half ton  it must weigh that at least  this half ton proofreader .        proofreading is not all it will do .  it will prepare reports from outlines  fill out forms  serve as an accurate memory file  grade papers      all picayune .      lanning said     not at all  as i can show you in a moment .  but i think we can discuss this more comfortably in your office  if you have no objection .        no  of course not     began the professor mechanically and took a half step as though to turn .  then he snapped out     but the robot  we can   t take the robot .  really  doctor  you   ll have to crate it up again .        time enough .  we can leave easy here .        unattended .        why not .  he knows he is to stay .  professor goodfellow  it is necessary to understand that a robot is far more reliable than a human being .        i would be responsible for any damage         there will be no damage .  i guarantee that .  look  it   s after hours .  you expect no one here  i imagine  before tomorrow morning .  the truck and my two men are outside .  u .  s .  robots will take any responsibility that may arise .  none will .  call it a demonstration of the reliability of the robot .     the professor allowed himself to be led out of the storeroom .  nor did he look entirely comfortable in his own office  five stories up .  he dabbed at the line of droplets along the upper half of his forehead with a white handkerchief .     as you know very well  dr .  lanning  there are laws against the use of robots on earth   s surface     he pointed out .     the laws  professor goodfellow  are not simple ones .  robots may not be used on public thoroughfares or within public edifices .  they may not be used on private grounds or within private structures except under certain restrictions that usually turn out to be prohibitive .  the university  however  is a large and privately owned institution that usually receives preferential treatment .  if the robot is used only in a specific room for only academic purposes  if certain other restrictions are observed and if the men and women having occasion to enter the room cooperate fully  we may remain within the law .        but all that trouble just to read proof .        the uses would be infinite .  professor .  robotic labor has so far been used only to relieve physical drudgery .  isn   t there such a thing as mental drudgery .  when a professor capable of the most useful creative thought is forced to spend two weeks painfully checking the spelling of lines of print and i offer you a machine that can do it in thirty minutes  is that picayune .        but the price         the price need not bother you .  you cannot buy ez    .  u .  s .  robots does not sell its products .  but the university can lease ez    for a thousand dollars a year  considerably less than the cost of a single microwave spectograph continuous recording attachment .     goodfellow looked stunned .  lanning followed up his advantage by saying     i only ask that you put it up to whatever group makes the decisions here .  i would be glad to speak to them if they want more information .        well     goodfellow said doubtfully     i can bring it up at next week   s senate meeting .  i can   t promise that will do any good  though .        naturally     said lanning .   the defense attorney was short and stubby and carried himself rather portentously  a stance that had the effect of accentuating his double chin .  he stared at professor goodfellow  once that witness had been handed over  and said     you agreed rather readily  did you not .     the professor said briskly     i suppose i was anxious to be rid of dr .  lanning .  i would have agreed to anything .        with the intention of forgetting about it after he left .        well         nevertheless  you did present the matter to a meeting of the executive board of the university senate .        yes  i did .        so that you agreed in good faith with dr .  lanning   s suggestions .  you weren   t just going along with a gag .  you actually agreed enthusiastically  did you not .        i merely followed ordinary procedures .        as a matter of fact  you weren   t as upset about the robot as you now claim you were .  you know the three laws of robotics and you knew them at the time of your interview with dr .  lanning .        well  yes .        and you were perfectly willing to leave a robot at large and unattended .        dr .  lanning assured me         surely you would never have accepted his assurance if you had had the slightest doubt that the robot might be in the least dangerous .     the professor began frigidly     i had every faith in the word         that is all     said defense abruptly .  as professor goodfellow  more than a bit ruffled  stood down  justice shane leaned forward and said     since i am not a robotics man myself  i would appreciate knowing precisely what the three laws of robotics are .  would dr .  lanning quote them for the benefit of the court .     dr .  lanning looked startled .  he had been virtually bumping heads with the gray haired woman at his side .  he rose to his feet now and the woman looked up  too  expressionlessly .  dr .  lanning said     very well  your honor .     he paused as though about to launch into an oration and said  with laborious clarity     first law  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .  second law  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings  except where such orders would conflict with the first law .  third law  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .        i see     said the judge  taking rapid notes .     these laws are built into every robot  are they .        into every one .  that will be borne out by any roboticist .        and into robot ez    specifically .        yes  your honor .        you will probably be required to repeat those statements under oath .        i am ready to do so  your honor .     he sat down again .  dr .  susan calvin  robopsychologist in chief for u .  s .  robots  who was the gray haired woman sitting next to lanning  looked at her titular superior without favor  but then she showed favor to no human being .  she said     was goodfellow   s testimony accurate  alfred .        essentially     muttered lanning .     he wasn   t as nervous as all that about the robot and he was anxious enough to talk business with me when he heard the price .  but there doesn   t seem to be any drastic distortion .     dr .  calvin said thoughtfully     it might have been wise to put the price higher than a thousand .        we were anxious to place easy .        i know .  too anxious  perhaps .  they   ll try to make it look as though we had an ulterior motive .     lanning looked exasperated .     we did .  i admitted that at the university senate meeting .        they can make it look as if we had one beyond the one we admitted .     scott robertson  son of the founder of u .  s .  robots and still owner of a majority of the stock  leaned over from dr .  calvin   s other side and said in a kind of explosive whisper     why can   t you get easy to talk so we   ll know where we   re at .        you know he can   t talk about it  mr .  robertson .        make him .  you   re the psychologist  dr .  calvin .  make him .        if i   m the psychologist  mr .  robertson     said susan calvin coldly     let me make the decisions .  my robot will not be made to do anything at the price of his well being .     robertson frowned and might have answered  but justice shane was tapping his gavel in a polite sort of way and they grudgingly fell silent .  francis j .  hart  head of the department of english and dean of graduate studies  was on the stand .  he was a plump man  meticulously dressed in dark clothing of a conservative cut  and possessing several strands of hair traversing the pink top of his cranium .  he sat well back in the witness chair with his hands folded neatly in his lap and displaying  from time to time  a tight lipped smile .  he said     my first connection with the matter of the robot ez    was on the occasion of the session of the university senate executive committee at which the subject was introduced by professor goodfellow .  thereafter  on the tenth of april of last year  we held a special meeting on the subject  during which i was in the chair .        were minutes kept of the meeting of the executive committee .  of the special meeting  that is .        well  no .  it was a rather unusual meeting .     the dean smiled briefly .     we thought it might remain confidential .        what transpired at the meeting .      dean hart was not entirely comfortable as chairman of that meeting .  nor did the other members assembled seem completely calm .  only dr .  lanning appeared at peace with himself .  his tall  gaunt figure and the shock of white hair that crowned him reminded hart of portraits he had seen of andrew jackson .  samples of the robot   s work lay scattered along the central regions of the table and the reproduction of a graph drawn by the robot was now in the hands of professor minott of physical chemistry .  the chemist   s lips were pursed in obvious approval .  hart cleared his throat and said     there seems no doubt that the robot can perform certain routine tasks with adequate competence .  i have gone over these  for instance  just before coming in and there is very little to find fault with .     he picked up a long sheet of printing  some three times as long as the average book page .  it was a sheet of galley proof  designed to be corrected by authors before the type was set up in page form .  along both of the wide margins of the galley were proofmarks  neat and superbly legible .  occasionally  a word of print was crossed out and a new word substituted in the margin in characters so fine and regular it might easily have been print itself .  some of the corrections were blue to indicate the original mistake had been the author   s  a few in red  where the printer had been wrong .     actually     said lanning     there is less than very little to find fault with .  i should say there is nothing at all to find fault with  dr .  hart .  i   m sure the corrections are perfect  insofar as the original manuscript was .  if the manuscript against which this galley was corrected was at fault in a matter of fact rather than of english  the robot is not competent to correct it .        we accept that .  however  the robot corrected word order on occasion and i don   t think the rules of english are sufficiently hidebound for us to be sure that in each case the robot   s choice was the correct one .        easy   s positronic brain     said lanning  showing large teeth as he smiled     has been molded by the contents of all the standard works on the subject .  i   m sure you cannot point to a case where the robot   s choice was definitely the incorrect one .     professor minott looked up from the graph he still held .     the question in my mind  dr .  lanning  is why we need a robot at all  with all the difficulties in public relations that would entail .  the science of automation has surely reached the point where your company could design a machine  an ordinary computer of a type known and accepted by the public  that would correct galleys .        i am sure we could     said lanning stiffly     but such a machine would require that the galleys be translated into special symbols or  at the least  transcribed on tapes .  any corrections would emerge in symbols .  you would need to keep men employed translating words to symbols  symbols to words .  furthermore  such a computer could do no other job .  it couldn   t prepare the graph you hold in your hand  for instance .     minott grunted .   lanning went on .     the hallmark of the positronic robot is its flexibility .  it can do a number of jobs .  it is designed like a man so that it can use all the tools and machines that have  after all  been designed to be used by a man .  it can talk to you and you can talk to it .  you can actually reason with it up to a point .  compared to even a simple robot  an ordinary computer with a non positronic brain is only a heavy adding machine .     goodfellow looked up and said     if we all talk and reason with the robot  what are the chances of our confusing it .  i suppose it doesn   t have the capability of absorbing an infinite amount of data .        no  it hasn   t .  but it should last five years with ordinary use .  it will know when it will require clearing  and the company will do the job without charge .        the company will .        yes .  the company reserves the right to service the robot outside the ordinary course of its duties .  it is one reason we retain control of our positronic robots and lease rather than sell them .  in the pursuit of its ordinary functions  any robot can be directed by any man .  outside its ordinary functions  a robot requires expert handling  and that we can give it .  for instance  any of you might clear an ez robot to an extent by telling it to forget this item or that .  but you would be almost certain to phrase the order in such a way as to cause it to forget too much or too little .  we would detect such tampering  because we have built in safeguards .  however  since there is no need for clearing the robot in its ordinary work  or for doing other useless things  this raises no problem .      dean hart touched his head as though to make sure his carefully cultivated strands lay evenly distributed and said     you are anxious to have us take the machine .  yet surely it is a losing proposition for u .  s .  robots .  one thousand a year is a ridiculously low price .  is it that you hope through this to rent other such machines to other universities at a more reasonable price .        certainly that   s a fair hope     said lanning .     but even so  the number of machines you could rent would be limited .  i doubt if you could make it a paying proposition .     lanning put his elbows on the table and earnestly leaned forward .     let me put it bluntly  gentlemen .  robots cannot be used on earth  except in certain special cases  because of prejudice against them on the part of the public .  u .  s .  robots is a highly successful corporation with our extraterrestrial and spaceflight markets alone  to say nothing of our computer subsidiaries .  however  we are concerned with more than profits alone .  it is our firm belief that the use of robots on earth itself would mean a better life for all eventually  even if a certain amount of economic dislocation resulted at first .     the labor unions are naturally against us  but surely we may expect cooperation from the large universities .  the robot  easy  will help you by relieving you of scholastic drudgery  by assuming  if you permit it  the role of galley slave for you .  other universities and research institutions will follow your lead  and if it works out  then perhaps other robots of other types may be placed and the public   s objections to them broken down by stages .     minott murmured     today northeastern university  tomorrow the world .     angrily  lanning whispered to susan calvin     i wasn   t nearly that eloquent and they weren   t nearly that reluctant .  at a thousand a year  they were jumping to get easy .  professor minott told me he   d never seen as beautiful a job as that graph he was holding and there was no mistake on the galley or anywhere else .  hart admitted it freely .     the severe vertical lines on dr .  calvin   s face did not soften .     you should have demanded more money than they could pay  alfred  and let them beat you down .        maybe     he grumbled .  prosecution was not quite done with professor hart .     after dr .  lanning left  did you vote on whether to accept robot ez    .        yes  we did .        with what result .        in favor of acceptance  by majority vote .        what would you say influenced the vote .     defense objected immediately .  prosecution rephrased the question .     what influenced you  personally  in your individual vote .  you did vote in favor  i think .        i voted in favor  yes .  i did so largely because i was impressed by dr .  lanning   s feeling that it was our duty as members of the world   s intellectual leadership to allow robotics to help man in the solution of his problems .        in other words  dr .  lanning talked you into it .        that   s his job .  he did it very well .        your witness .     defense strode up to the witness chair and surveyed professor hart for a long moment .  he said     in reality  you were all pretty eager to have robot ez    in your employ  weren   t you .        we thought that if it could do the work  it might be useful .        if it could do the work .  i understand you examined the samples of robot ez      s original work with particular care on the day of the meeting which you have just described .        yes  i did .  since the machine   s work dealt primarily with the handling of the english language  and since that is my field of competence  it seemed logical that i be the one chosen to examine the work .        very good .  was there anything on display on the table at the time of the meeting which was less than satisfactory .  i have all the material here as exhibits .  can you point to a single unsatisfactory item .        well         it   s a simple question .  was there one single solitary unsatisfactory item .  you inspected it .  was there .     the english professor frowned .     there wasn   t .        i also have some samples of work done by robot ez    during the course of his fourteen month employ at northeastern .  would you examine these and tell me if there is anything wrong with them in even one particular .     hart snapped     when he did make a mistake  it was a beauty .        answer my question     thundered defense     and only the question i am putting to you .  is there anything wrong with the material .     dean hart looked cautiously at each item .     well  nothing .        barring the matter concerning which we are here engaged .  do you know of any mistake on the part of ez    .        barring the matter for which this trial is being held  no .      defense cleared his throat as though to signal end of paragraph .  he said .     now about the vote concerning whether robot ez    was to be employed or not .  you said there was a majority in favor .  what was the actual vote .        thirteen to one  as i remember .        thirteen to one .  more than just a majority  wouldn   t you say .        no  sir .    all the pedant in dean hart was aroused .     in the english language  the word    majority    means    more than half .     thirteen out of fourteen is a majority  nothing more .        but an almost unanimous one .        a majority all the same .     defense switched ground .     and who was the lone holdout .     dean hart looked acutely uncomfortable .     professor simon ninheimer .     defense pretended astonishment .     professor ninheimer .  the head of the department of sociology .        yes  sir .        the plaintiff .        yes  sir .     defense pursed his lips .     in other words  it turns out that the man bringing the action for payment of          damages against my client .  united states robots and mechanical men corporation was the one who from the beginning opposed the use of the robot  although everyone else on the executive committee of the university senate was persuaded that it was a good idea .        he voted against the motion  as was his right .        you didn   t mention in your description of the meeting any remarks made by professor ninheimer .  did he make any .        i think he spoke .        you think .        well  he did speak .        against using the robot .        yes .        was he violent about it .     dean hart paused .     he was vehement .     defense grew confidential .     how long have you known professor ninheimer  dean hart .        about twelve years .        reasonably well .        i should say so  yes .        knowing him  then  would you say he was the kind of man who might continue to bear resentment against a robot  all the more so because an adverse vote had      prosecution drowned out the remainder of the question with an indignant and vehement objection of his own .  defense motioned the witness down and justice shane called luncheon recess .   robertson mangled his sandwich .  the corporation would not founder for loss of three quarters of a million  but the loss would do it no particular good .  he was conscious  moreover  that there would be a much more costly long term setback in public relations .  he said sourly     why all this business about how easy got into the university .  what do they hope to gain .     the attorney for defense said quietly     a court action is like a chess game  mi .  robertson .  the winner is usually the one who can see more moves ahead  and my friend at the prosecutor   s table is no beginner .  they can show damage  that   s no problem .  their main effort lies in anticipating our defense .  they must be counting on us to try to show that easy couldn   t possibly have committed the offense  because of the laws of robotics .        all right     said robertson     that is our defense .  an absolutely airtight one .        to a robotics engineer .  not necessarily to a judge .  they   re setting themselves up a position from which they can demonstrate that ez    was no ordinary robot .  it was the first of its type to be offered to the public .  it was an experimental model that needed field testing and the university was the only decent way to provide such testing .  that would look plausible in the light of dr .  lanning   s strong efforts to place the robot and the willingness of u .  s .  robots to lease it for so little .  the prosecution would then argue that the field test proved easy to have been a failure .  now do you see the purpose of what   s been going on .        but ez    was a perfectly good model     argued robertson .     it was the twenty seventh in production .        which is really a bad point     said defense somberly .     what was wrong with the first twenty six .  obviously something .  why shouldn   t there be something wrong with the twenty seventh  too .        there was nothing wrong with the first twenty six except that they weren   t complex enough for the task .  these were the first positronic brains of the sort to be constructed and it was rather hit and miss to begin with .  but the three laws held in all of them .  no robot is so imperfect that the three laws don   t hold .        dr .  lanning has explained this to me  mr .  robertson  and i am willing to take his word for it .  the judge  however  may not be .  we are expecting a decision from an honest and intelligent man who knows no robotics and thus may be led astray .  for instance  if you or dr .  lanning or dr .  calvin were to say on the stand that any positronic brains were constructed    hit and miss     as you just did  prosecution would tear you apart in cross examination .  nothing would salvage our case .  so that   s something to avoid .     robertson growled     if only easy would talk .     defense shrugged .     a robot is incompetent as a witness  so that would do us no good .        at least we   d know some of the facts .  we   d know how it came to do such a thing .     susan calvin fired up .  a dullish red touched her cheeks and her voice had a trace of warmth in it .     we know how easy came to do it .  it was ordered to .  i   ve explained this to counsel and i   ll explain it to you now .        ordered to by whom .     asked robertson in honest astonishment .   no one ever told him anything  he thought resentfully .  these research people considered themselves the owners of u .  s .  robots  by god .      by the plaintiff     said dr .  calvin .     in heaven   s name  why .        i don   t know why yet .  perhaps just that we might be sued  that he might gain some cash .     there were blue glints in her eyes as she said that .     then why doesn   t easy say so .        isn   t that obvious .  it   s been ordered to keep quiet about the matter .        why should that be obvious .     demanded robertson truculently .     well  it   s obvious to me .  robot psychology is my profession .  if easy will not answer questions about the matter directly  he will answer questions on the fringe of the matter .  by measuring increased hesitation in his answers as the central question is approached  by measuring the area of blankness and the intensity of counterpotentials set up  it is possible to tell with scientific precision that his troubles are the result of an order not to talk  with its strength based on first law .  in other words  he   s been told that if he talks  harm will be done a human being .  presumably harm to the unspeakable professor ninheimer  the plaintiff  who  to the robot  would seem a human being .        well  then     said robertson     can   t you explain that if he keeps quiet  harm will be done to u .  s .  robots .        u .  s .  robots is not a human being and the first law of robotics does not recognize a corporation as a person the way ordinary laws do .  besides  it would be dangerous to try to lift this particular sort of inhibition .  the person who laid it on could lift it off least dangerously  because the robot   s motivations in that respect are centered on that person .  any other course      she shook her head and grew almost impassioned .     i won   t let the robot be damaged .     lanning interrupted with the air of bringing sanity to the problem .     it seems to me that we have only to prove a robot incapable of the act of which easy is accused .  we can do that .        exactly     said defense  in annoyance .     you can do that .  the only witnesses capable of testifying to easy   s condition and to the nature of easy   s state of mind are employees of u .  s .  robots .  the judge can   t possibly accept their testimony as unprejudiced .        how can he deny expert testimony .        by refusing to be convinced by it .  that   s his right as the judge .  against the alternative that a man like professor ninheimer deliberately set about ruining his own reputation  even for a sizable sum of money  the judge isn   t going to accept the technicalities of your engineers .  the judge is a man  after all .  if he has to choose between a man doing an impossible thing and a robot doing an impossible thing  he   s quite likely to decide in favor of the man .        a man can do an impossible thing     said lanning     because we don   t know all the complexities of the human mind and we don   t know what  in a given human mind  is impossible and what is not .  we do know what is really impossible to a robot .        well  we   ll see if we can   t convince the judge of that     defense replied wearily .     if all you say is so     rumbled robertson     i don   t see how you can .        we   ll see .  it   s good to know and be aware of the difficulties involved  but let   s not be too downhearted .  i   ve tried to look ahead a few moves in the chess game  too .     with a stately nod in the direction of the robopsychologist  he added     with the help of the good lady here .     lanning looked from one to the other and said     what the devil is this .     but the bailiff thrust his head into the room and announced somewhat breathlessly that the trial was about to resume .  they took their seats  examining the man who had started all the trouble .  simon ninheimer owned a fluffy head of sandy hair  a face that narrowed past a beaked nose toward a pointed chin  and a habit of sometimes hesitating before key words in his conversation that gave him an air of a seeker after an almost unbearable precision .  when he said     the sun rises in the  uh  east     one was certain he had given due consideration to the possibility that it might at some time rise in the west .  prosecution said     did you oppose employment of robot ez    by the university .        i did  sir .        why was that .        i did not feel that we understood the  uh  motives of u .  s .  robots thoroughly .  i mistrusted their anxiety to place the robot with us .        did you feel that it was capable of doing the work that it was allegedly designed to do .        i know for a fact that it was not .        would you state your reasons .      simon ninheimer   s book  entitled social tensions involved in space flight and their resolution  had been eight years in the making .  ninheimer   s search for precision was not confined to his habits of speech  and in a subject like sociology  almost inherently imprecise  it left him breathless .  even with the material in galley proofs  he felt no sense of completion .  rather the reverse  in fact .  staring at the long strips of print  he felt only the itch to tear the lines of type apart and rearrange them differently .  jim baker  instructor and soon to be assistant professor of sociology  found ninheimer  three days after the first batch of galleys had arrived from the printer  staring at the handful of paper in abstraction .  the galleys came in three copies  one for ninheimer to proofread  one for baker to proofread independently  and a third  marked    original     which was to receive the final corrections  a combination of those made by ninheimer and by baker  after a conference at which possible conflicts and disagreements were ironed out .  this had been their policy on the several papers on which they had collaborated in the past three years and it worked well .  baker  young and ingratiatingly soft voiced  had his own copies of the galleys in his hand .  he said eagerly     i   ve done the first chapter and it contains some typographical beauts .        the first chapter always has them     said ninheimer distantly .     do you want to go over it now .     ninheimer brought his eyes to grave focus on baker .     i haven   t done anything on the galleys  jim .  i don   t think i   ll bother .     baker looked confused .     not bother .     ninheimer pursed his lips .     i   ve asked about the  uh  workload of the machine .  after all  he was originally  uh  promoted as a proofreader .  they   ve set a schedule .        the machine .  you mean easy .        i believe that is the foolish name they gave it .        but  dr .  ninheimer  i thought you were staying clear of it          i seem to be the only one doing so .  perhaps i ought to take my share of the  uh  advantage .        oh .  well  i seem to have wasted time on this first chapter  then     said the younger man ruefully .     not wasted .  we can compare the machine   s result with yours as a check .        if you want to  but         yes .        i doubt that we   ll find anything wrong with easy   s work .  it   s supposed never to have made a mistake .        i dare say     said ninheimer dryly .   the first chapter was brought in again by baker four days later .  this time it was ninheimer   s copy  fresh from the special annex that had been built to house easy and the equipment it used .  baker was jubilant .     dr .  ninheimer  it not only caught everything i caught  it found a dozen errors i missed .  the whole thing took it twelve minutes .     ninheimer looked over the sheaf  with the neatly printed marks and symbols in the margins .  he said     it is not as complete as you and i would have made it .  we would have entered an insert on suzuki   s work on the neurological effects of low gravity .        you mean his paper in sociological reviews .        of course .        well  you can   t expect impossibilities of easy .  it can   t read the literature for us .        i realize that .  as a matter of fact  i have prepared the insert .  i will see the machine and make certain it knows how to  uh  handle inserts .        it will know .        i prefer to make certain .     ninheimer had to make an appointment to see easy  and then could get nothing better than fifteen minutes in the late evening .  but the fifteen minutes turned out to be ample .  robot ez    understood the matter of inserts at once .  ninheimer found himself uncomfortable at close quarters with the robot for the first time .  almost automatically  as though it were human  he found himself asking     are you happy with your work .        most happy  professor ninheimer     said easy solemnly  the photocells that were its eyes gleaming their normal deep red .     you know me .        from the fact that you present me with additional material to include in the galleys  it follows that you are the author .  the author   s name  of course  is at the head of each sheet of galley proof .        i see .  you make  uh  deductions  then .  tell me     he couldn   t resist the question     what do you think of the book so far .     easy said     i find it very pleasant to work with .        pleasant .  that is an odd word for a  uh  a mechanism without emotion .  i   ve been told you have no emotion .        the words of your book go in accordance with my circuits     easy explained .     they set up little or no counterpotentials .  it is in my brain paths to translate this mechanical fact into a word such as    pleasant .     the emotional context is fortuitous .        i see .  why do you find the book pleasant .        it deals with human beings  professor  and not with inorganic materials or mathematical symbols .  your book attempts to understand human beings and to help increase human happiness .        and this is what you try to do and so my book goes in accordance with your circuits .  is that it .        that is it  professor .     the fifteen minutes were up .  ninheimer left and went to the university library  which was on the point of closing .  he kept them open long enough to find an elementary text on robotics .  he took it home with him .  except for occasional insertion of late material  the galleys went to easy and from him to the publishers with little intervention from ninheimer at first  and none at all later .  baker said  a little uneasily     it almost gives me a feeling of uselessness .        it should give you a feeling of having time to begin a new project     said ninheimer  without looking up from the notations he was making in the current issue of social science abstracts .     i   m just not used to it .  i keep worrying about the galleys .  it   s silly  i know .        it is .        the other day i got a couple of sheets before easy sent them off to         what .     ninheimer looked up  scowling .  the copy of abstracts slid shut .     did you disturb the machine at its work .        only for a minute .  everything was all right .  oh  it changed one word .  you referred to something as    criminal     it changed the word to    reckless .     it thought the second adjective fit in better with the context .     ninheimer grew thoughtful .     what did you think .        you know  i agreed with it .  i let it stand .     ninheimer turned in his swivel chair to face his young associate .     see here  i wish you wouldn   t do this again .  if i am to use the machine  i wish the  uh  full advantage of it .  if i am to use it and lose your  uh  services anyway because you supervise it when the whole point is that it requires no supervision  i gain nothing .  do you see .        yes  dr .  ninheimer     said baker  subdued .  the advance copies of social tensions arrived in dr .  ninheimer   s office on the eighth of may .  he looked through it briefly  flipping pages and pausing to read a paragraph here and there .  then he put his copies away .  as he explained later  he forgot about it .  for eight years  he had worked at it  but now  and for months in the past  other interests had engaged him while easy had taken the load of the book off his shoulders .  he did not even think to donate the usual complimentary copy to the university library .  even baker  who had thrown himself into work and had steered clear of the department head since receiving his rebuke at their last meeting  received no copy .  on the sixteenth of june that stage ended .  ninheimer received a phone call and stared at the image in the    plate with surprise .     speidell .  are you in town .        no  sir .  i   m in cleveland .     speidell   s voice trembled with emotion .     then why the call .        because i   ve just been looking through your new book .  ninheimer  are you mad .  have you gone insane .      ninheimer stiffened .     is something  uh  wrong .     he asked in alarm .     wrong .  i refer you to page     .  what in blazes do you mean by interpreting my work as you do .  where in the paper cited do i make the claim that the criminal personality is nonexistent and that it is the law enforcement agencies that are the true criminals .  here  let me quote         wait .  wait .     cried ninheimer  trying to find the page .     let me see .  let me see .  .  . good god .        well .        speidell  i don   t see how this could have happened .  i never wrote this .        but that   s what   s printed .  and that distortion isn   t the worst .  you look at page     and imagine what ipatiev is going to do to you when he sees the hash you   ve made of his findings .  look  ninheimer  the book is riddled with this sort of thing .  i don   t know what you were thinking of  but there   s nothing to do but get the book off the market .  and you   d better be prepared for extensive apologies at the next association meeting .        speidell  listen to me      but speidell had flashed off with a force that had the    plate glowing with after images for fifteen seconds .  it was then that ninheimer went through the book and began marking off passages with red ink .  he kept his temper remarkably well when he faced easy again  but his lips were pale .  he passed the book to easy and said     will you read the marked passages on pages               and     .     easy did so in four glances .     yes  professor ninheimer .        this is not as i had it in the original galleys .        no  sir .  it is not .        did you change it to read as it now does .        yes  sir .        why .        sir  the passages as they read in your version were most uncomplimentary to certain groups of human beings .  i felt it advisable to change the wording to avoid doing them harm .        how dared you do such a thing .        the first law  professor  does not let me  through any inaction  allow harm to come to human beings .  certainly  considering your reputation in the world of sociology and the wide circulation your book would receive among scholars  considerable harm would come to a number of the human beings you speak of .        but do you realize the harm that will come to me now .        it was necessary to choose the alternative with less harm .     professor ninheimer  shaking with fury  staggered away .  it was clear to him that u .  s .  robots would have to account to him for this .   there was some excitement at the defendants    table  which increased as prosecution drove the point home .     then robot ez    informed you that the reason for its action was based on the first law of robotics .        that is correct  sir .        that  in effect  it had no choice .        yes  sir .        it follows then that u .  s .  robots designed a robot that would of necessity rewrite books to accord with its own conceptions of what was right .  and yet they palmed it off as simple proofreader .  would you say that .     defense objected firmly at once  pointing out that the witness was being asked for a decision on a matter in which he had no competence .  the judged admonished prosecution in the usual terms  but there was no doubt that the exchange had sunk home  not least upon the attorney for the defense .  defense asked for a short recess before beginning cross examination  using a legal technicality for the purpose that got him five minutes .  he leaned over toward susan calvin .     is it possible  dr .  calvin  that professor ninheimer is telling the truth and that easy was motivated by the first law .     calvin pressed her lips together  then said     no .  it isn   t possible .  the last part of ninheimer   s testimony is deliberate perjury .  easy is not designed to be able to judge matters at the stage of abstraction represented by an advanced textbook on sociology .  it would never be able to tell that certain groups of humans would be harmed by a phrase in such a book .  its mind is simply not built for that .        i suppose  though  that we can   t prove this to a layman     said defense pessimistically .     no     admitted calvin .     the proof would be highly complex .  our way out is still what it was .  we must prove ninheimer is lying  and nothing he has said need change our plan of attack .        very well  dr .  calvin     said defense     i must accept your word in this .  we   ll go on as planned .     in the courtroom  the judge   s gavel rose and fell and dr .  ninheimer took the stand once more .  he smiled a little as one who feels his position to be impregnable and rather enjoys the prospect of countering a useless attack .  defense approached warily and began softly .     dr .  ninheimer  do you mean to say that you were completely unaware of these alleged changes in your manuscript until such time as dr .  speidell called you on the sixteenth of june .        that is correct  sir .        did you never look at the galleys after robot ez    had proofread them .        at first i did  but it seemed to me a useless task .  i relied on the claims of u .  s .  robots .  the absurd  uh  changes were made only in the last quarter of the book after the robot  i presume  had learned enough about sociology         never mind your presumptions .     said defense .     i understood your colleague  dr .  baker  saw the later galleys on at least one occasion .  do you remember testifying to that effect .        yes  sir .  as i said  he told me about seeing one page  and even there  the robot had changed a word .          again defense broke in .     don   t you find it strange  sir  that after over a year of implacable hostility to the robot  after having voted against it in the first place and having refused to put it to any use whatever  you suddenly decided to put your book  your magnum opus  into its hands .        i don   t find that strange .  i simply decided that i might as well use the machine .        and you were so confident of robot ez     all of a sudden  that you didn   t even bother to check your galleys .        i told you i was  uh  persuaded by u .  s .  robots    propaganda .        so persuaded that when your colleague  dr .  baker  attempted to check on the robot  you berated him soundly .        i didn   t berate him .  i merely did not wish to have him  uh  waste his time .  at least  i thought then it was a waste of time .  i did not see the significance of that change in a word at the      defense said with heavy sarcasm     i have no doubt you were instructed to bring up that point in order that the word change be entered in the record      he altered his line to forestall objection and said     the point is that you were extremely angry with dr .  baker .        no  sir .  not angry .        you didn   t give him a copy of your book when you received it .        simple forgetfulness .  i didn   t give the library its copy  either .     ninheimer smiled cautiously .     professors are notoriously absentminded .     defense said     do you find it strange that  after more than a year of perfect work  robot ez    should go wrong on your book .  on a book  that is  which was written by you  who was  of all people  the most implacably hostile to the robot .        my book was the only sizable work dealing with mankind that it had to face .  the three laws of robotics took hold then .        several times  dr .  ninheimer     said defense     you have tried to sound like an expert on robotics .  apparently you suddenly grew interested in robotics and took out books on the subject from the library .  you testified to that effect  did you not .        one book  sir .  that was the result of what seems to me to have been  uh  natural curiosity .        and it enabled you to explain why the robot should  as you allege  have distorted your book .        yes  sir .        very convenient .  but are you sure your interest in robotics was not intended to enable you to manipulate the robot for your own purposes .     ninheimer flushed .     certainly not  sir .     defense   s voice rose .     in fact  are you sure the alleged altered passages were not as you had them in the first place .     the sociologist half rose .     that   s  uh  uh  ridiculous .  i have the galleys      he had difficulty speaking and prosecution rose to insert smoothly     with your permission  your honor  i intend to introduce as evidence the set of galleys given by dr .  ninheimer to robot ez    and the set of galleys mailed by robot ez    to the publishers .  i will do so now if my esteemed colleague so desires  and will be willing to allow a recess in order that the two sets of galleys may be compared .      defense waved his hand impatiently .     that is not necessary .  my honored opponent can introduce those galleys whenever he chooses .  i   m sure they will show whatever discrepancies are claimed by the plaintiff to exist .  what i would like to know of the witness  however  is whether he also has in his possession dr .  baker   s galleys .        dr .  baker   s galleys .     ninheimer frowned .  he was not yet quite master of himself .     yes  professor .  i mean dr .  baker   s galleys .  you testified to the effect that dr .  baker had received a separate copy of the galleys .  i will have the clerk read your testimony if you are suddenly a selective type of amnesiac .  or is it just that professors are  as you say  notoriously absent minded .     ninheimer said     i remember dr .  baker   s galleys .  they weren   t necessary once the job was placed in the care of the proofreading machine         so you burned them .        no .  i put them in the waste basket .        burned them  dumped them  what   s the difference .  the point is you got rid of them .        there   s nothing wrong      began ninheimer weakly .     nothing wrong .     thundered defense .     nothing wrong except that there is now no way we can check to see if  on certain crucial galley sheets  you might not have substituted a harmless blank one from dr .  baker   s copy for a sheet in your own copy which you had deliberately mangled in such a way as to force the robot to      prosecution shouted a furious objection .  justice shane leaned forward  his round face doing its best to assume an expression of anger equivalent to the intensity of the emotion felt by the man .  the judge said     do you have any evidence  counselor  for the extraordinary statement you have just made .     defense said quietly     no direct evidence  your honor .  but i would like to point out that  viewed properly  the sudden conversion of the plaintiff from anti roboticism  his sudden interest in robotics  his refusal to check the galleys or to allow anyone else to check them  his careful neglect to allow anyone to see the book immediately after publication  all very clearly point         counselor     interrupted the judge impatiently     this is not the place for esoteric deductions .  the plaintiff is not on trial .  neither are you prosecuting him .  i forbid this line of attack and i can only point out that the desperation that must have induced you to do this cannot help but weaken your case .  if you have legitimate questions to ask  counselor  you may continue with your cross examination .  but i warn you against another such exhibition in this courtroom .        i have no further questions  your honor .     robertson whispered heatedly as counsel for the defense returned to his table     what good did that do  for god   s sake .  the judge is dead set against you now .     defense replied calmly     but ninheimer is good and rattled .  and we   ve set him up for tomorrow   s move .  he   ll be ripe .     susan calvin nodded gravely .   the rest of prosecution   s case was mild in comparison .  dr .  baker was called and bore out most of ninheimer   s testimony .  drs .  speidell and ipatiev were called  and they expounded most movingly on their shock and dismay at certain quoted passages in dr .  ninheimer   s book .  both gave their professional opinion that dr .  ninheimer   s professional reputation had been seriously impaired .  the galleys were introduced in evidence  as were copies of the finished book .  defense cross examined no more that day .  prosecution rested and the trial was recessed till the next morning .  defense made his first motion at the beginning of the proceedings on the second day .  he requested that robot ez    be admitted as a spectator to the proceedings .  prosecution objected at once and justice shane called both to the bench .  prosecution said hotly     this is obviously illegal .  a robot may not be in any edifice used by the general public .        this courtroom     pointed out defense     is closed to all but those having an immediate connection with the case .        a large machine of known erratic behavior would disturb my clients and my witnesses by its very presence .  it would make hash out of the proceedings .     the judge seemed inclined to agree .  he turned to defense and said rather unsympathetically     what are the reasons for your request .     defense said     it will be our contention that robot ez    could not possibly  by the nature of its construction  have behaved as it has been described as behaving .  it will be necessary to present a few demonstrations .     prosecution said     i don   t see the point  your honor .  demonstrations conducted by men employed at u .  s .  robots are worth little as evidence when u .  s .  robots is the defendant .        your honor     said defense     the validity of any evidence is for you to decide  not for the prosecuting attorney .  at least  that is my understanding .     justice shane  his prerogatives encroached upon  said     your understanding is correct .  nevertheless  the presence of a robot here does raise important legal questions .        surely  your honor  nothing that should be allowed to override the requirements of justice .  if the robot is not present  we are prevented from presenting our only defense .     the judge considered .     there would be the question of transporting the robot here .        that is a problem with which u .  s .  robots has frequently been faced .  we have a truck parked outside the courtroom  constructed according to the laws governing the transportation of robots .  robot ez    is in a packing case inside with two men guarding it .  the doors to the truck are properly secured and all other necessary precautions have been taken .        you seem certain     said justice shane  in renewed ill temper     that judgment on this point will be in your favor .        not at all  your honor .  if it is not  we simply turn the truck about .  i have made no presumptions concerning your decision .     the judge nodded .     the request on the part of the defense is granted .     the crate was carried in on a large dolly and the two men who handled it opened it .  the courtroom was immersed in a dead silence .   susan calvin waited as the thick slabs of celluform went down  then held out one hand .     come  easy .     the robot looked in her direction and held out its large metal arm .  it towered over her by two feet but followed meekly  like a child in the clasp of its mother .  someone giggled nervously and choked it off at a hard glare from dr .  calvin .  easy seated itself carefully in a large chair brought by the bailiff  which creaked but held .  defense said     when it becomes necessary  your honor  we will prove that this is actually robot ez     the specific robot in the employ of northeastern university during the period of time with which we are concerned .        good     his honor said .     that will be necessary .  i  for one  have no idea how you can tell one robot from another .        and now     said defense     i would like to call my first witness to the stand .  professor simon ninheimer  please .     the clerk hesitated  looked at the judge .  justice shane asked  with visible surprise     you are calling the plaintiff as your witness .        yes  your honor .        i hope that you   re aware that as long as he   s your witness  you will be allowed none of the latitude you might exercise if you were cross examining an opposing witness .     defense said smoothly     my only purpose in all this is to arrive at the truth .  it will not be necessary to do more than ask a few polite questions .        well     said the judge dubiously     you   re the one handling the case .  call the witness .     ninheimer took the stand and was informed that he was still under oath .  he looked more nervous than he had the day before  almost apprehensive .  but defense looked at him benignly .     now  professor ninheimer  you are suing my clients in the amount of          .        that is the  uh  sum .  yes .        that is a great deal of money .        i have suffered a great deal of harm .        surely not that much .  the material in question involves only a few passages in a book .  perhaps these were unfortunate passages  but after all  books sometimes appear with curious mistakes in them .     ninheimer   s nostrils flared .     sir  this book was to have been the climax of my professional career .  instead  it makes me look like an incompetent scholar  a perverter of the views held by my honored friends and associates  and a believer of ridiculous and  uh  outmoded viewpoints .  my reputation is irretrievably shattered .  i can never hold up my head in any  uh  assemblage of scholars  regardless of the outcome of this trial .  i certainly cannot continue in my career  which has been the whole of my life .  the very purpose of my life has been  uh  aborted and destroyed .     defense made no attempt to interrupt the speech  but stared abstractedly at his fingernails as it went on .  he said very soothingly     but surely  professor ninheimer  at your present age  you could not hope to earn more than  let us be generous   l o ooo during the remainder of your life .  yet you are asking the court to award you five times as much .      ninheimer said  with an even greater burst of emotion     it is not in my lifetime alone that i am ruined .  i do not know for how many generations i shall be pointed at by sociologists as a  uh  a fool or maniac .  my real achievements will be buried and ignored .  i am ruined not only until the day of my death  but for all time to come  because there will always be people who will not believe that a robot made those insertions      it was at this point that robot ez    rose to his feet .  susan calvin made no move to stop him .  she sat motionless  staring straight ahead .  defense sighed softly .  easy   s melodious voice carried clearly .  it said     i would like to explain to everyone that i did insert certain passages in the galley proofs that seemed directly opposed to what had been there at first      even the prosecuting attorney was too startled at the spectacle of a seven foot robot rising to address the court to be able to demand the stopping of what was obviously a most irregular procedure .  when he could collect his wits  it was too late .  for ninheimer rose in the witness chair  his face working .  he shouted wildly     damn you  you were instructed to keep your mouth shut about      he ground to a choking halt  and easy was silent  too .  prosecution was on his feet now  demanding that a mistrial be declared .  justice shane banged his gavel desperately .     silence .  silence .  certainly there is every reason here to declare a mistrial  except that in the interests of justice i would like to have professor ninheimer complete his statement .  i distinctly heard him say to the robot that the robot had been instructed to keep its mouth shut about something .  there was no mention in your testimony  professor ninheimer  as to any instructions to the robot to keep silent about anything .     ninheimer stared wordlessly at the judge .  justice shane said     did you instruct robot ez    to keep silent about something .  and if so  about what .        your honor      began ninheimer hoarsely  and couldn   t continue .  the judge   s voice grew sharp .     did you  in fact  order the inserts in question to be made in the galleys and then order the robot to keep quiet about your part in this .     prosecution objected vigorously  but ninheimer shouted     oh  what   s the use .  yes .  yes .    and he ran from the witness stand .  he was stopped at the door by the bailiff and sank hopelessly into one of the last rows of seats  head buried in both hands .  justice shane said     it is evident to me that robot ez    was brought here as a trick .  except for the fact that the trick served to prevent a serious miscarriage of justice  i would certainly hold attorney for the defense in contempt .  it is clear now  beyond any doubt  that the plaintiff has committed what is to me a completely inexplicable fraud since  apparently  he was knowingly ruining his career in the process      judgment  of course  was for the defendant .   dr .  susan calvin had herself announced at dr .  ninheimer   s bachelor quarters in university hall .  the young engineer who had driven the car offered to go up with her  but she looked at him scornfully .     do you think he   ll assault me .  wait down here .     ninheimer was in no mood to assault anyone .  he was packing  wasting no time  anxious to be away before the adverse conclusion of the trial became general knowledge .  he looked at calvin with a queerly defiant air and said     are you coming to warn me of a countersuit .  if so  it will get you nothing .  i have no money  no job  no future .  i can   t even meet the costs of the trial .        if you   re looking for sympathy     said calvin coldly     don   t look for it here .  this was your doing .  however  there will be no countersuit  neither of you nor of the university .  we will even do what we can to keep you from going to prison for perjury .  we aren   t vindictive .        oh  is that why i   m not already in custody for forswearing myself .  i had wondered .  but then     he added bitterly     why should you be vindictive .  you have what you want now .        some of what we want  yes     said calvin .     the university will keep easy in its employ at a considerably higher rental fee .  furthermore  certain underground publicity concerning the trial will make it possible to place a few more of the ez models in other institutions without danger of a repetition of this trouble .        then why have you come to see me .        because i don   t have all of what i want yet .  i want to know why you hate robots as you do .  even if you had won the case  your reputation would have been ruined .  the money you might have obtained could not have compensated for that .  would the satisfaction of your hatred for robots have done so .        are you interested in human minds  dr .  calvin .     asked ninheimer  with acid mockery .     insofar as their reactions concern the welfare of robots  yes .  for that reason  i have learned a little of human psychology .        enough of it to be able to trick met       that wasn   t hard     said calvin  without pomposity .     the difficult thing was doing it in such a way as not to damage easy .        it is like you to be more concerned for a machine than for a man .     he looked at her with savage contempt .  it left her unmoved .     it merely seems so  professor ninheimer .  it is only by being concerned for robots that one can truly be concerned for twenty first century man .  you would understand this if you were a roboticist .        i have read enough robotics to know i don   t want to be a roboticist .        pardon me  you have read a book on robotics .  it has taught you nothing .  you learned enough to know that you could order a robot to do many things  even to falsify a book  if you went about it properly .  you learned enough to know that you could not order him to forget something entirely without risking detection  but you thought you could order him into simple silence more safely .  you were wrong .        you guessed the truth from his silencer       it wasn   t guessing .  you were an amateur and didn   t know enough to cover your tracks completely .  my only problem was to prove the matter to the judge and you were kind enough to help us there  in your ignorance of the robotics you claim to despise .         is there any purpose in this discussion .     asked ninheimer wearily .     for me  yes     said susan calvin     because i want you to understand how completely you have misjudged robots .  you silenced easy by telling him that if he told anyone about your own distortion of the book  you would lose your job .  that set up a certain potential within easy toward silence  one that was strong enough to resist our efforts to break it down .  we would have damaged the brain if we had persisted .     on the witness stand  however  you yourself put up a higher counterpotential .  you said that because people would think that you  not a robot  had written the disputed passages in the book  you would lose far more than just your job .  you would lose your reputation  your standing  your respect  your reason for living .  you would lose the memory of you after death .  a new and higher potential was set up by you  and easy talked .        oh  god     said ninheimer  turning his head away .  calvin was inexorable .  she said     do you understand why he talked .  it was not to accuse you  but to defend you .  it can be mathematically shown that he was about to assume full blame for your crime  to deny that you had anything to do with it .  the first law required that .  he was going to lie  to damage himself  to bring monetary harm to a corporation .  all that meant less to him than did the saving of you .  if you really understood robots and robotics  you would have let him talk .  but you did not understand  as i was sure you wouldn   t  as i guaranteed to the defense attorney that you wouldn   t .  you were certain  in your hatred of robots  that easy would act as a human being would act and defend itself at your expense .  so you flared out at him in panic  and destroyed yourself .     ninheimer said with feeling     i hope some day your robots turn on you and kill you .        don   t be foolish     said calvin .     now i want you to explain why you   ve done all this .     ninheimer grinned a distorted  humorless grin .     i am to dissect my mind  am i  for your intellectual curiosity  in return for immunity from a charge of perjury .        put it that way if you like     said calvin emotionlessly .     but explain .        so that you can counter future anti robot attempts more efficiently .  with greater understanding .        i accept that .        you know     said ninheimer     i   ll tell you  just to watch it do you no good at all .  you can   t understand human motivation .  you can only understand your damned machines because you   re a machine yourself  with skin on .      he was breathing hard and there was no hesitation in his speech  no searching for precision .  it was as though he had no further use for precision .  he said     for two hundred and fifty years  the machine has been replacing man and destroying the handcraftsman .  pottery is spewed out of molds and presses .  works of art have been replaced by identical gimcracks stamped out on a die .  call it progress  if you wish .  the artist is restricted to abstractions  confined to the world of ideas .  he must design something in mind  and then the machine does the rest .     do you suppose the potter is content with mental creation .  do you suppose the idea is enough .  that there is nothing in the feel of the clay itself  in watching the thing grow as hand and mind work together .  do you suppose the actual growth doesn   t act as a feedback to modify and improve the idea .        you are not a potter     said dr .  calvin .     i am a creative artist .  i design and build articles and books .  there is more to it than the mere thinking of words and of putting them in the right order .  if that were all  there would be no pleasure in it  no return .     a book should take shape in the hands of the writer .  one must actually see the chapters grow and develop .  one must work and rework and watch the changes take place beyond the original concept even .  there is taking the galleys in hand and seeing how the sentences look in print and molding them again .  there are a hundred contacts between a man and his work at every stage of the game and the contact itself is pleasurable and repays a man for the work he puts into his creation more than anything else could .  your robot would take all that away .        so does a typewriter .  so does a printing press .  do you propose to return to the hand illumination of manuscripts .        typewriters and printing presses take away some  but your robot would deprive us of all .  your robot takes over the galleys .  soon it  or other robots  would take over the original writing  the searching of the sources  the checking and cross checking of passages  perhaps even the deduction of conclusions .  what would that leave the scholar .  one thing only  the barren decisions concerning what orders to give the robot next .  i want to save the future generations of the world of scholarship from such a final hell .  that meant more to me than even my own reputation and so i set out to destroy u .  s .  robots by whatever means .        you were bound to fail     said susan calvin .     i was bound to try     said simon ninheimer .  calvin turned and left .  she did her best to feel no pang of sympathy for the broken man .  she did not entirely succeed .   little lost robot  measures on hyper base had been taken in a sort of rattling fury    the muscular equivalent of a hysterical shriek .  to itemize them in order of both chronology and desperation  they were     .  all work on the hyperatomic drive through all the space volume occupied by the stations of the twenty seventh asteroidal grouping came to a halt .     .  that entire volume of space was nipped out of the system  practically speaking .  no one entered without permission .  no one left under any conditions .     .  by special government patrol ship  drs .  susan calvin and peter bogert  respectively head psychologist and mathematical director of united states robot   mechanical men corporation  were brought to hyper base .   susan calvin had never left the surface of earth before  and had no perceptible desire to leave it this time .  in an age of atomic power and a clearly coming hyperatomic drive  she remained quietly provincial .  so she was dissatisfied with her trip and unconvinced of the emergency  and every line of her plain  middle aged face showed it clearly enough during her first dinner at hyper base .  nor did dr .  bogert   s sleek paleness abandon a certain hangdog attitude .  nor did major general kallner  who headed the project  even once forget to maintain a hunted expression .  in short  it was a grisly episode  that meal  and the little session of three that followed began in a gray  unhappy manner .  kallner  with his baldness glistening  and his dress uniform oddly unsuited to the general mood  began with uneasy directness .     this is a queer story to tell  sir  and madam .  i want to thank you for coming on short notice and without a reason being given .  we   ll try to correct that now .  we   ve lost a robot .  work has stopped and must stop until such time as we locate it .  so far we have failed  and we feel we need expert help .     perhaps the general felt his predicament anticlimactic .  he continued with a note of desperation     i needn   t tell you the importance of our work here .  more than eighty percent of last year   s appropriations for scientific research have gone to us        why  we know that     said bogert  agreeably .     u .  s .  robots is receiving a generous rental fee for use of our robots .     susan calvin injected a blunt  vinegary note     what makes a single robot so important to the project  and why hasn   t it been located .     the general turned his red face toward her and wet his lips quickly     why  in a manner of speaking we have located it .     then  with near anguish     here  suppose i explain .  as soon as the robot failed to report a state of emergency was declared  and all movement off hyper base stopped .  a cargo vessel had landed the previous day and had delivered us two robots for our laboratories .  it had sixty two robots of the .  .  .  uh .  .  .  game type for shipment elsewhere .  we are certain as to that figure .  there is no question about it whatever .        yes .  and the connection .        when our missing robot failed of location anywhere    i assure you we would have found a missing blade of grass if it had been there to find    we brainstormed ourselves into counting the robots left of the cargo ship .  they have sixty three now .        so that the sixty third  i take it  is the missing prodigal .     dr .  calvin   s eyes darkened .     yes  but we have no way of telling which is the sixty third .     there was a dead silence while the electric clock chimed eleven times  and then the robopsychologist said     very peculiar     and the corners of her lips moved downward .     peter     she turned to her colleague with a trace of savagery     what   s wrong here .  what kind of robots are they  using at hyper base .     dr .  bogert hesitated and smiled feebly     it   s been rather a matter of delicacy till now  susan .     she spoke rapidly     yes  till now .  if there are sixty three same type robots  one of which is wanted and the identity of which cannot be determined  why won   t any of them do .  what   s the idea of all this .  why have we been sent for .     bogert said in resigned fashion     if you   ll give me a chance  susan    hyper base happens to be using several robots whose brains are not impressioned with the entire first law of robotics .        aren   t impressioned .     calvin slumped back in her chair     i see .  how many were made .        a few .  it was on government order and there was no way of violating the secrecy .  no one was to know except the top men directly concerned .  you weren   t included  susan .  it was nothing i had anything to do with .      the general interrupted with a measure of authority .     i would like to explain that bit .  i hadn   t been aware that dr .  calvin was unacquainted with the situation .  i needn   t tell you  dr .  calvin  that there always has been strong opposition to robots on the planet .  the only defense the government has had against the fundamentalist radicals in this matter was the fact that robots are always built with an unbreakable first law    which makes it impossible for them to harm human beings under any circumstance .     but we had to have robots of a different nature .  so just a few of the ns   model  the nestors  that is  were prepared with a modified first law .  to keep it quiet  all ns     s are manufactured without serial numbers  modified members are delivered here along with a group of normal robots  and  of course  all our kind are under the strictest impressionment never to tell of their modification to unauthorized personnel .     he wore an embarrassed smile     this has all worked out against us now .     calvin said grimly     have you asked each one who it is  anyhow .  certainly  you are authorized .     the general nodded     all sixty three deny having worked here    and one is lying .        does the one you want show traces of wear .  the others  i take it  are factory fresh .        the one in question only arrived last month .  it  and the two that have just arrived  were to be the last we needed .  there   s no perceptible wear .     he shook his head slowly and his eyes were haunted again     dr .  calvin  we don   t dare let that ship leave .  if the existence of non first law robots becomes general knowledge     there seemed no way of avoiding understatement in the conclusion .     destroy all sixty three     said the robopsychologist coldly and flatly     and make an end of it .     bogert drew back a corner of his mouth .     you mean destroy thirty thousand dollars per robot .  i   m afraid u .  s .  robots wouldn   t like that .  we   d better make an effort first  susan  before we destroy anything .        in that case     she said  sharply     i need facts .  exactly what advantage does hyper base derive from these modified robots .  what factor made them desirable  general .     kallner ruffled his forehead and stroked it with an upward gesture of his hand .     we had trouble with our previous robots .  our men work with hard radiations a good deal  you see .  it   s dangerous  of course  but reasonable precautions are taken .  there have been only two accidents since we began and neither was fatal .  however  it was impossible to explain that to an ordinary robot .  the first law states    i   ll quote it       no robot may harm a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .        that   s primary  dr .  calvin .  when it was necessary for one of our men to expose himself for a short period to a moderate gamma field  one that would have no physiological effects  the nearest robot would dash in to drag him out .  if the field were exceedingly weak  it would succeed  and work could not continue till all robots were cleared out .  if the field were a trifle stronger  the robot would never reach the technician concerned  since its positronic brain would collapse under gamma radiations    and then we would be out one expensive and hard to replace robot .     we tried arguing with them .  their point was that a human being in a gamma field was endangering his life and that it didn   t matter that he could remain there half an hour safely .  supposing  they would say  he forgot and remained an hour .  they couldn   t take chances .  we pointed out that they were risking their lives on a wild off chance .  but self preservation is only the third law of robotics    and the first law of human safety came first .  we gave them orders  we ordered them strictly and harshly to remain out of gamma fields at whatever cost .  but obedience is only the second law of robotics    and the first law of human safety came first .  dr .  calvin  we either had to do without robots  or do something about the first law    and we made our choice .        i can   t believe     said dr .  calvin     that it was found possible to remove the first law .        it wasn   t removed  it was modified     explained kallner .     positronic brains were constructed that contained the positive aspect only of the law  which in them reads     no robot may harm a human being .     that is all .  they have no compulsion to prevent one coming to harm through an extraneous agency such as gamma rays .  i state the matter correctly  dr .  bogert .        quite     assented the mathematician .     and that is the only difference of your robots from the ordinary ns  model .  the only difference .  peter .        the only difference  susan .     she rose and spoke with finality     i intend sleeping now  and in about eight hours  i want to speak to whomever saw the robot last .  and from now on  general kallner  if i   m to take any responsibility at all for events  i want full and unquestioned control of this investigation .     susan calvin  except for two hours of resentful lassitude  experienced nothing approaching sleep .  she signaled at bogert   s door at the local time of      and found him also awake .  he had apparently taken the trouble of transporting a dressing gown to hyper base with him  for he was sitting in it .  he put his nail scissors down when calvin entered .  he said softly     i   ve been expecting you more or less .  i suppose you feel sick about all this .        i do .        well    i   m sorry .  there was no way of preventing it .  when the call came out from hyper base for us  i knew that something must have gone wrong with the modified nestors .  but what was there to do .  i couldn   t break the matter to you on the trip here  as i would have liked to  because i had to be sure .  the matter of the modification is top secret .     the psychologist muttered     i should have been told .  u .  s .  robots had no right to modify positronic brains this way without the approval of a psychologist .     bogert lifted his eyebrows and sighed .     be reasonable  susan .  you couldn   t have influenced them .  in this matter  the government was bound to have its way .  they want the hyperatomic drive and the etheric physicists want robots that won   t interfere with them .  they were going to get them even if it did mean twisting the first law .  we had to admit it was possible from a construction standpoint and they swore a mighty oath that they wanted only twelve  that they would be used only at hyper base  that they would be destroyed once the drive was perfected  and that full precautions would be taken .  and they insisted on secrecy    and that   s the situation .     dr .  calvin spoke through her teeth     i would have resigned .        it wouldn   t have helped .  the government was offering the company a fortune  and threatening it with antirobot legislation in case of a refusal .  we were stuck then  and we   re badly stuck now .  if this leaks out  it might hurt kallner and the government  but it would hurt u .  s .  robots a devil of a lot more .     the psychologist stared at him .     peter  don   t you realize what all this is about .  can   t you understand what the removal of the first law means .  it isn   t just a matter of secrecy .        i know what removal would mean .  i   m not a child .  it would mean complete instability  with no nonimaginary solutions to the positronic field equations .        yes  mathematically .  but can you translate that into crude psychological thought .  all normal life  peter  consciously or otherwise  resents domination .  if the domination is by an inferior  or by a supposed inferior  the resentment becomes stronger .  physically  and  to an extent  mentally  a robot    any robot    is superior to human beings .  what makes him slavish  then .  only the first law .  why  without it  the first order you tried to give a robot would result in your death .  unstable .  what do you think .        susan     said bogert  with an air of sympathetic amusement .     i   ll admit that this frankenstein complex you   re exhibiting has a certain justification    hence the first law in the first place .  but the law  i repeat and repeat  has not been removed    merely modified .        and what about the stability of the brain .     the mathematician thrust out his lips     decreased  naturally .  but it   s within the border of safety .  the first nestors were delivered to hyper base nine months ago  and nothing whatever has gone wrong till now  and even this involves merely fear of discovery and not danger to humans .        very well  then .  we   ll see what comes of the morning conference .     bogert saw her politely to the door and grimaced eloquently when she left .  he saw no reason to change his perennial opinion of her as a sour and fidgety frustration .  susan calvin   s train of thought did not include bogert in the least .  she had dismissed him years ago as a smooth and pretentious sleekness .   gerald black had taken his degree in etheric physics the year before and  in common with his entire generation of physicists  found himself engaged in the problem of the drive .  he now made a proper addition to the general atmosphere of these meetings on hyper base .  in his stained white smock  he was half rebellious and wholly uncertain .  his stocky strength seemed striving for release and his fingers  as they twisted each other with nervous yanks  might have forced an iron bar out of true .  major general kallner sat beside him  the two from u .  s .  robots faced him .  black said     i   m told that i was the last to see nestor    before he vanished .  i take it you want to ask me about that .     dr .  calvin regarded him with interest     you sound as if you were not sure  young man .  don   t you know whether you were the last to see him .        he worked with me  ma   am  on the field generators  and he was with me the morning of his disappearance .  i don   t know if anyone saw him after about noon .  no one admits having done so .        do you think anyone   s lying about it .        i don   t say that .  but i don   t say that i want the blame of it  either .     his dark eyes smoldered .     there   s no question of blame .  the robot acted as it did because of what it is .  we   re just trying to locate it  mr .  black  and let   s put everything else aside .  now if you   ve worked with the robot  you probably know it better than anyone else .  was there anything unusual about it that you noticed .  had you ever worked with robots before .        i   ve worked with other robots we have here    the simple ones .  nothing different about the nestors except that they   re a good deal cleverer    and more annoying .        annoying .  in what way .        well    perhaps it   s not their fault .  the work here is rough and most of us get a little jagged .  fooling around with hyper space isn   t fun .     he smiled feebly  finding pleasure in confession .     we run the risk continually of blowing a hole in normal space time fabric and dropping right out of the universe  asteroid and all .  sounds screwy  doesn   t it .  naturally  you   re on edge sometimes .  but these nestors aren   t .  they   re curious  they   re calm  they don   t worry .  it   s enough to drive you nuts at times .  when you want something done in a tearing hurry  they seem to take their time .  sometimes i   d rather do without .        you say they take their time .  have they ever refused an order .        oh  no     hastily .     they do it all right .  they tell you when they think you   re wrong  though .  they don   t know anything about the subject but what we taught them  but that doesn   t stop them .  maybe i imagine it  but the other fellows have the same trouble with their nestors .     general kallner cleared his throat ominously     why have no complaints reached me on the matter  black .     the young physicist reddened     we didn   t really want to do without the robots  sir  and besides we weren   t certain exactly how such .  .  .  uh .  .  .  minor complaints might be received .     bogert interrupted softly     anything in particular happen the morning you last saw it .     there was a silence .  with a quiet motion  calvin repressed the comment that was about to emerge from kallner  and waited patiently .  then black spoke in blurting anger     i had a little trouble with it .  i   d broken a kimball tube that morning and was out five days of work  my entire program was behind schedule  i hadn   t received any mail from home for a couple of weeks .  and he came around wanting me to repeat an experiment i had abandoned a month ago .  he was always annoying me on that subject and i was tired of it .  i told him to go away    and that   s all i saw of him .        you told him to go away .     asked dr .  calvin with sharp interest .     in just those words .  did you say    go away    .  try to remember the exact words .     there was apparently an internal struggle in progress .  black cradled his forehead in a broad palm for a moment  then tore it away and said defiantly     i said     go lose yourself .         bogert laughed for a short moment .     and he did  eh .     but calvin wasn   t finished .  she spoke cajolingly     now we   re getting somewhere  mr .  black .  but exact details are important .  in understanding the robot   s actions  a word  a gesture  an emphasis may be everything .  you couldn   t have said just those three words  for instance  could you .  by your own description you must have been in a hasty mood .  perhaps you strengthened your speech a little .     the young man reddened     well .  .  .  i may have called it a .  .  .  a few things .        exactly what things .        oh    i wouldn   t remember exactly .  besides i couldn   t repeat it .  you know how you get when you   re excited .     his embarrassed laugh was almost a giggle     i sort of have a tendency to strong language .        that   s quite all right     she replied  with prim severity .     at the moment  i   m a psychologist .  i would like to have you repeat exactly what you said as nearly as you remember  and  even more important  the exact tone of voice you used .     black looked at his commanding officer for support  found none .  his eyes grew round and appalled     but i can   t .        you must .        suppose     said bogert  with ill hidden amusement     you address me .  you may find it easier .     the young man   s scarlet face turned to bogert .  he swallowed .     i said    his voice faded out .  he tried again     i said     and he drew a deep breath and spewed it out hastily in one long succession of syllables .  then  in the charged air that lingered  he concluded almost in tears      .  .  .  more or less .  i don   t remember the exact order of what i called him  and maybe i left out something or put in something  but that was about it .     only the slightest flush betrayed any feeling on the part of the robopsychologist .  she said     i am aware of the meaning of most of the terms used .  the others  i suppose  are equally derogatory .        i   m afraid so     agreed the tormented black .     and in among it  you told him to lose himself .        i meant it only figuratively .        i realize that .  no disciplinary action is intended  i am sure .     and at her glance  the general  who  five seconds earlier  had seemed not sure at all  nodded angrily .     you may leave  mr .  black .  thank you for your cooperation .      it took five hours for susan calvin to interview the sixty three robots .  it was five hours of multi repetition  of replacement after replacement of identical robot  of questions a  b  c  d  and answers a  b  c  d  of a carefully bland expression  a carefully neutral tone  a carefully friendly atmosphere  and a hidden wire recorder .  the psychologist felt drained of vitality when she was finished .  bogert was waiting for her and looked expectant as she dropped the recording spool with a clang upon the plastic of the desk .  she shook her head     all sixty three seemed the same to me .  i couldn   t tell     he said     you couldn   t expect to tell by ear  susan .  suppose we analyze the recordings .     ordinarily  the mathematical interpretation of verbal reactions of robots is one of the more intricate branches of robotic analysis .  it requires a staff of trained technicians and the help of complicated computing machines .  bogert knew that .  bogert stated as much  in an extreme of unshown annoyance after having listened to each set of replies  made lists of word deviations  and graphs of the intervals of responses .     there are no anomalies present  susan .  the variations in wording and the time reactions are within the limits of ordinary frequency groupings .  we need finer methods .  they must have computers here .  no .     he frowned and nibbled delicately at a thumbnail .     we can   t use computers .  too much danger of leakage .  or maybe if we     dr .  calvin stopped him with an impatient gesture     please  peter .  this isn   t one of your petty laboratory problems .  if we can   t determine the modified nestor by some gross difference that we can see with the naked eye  one that there is no mistake about  we   re out of luck .  the danger of being wrong  and of letting him escape is otherwise too great .  it   s not enough to point out a minute irregularity in a graph .  i tell you  if that   s all i   ve got to go on  i   d destroy them all just to be certain .  have you spoken to the other modified nestors .        yes  i have     snapped back bogert     and there   s nothing wrong with them .  they   re above normal in friendliness if anything .  they answered my questions  displayed pride in their knowledge    except the two new ones that haven   t had time to learn their etheric physics .  they laughed rather good naturedly at my ignorance in some of the specializations here .     he shrugged     i suppose that forms some of the basis for resentment toward them on the part of the technicians here .  the robots are perhaps too willing to impress you with their greater knowledge .        can you try a few planar reactions to see if there has been any change  any deterioration  in their mental set up since manufacture .        i haven   t yet  but i will .     he shook a slim finger at her     you   re losing your nerve  susan .  i don   t see what it is you   re dramatizing .  they   re essentially harmless .        they are .     calvin took fire .     they are .  do you realize one of them is lying .  one of the sixty three robots i have just interviewed has deliberately lied to me after the strictest injunction to tell the truth .  the abnormality indicated is horribly deep seated  and horribly frightening .     peter bogert felt his teeth harden against each other .  he said     not at all .  look .  nestor    was given orders to lose himself .  those orders were expressed in maximum urgency by the person most authorized to command him .  you can   t counteract that order either by superior urgency or superior right of command .  naturally  the robot will attempt to defend the carrying out of his orders .  in fact  objectively  i admire his ingenuity .  how better can a robot lose himself than to hide himself among a group of similar robots .        yes  you would admire it .  i   ve detected amusement in you  peter    amusement and an appalling lack of understanding .  are you a roboticist  peter .  those robots attach importance to what they consider superiority .  you   ve just said as much yourself .  subconsciously they feel humans to be inferior and the first law which protects us from them is imperfect .  they are unstable .  and here we have a young man ordering a robot to leave him  to lose himself  with every verbal appearance of revulsion  disdain  and disgust .  granted  that robot must follow orders  but subconsciously  there is resentment .  it will become more important than ever for it to prove that it is superior despite the horrible names it was called .  it may become so important that what   s left of the first law won   t be enough .        how on earth  or anywhere in the solar system  susan  is a robot going to know the meaning of the assorted strong language used upon him .  obscenity is not one of the things impressioned upon his brain .        original impressionment is not everything     calvin snarled at him .     robots have learning capacity  you .  .  .  you fool     and bogert knew that she had really lost her temper .  she continued hastily     don   t you suppose he could tell from the tone used that the words weren   t complimentary .  don   t yon suppose he   s heard the words used before and noted upon what occasions .        well  then     shouted bogert     will you kindly tell me one way in which a modified robot can harm a human being  no matter how offended it is  no matter how sick with desire to prove superiority .        if i tell you one way  will you keep quiet .        yes .     they were leaning across the table at each other  angry eyes nailed together .  the psychologist said     if a modified robot were to drop a heavy weight upon a human being  he would not be breaking the first law  if he did so with the knowledge that his strength and reaction speed would be sufficient to snatch the weight away before it struck the man .  however once the weight left his fingers  he would be no longer the active medium .  only the blind force of gravity would be that .  the robot could then change his mind and merely by inaction  allow the weight to strike .  the modified first law allows that .        that   s an awful stretch of imagination .        that   s what my profession requires sometimes .  peter  let   s not quarrel  let   s work .  you know the exact nature of the stimulus that caused the robot to lose himself .  you have the records of his original mental make up .  i want you to tell me how possible it is for our robot to do the sort of thing i just talked about .  not the specific instance  mind you  but that whole class of response .  and i want it done quickly .        and meanwhile        and meanwhile  we   ll have to try performance tests directly on the response to first law .      gerald black  at his own request  was supervising the mushrooming wooden partitions that were springing up in a bellying circle on the vaulted third floor of radiation building   .  the laborers worked  in the main  silently  but more than one was openly a wonder at the sixty three photocells that required installation .  one of them sat down near black  removed his hat  and wiped his forehead thoughtfully with a freckled forearm .  black nodded at him     how   s it doing  walensky .     walensky shrugged and fired a cigar     smooth as butter .  what   s going on anyway  doc .  first  there   s no work for three days and then we have this mess of jiggers .     he leaned backward on his elbows and puffed smoke .  black twitched his eyebrows     a couple of robot men came over from earth .  remember the trouble we had with robots running into the gamma fields before we pounded it into their skulls that they weren   t to do it .        yeah .  didn   t we get new robots .        we got some replacements  but mostly it was a job of indoctrination .  anyway  the people who make them want to figure out robots that aren   t hit so bad by gamma rays .        sure seems funny  though  to stop all the work on the drive for this robot deal .  i thought nothing was allowed to stop the drive .        well  it   s the fellows upstairs that have the say on that .  me    i just do as i   m told .  probably all a matter of pull        yeah     the electrician jerked a smile  and winked a wise eye .     somebody knew somebody in washington .  but as long as my pay comes through on the dot  i should worry .  the drive   s none of my affair .  what are they going to do here .        you   re asking me .  they brought a mess of robots with them     over sixty  and they   re going to measure reactions .  that   s all my knowledge .        how long will it take .        i wish i knew .        well     walensky said  with heavy sarcasm     as long as they dish me my money  they can play games all they want .     black felt quietly satisfied .  let the story spread .  it was harmless  and near enough to the truth to take the fangs out of curiosity .   a man sat in the chair  motionless  silent .  a weight dropped  crashed downward  then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam .  in sixty three wooden cells  watching ns   robots dashed forward in that split second before the weight veered  and sixty three photocells five feet ahead of their original positions jiggled the marking pen and presented a little jag on the paper .  the weight rose and dropped  rose and dropped  rose  ten times .  ten times the robots sprang forward and stopped  as the man remained safely seated .   major general kallner had not worn his uniform in its entirety since the first dinner with the u .  s .  robot representatives .  he wore nothing over his blue gray shirt now  the collar was open  and the black tie was pulled loose .  he looked hopefully at bogert  who was still blandly neat and whose inner tension was perhaps betrayed only by the trace of glister at his temples .  the general said     how does it look .  what is it you   re trying to see .     bogert replied     a difference which may turn out to be a little too subtle for our purposes  i   m afraid .  for sixty two of those robots the necessity of jumping toward the apparently threatened human was what we call  in robotics  a forced reaction .  you see  even when the robots knew that the human in question would not come to harm    and after the third or fourth time they must have known it    they could not prevent reacting as they did .  first law requires it       well .        but the sixty third robot  the modified nestor  had no such compulsion .  he was under free action .  if he had wished  he could have remained in his seat .  unfortunately     said his voice was mildly regretful     he didn   t so wish .        why do you suppose .     bogert shrugged     i suppose dr .  calvin will tell us when she gets here .  probably with a horribly pessimistic interpretation  too .  she is sometimes a bit annoying .        she   s qualified  isn   t she .     demanded the general with a sudden frown of uneasiness .     yes .     bogert seemed amused .     she   s qualified all right .  she understands robots like a sister    comes from hating human beings so much  i think .  it   s just that  psychologist or not  she   s an extreme neurotic .  has paranoid tendencies .  don   t take her too seriously .     he spread the long row of broken line graphs out in front of him .     you see  general  in the case of each robot the time interval from moment of drop to the completion of a five foot movement tends to decrease as the tests are repeated .  there   s a definite mathematical relationship that governs such things and failure to conform would indicate marked abnormality in the positronic brain .  unfortunately  all here appear normal .        but if our nestor    was not responding with a forced action  why isn   t his curve different .  i don   t understand that .        it   s simple enough .  robotic responses are not perfectly analogous to human responses  more   s the pity .  in human beings  voluntary action is much slower than reflex action .  but that   s not the case with robots  with them it is merely a question of freedom of choice  otherwise the speeds of free and forced action are much the same .  what i had been expecting  though  was that nestor    would be caught by surprise the first time and allow too great an interval to elapse before responding .        and he didn   t .        i   m afraid not .        then we haven   t gotten anywhere .     the general sat back with an expression of pain .     it   s five days since you   ve come .     at this point  susan calvin entered and slammed the door behind her .     put your graphs away  peter     she cried     you know they don   t show anything .     she mumbled something impatiently as kallner half rose to greet her  and went on     we   ll have to try something else quickly .  i don   t like what   s happening .     bogert exchanged a resigned glance with the general .     is anything wrong .        you mean specifically .  no .  but i don   t like to have nestor    continue to elude us .  it   s bad .  it must be gratifying his swollen sense of superiority .  i   m afraid that his motivation is no longer simply one of following orders .  i think it   s becoming more a matter of sheer neurotic necessity to outthink humans .  that   s a dangerously unhealthy situation .  peter  have you done what i asked .  have you worked out the instability factors of the modified ns   along the lines i want .        it   s in progress     said the mathematician  without interest .  she stared at him angrily for a moment  then turned to kallner .     nester    is decidedly aware of what we   re doing  general .  he had no reason to jump for the bait in this experiment  especially after the first time  when he must have seen that there was no real danger to our subject .  the others couldn   t help it  but he was deliberately falsifying a reaction .        what do you think we ought to do now  then  dr .  calvin .        make it impossible for him to fake an action the next time .  we will repeat the experiment  but with an addition .  high tension cables  capable of electrocuting the nestor models will be placed between subject and robot    enough of them to avoid the possibility of jumping over    and the robot will be made perfectly aware in advance that touching the cables will mean death .        hold on     spat out bogert with sudden viciousness .     i rule that out .  we are not electrocuting two million dollars worth of robots to locate nestor    .  there are other ways .        you   re certain .  you   ve found none .  in any case  it   s not a question of electrocution .  we can arrange a relay which will break the current at the instant of application of weight .  if the robot should place his weight on it  he won   t die .  but he won   t know that  you see .     the general   s eyes gleamed into hope .     will that work .        it should .  under those conditions  nestor    would have to remain in his seat .  he could be ordered to touch the cables and die  for the second law of obedience is superior to the third law of self preservation .  but he won   t be ordered to  he will merely be left to his own devices  as will all the robots .  in the case of the normal robots  the first law of human safety will drive them to their death even without orders .  but not our nestor    .  without the entire first law  and without having received any orders on the matter  the third law  self preservation  will be the highest operating  and he will have no choice but to remain in his seat .  it would be a forced action .        will it be done tonight  then .        tonight     said the psychologist     if the cables can be laid in time .  i   ll tell the robots now what they   re to be up against .      a man sat in the chair  motionless  silent .  a weight dropped  crashed downward  then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam .  only once  and from her small camp chair in the observing booth in the balcony  dr .  susan calvin rose with a short gasp of pure horror .  sixty three robots sat quietly in their chairs  staring owlishly at the endangered man before them .  not one moved .   dr .  calvin was angry  angry almost past endurance .  angry the worse for not daring to show it to the robots that  one by one were entering the room and then leaving .  she checked the list .  number twenty eight was due in now    thirty five still lay ahead of her .  number twenty eight entered  diffidently .  she forced herself into reasonable calm .     and who are you .     the robot replied in a low  uncertain voice     i have received no number of my own yet  ma   am .  i   m an ns   robot  and i was number twenty eight in line outside .  i have a slip of paper here that i   m to give to you .        you haven   t been in here before this today .        no  ma   am .        sit down .  right there .  i want to ask you some questions  number twenty eight .  were you in the radiation room of building two about four hours ago .     the robot had trouble answering .  then it came out hoarsely  like machinery needing oil     yes  ma   am .        there was a man who almost came to harm there  wasn   t there .        yes  ma   am .        you did nothing  did you .        no  ma   am .        the man might have been hurt because of your inaction .  do you know that .        yes  ma   am .  i couldn   t help it  ma   am .     it is hard to picture a large expressionless metallic figure cringing  but it managed .     i want you to tell me exactly why you did nothing to save him .        i want to explain  ma   am .  i certainly don   t want to have you .  .  .  have anyone .  .  .  think that i could do a thing that might cause harm to a master .  oh  no  that would be a horrible .  .  .  an inconceivable        please don   t get excited  boy .  i   m not blaming you for anything .  i only want to know what you were thinking at the time .        ma   am  before it all happened you told us that one of the masters would be in danger of harm from that weight that keeps falling and that we would have to cross electric cables if we were to try to save him .  well  ma   am  that wouldn   t stop me .  what is my destruction compared to the safety of a master .  but .  .  .  but it occurred to me that if i died on my way to him  i wouldn   t be able to save him anyway .  the weight would crush him and then i would be dead for no purpose and perhaps some day some other master might come to harm who wouldn   t have  if i had only stayed alive .  do you understand me  ma   am .        you mean that it was merely a choice of the man dying  or both the man and yourself dying .  is that right .        yes  ma   am .  it was impossible to save the master .  he might be considered dead .  in that case  it is inconceivable that i destroy myself for nothing    without orders .     the robopsychologist twiddled a pencil .  she had heard the same story with insignificant verbal variations twenty seven times before .  this was the crucial question now .     boy     she said     your thinking has its points  but it is not the sort of thing i thought you might think .  did you think of this yourself .     the robot hesitated .     no .        who thought of it  then .        we were talking last night  and one of us got that idea and it sounded reasonable .        which one .     the robot thought deeply .     i don   t know .  just one of us .     she sighed     that   s all .     number twenty nine was next .  thirty four after that .   major general kallner  too  was angry .  for one week all of hyper base had stopped dead  barring some paper work on the subsidiary asteroids of the group .  for nearly one week  the two top experts in the field had aggravated the situation with useless tests .  and now they    or the woman  at any rate    made impossible propositions .  fortunately for the general situation  kallner felt it impolitic to display his anger openly .  susan calvin was insisting     why not  sir .  it   s obvious that the present situation is unfortunate .  the only way we may reach results in the future    or what future is left us in this matter    is to separate the robots .  we can   t keep them together any longer .        my dear dr .  calvin     rumbled the general  his voice sinking into the lower baritone registers .     i don   t see how i can quarter sixty three robots all over the place     dr .  calvin raised her arms helplessly .     i can do nothing then .  nestor    will either imitate what the other robots would do  or else argue them plausibly into not doing what he himself cannot do .  and in any case  this is bad business .  we   re in actual combat with this little lost robot of ours and he   s winning out .  every victory of his aggravates his abnormality .     she rose to her feet in determination .     general kallner  if you do not separate the robots as i ask  then i can only demand that all sixty three be destroyed immediately .        you demand it  do you .     bogert looked up suddenly  and with real anger .     what gives you the right to demand any such thing .  those robots remain as they are .  i   m responsible to the management  not you .        and i     added major general kallner     am responsible to the world co ordinator    and i must have this settled .        in that case     flashed back calvin     there is nothing for me to do but resign .  if necessary to force you to the necessary destruction  i   ll make this whole matter public .  it was not i that approved the manufacture of modified robots .        one word from you  dr .  calvin     said the general  deliberately     in violation of security measures  and you would be certainly imprisoned instantly .     bogert felt the matter to be getting out of hand .  his voice grew syrupy     well  now  we   re beginning to act like children  all of us .  we need only a little more time .  surely we can outwit a robot without resigning  or imprisoning people  or destroying two millions .     the psychologist turned on him with quiet fury     i don   t want any unbalanced robots in existence .  we have one nestor that   s definitely unbalanced  eleven more that are potentially so  and sixty two normal robots that are being subjected to an unbalanced environment .  the only absolute safe method is complete destruction .     the signal burr brought all three to a halt  and the angry tumult of growingly unrestrained emotion froze .     come in     growled kallner .  it was gerald black  looking perturbed .  he had heard angry voices .  he said     i thought i   d come myself .  .  .  didn   t like to ask anyone else        what is it .  don   t orate        the locks of compartment c in the trading ship have been played with .  there are fresh scratches on them .        compartment c .     explained calvin quickly .     that   s the one that holds the robots  isn   t it .  who did it .        from the inside     said black  laconically .     the lock isn   t out of order  is it .        no .  it   s all right .  i   ve been staying on the ship now for four days and none of them have tried to get out .  but i thought you ought to know  and i didn   t like to spread the news .  i noticed the matter myself .        is anyone there now .     demanded the general .     i left robbins and mcadams there .     there was a thoughtful silence  and then dr .  calvin said  ironically     well .     kallner rubbed his nose uncertainly     what   s it all about .        isn   t it obvious .  nester    is planning to leave .  that order to lose himself is dominating his abnormality past anything we can do .  i wouldn   t be surprised if what   s left of his first law would scarcely be powerful enough to override it .  he is perfectly capable of seizing the ship and leaving with it .  then we   d have a mad robot on a spaceship .  what would he do next .  any idea .  do you still want to leave them all together  general .        nonsense     interrupted bogert .  he had regained his smoothness .     all that from a few scratch marks on a lock .        have you  dr .  bogert  completed the analysis i   ve required  since you volunteer opinions .        yes .        may i see it .        no .        why not .  or mayn   t i ask that  either .        because there   s no point in it  susan .  i told you in advance that these modified robots are less stable than the normal variety  and my analysis shows it .  there   s a certain very small chance of breakdown under extreme circumstances that are not likely to occur .  let it go at that .  i won   t give you ammunition for your absurd claim that sixty two perfectly good robots be destroyed just because so far you lack the ability to detect nestor    among them .     susan calvin stared him down and let disgust fill her eyes .     you won   t let anything stand in the way of the permanent directorship  will you .        please     begged kallner  half in irritation .     do you insist that nothing further can be done  dr .  calvin .        i can   t think of anything  sir     she replied  wearily .     if there were only other differences between nestor    and the normal robots  differences that didn   t involve the first law .  even one other difference .  something in impressionment  environment  specification     and she stopped suddenly .     what is it .        i   ve thought of something .  .  .  i think     her eyes grew distant and hard     these modified nestors  peter .  they get the same impressioning the normal ones get  don   t they .        yes .  exactly the same .        and what was it you were saying  mr .  black     she turned to the young man  who through the storms that had followed his news had maintained a discreet silence .     once when complaining of the nestors    attitude of superiority  you said the technicians had taught them all they knew .        yes  in etheric physics .  they   re not acquainted with the subject when they come here .        that   s right     said bogert  in surprise .     i told you  susan  when i spoke to the other nestors here that the two new arrivals hadn   t learned etheric physics yet .        and why is that .     dr .  calvin was speaking in mounting excitement .     why aren   t ns   models impressioned with etheric physics to start with .        i can tell you that     said kallner .     it   s all of a piece with the secrecy .  we thought that if we made a special model with knowledge of etheric physics  used twelve of them and put the others to work in an unrelated field  there might be suspicion .  men working with normal nestors might wonder why they knew etheric physics .  so there was merely an impressionment with a capacity for training in the field .  only the ones that come here  naturally  receive such a training .  it   s that simple .        i understand .  please get out of here  the lot of you .  let me have an hour or so .      calvin felt she could not face the ordeal for a third time .  her mind had contemplated it and rejected it with an intensity that left her nauseated .  she could face that unending file of repetitious robots no more .  so bogert asked the question now  while she sat aside  eyes and mind half closed .  number fourteen came in    forty nine to go .  bogert looked up from the guide sheet and said     what is your number in line .        fourteen  sir .     the robot presented his numbered ticket .     sit down  boy .     bogert asked     you haven   t been here before on this day .        no  sir .        well  boy  we are going to have another man in danger of harm soon after we   re through here .  in fact  when you leave this room  you will be led to a stall where you will wait quietly  till you are needed .  do you understand .        yes  sir .        now  naturally  if a man is in danger of harm  you will try to save him .        naturally  sir .        unfortunately  between the man and yourself  there will be a gamma ray field .     silence .     do you know what gamma rays are .     asked bogert sharply .     energy radiation  sir .     the next question came in a friendly  offhand manner     ever work with gamma rays .        no  sir .     the answer was definite .     mm m .  well  boy  gamma rays will kill you instantly .  they   ll destroy your brain .  that is a fact you must know and remember .  naturally  you don   t want to destroy yourself .        naturally .     again the robot seemed shocked .  then  slowly     but  sir  if the gamma rays are between myself and the master that may be harmed  how can i save him .  i would be destroying myself to no purpose .        yes  there is that     bogert seemed concerned about the matter .     the only thing i can advise  boy  is that if you detect the gamma radiation between yourself and the man  you may as well sit where you are .     the robot was openly relieved .     thank you  sir .  there wouldn   t be any use  would there .        of course not .  but if there weren   t any dangerous radiation  that would be a different matter .        naturally  sir .  no question of that .        you may leave now .  the man on the other side of the door will lead you to your stall .  please wait there .     he turned to susan calvin when the robot left .     how did that go  susan .        very well     she said  dully .     do you think we could catch nestor    by quick questioning on etheric physics .        perhaps  but it   s not sure enough .     her hands lay loosely in her lap .     remember  he   s fighting us .  he   s on his guard .  the only way we can catch him is to outsmart him    and  within his limitations  he can think much more quickly than a human being .        well  just for fun    suppose i ask the robots from now on a few questions on gamma rays .  wave length limits  for instance .        no .     dr .  calvin   s eyes sparked to life .     it would be too easy for him to deny knowledge and then he   d be warned against the test that   s coming up    which is our real chance .  please follow the questions i   ve indicated  peter  and don   t improvise .  it   s just within the bounds of risk to ask them if they   ve ever worked with gamma rays .  and try to sound even less interested than you do when you ask it .     bogert shrugged  and pressed the buzzer that would allow the entrance of number fifteen .  the large radiation room was in readiness once more .  the robots waited patiently in their wooden cells  all open to the center but closed off from each other .  major general kallner mopped his brow slowly with a large handkerchief while dr .  calvin checked the last details with black .     you   re sure now     she demanded     that none of the robots have had a chance to talk with each other after leaving the orientation room .        absolutely sure     insisted black .     there   s not been a word exchanged .        and the robots are put in the proper stalls .        here   s the plan .     the psychologist looked at it thoughtfully     um m m .     the general peered over her shoulder .     what   s the idea of the arrangement  dr .  calvin .        i   ve asked to have those robots that appeared even slightly out of true in the previous tests concentrated on one side of the circle .  i   m going to be sitting in the center myself this time  and i wanted to watch those particularly .        you   re going to be sitting there      exclaimed bogert .     why not .     she demanded coldly .     what i expect to see may be something quite momentary .  i can   t risk having anyone else as main observer .  peter  you   ll be in the observing booth  and i want you to keep your eye on the opposite side of the circle .  general kallner  i   ve arranged for motion pictures to be taken of each robot  in case visual observation isn   t enough .  if these are required  the robots are to remain exactly where they are until the pictures are developed and studied .  none must leave  none must change place .  is that clear .        perfectly .        then let   s try it this one last time .      susan calvin sat in the chair  silent  eyes restless .  a weight dropped  crashed downward  then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam .  and a single robot jerked upright and took two steps .  and stopped .  but dr .  calvin was upright  and her finger pointed to him sharply .     nestor     come here     she cried     come here .  come here .     slowly  reluctantly  the robot took another step forward .  the psychologist shouted at the top of her voice  without taking her eyes from the robot     get every other robot out of this place  somebody .  get them out quickly  and keep them out .     somewhere within reach of her ears there was noise  and the thud of hard feet upon the floor .  she did not look away .  nestor       if it was nestor       took another step  and then  under force of her imperious gesture  two more .  he was only ten feet away  when he spoke harshly     i have been told to be lost     another stop .     i must not disobey .  they have not found me so far    he would think me a failure    he told me    but it   s not so    i am powerful and intelligent     the words came in spurts .  another step .     i know a good deal    he would think .  .  .  i mean i   ve been found    disgraceful    not i    i am intelligent    and by just a master .  .  .  who is weak    slow     another step    and one metal arm flew out suddenly to her shoulder  and she felt the weight bearing her down .  her throat constricted  and she felt a shriek tear through .  dimly  she heard nestor      s next words     no one must find me .  no master     and the cold metal was against her  and she was sinking under the weight of it .  and then a queer  metallic sound  and she was on the ground with an unfelt thump  and a gleaming arm was heavy across her body .  it did not move .  nor did nestor     who sprawled beside her .  and now faces were bending over her .  gerald black was gasping     are you hurt  dr .  calvin .     she shook her head feebly .  they pried the arm off her and lifted her gently to her feet     what happened .     black said     i bathed the place in gamma rays for five seconds .  we didn   t know what was happening .  it wasn   t till the last second that we realized he was attacking you  and then there was no time for anything but a gamma field .  he went down in an instant .  there wasn   t enough to harm you though .  don   t worry about it .        i   m not worried .     she closed her eyes and leaned for a moment upon his shoulder .     i don   t think i was attacked exactly .  nestor    was simply trying to do so .  what was left of the first law was still holding him back .      susan calvin and peter bogert  two weeks after their first meeting with major general kallner had their last .  work at hyper base had been resumed .  the trading ship with its sixty two normal ns     s was gone to wherever it was bound  with an officially imposed story to explain its two weeks    delay .  the government cruiser was making ready to carry the two roboticists back to earth .  kallner was once again a gleam in dress uniform .  his white gloves shone as he shook hands .  calvin said     the other modified nestors are  of course  to be destroyed .        they will be .  we   ll make shift with normal robots  or  if necessary  do without .        good .        but tell me    you haven   t explained    how was it done .     she smiled tightly     oh  that .  i would have told you in advance if i had been more certain of its working .  you see  nestor    had a superiority complex that was becoming more radical all the time .  he liked to think that he and other robots knew more than human beings .  it was becoming very important for him to think so .     we knew that .  so we warned every robot in advance that gamma rays would kill them  which it would  and we further warned them all that gamma rays would be between them and myself .  so they all stayed where they were  naturally .  by nestor      s own logic in the previous test they had all decided that there was no point in trying to save a human being if they were sure to die before they could do it .        well  yes  dr .  calvin  i understand that .  but why did nestor    himself leave his seat .        ah .  that was a little arrangement between myself and your young mr .  black .  you see it wasn   t gamma rays that flooded the area between myself and the robots    but infrared rays .  just ordinary heat rays  absolutely harmless .  nestor    knew they were infrared and harmless and so he began to dash out  as he expected the rest would do  under first law compulsion .  it was only a fraction of a second too late that he remembered that the normal ns     s could detect radiation  but could not identify the type .  that he himself could only identify wavelengths by virtue of the training he had received at hyper base  under mere human beings  was a little too humiliating to remember for just a moment .  to the normal robots the area was fatal because we had told them it would be  and only nestor    knew we were lying .     and just for a moment he forgot  or didn   t want to remember  that other robots might be more ignorant than human beings .  his very superiority caught him .  good by  general .      risk  hyper base had lived for this day .  spaced about the gallery of the viewing room  in order and precedence strictly dictated by protocol  was a group of officials  scientists  technicians and others who could only be lumped under the general classification of    personnel .     in accordance with their separate temperaments they waited hopefully  uneasily  breathlessly  eagerly  or fearfully for this culmination of their efforts .  the hollowed interior of the asteroid known as hyper base had become for this day the center of a sphere of iron security that extended out for ten thousand miles .  no ship might enter that sphere and live .  no message might leave without scrutiny .  a hundred miles away  more or less  a small asteroid moved neatly in the orbit into which it had been urged a year before  an orbit that ringed hyper base in as perfect a circle as could be managed .  the asteroidlet   s identity number was h     but no one on hyper base called it anything but it .      have you been out on it today .        the general   s on it  blowing his top     and eventually the impersonal pronoun achieved the dignity of capitalization .   on it  unoccupied now as zero second approached  was the parsec  the only ship of its kind ever built in the history of man .  it lay  unmanned  ready for its takeoff into the inconceivable .  gerald black  who  as one of the bright young men in etherics engineering  rated a front row view  cracked his large knuckles  then wiped his sweating palms on his stained white smock and said sourly     why don   t you bother the general  or her ladyship there .     nigel ronson  of interplanetary press  looked briefly across the gallery toward the glitter of major general richard kallner and the unremarkable woman at his side  scarcely visible in the glare of his dress uniform .  he said     i would .  except that i   m interested in news .     ronson was short and plump .  he painstakingly wore his hair in a quarter inch bristle  his shirt collar open and his trouser leg ankle short  in faithful imitation of the newsmen who were stock characters on tv shows .  he was a capable reporter nevertheless .  black was stocky  and his dark hairline left little room for forehead  but his mind was as keen as his strong fingers were blunt .  he said     they   ve got all the news .        nuts     said ronson .     kallner   s got no body under that gold braid .  strip him and you   ll find only a conveyer belt dribbling orders downward and shooting responsibility upward .     black found himself at the point of a grin but squeezed it down .  he said .     what about the madam doctor .        dr .  susan calvin of u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .     intoned the reporter .     the lady with hyperspace where her heart ought to be and liquid helium in her eyes .  she   d pass through the sun and come out the other end encased in frozen flame .     black came even closer to a grin .     how about director schloss  then .     ronson said glibly     he knows too much .  between spending his time fanning the feeble flicker of intelligence in his listener and dimming his own brains for fear of blinding said listener permanently by sheer force of brilliance  he ends up saying nothing .     black showed his teeth this time .     now suppose you tell me why you pick on me .        easy  doctor .  i looked at you and figured you   re too ugly to be stupid and too smart to miss a possible opportunity at some good personal publicity .        remind me to knock you down someday .     said black .     what do you want to know .     the man from interplanetary press pointed into the pit and said     is that thing going to work .     black looked downward too  and felt a vague chill riffle over him like the thin night wind of mars .  the pit was one large television screen  divided in two .  one half was an over all view of it .  on it   s pitted gray surface was the parse  glowing mutedly in the feeble sunlight .  the other half showed the control room of the parsec .  there was no life in that control room .  in the pilot   s seat was an object the vague humanity of which did not for a moment obscure the fact that it was only a positronic robot .  black said     physically  mister  this will work .  that robot will leave and come back .  space .  how we succeeded with that part of it .  i watched it all .  i came here two weeks after i took my degree in etheric physics and i   ve been here  barring leave and furloughs  ever since .  i was here when we sent the first piece of iron wire to jupiter   s orbit and back through hyperspace  and got back iron filings .  i was here when we sent white mice there and back and ended up with mincemeat .     we spent six months establishing an even hyperfield after that .  we had to wipe out lags of as little as tenths of thousandths of seconds from point to point in matter being subjected to hypertravel .  after that  the white mice started coming back intact .  i remember when we celebrated for a week because one white mouse came back alive and lived ten minutes before dying .  now they live as long as we can take proper care of them .     ronson said     great .     black looked at him obliquely .     i said  physically it will work .  those white mice that come back         well .        no minds .  not even little white mice type minds .  they won   t eat .  they have to be force fed .  they won   t mate .  they won   t run .  they sit .  they sit .  they sit .  that   s all .  we finally worked up to sending a chimpanzee .  it was pitiful .  it was too close to a man to make watching it bearable .  it came back a hunk of meat that could make crawling motions .  it could move its eyes and sometimes it would scrabble .  it whined and sat in its own wastes without the sense to move .  somebody shot it one day  and we were all grateful for that .  i tell you this  fella  nothing that ever went into hyperspace has come back with a mind .        is this for publication .         after this experiment  maybe .  they expect great things of it .     a comer of black   s mouth lifted .     you don   t .        with a robot at the controls .  no .     almost automatically black   s mind went back to that interlude  some years back  in which he had been unwittingly responsible for the near loss of a robot .  he thought of the nestor robots that filled hyper base with smooth  ingrained knowledge and perfectionist shortcomings .  mat was the use of talking about robots .  he was not  by nature  a missionary .  but then ronson  filling the continuing silence with a bit of small talk  said  as he replaced the wad of gum in his mouth with a fresh piece     don   t tell me you   re anti robot .  i   ve always heard that scientists are the one group that aren   t anti robot .     black   s patience snapped .  he said     that   s true  and that   s the trouble .  technology   s gone robot happy .  any job has to have a robot  or the engineer in charge feels cheated .  you want a doorstop  buy a robot with a thick foot .  that   s a serious thing .     he was speaking in a low  intense voice  shoving the words directly into ronson   s ear .  ronson managed to extricate his arm .  he said     hey  i   m no robot .  don   t take it out on me .  i   m a man .  homo sapiens .  you just broke an arm bone of mine .  isn   t that proof .     having started  however  it took more than frivolity to stop black .  he said     do you know how much time was wasted on this setup .  we   ve had a perfectly generalized robot built and we   ve given it one order .  period .  i heard the order given .  i   ve memorized it .  short and sweet .     seize the bar with a firm grip .  pull it toward you firmly .  firmly .  maintain your hold until the control board informs you that you have passed through hyperspace twice .        so at zero time  the robot will grab the control bar and pull it firmly toward himself .  his hands are heated to blood temperature .  once the control bar is in position  heat expansion completes contact and hyperfield is initiated .  if anything happens to his brain during the first trip through hyperspace  it doesn   t matter .  all he needs to do is maintain position one microinstant and the ship will come back and the hyperfield will flip off .  nothing can go wrong .  then we study all its generalized reactions and see what  if anything  has gone wrong .     ronson looked blank .     this all makes sense to me .        does it .     asked black bitterly .     and what will you learn from a robot brain .  it   s positronic  ours is cellular .  it   s metal  ours is protein .  they   re not the same .  there   s no comparison .  yet i   m convinced that on the basis of what they learn  or think they learn  from the robot  they   ll send men into hyperspace .  poor devils .  look  it   s not a question of dying .  it   s coming back mindless .  if you   d seen the chimpanzee  you   d know what i mean .  death is clean and final .  the other thing      the reporter said     have you talked about this to anyone .     black said     yes .  they say what you said .  they say i   m anti robot and that settles everything .    look at susan calvin there .  you can bet she isn   t anti robot .  she came all the way from earth to watch this experiment .  if it had been a man at the controls  she wouldn   t have bothered .  but what   s the use .        hey     said ronson     don   t stop now .  there   s more .        more what .        more problems .  you   ve explained the robot .  but why the security provisions all of a sudden .        huh .        come on .  suddenly i can   t send dispatches .  suddenly ships can   t come into the area .  what   s going on .  this is just another experiment .  the public knows about hyperspace and what you boys are trying to do  so what   s the big secret .     the backwash of anger was still seeping over black  anger against the robots  anger against susan calvin  anger at the memory of that little lost robot in his past .  there was some to spare  he found  for the irritating little newsman and his irritating little questions .  he said to himself  let   s see how he takes it .  he said     you really want to know .        you bet .        all right .  we   ve never initiated a hyperfield for any object a millionth as large as that ship  or to send anything a millionth as far .  that means that the hyperfield that will soon be initiated is some million million times as energetic as any we   ve ever handled .  we   re not sure what it can do .        what do you mean .        theory tells us that the ship will be neatly deposited out near sirius and neatly brought back here .  but how large a volume of space about the parsec will be carried with it .  it   s hard to tell .  we don   t know enough about hyperspace .  the asteroid on which the ship sits may go with it and  you know  if our calculations are even a little off  it may never be brought back here .  it may return  say  twenty billion miles away .  and there   s a chance that more of space than just the asteroid may be shifted .        how much more .     demanded ronson .     we can   t say .  there   s an element of statistical uncertainty .  that   s why no ships must approach too closely .  that   s why we   re keeping things quiet till the experiment is safely over .     ronson swallowed audibly .     supposing it reaches to hyper base .        there   s a chance of it     said black with composure .     not much of a chance or director schloss wouldn   t be here  i assure you .  still  there   s a mathematical chance .     the newsman looked at his watch .     when does this all happen .        in about five minutes .  you   re not nervous  are you .        no     said ronson  but he sat down blankly and asked no more questions .  black leaned outward over the railing .  the final minutes were ticking off .  the robot moved .  there was a mass sway of humanity forward at that sign of motion and the lights dimmed in order to sharpen and heighten the brightness of the scene below .  but so far it was only the first motion .  the hands of the robot approached the starting bar .  black waited for the final second when the robot would pull the bar toward himself .  black could imagine a number of possibilities  and all sprang nearly simultaneously to mind .  there would first be the short flicker that would indicate the departure through hyperspace and return .  even though the time interval was exceedingly short  return would not be to the precise starting position and there would be a flicker .  there always was .  then  when the ship returned  it might be found  perhaps  that the devices to even the field over the huge volume of the ship had proved inadequate .  the robot might be scrap steel .  the ship might be scrap steel .  or their calculations might be somewhat off and the ship might never return .  or worse still  hyper base might go with the ship and never return .  or  of course  all might be well .  the ship might flicker and be there in perfect shape .  the robot  with mind untouched  would get out of his seat and signal a successful completion of the first voyage of a man made object beyond the gravitational control of the sun .  the last minute was ticking off .  the last second came and the robot seized the starting bar and pulled it firmly toward himself   nothing .  no flicker .  nothing .  the parsec never left normal space .   major general kallner took off his officer   s cap to mop his glistening forehead and in doing so exposed a bald head that would have aged him ten years in appearance if his drawn expression had not already done so .  nearly an hour had passed since the parsec   s failure and nothing had been done .     how did it happen .  how did it happen .  i don   t understand it .     dr .  mayer schloss  who at forty was the    grand old man    of the young science of hyperfield matrices  said hopelessly     there is nothing wrong with the basic theory .  i   ll swear my life away on that .  there   s a mechanical failure on the ship somewhere .  nothing more .     he had said that a dozen times .     i thought everything was tested .     that had been said too .     it was  sir  it was .  just the same      and that .  they sat staring at each other in kallner   s office  which was now out of bounds for all personnel .  neither quite dared to look at the third person present .  susan calvin   s thin lips and pale cheeks bore no expression .  she said coolly     you may console yourself with what i have told you before .  it is doubtful whether anything useful would have resulted .        this is not the time for the old argument     groaned schloss .     i am not arguing .  u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation will supply robots made up to specification to any legal purchaser for any legal use .  we did our part  however .  we informed you that we could not guarantee being able to draw conclusions with regard to the human brain from anything that happened to the positronic brain .  our responsibility ends there .  there is no argument .        great space     said general kallner  in a tone that made the expletive feeble indeed .     let   s not discuss that .        what else was there to do .     muttered schloss  driven to the subject nevertheless .     until we know exactly what   s happening to the mind in hyperspace we can   t progress .  the robot   s mind is at least capable of mathematical analysis .  it   s a start  a beginning .  and until we try      he looked up wildly     but your robot isn   t the point  dr .  calvin .  we   re not worried about him or his positronic brain .  damn it  woman      his voice rose nearly to a scream .  the robopsychologist cut him to silence with a voice that scarcely raised itself from its level monotone .     no hysteria  man .  in my lifetime i have witnessed many crises and i have never seen one solved by hysteria .  i want answers to some questions .     schloss   s full lips trembled and his deep set eyes seemed to retreat into their sockets and leave pits of shadow in their places .  he said harshly     are you trained in etheric engineering .        that is an irrelevant question .  i am chief robopsychologist of the united states robots and mechanical men corporation .  that is a positronic robot sitting at the controls of the parsec .  like all such robots  it is leased and not sold .  i have a right to demand information concerning any experiment in which such a robot is involved .        talk to her  schloss     barked general kallner .     she   s  she   s all right .     dr .  calvin turned her pale eyes on the general  who had been present at the time of the affair of the lost robot and who therefore could be expected not to make the mistake of underestimating her .   schloss had been out on sick leave at the time  and hearsay is not as effective as personal experience .      thank you  general     she said .  schloss looked helplessly from one to the other and muttered     what do you want to know .        obviously my first question is  what is your problem if the robot is not .        but the problem is an obvious one .  the ship hasn   t moved .  can   t you see that .  are you blind .        i see quite well .  what i don   t see is your obvious panic over some mechanical failure .  don   t you people expect failure sometimes .     the general muttered     it   s the expense .  the ship was hellishly expensive .  the world congress  appropriations      he bogged down .     the ship   s still there .  a slight overhaul and correction would involve no great trouble .     schloss had taken hold of himself .  the expression on his face was one of a man who had caught his soul in both hands  shaken it hard and set it on its feet .  his voice had even achieved a kind of patience .     dr .  calvin  when i say a mechanical failure  i mean something like a relay jammed by a speck of dust  a connection inhibited by a spot of grease  a transistor balked by a momentary heat expansion .  a dozen other things .  a hundred other things .  any of them can be quite temporary .  they can stop taking effect at any moment .        which means that at any moment the parsec may flash through hyperspace and back after all .        exactly .  now do you understand .        not at all .  wouldn   t that be just what you want .     schloss made a motion that looked like the start of an effort to seize a double handful of hair and yank .  he said     you are not an etherics engineer .        does that tongue tie you  doctor .        we had the ship set     said schloss despairingly     to make a jump from a definite point in space relative to the center of gravity of the galaxy to another point .  the return was to be to the original point corrected for the motion of the solar system .  in the hour that has passed since the parsec should have moved  the solar system has shifted position .  the original parameters to which the hyperfield is adjusted no longer apply .  the ordinary laws of motion do not apply to hyperspace and it would take us a week of computation to calculate a new set of parameters .        you mean that if the ship moves now it will return to some unpredictable point thousands of miles away .        unpredictable .     schloss smiled hollowly .     yes  i should call it that .  the parsec might end up in the andromeda nebula or in the center of the sun .  in any case the odds are against our ever seeing it again .     susan calvin nodded .     the situation then is that if the ship disappears  as it may do at any moment  a few billion dollars of the taxpayers    money may be irretrievably gone  and  it will be said  through bungling .     major general kallner could not have winced more noticeably if he had been poked with a sharp pin in the fundament .  the robopsychologist went on     somehow  then  the ship   s hyperfield mechanism must be put out of action  and that as soon as possible .  something will have to be unplugged or jerked loose or flicked off .     she was speaking half to herself .     it   s not that simple     said schloss .     i can   t explain it completely  since you   re not an etherics expert .  it   s like trying to break an ordinary electric circuit by slicing through high tension wire with garden shears .  it could be disastrous .  it would be disastrous .        do you mean that any attempt to shut off the mechanism would hurl the ship into hyperspace .        any random attempt would probably do so .  hyper forces are not limited by the speed of light .  it is very probable that they have no limit of velocity at all .  it makes things extremely difficult .  the only reasonable solution is to discover the nature of the failure and learn from that a safe way of disconnecting the field .        and how do you propose to do that  dr .  schloss .     schloss said     it seems to me that the only thing to do is to send one of our nestor robots         no .  don   t be foolish     broke in susan calvin .  schloss said  freezingly     the nestors are acquainted with the problems of etherics engineering .  they will be ideally         out of the question .  you cannot use one of our positronic robots for such a purpose without my permission .  you do not have it and you shall not get it .        what is the alternative .        you must send one of your engineers .     schloss shook his head violently     impossible .  the risk involved is too great .  if we lose a ship and man         nevertheless  you may not use a nestor robot  or any robot .     the general said     i  i must get in touch with earth .  this whole problem has to go to a higher level .     susan calvin said with asperity     i wouldn   t just yet if i were you  general .  you will be throwing yourself on the government   s mercy without a suggestion or plan of action of your own .  you will not come out very well  i am certain .        but what is there to do .     the general was using his handkerchief again .     send a man .  there is no alternative .     schloss had paled to a pasty gray .     it   s easy to say  send a man .  but whom .        i   ve been considering that problem .  isn   t there a young man  his name is black  whom i met on the occasion of my previous visit to hyper base .        dr .  gerald black .        i think so .  yes .  he was a bachelor then .  is he still .        yes  i believe so .        i would suggest then that he be brought here  say  in fifteen minutes  and that meanwhile i have access to his records .     smoothly she had assumed authority in this situation  and neither kallner nor schloss made any attempt to dispute that authority with her .   black had seen susan calvin from a distance on this  her second visit to hyper base .  he had made no move to cut down the distance .  now that he had been called into her presence  he found himself staring at her with revulsion and distaste .  he scarcely noticed dr .  schloss and general kallner standing behind her .  he remembered the last time he had faced her thus  undergoing a cold dissection for the sake of a lost robot .  dr .  calvin   s cool gray eyes were fixed steadily on his hot brown ones .     dr .  black     she said     i believe you understand the situation .     black said     i do .        something will have to be done .  the ship is too expensive to lose .  the bad publicity will probably mean the end of the project .     black nodded .     i   ve been thinking that .        i hope you   ve also thought that it will be necessary for someone to board the parsec  find out what   s wrong  and  uh  deactivate it .     there was a moment   s pause .  black said harshly     what fool would go .     kallner frowned and looked at schloss  who bit his lip and looked nowhere .  susan calvin said     there is  of course  the possibility of accidental activation of the hyperfield  in which case the ship may drive beyond all possible reach .  on the other hand  it may return somewhere within the solar system .  if so  no expense or effort will be spared to recover man and ship .     black said     idiot and ship .  just a correction .     susan calvin disregarded the comment .  she said     i have asked general kallner   s permission to put it to you .  it is you who must go .     no pause at all here .  black said  in the flattest possible way     lady  i   m not volunteering .        there are not a dozen men on hyper base with sufficient knowledge to have any chance at all of carrying this thing through successfully .  of those who have the knowledge  i   ve selected you on the basis of our previous acquaintanceship .  you will bring to this task an understanding         look  i   m not volunteering .        you have no choice .  surely you will face your responsibility .        my responsibility .  what makes it mine .        the fact that you are best fitted for the job .        do you know the risk .        i think i do     said susan calvin .     i know you don   t .  you never saw that chimpanzee .  look  when i said    idiot and ship    i wasn   t expressing an opinion .  i was telling you a fact .  i   d risk my life if i had to .  not with pleasure  maybe  but i   d risk it .  risking idiocy  a lifetime of animal mindlessness  is something i won   t risk  that   s all .     susan calvin glanced thoughtfully at the young engineer   s sweating  angry face .  black shouted     send one of your robots  one of your ns   jobs .     the psychologist   s eye reflected a kind of cold glitter .  she said with deliberation     yes  dr .  schloss suggested that .  but the ns   robots are leased by our firm  not sold .  they cost millions of dollars apiece  you know .  i represent the company and i have decided that they are too expensive to be risked in a matter such as this .     black lifted his hands .  they clenched and trembled close to his chest as though he were forcibly restraining them .     you   re telling me  you   re saying you want me to go instead of a robot because i   m more expendable .        it comes to that  yes .        dr .  calvin     said black     i   d see you in hell first .        that statement might be almost literally true  dr .  black .  as general kallner will confirm  you are ordered to take this assignment .  you are under quasi military law here  i understand  and if you refuse an assignment  you can be court martialed .  a case like this will mean mercury prison and i believe that will be close enough to hell to make your statement uncomfortably accurate were i to visit you  though i probably would not .  on the other hand  if you agree to board the parsec and carry through this job  it will mean a great deal for your career .     black glared  red eyed  at her .  susan calvin said     give the man five minutes to think about this  general kallner  and get a ship ready .     two security guards escorted black out of the room .   gerald black felt cold .  his limbs moved as though they were not part of him .  it was as though he were watching himself from some remote  safe place  watching himself board a ship and make ready to leave for it and for the parsec .  he couldn   t quite believe it .  he had bowed his head suddenly and said     i   ll go .     but why .  he had never thought of himself as the hero type .  then why .  partly  of course  there was the threat of mercury prison .  partly it was the awful reluctance to appear a coward in the eyes of those who knew him  that deeper cowardice that was behind half the bravery in the world .  mostly  though  it was something else .  ronson of interplanetary press had stopped black momentarily as he was on his way to the ship .  black looked at ronson   s bushed face and said .     what do you want .     ronson babbled .     listen .  when you get back  i want it exclusive .  i   ll arrange any payment you want  anything you want      black pushed him aside  sent him sprawling  and walked on .  the ship had a crew of two .  neither spoke to him .  their glances slid over and under and around him .  black didn   t mind that .  they were scared spitless themselves and their ship was approaching the parsec like a kitten skittering sideways toward the first dog it had ever seen .  he could do without them .  there was only one face that he kept seeing .  the anxious expression of general kallner and the look of synthetic determination on schloss   s face were momentary punctures on his consciousness .  they healed almost at once .  it was susan calvin   s unruffled face that he saw .  her calm expressionlessness as he boarded the ship .  he stared into the blackness where hyper base had already disappeared into space   susan calvin .  doctor susan calvin .  robopsychologist susan calvin .  the robot that walks like a woman .  what were her three laws  he wondered .  first law  thou shalt protect the robot with all thy might and all thy heart and all thy soul .  second law  thou shalt hold the interests of u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation holy provided it interfereth not with the first law .  third law  thou shalt give passing consideration to a human being provided it interfereth not with the first and second laws .  had she ever been young  he wondered savagely .  had she ever felt one honest emotion .  space .  how he wanted to do something  something that would take that frozen look of nothing off her face .  and he would .  by the stars  he would .  let him but get out of this sane and he would see her smashed and her company with her and all the vile brood of robots with them .  it was that thought that was driving him more than fear of prison or desire for social prestige .  it was that thought that almost robbed him of fear altogether .  almost .  one of the pilots muttered at him  without looking     you can drop down from here .  it   s half a mile under .     black said bitterly     aren   t you landing .        strict orders not to .  the vibration of the landing might         what about the vibration of my landing .     the pilot said     i   ve got my orders .     black said no more but climbed into his suit and waited for the inner lock to open .  a tool kit was welded firmly to the metal of the suit about his right thigh .  just as he stepped into the lock  the earpieces inside his helmet rumbled at him .     wish you luck  doctor .     it took a moment for him to realize that it came from the two men aboard ship  pausing in their eagerness to get out of that haunted volume of space to give him that much  anyway .     thanks     said black awkwardly  half resentfully .  and then he was out in space  tumbling slowly as the result of the slightly off center thrust of feet against outer lock .  he could see the parsec waiting for him  and by looking between his legs at the right moment of the tumble he could see the long hiss of the lateral jets of the ship that had brought him  as it turned to leave .  he was alone .  space  he was alone .  could any man in history ever have felt so alone .  would he know  he wondered sickly  if  if anything happened .  would there be any moments of realization .  would he feel his mind fade and the light of reason and thought dim and blank out .  or would it happen suddenly  like the cut of a force knife .  in either case the thought of the chimpanzee  blank eyed  shivering with mindless terrors  was fresh within him .   the asteroid was twenty feet below him now .  it swam through space with an absolutely even motion .  barring human agency  no grain of sand upon it had as much as stirred through astronomical periods of time .  in the ultimate jarlessness of it  some small particle of grit encumbered a delicate working unit on board the parsec  or a speck of impure sludge in the fine oil that bathed some moving part had stopped it .  perhaps it required only a small vibration  a tiny tremor originating from the collision of mass and mass to unencumber that moving part  bringing it down along its appointed path  creating the hyperfield  blossoming it outward like an incredibly ripening rose .  his body was going to touch it and he drew his limbs together in his anxiety to    hit easy .     he did not want to touch the asteroid .  his skin crawled with intense aversion .  it came closer .  now  now    nothing .  there was only the continuing touch of the asteroid  the uncanny moments of slowly mounting pressure that resulted from a mass of     pounds  himself plus suit  possessing full inertia but no weight to speak of .  black opened his eyes slowly and let the sight of stars enter .  the sun was a glowing marble  its brilliance muted by the polarizing shield over his faceplate .  the stars were correspondingly feeble but they made up the familiar arrangement .  with sun and constellations normal  he was still in the solar system .  he could even see hyper base  a small  dim crescent .  he stiffened in shock at the sudden voice in his ear .  it was schloss .  schloss said     we   ve got you in view  dr .  black .  you are not alone .     black could have laughed at the phraseology  but he only said in a low  clear voice     clear off .  if you   ll do that  you won   t be distracting me .     a pause .  schloss   s voice  more cajoling     if you care to report as you go along  it may relieve the tension .        you   ll get information from me when i get back .  not before .     he said it bitterly  and bitterly his metal encased fingers moved to the control panel in his chest and blanked out the suit   s radio .  they could talk into a vacuum now .  he had his own plans .  if he got out of this sane  it would be his show .  he got to his feet with infinite caution and stood on it .  he swayed a bit as involuntary muscular motions  tricked by the almost total lack of gravity into an endless series of overbalancings  pulled him this way and that .  on hyper base there was a pseudo gravitic field to hold them down .  black found that a portion of his mind was sufficiently detached to remember that and appreciate it in absentia .  the sun had disappeared behind a crag .  the stars wheeled visibly in time to the asteroid   s one hour rotation period .  he could see the parsec from where he stood and now he moved toward it slowly  carefully  tippy toe almost .   no vibration .  no vibration .  the words ran pleadingly through his mind .   before he was completely aware of the distance he had crossed  he was at the ship .  he was at the foot of the line of hand grips that led to the outer lock .  there he paused .  the ship looked quite normal .  or at least it looked normal except for the circle of steely knobs that girdled it one third of the way up  and a second circle two thirds of the way up .  at the moment  they must be straining to become the source poles of the hyperfield .  a strange desire to reach up and fondle one of them came over black .  it was one of those irrational impulses  like the momentary thought     what if i jumped .     that is almost inevitable when one stares down from a high building .  black took a deep breath and felt himself go clammy as he spread the fingers of both hands and then lightly  so lightly  put each hand flat against the side of the ship .   nothing .  he seized the lowest hand grip and pulled himself up  carefully .  he longed to be as experienced at null gravity manipulation as were the construction men .  you had to exert enough force to overcome inertia and then stop .  continue the pull a second too long and you would overbalance  careen into the side of the ship .  he climbed slowly  tippy fingers  his legs and hips swaying to the right as his left arm reached upward  to the left as his right arm reached upward .  a dozen rungs  and his fingers hovered over the contact that would open the outer lock .  the safety marker was a tiny green smear .  once again he hesitated .  this was the first use he would make of the ship   s power .  his mind ran over the wiring diagrams and the force distributions .  if he pressed the contact  power would be siphoned off the micropile to pull open the massive slab of metal that was the outer lock .  well .  what was the use .  unless he had some idea as to what was wrong  there was no way of telling the effect of the power diversion .  he sighed and touched contact .  smoothly  with neither jar nor sound  a segment of the ship curled open .  black took one more look at the friendly constellations  they had not changed  and stepped into the softly illuminated cavity .  the outer lock closed behind him .  another contact now .  the inner lock had to be opened .  again he paused to consider .  air pressure within the ship would drop ever so slightly as the inner lock opened  and seconds would pass before the ship   s electrolyzers could make up the loss .  well .  the bosch posterior plate  to name one item  was sensitive to pressure  but surely not this sensitive .  he sighed again  more softly  the skin of his fear was growing calloused  and touched the contact .  the inner lock opened .  he stepped into the pilot room of the parsec  and his heart jumped oddly when the first thing he saw was the visiplate  set for reception and powdered with stars .  he forced himself to look at them .   nothing .  cassiopeia was visible .  the constellations were normal and he was inside the parsec .  somehow he could feel the worst was over .  having come so far and remained within the solar system  having kept his mind so far  he felt something that was faintly like confidence begin to seep back .  there was an almost supernatural stillness about the parsec .  black had been in many ships in his life and there had always been the sounds of life  even if only the scuffing of a shoe or a cabin boy humming in the corridor .  here the very beating of his own heart seemed muffled to soundlessness .  the robot in the pilot   s seat had its back to him .  it indicated by no response that it was aware of his having entered .  black bared his teeth in a savage grin and said sharply     release the bar .  stand up .     the sound of his voice was thunderous in the close quarters .  too late he dreaded the air vibrations his voice set up  but the stars on the visiplate remained unchanged .  the robot  of course  did not stir .  it could receive no sensations of any sort .  it could not even respond to the first law .  it was frozen in the unending middle of what should have been almost instantaneous process .  he remembered the orders it had been given .  they were open to no misunderstanding     seize the bar with a firm grip .  pull it toward you firmly .  firmly .  maintain your hold until the control board informs you that you have passed through hyperspace twice .     well  it had not yet passed through hyperspace once .  carefully  he moved closer to the robot .  it sat there with the bar pulled firmly back between its knees .  that brought the trigger mechanism almost into place .  the temperature of his metal hands then curled that trigger  thermocouple fashion  just sufficiently for contact to be made .  automatically black glanced at the thermometer reading set into the control board .  the robot   s hands were at    centigrade  as they should be .  he thought sardonically  fine thing .  i   m alone with this machine and i can   t do anything about it .  what he would have liked to do was take a crowbar to it and smash it to filings .  he enjoyed the flavor of that thought .  he could see the horror on susan calvin   s face  if any horror could creep through the ice  the horror of a smashed robot was it  .  like all positronic robots  this one shot was owned by u .  s .  robots  had been made there  had been tested there .  and having extracted what juice he could out of imaginary revenge  he sobered and looked about the ship .  after all  progress so far had been zero .   slowly  he removed his suit .  gently  he laid it on the rack .  gingerly  he walked from room to room  studying the large interlocking surfaces of the hyperatomic motor  following the cables  inspecting the field relays .  he touched nothing .  there were a dozen ways of deactivating the hyperfield  but each one would be ruinous unless he knew at least approximately where the error lay and let his exact course of procedure be guided by that .  he found himself back at the control panel and cried in exasperation at the grave stolidity of the robot   s broad back     tell me  will you .  what   s wrong .     there was the urge to attack the ship   s machinery at random .  tear at it and get it over with .  he repressed the impulse firmly .  if it took him a week  he would deduce  somehow  the proper point of attack .  he owed that much to dr .  susan calvin and his plans for her .  he turned slowly on his heel and considered .  every part of the ship  from the engine itself to each individual two way toggle switch .  had been exhaustively checked and tested on hyper base .  it was almost impossible to believe that anything could go wrong .  there wasn   t a thing on board ship well  yes  there was  of course .  the robot .  that had been tested at u .  s .  robots and they  blast their devils    hides  could be assumed to be competent .  what was it everyone always said  a robot can just naturally do a better job .  it was the normal assumption  based in part on u .  s .  robots    own advertising campaigns .  they could make a robot that would be better than a man for a given purpose .  not    as good as a man .     but    better than a man .     and as gerald black stared at the robot and thought that  his brows contracted under his low forehead and his look became compounded of astonishment and a wild hope .  he approached and circled the robot .  he stared at its arms holding the control bar in trigger position  holding it forever so  unless the ship jumped or the robot   s own power supply gave out .  black breathed .     i bet .  i bet .     he stepped away  considered deeply  he said .     it   s got to be .     he turned on ship   s radio .  its carrier beam was already focused on hyper base .  he barked into the mouthpiece .     hey  schloss .     schloss was prompt in his answer .     great space .  black         never mind     said black crisply .     no speeches .  i just want to make sure you   re watching .        yes  of course .  we all are .  look      but black turned off the radio .  he grinned with tight one sidedness at the tv camera inside the pilot room and chose a portion of the hyperfield mechanism that would be in view .  he didn   t know how many people would be in the viewing room .  there might be only kallner  schloss and susan calvin .  there might be all personnel .  in any case  he would give them something to watch .  relay box     was adequate for the purpose  he decided .  it was located in a wall recess  coated over with a smooth cold seamed panel .  black reached into his tool kit and removed the splayed  blunt edged seamer .  he pushed his space suit farther back on the rack  having turned it to bring the tool kit in reach  and turned to the relay box .  ignoring a last tingle of uneasiness  black brought up the seamer  made contact at three separated points along the cold seam .  the tool   s force field worked deftly and quickly  the handle growing a trifle warm in his hand as the surge of energy came and left .  the panel swung free .  he glanced quickly  almost involuntarily  at the ship   s visiplate .  the stars were normal .  he  himself  felt normal .  that was the last bit of encouragement he needed .  he raised his foot and smashed his shoe down on the feather delicate mechanism within the recess .  there was a splinter of glass  a twisting of metal  and a tiny spray of mercury droplets black breathed heavily .  he turned on the radio once more .     still there  schloss .        yes  but         then i report the hyperfield on board the parsec to be deactivated .  come and get me .      gerald black felt no more the hero than when he had left for the parsec  but he found himself one just the same .  the men who had brought him to the small asteroid came to take him off .  they landed this time .  they clapped his back .  hyper base was a crowded mass of waiting personnel when the ship arrived  and black was cheered .  he waved at the throng and grinned  as was a hero   s obligation  but he felt no triumph inside .  not yet .  only anticipation .  triumph would come later  when he met susan calvin .  he paused before descending from the ship .  he looked for her and did not see her .  general kallner was there  waiting  with all his soldierly stiffness restored and a bluff look of approval firmly plastered on his face .  mayer schloss smiled nervously at him .  ronson of interplanetary press waved frantically .  susan calvin was nowhere .  he brushed kallner and schloss aside when he landed .     i   m going to wash and eat first .     he had no doubts but that  for the moment at least  he could dictate terms to the general or to anybody .  the security guards made a way for him .  he bathed and ate leisurely in enforced isolation  he himself being solely responsible for the enforcement .  then he called ronson of interplanetary and talked to him briefly .  he waited for the return call before he felt he could relax thoroughly .  it had all worked out so much better than he had expected .  the very failure of the ship had conspired perfectly with him .  finally he called the general   s office and ordered a conference .  it was what it amounted to  orders .  major general kallner all but said     yes  sir .      they were together again .  gerald black  kallner  schloss  even susan calvin .  but it was black who was dominant now .  the robopsychologist  graven faced as ever  as unimpressed by triumph as by disaster  had nevertheless seemed by some subtle change of attitude to have relinquished the spotlight .  dr .  schloss nibbled a thumbnail and began by saying  cautiously     dr .  black  we are all very grateful for your bravery and success .     then  as though to institute a healthy deflation at once  he added     still  smashing the relay box with your heel was imprudent and  well  it was an action that scarcely deserved success .     black said     it was an action that could scarcely have avoided success .  you see     this was bomb number one     by that time i knew what had gone wrong .     schloss rose to his feet .     you did .  are you sure .        go there yourself .  it   s safe now .  i   ll tell you what to look for .     schloss sat down again  slowly .  general kallner was enthusiastic .     why  this is the best yet  if true .        it   s true     said black .  his eyes slid to susan calvin  who said nothing .  black was enjoying the sensation of power .  he released bomb number two by saying     it was the robot  of course .  did you hear that  dr .  calvin .     susan calvin spoke for the first time .     i hear it .  i rather expected it  as a matter of fact .  it was the only piece of equipment on board ship that had not been tested at hyper base .     for a moment black felt dashed .  he said     you said nothing of that .     dr .  calvin said     as dr .  schloss said several times  i am not an etherics expert .  my guess  and it was no more than that  might easily have been wrong .  i felt i had no right to prejudice you in advance of your mission .     black said     all right  did you happen to guess how it went wrong .        no  sir .        why  it was made better than a man .  that   s what the trouble was .  isn   t it strange that the trouble should rest with the very specialty of u .  s .  robots .  they make robots better than men  i understand .     he was slashing at her with words now but she did not rise to his bait .  instead  she sighed .     my dear dr .  black .  i am not responsible for the slogans of our sales promotion department .     black felt dashed again .  she wasn   t an easy woman to handle  this calvin .  he said     your people built a robot to replace a man at the controls of the parsec .  he had to pull the control bar toward himself  place it in position and let the heat of his hands twist the trigger to make final contact .  simple enough  dr .  calvin .        simple enough  dr .  black .         and if the robot had been made no better than a man  he would have succeeded .  unfortunately  u .  s .  robots felt compelled to make it better than a man .  the robot was told to pull back the control bar firmly .  firmly .  the word was repeated  strengthened  emphasized .  so the robot did what it was told .  it pulled it back firmly .  there was only one trouble .  he was easily ten times stronger than the ordinary human being for whom the control bar was designed .         are you implying         i   m saying the bar bent .  it bent back just enough to misplace the trigger .  when the heat of the robot   s hand twisted the thermocouple    it did not make contact .     he grinned .     this isn   t the failure of just one robot  dr .  calvin .  it   s symbolic of the failure of the robot idea .        come now  dr .  black     said susan calvin icily     you   re drowning logic in missionary psychology .  the robot was equipped with adequate understanding as well as with brute force .  had the men who gave it its orders used quantitative terms rather than the foolish adverb    firmly     this would not have happened .  had they said     apply a pull of fifty five pounds     all would have been well .        what you are saying     said black     is that the inadequacy of a robot must be made up for by the ingenuity and intelligence of a man .  i assure you that the people back on earth will look at it in that way and will not be in the mood to excuse u .  s .  robots for this fiasco .     major general kallner said quickly  with a return of authority to his voice     now wait  black  all that has happened is obviously classified information .        in fact     said schloss suddenly     your theory hasn   t been checked yet .  we   ll send a party to the ship and find out .  it may not be the robot at all .        you   ll take care to make that discovery  will you .  i wonder if the people will believe an interested party .  besides which  i have one more thing to tell you .     he readied bomb number three and said     as of this moment  i   m resigning from this man   s project .  i   m quitting .        why .     asked susan calvin .     because  as you said  dr .  calvin  i am a missionary     said black  smiling .     i have a mission .  i feel i owe it to the people of earth to tell them that the age of the robots has reached the point where human life is valued less than robot life .  it is now possible to order a man into danger because a robot is too precious to risk .  i believe earthmen should hear that .  many men have many reservations about robots as is .  u .  s .  robots has not yet succeeded in making it legally permissible to use robots on the planet earth itself .  i believe what i have to say  dr .  calvin  will complete the matter .  for this day   s work  dr .  calvin  you and your company and your robots will be wiped off the face of the solar system .     he was forewarning her  black knew  he was forearming her  but he could not forego this scene .  he had lived for this very moment ever since he had first left for the parsec  and he could not give it up .  he all but gloated at the momentary glitter in susan calvin   s pale eyes and at the faintest flush in her cheeks .  he thought  how do you feel now  madam scientist .  kallner said     you will not be permitted to resign  black  nor will you be permitted         how can you stop me  general .  i   m a hero  haven   t you heard .  and old mother earth will make much of its heroes .  it always has .  they   ll want to hear from me and they   ll believe anything i say .  and they won   t like it if i   m interfered with  at least not while i   m a fresh  brand new hero .  i   ve already talked to ronson of interplanetary press and told him i had something big for them  something that would rock every government official and science director right out of the chair plush  so interplanetary will be first in line  waiting to hear from me .  so what can you do except to have me shot .  and i think you   d be worse off after that if you tried it .     black   s revenge was complete .  he had spared no word .  he had hampered himself not in the least .  he rose to go .      one moment  dr .  black     said susan calvin .  her low voice carried authority .  black turned involuntarily  like a schoolboy at his teacher   s voice  but he counteracted that gesture by a deliberately mocking     you have an explanation to make  i suppose .        not at all     she said primly .     you have explained for me  and quite well .  i chose you because i knew you would understand  though i thought you would understand sooner .  i had had contact with you before .  i knew you disliked robots and would  therefore  be under no illusions concerning them .  from your records  which i asked to see before you were given your assignment  i saw that you had expressed disapproval of this robot through hyperspace experiment .  your superiors held that against you  but i thought it a point in your favor .        what are you talking about  doctor  if you   ll excuse my rudeness .        the fact that you should have understood why no robot could have been sent on this mission .  what was it you yourself said .  something about a robot   s inadequacies having to be balanced by the ingenuity and intelligence of a man .  exactly so  young man  exactly so .  robots have no ingenuity .  their minds are finite and can be calculated to the last decimal .  that  in fact  is my job .     now if a robot is given an order  a precise order  he can follow it .  if the order is not precise  he cannot correct his own mistake without further orders .  isn   t that what you reported concerning the robot on the ship .  how then can we send a robot to find a flaw in a mechanism when we cannot possibly give precise orders  since we know nothing about the flaw ourselves .     find out what   s wrong    is not an order you can give to a robot  only to a man .  the human brain  so far at least  is beyond calculation .     black sat down abruptly and stared at the psychologist in dismay .  her words struck sharply on a substratum of understanding that had been larded over with emotion .  he found himself unable to refute her .  worse than that  a feeling of defeat encompassed him .  he said     you might have said this before i left .        i might have     agreed dr .  calvin     but i noticed your very natural fear for your sanity .  such an overwhelming concern would easily have hampered your efficiency as an investigator  and it occurred to me to let you think that my only motive in sending you was that i valued a robot more .  that  i thought  would make you angry  and anger  my dear dr .  black  is sometimes a very useful emotion .  at least  an angry man is never quite as afraid as he would be otherwise .  it worked out nicely  i think .     she folded her hands loosely in her lap and came as near a smile as she ever had in her life .  black said     i   ll be damned .     susan calvin said     so now  if you   ll take my advice  return to your job  accept your status as hero  and tell your reporter friend the details of your brave deed .  let that be the big news you promised him .     slowly  reluctantly  black nodded .  schloss looked relieved  kallner burst into a toothy smile .  they held out hands  not having said a word in all the time that susan calvin had spoken  and not saying a word now .  black took their hands and shook them with some reserve .  he said     it   s your part that should be publicized  dr .  calvin .     susan calvin said icily     don   t be a fool  young man .  this is my job .      escape .   when susan calvin returned from hyper base  alfred tanning was waiting for her .  the old man never spoke about his age  but everyone knew it to be over seventy five .  yet his mind was keen  and if he had finally allowed himself to be made director emeritus of research with bogert as acting director  it did not prevent him from appearing in his office daily .     how close are they to the hyperatomic drive .     he asked .     i don   t know     she replied irritably     i didn   t ask .        hmm .  i wish they   d hurry .  because if they don   t  consolidated might beat them to it  and beat us to it as well .        consolidated .  what have they got to do with it .        well  we   re not the only ones with calculating machines .  ours may be positronic  but that doesn   t mean they   re better .  robertson is calling a big meeting about it tomorrow .  he   s been waiting for you to come back .      robertson of u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation  son of the founder  pointed his lean nose at his general manager and his adam   s apple jumped as he said     you start now .  let   s get this straight .     the general manager did so with alacrity     here   s the deal now  chief .  consolidated robots approached us a month ago with a funny sort of proposition .  they brought about five tons of figures  equations  all that sort of stuff .  it was a problem  see  and they wanted an answer from the brain .  the terms were as follows     he ticked them off on thick fingers     a hundred thousand for us if there is no solution and we can tell them the missing factors .  two hundred thousand if there is a solution  plus costs of construction of the machine involved  plus quarter interest in all profits derived therefrom .  the problem concerns the development of an interstellar engine     robertson frowned and his lean figure stiffened     despite the fact that they have a thinking machine of their own .  right .        exactly what makes the whole proposition a foul ball  chief .  levver  take it from there .     abe levver looked up from the far end of the conference table and smoothed his stubbled chin with a faint rasping sound .  he smiled     it   s this way  sir .  consolidated had a thinking machine .  it   s broken .        what .     robertson half rose .     that   s right .  broken .  it   s kaput .  nobody knows why  but i got hold of some pretty interesting guesses    like  for instance  that they asked it to give them an interstellar engine with the same set of information they came to us with  and that it cracked their machine wide open .  it   s scrap    just scrap now .        you get it  chief .     the general manager was wildly jubilant .     you get it .  there isn   t any industrial research group of any size that isn   t trying to develop a space warp engine  and consolidated and u .  s .  robots have the lead on the field with our super robot brains .  now that they   ve managed to foul theirs up  we have a clear field .  that   s the nub  the .  .  .  uh .  .  .  motivation .  it will take them six years at least to build another and they   re sunk  unless they can break ours  too  with the same problem .     the president of u .  s .  robots bulged his eyes     why  the dirty rats        hold on  chief .  there   s more to this .     he pointed a finger with a wide sweep     lanning  take it .     dr .  alfred lanning viewed the proceedings with faint scorn    his usual reaction to the doings of the vastly better paid business and sales divisions .  his unbelievable gray eyebrows hunched low and his voice was dry     from a scientific standpoint the situation  while not entirely clear  is subject to intelligent analysis .  the question of interstellar travel under present conditions of physical theory is .  .  .  uh .  .  .  vague .  the matter is wide open    and the information given by consolidated to its thinking machine  assuming these we have to be the same  was similarly wide open .  our mathematical department has given it a thorough analysis  and it seems consolidated has included everything .  its material for submission contains all known developments of franciacci   s space warp theory  and  apparently  all pertinent astrophysical and electronic data .  it   s quite a mouthful .     robertson followed anxiously .  he interrupted     too much for the brain to handle .     lanning shook his head decisively     no .  there are no known limits to the brain   s capacity .  it   s a different matter .  it   s a question of the robotic laws .  the brain  for instance  could never supply a solution to a problem set to it if that solution  would involve the death or injury of humans .  as far as it would be concerned  a problem with only such a solution would be insoluble .  if such a problem is combined with an extremely urgent demand that it be answered  it is just possible that the brain  only a robot after all  would be presented with a dilemma  where it could neither answer nor refuse to answer .  something of the sort must have happened to consolidated   s machine .     he paused  but the general manager urged on     go ahead  dr .  tanning .  explain it the way you explained it to me .     lanning set his lips and raised his eyebrows in the direction of dr .  susan calvin who lifted her eyes from her precisely folded hands for the first time .  her voice was low and colorless .     the nature of a robot reaction to a dilemma is startling     she began .     robot psychology is far from perfect    as a specialist  i can assure you of that but it can be discussed in qualitative terms  because with all the complications introduced into a robot   s positronic brain  it is built by humans and is therefore built according to human values .     now a human caught in an impossibility often responds by a retreat from reality  by entry into a world of delusion  or by taking to drink  going off into hysteria  or jumping off a bridge .  it all comes to the same thing    a refusal or inability to face the situation squarely .  and so  the robot  a dilemma at its mildest will disorder half its relays  and at its worst it will burn out every positronic brain path past repair .        i see     said robertson  who didn   t .     now what about this information consolidated   s wishing on us .        it undoubtedly involves     said dr .  calvin     a problem of a forbidden sort .  but the brain is considerably different from consolidated   s robot .        that   s right  chief .  that   s right .     the general manager was energetically interruptive .     i want you to get this  because it   s the whole point of the situation .     susan calvin   s eyes glittered behind the spectacles  and she continued patiently     you see  sir  consolidated   s machines  their super thinker among them  are built without personality .  they go in for functionalism  you know    they have to  without u .  s .  robot   s basic patents for the emotional brain paths .  their thinker is merely a calculating machine on a grand scale  and a dilemma ruins it instantly .     however  the brain  our own machine  has a personality    a child   s personality .  it is a supremely deductive brain  but it resembles an idiot savant .  it doesn   t really understand what it does    it just does it .  and because it is really a child  it is more resilient .  life isn   t so serious  you might say .     the robopsychologist continued     here is what we   re going to do .  we have divided all of consolidated   s information into logical units .  we are going to feed the units to the brain singly and cautiously .  when the factor enters    the one that creates the dilemma    the brain   s child personality will hesitate .  its sense of judgment is not mature .  there will be a perceptible interval before it will recognize a dilemma as such .  and in that interval  it will reject the unit automatically    before its brainpaths can be set in motion and ruined .     robertson   s adam   s apple squirmed     are you sure  now .     dr .  calvin masked impatience     it doesn   t make much sense  i admit  in lay language  but there is no conceivable use in presenting the mathematics of this .  i assure you  it is as i say .     the general manager was in the breach instantly and fluently     so here   s the situation  chief .  if we take the deal  we can put it through like this .  the brain will tell us which unit of information involves the dilemma .  from there  we can figure why the dilemma .  isn   t that right  dr .  bogert .  there you are  chief  and dr .  bogert is the best mathematician you   ll find anywhere .  we give consolidated a    no solution    answer  with the reason  and collect a hundred thousand .  they   re left with a broken machine  we   re left with a whole one .  in a year  two maybe  we   ll have a space warp engine or a hyper atomic motor some people call it .  whatever you name it  it will be the biggest thing in the world .     robertson chuckled and reached out     let   s see the contract .  i   ll sign it .      when susan calvin entered the fantastically guarded vault that held the brain  one of the current shift of technicians had just asked it     if one and a half chickens lay one and a half eggs in one and a half days  how many eggs will nine chickens lay in nine days .     the brain had just answered     fifty four .     and the technician had just said to another     see  you dope .     dr .  calvin coughed and there was a sudden impossible flurry of directionless energy .  the psychologist motioned briefly  and she was alone with the brain .  the brain was a two foot globe merely    one which contained within it a thoroughly conditioned helium atmosphere  a volume of space completely vibration absent and radiation free    and within that was that unheard of complexity of positronic brain paths that was the brain .  the rest of the room was crowded with the attachments that were the intermediaries between the brain and the outside world    its voice  its arms  its sense organs .  dr .  calvin said softly     how are you  brain .     the brain   s voice was high pitched and enthusiastic     swell  miss susan .  you   re going to ask me something .  i can tell .  you always have a book in your hand when you   re going to ask me something .     dr .  calvin smiled mildly     well  you   re right  but not just yet .  this is going to be a question .  it will be so complicated we   re going to give it to you in writing .  but not just yet  i think i   ll talk to you first .        all right .  i don   t mind talking .        now  brain  in a little while  dr .  lanning and dr .  bogert will be here with this complicated question .  we   ll give it to you a very little at a time and very slowly  because we want you to be careful .  we   re going to ask you to build something  if you can  out of the information  but i   m going to warn you now that the solution might involve .  .  .  uh .  .  .  damage to human beings .        gosh .     the exclamation was hushed  drawn out .     now you watch for that .  when we come to a sheet which means damage  even maybe death  don   t get excited .  you see  brain  in this case  we don   t mind    not even about death  we don   t mind at all .  so when you come to that sheet  just stop  give it back    and that   ll be all .  you understand .        oh  sure .  by golly  the death of humans .  oh  my .        now  brain  i hear dr .  lanning and dr .  bogert coming .  they   ll tell you what the problem is all about and then we   ll start .  be a good boy  now     slowly the sheets were fed in .  after each one came the interval of the queerly whispery chuckling noise that was the brain in action .  then the silence that meant readiness for another sheet .  it was a matter of hours    during which the equivalent of something like seventeen fat volumes of mathematical physics were fed into the brain .  as the process went on  frowns appeared and deepened .  lanning muttered ferociously under his breath .  bogert first gazed speculatively at his fingernails  and then bit at them in abstracted fashion .  it was when the last of the thick pile of sheets disappeared that calvin  white faced  said     something   s wrong .     lanning barely got the words out     it can   t be .  is it    dead .        brain .     susan calvin was trembling .     do you hear me  brain .        huh .     came the abstracted rejoinder .     do you want me .        the solution        oh  that .  i can do it .  i   ll build you a whole ship  just as easy    if you let me have the robots .  a nice ship  it   ll take two months maybe .        there was    no difficulty .        it took long to figure     said the brain .  dr .  calvin backed away .  the color had not returned to her thin cheeks .  she motioned the others away .   in her office  she said     i can   t understand it .  the information  as given  must involve a dilemma    probably involves death .  if something has gone wrong     bogert said quietly     the machine talks and makes sense .  it can   t be a dilemma .     but the psychologist replied urgently     there are dilemmas and dilemmas .  there are different forms of escape .  suppose the brain is only mildly caught  just badly enough  say  to be suffering from the delusion that he can solve the problem  when he can   t .  or suppose it   s teetering on the brink of something really bad  so that any small push shoves it over .        suppose     said lanning     there is no dilemma .  suppose consolidated   s machine broke down over a different question  or broke down for purely mechanical reasons .        but even so     insisted calvin     we couldn   t take chances .  listen  from now on  no one is to as much as breathe to the brain .  i   m taking over .        all right     sighed lanning     take over  then .  and meanwhile we   ll let the brain build its ship .  and if it does build it  we   ll have to test it .     he was ruminating     we   ll need our top field men for that .      michael donovan brushed down his red hair with a violent motion of his hand and a total indifference to the fact that the unruly mass sprang to attention again immediately .  he said     call the turn now  greg .  they say the ship is finished .  they don   t know what it is  but it   s finished .  let   s go  greg .  let   s grab the controls right now .     powell said wearily     cut it  mike .  there   s a peculiar overripe flavor to your humor at its freshest  and the confined atmosphere here isn   t helping it .        well  listen     donovan took another ineffectual swipe at his hair     i   m not worried so much about our cast iron genius and his tin ship .  there   s the matter of my lost leave .  and the monotony .  there   s nothing here but whiskers and figures    the wrong kind of figures .  oh  why do they give us these jobs .        because     replied powell  gently     we   re no loss  if they lose us .  o . k .   relax .     doc lanning   s coming this way .     lanning was coming  his gray eyebrows as lavish as ever  his aged figure unbent as yet and full of life .  he walked silently up the ramp with the two men and out into the open field  where  obeying no human master  silent robots were building a ship .  wrong tense .  had built a ship .  for lanning said     the robots have stopped .  not one has moved today .        it   s completed then .  definitely .     asked powell .     now how can i tell .     lanning was peevish  and his eyebrows curled down in an eye hiding frown .     it seems done .  there are no spare pieces about  and the interior is down to a gleaming finish .        you   ve been inside .        just in  then out .  i   m no space pilot .  either of you two know much about engine theory .     donovan looked at powell  who looked at donovan .  donovan said     i   ve got my license  sir  but at last reading it didn   t say anything about hyper engines or warp navigation .  just the usual child   s play in three dimensions .     alfred lanning looked up with sharp disapproval and snorted the length of his prominent nose .  he said frigidly     well  we have our engine men .     powell caught at his elbow as he walked away     sir  is the ship still restricted ground .     the old director hesitated  then rubbed the bridge of his nose     i suppose not .  for you two anyway .     donovan looked after him as he left and muttered a short  expressive phrase at his back .  he turned to powell     i   d like to give him a literary description of himself  greg .        suppose you come along  mike .     the inside of the ship was finished  as finished as a ship ever was  that could be told in a single eye blinking glance .  no martinet in the system could have put as much spit and polish into a surface as those robots had .  the walls were of a gleaming silvery finish that retained no fingerprints .  there were no angles  walls  floors  and ceiling faded gently into each other and in the cold  metallic glittering of the hidden lights  one was surrounded by six chilly reflections of one   s bewildered self .  the main corridor was a narrow tunnel that led in a hard  clatter footed stretch along a line of rooms of no interdistinguishing features .  powell said     i suppose furniture is built into the wall .  or maybe we   re not supposed to sit or sleep .     it was in the last room  the one nearest the nose  that the monotony broke .  a curving window of non reflecting glass was the first break in the universal metal  and below it was a single large dial  with a single motionless needle hard against the zero mark .  donovan said     look at that .     and pointed to the single word on the finely marked scale .  it said     parsecs    and the tiny figure at the right end of the curving  graduated meter said              .     there were two chairs  heavy  wide flaring  uncushioned .  powell seated himself gingerly  and found it molded to the body   s curves  and comfortable .  powell said     what do you think of it .        for my money  the brain has brain fever .  let   s get out .        sure you don   t want to look it over a bit .        i have looked it over .  i came  i saw  i   m through .     donovan   s red hair bristled into separate wires     greg  let   s get out of here .  i quit my job five seconds ago  and this is a restricted area for non personnel .     powell smiled in an oily self satisfied manner and smoothed his mustache     o . k .   mike  turn off that adrenalin tap you   ve got draining into your bloodstream .  i was worried  too  but no more .        no more  huh .  how come  no more .  increased your insurance .        mike  this ship can   t fly .        how do you know .        well  we   ve been through the entire ship  haven   t we .        seems so .        take my word for it  we have .  did you see any pilot room except for this one port and the one gauge here in parsecs .  did you see any controls .        no .        and did you see any engines .        holy joe  no .        well  then .  let   s break the news to lanning  mike .     they cursed their way through the featureless corridors and finally hit and missed their way into the short passage to the air lock .  donovan stiffened     did you lock this thing  greg .        no  i never touched it .  yank the lever  will you .     the lever never budged  though donovan   s face twisted appallingly with exertion .  powell said     i didn   t see any emergency exits .  if something   s gone wrong here  they   ll have to melt us out .        yes  and we   ve got to wait until they find out that some fool has locked us in here     added donovan  frantically .     let   s get back to the room with the port .  it   s the only place from which we might attract attention .     but they didn   t .  in that last room  the port was no longer blue and full of sky .  it was black  and hard yellow pin point stars spelled space .  there was a dull  double thud  as two bodies collapsed separately into two chairs .       alfred lanning met dr .  calvin just outside his office .  he lit a nervous cigar and motioned her in .  he said     well  susan  we   ve come pretty far  and robertson   s getting jumpy .  what are you doing with the brain .     susan calvin spread her hands     it   s no use getting impatient .  the brain is worth more than anything we forfeit on this deal .        but you   ve been questioning it for two months .     the psychologist   s voice was flat  but somehow dangerous     you would rather run this yourself .        now you know what i meant .        oh  i suppose i do     dr .  calvin rubbed her hands nervously .     it isn   t easy .  i   ve been pampering it and probing it gently  and i haven   t gotten anywhere yet .  its    reactions aren   t normal .  its answers    they   re queer  somehow .  but nothing i can put my finger on yet .  and you see  until we know what   s wrong  we must just tiptoe our way through .  i can never tell what simple question or remark will just .  .  .  push him over .  .  .  and then    well  and then we   ll have on our hands a completely useless brain .  do you want to face that .        well  it can   t break the first law .        i would have thought so  but        you   re not even sure of that .     lanning was profoundly shocked .     oh  i can   t be sure of anything  alfred     the alarm system raised its fearful clangor with a horrifying suddenness .  lanning clicked on communications with an almost paralytic spasm .  the breathless words froze him .  he said     susan .  .  .  you heard that .  .  .  the ship   s gone .  i sent those two field men inside half an hour ago .  you   ll have to see the brain again .      susan calvin said with enforced calm     brain  what happened to the ship .     the brain said happily     the ship i built  miss susan .        that   s right .  what has happened to it .        why  nothing at all .  the two men that were supposed to test it were inside  and we were all set .  so i sent it off .        oh    well  that   s nice .     the psychologist felt some difficulty in breathing .     do you think they   ll be all right .        right as anything  miss susan .  i   ve taken care of it all .  it   s a bee yootiful ship .        yes  brain  it is beautiful  but you think they have enough food  don   t you .  they   ll be comfortable .        plenty of food .        this business might be a shock to them  brain .  unexpected  you know .     the brain tossed it off     they   ll be all right .  it ought to be interesting for them .        interesting .  how .        just interesting     said the brain  slyly .     susan     whispered lanning in a fuming whisper     ask him if death comes into it .  ask him what the dangers are .     susan calvin   s expression contorted with fury     keep quiet .     in a shaken voice  she said to the brain     we can communicate with the ship  can   t we brain .        oh  they can hear you if you call by radio .  i   ve taken care of that .        thanks .  that   s all for now .     once outside  lanning lashed out ragingly     great galaxy  susan  if this gets out  it will ruin all of us .  we   ve got to get those men back .  why didn   t you ask it if there was danger of death    straight out .        because     said calvin  with a weary frustration     that   s just what i can   t mention .  if it   s got a case of dilemma  it   s about death .  anything that would bring it up badly might knock it completely out .  will we be better off then .  now  look  it said we could communicate with them .  let   s do so  get their location  and bring them back .  they probably can   t use the controls themselves  the brain is probably handling them remotely .  come .      it was quite a while before powell shook himself together .     mike     he said  out of cold lips     did you feel an acceleration .     donovan   s eyes were blank     huh .  no .  .  .  no .     and then the redhead   s fists clenched and he was out of his seat with sudden frenzied energy and up against the cold  wide curving glass .  there was nothing to see    but stars .  he turned     greg  they must have started the machine while we were inside .  greg  it   s a put up job  they fixed it up with the robot to jerry us into being the try out boys  in case we were thinking of backing out .     powell said     what are you talking about .  what   s the good of sending us out if we don   t know how to run the machine .  how are we supposed to bring it back .  no  this ship left by itself  and without any apparent acceleration .     he rose  and walked the floor slowly .  the metal walls dinned back the clangor of his steps .  he said tonelessly     mike  this is the most confusing situation we   ve ever been up against .        that     said donovan  bitterly     is news to me .  i was just beginning to have a very swell time  when you told me .     powell ignored that .     no acceleration    which means the ship works on a principle different from any known .        different from any we know  anyway .        different from any known .  there are no engines within reach of manual control .  maybe they   re built into the walls .  maybe that   s why they   re thick as they are .        what are you mumbling about .     demanded donovan .     why not listen .  i   m saying that whatever powers this ship is enclosed  and evidently not meant to be handled .  the ship is running by remote control .        the brain   s control .        why not .        then you think we   ll stay out here till the brain brings us back .        it could be .  if so  let   s wait quietly .  the brain is a robot .  it   s got to follow the first law .  it can   t hurt a human being .     donovan sat down slowly     you figure that .     carefully  he flattened his hair     listen  this junk about the space warp knocked out consolidated   s robot  and the longhairs said it was because interstellar travel killed humans .  which robot are you going to trust .  ours had the same data  i understand .     powell was yanking madly at his mustache     don   t pretend you don   t know your robotics  mike .  before it   s physically possible in any way for a robot to even make a start to breaking the first law  so many things have to break down that it would be a ruined mess of scrap ten times over .  there   s some simple explanation to this .        oh sure  sure .  just have the butler call me in the morning .  it   s all just too  too simple for me to bother about before my beauty nap .        well  jupiter  mike  what are you complaining about so far .  the brain is taking care of us .  this place is warm .  it   s got light .  it   s got air .  there wasn   t even enough of an acceleration jar to muss your hair if it were smooth enough to be mussable in the first place .        yeah .  greg  you must   ve taken lessons .  no one could put pollyanna that far out of the running without .  what do we eat .  what do we drink .  where are we .  how do we get back .  and in case of accident  to what exit and in what spacesuit do we run  not walk .  i haven   t even seen a bathroom in the place  or those little conveniences that go along with bathrooms .  sure  we   re being taken care of    but good .     the voice that interrupted donovan   s tirade was not powell   s .  it was nobody   s .  it was there  hanging in open air    stentorian and petrifying in its effects .     gregory powell .  michael donovan .  gregory powell .  michael donovan .  please report your present positions .  if your ship answers controls  please return to base .  gregory powell .  michael donovan .       the message was repetitious  mechanical  broken by regular  untiring intervals .  donovan said     where   s it coming from .        i don   t know .     powell   s voice was an intense whisper     where do the lights come from .  where does anything come from .        well  how are we going to answer .     they had to speak in the intervals between the loudly echoing  repeating message .  the walls were bare    as bare and as unbroken as smooth  curving metal can be .  powell said     shout an answer .     they did .  they shouted  in turns  and together     position unknown .  ship out of control .  condition desperate .     their voices rose and cracked .  the short businesslike sentences became interlarded and adulterated with screaming and emphatic profanity  but the cold  calling voice repeated and repeated and repeated unwearyingly .     they don   t hear us     gasped donovan .     there   s no sending mechanism .  just a receiver .     his eyes focused blindly at a random spot on the wall .  slowly the din of the outside voice softened and receded .  they called again when it was a whisper  and they called again  hoarsely  when there was silence .  something like fifteen minutes later  powell said lifelessly     let   s go through the ship again .  there must be something to eat somewheres .     he did not sound hopeful .  it was almost an admission of defeat .  they divided in the corridor to the right and left .  they could follow one another by the hard footsteps resounding  and they met occasionally in the corridor  where they would glare at each other and pass on .  powell   s search ended suddenly and as it did  he heard donovan   s glad voice rise boomingly .     hey  greg     it howled     the ship has got plumbing .  how did we miss it .     it was some five minutes later that he found powell by hit and miss .  he was saying     still no shower baths  though     but it got choked off in the middle .     food     he gasped .  the wall had dropped away  leaving a curved gap with two shelves .  the upper shelf was loaded with unlabeled cans of a bewildering variety of sizes and shapes .  the enameled cans on the lower shelf were uniform and donovan felt a cold draft about his ankles .  the lower half was refrigerated .     how .  .  .  how        it wasn   t there  before     said powell  curtly .     that wall section dropped out of sight as i came in the door .     he was eating .  the can was the preheating type with enclosed spoon and the warm odor of baked beans filled the room .     grab a can  mike .     donovan hesitated     what   s the menu .        how do i know .  are you finicky .        no  but all i eat on ships are beans .  something else would be first choice .     his hand hovered and selected a shining elliptical can whose flatness seemed reminiscent of salmon or similar delicacy .  it opened at the proper pressure .     beans .     howled donovan  and reached for another .  powell hauled at the slack of his pants .     better eat that  sonny boy .  supplies are limited and we may be here a long  long time .     donovan drew back sulkily     is that all we have .  beans .        could be .        what   s on the lower shelf .        milk .        just milk .     donovan cried in outrage .     looks it .     the meal of beans and milk was carried through in silence  and as they left  the strip of hidden wall rose up and formed an unbroken surface once more .  powell sighed     everything automatic .  everything just so .  never felt so helpless in my life .  where   s your plumbing .        right there .  and that wasn   t among those present when we first looked  either .     fifteen minutes later they were back in the glassed in room  staring at each other from opposing seats .  powell looked gloomily at the one gauge in the room .  it still said    parsecs     the figures still ended in                 and the indicating needle was still pressed hard against the zero mark .   in the innermost offices of the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corp .  alfred lanning was saying wearily     they won   t answer .  we   ve tried every wavelength  public  private  coded  straight  even this subether stuff they have now .  and the brain still won   t say anything .     he shot this at dr .  calvin .     it won   t amplify on the matter  alfred     she said  emphatically .     it says they can hear us .  .  .  and when i try to press it  it becomes .  .  .  well  it becomes sullen .  and it   s not supposed to    whoever heard of a sullen robot .        suppose you tell us what you have  susan     said bogert .     here it is .  it admits it controls the ship itself entirely .  it is definitely optimistic about their safety  but without details .  i don   t dare press it .  however  the center of disturbance seems to be about the interstellar jump itself .  the brain definitely laughed when i brought up the subject .  there are other indications  but that is the closest it   s come to an open abnormality .     she looked at the others     i refer to hysteria .  i dropped the subject immediately  and i hope i did no harm  but it gave me a lead .  i can handle hysteria .  give me twelve hours .  if i can bring it back to normal  it will bring back the ship .     bogert seemed suddenly stricken .     the interstellar jump .        what   s the matter .     the cry was double from calvin and lanning .     the figures for the engine the brain gave us .  say .  .  .  i just thought of something .     he left hurriedly .  lanning gazed after him .  he said brusquely to calvin     you take care of your end  susan .      two hours later  bogert was talking eagerly     i tell you  lanning  that   s it .  the interstellar jump is not instantaneous not as long as the speed of light is finite .  life can   t exist .  .  .  matter and energy as such can   t exist in the space warp .  i don   t know what it would be like    but that   s it .  that   s what killed consolidated   s robot .      donovan felt as haggard as he looked .     only five days .        only five days .  i   m sure of it .     donovan looked about him wretchedly .  the stars through the glass were familiar but infinitely indifferent .  the walls were cold to the touch  the lights  which had recently flared up again  were unfeelingly bright  the needle on the gauge pointed stubbornly to zero  and donovan could not get rid of the taste of beans .  he said  morosely     i need a bath .     powell looked up briefly  and said     so do i .  you needn   t feel self conscious .  but unless you want to bathe in milk and do without drinking       we   ll do without drinking eventually  anyway .  greg  where does this interstellar travel come in .        you tell me .  maybe we just keep on going .  we   d get there  eventually .  at least the dust of our skeletons would    but isn   t our death the whole point of the brain   s original breakdown .     donovan spoke with his back to the other     greg  i   ve been thinking .  it   s pretty bad .  there   s not much to do    except walk around or talk to yourself .  you know those stories about guys marooned in space .  they go nuts long before they starve .  i don   t know  greg  but ever since the lights went on  i feel funny .     there was a silence  then powell   s voice came thin and small     so do i .  what   s it like .     the redheaded figure turned     feel funny inside .  there   s a pounding in me with everything tense .  it   s hard to breathe .  i can   t stand still .        um m m .  do you feel vibration .        how do you mean .        sit down for a minute and listen .  you don   t hear it  but you feel it    as if something   s throbbing somewheres and it   s throbbing the whole ship  and you  too  along with it .  listen        yeah  .   .   .  yeah .  what do you think it is  greg .  you don   t suppose it   s us .        it might be .     powell stroked his mustache slowly .     but it might be the ship   s engines .  it might be getting ready .        for what .        for the interstellar jump .  it may be coming and the devil knows what it   s like .     donovan pondered .  then he said  savagely     if it does  let it .  but i wish we could fight .  it   s humiliating to have to wait for it .     an hour later  perhaps  powell looked at his hand on the metal chair arm and said with frozen calm     feel the wall  mike .     donovan did  and said     you can feel it shake  greg .     even the stars seemed blurred .  from somewhere came the vague impression of a huge machine gathering power with the walls  storing up energy for a mighty leap  throbbing its way up the scales of strength .  it came with a suddenness and a stab of pain .  powell stiffened  and half jerked from his chair .  his sight caught donovan and blanked out while donovan   s thin shout whimpered and died in his ears .  something writhed within him and struggled against a growing blanket of ice  that thickened .  something broke loose and whirled in a blaze of flickering light and pain .  it fell    and whirled and fell headlong into silence .  it was death .  it was a world of no motion and no sensation .  a world of dim  unsensing consciousness  a consciousness of darkness and of silence and of formless struggle .  most of all a consciousness of eternity .  he was a tiny white thread of ego    cold and afraid .  then the words came  unctuous and sonorous  thundering over him in a foam of sound     does your coffin fit differently lately .  why not try morbid m .  cadaver   s extensible caskets .  they are scientifically designed to fit the natural curves of the body  and are enriched with vitamin b  .  use cadaver   s caskets for comfort .  remember   you   re   going   to   be   dead   a   long   long   time .     it wasn   t quite sound  but whatever it was  it died away in an oily rumbling whisper .  the white thread that might have been powell heaved uselessly at the insubstantial eons of time that existed all about him    and collapsed upon itself as the piercing shriek of a hundred million ghosts of a hundred million soprano voices rose to a crescendo of melody      i   ll be glad when you   re dead  you rascal  you .     i   ll be glad when you   re dead  you rascal  you .     i   ll be glad      it rose up a spiral stairway of violent sound into the keening supersonics that passed hearing  and then beyond   the white thread quivered with a pulsating pang .  it strained quietly  the voices were ordinary    and many .  it was a crowd speaking  a swirling mob that swept through and past and over him with a rapid  headlong motion  that left drifting tatters of words behind them .     what did they getcha for  boy .  y   look banged up          a hot fire  i guess  but i got a case          i   ve made paradise  but old st .  pete        naaah  i got a pull with the boy .  had dealings with him        hey  sam  come this way        ja get a mouthpiece .  beelzebub says          going on  my good imp .  my appointment is with sa     and above it all the original stentorian roar  that plunged across all     hurry .  hurry .  hurry .  .  .  stir your bones  and don   t keep us waiting    there are many more in line .  have your certificates ready  and make sure peter   s release is stamped across it .  see if you are at the proper entrance gate .  there will be plenty of fire for all .  hey  you    you down there .  take your place in line or     the white thread that was powell groveled backward before the advancing shout  and felt the sharp stab of the pointing finger .  it all exploded into a rainbow of sound that dripped its fragments onto an aching brain .  powell was in the chair  again .  he felt himself shaking .  donovan   s eyes were opening into two large popping bowls of glazed blue .     greg     he whispered in what was almost a sob .     were you dead .        i .  .  .  felt dead .     he did not recognize his own croak .  donovan was obviously making a bad failure of his attempt to stand up     are we alive now .  or is there more .        i .  .  .  feel alive .     it was the same hoarseness .  powell said cautiously     did you .  .  .  hear anything  when .  .  .  when you were dead .     donovan paused  and then very slowly nodded his head     did you .        yes .  did you hear about coffins .  .  .  and females singing .  .  .  and the lines forming to get into hell .  did you .     donovan shook his head     just one voice .        loud .        no .  soft  but rough like a file over the fingertips .  it was a sermon  you know .  about hell fire .  he described the tortures of .  .  .  well  you know .  i once heard a sermon like that    almost .     he was perspiring .   they were conscious of sunlight through the port .  it was weak  but it was blue white    and the gleaming pea that was the distant source of light was not old sol .  and powell pointed a trembling finger at the single gauge .  the needle stood stiff and proud at the hairline whose figure read         parsecs .  powell said     mike if it   s true  we must be out of the galaxy altogether .     donovan said     blazed greg .  we   d be the first men out of the solar system .        yes .  that   s just it .  we   ve escaped the sun .  we   ve escaped the galaxy .  mike  this ship is the answer .  it means freedom for all humanity    freedom to spread through to every star that exists    millions and billions and trillions of them .     and then he came down with a hard thud     but how do we get back  mike .     donovan smiled shakily     oh  that   s all right .  the ship brought us here .  the ship will take us back .  me for more beans .        but mike .  .  .  hold on  mike .  if it takes us back the way it brought us here     donovan stopped halfway up and sat back heavily into the chair .  powell went on     we   ll have to .  .  .  die again  mike       well     sighed donovan     if we have to  we have to .  at least it isn   t permanent  not very permanent .      susan calvin was speaking slowly now .  for six hours she had been slowly prodding the brain    for six fruitless hours .  she was weary of repetitions  weary of circumlocutions  weary of everything .     now  brain  there   s just one more thing .  you must make a special effort to answer simply .  have you been entirely clear about the interstellar jump .  i mean does it take them very far .        as far as they want to go  miss susan .  golly  it isn   t any trick through the warp .        and on the other side  what will they see .        stars and stuff .  what do you suppose .     the next question slipped out     they   ll be alive  then .        sure .        and the interstellar jump won   t hurt them .     she froze as the brain maintained silence .  that was it .  she had touched the sore spot .     brain     she supplicated faintly     brain  do you hear me .     the answer was weak  quivering .  the brain said     do i have to answer .  about the jump  i mean .        not if you don   t want to .  but it would be interesting    i mean if you wanted to .     susan calvin tried to be bright about it .     aw w w .  you spoil everything .     and the psychologist jumped up suddenly  with a look of flaming insight on her face .     oh  my     she gasped .     oh  my .     and she felt the tension of hours and days released in a burst .  it was later that she told lanning     i tell you it   s all right .  no  you must leave me alone  now .  the ship will be back safely  with the men  and i want to rest .  i will rest .  now go away .      the ship returned to earth as silently  as unjarringly as it had left .  it dropped precisely into place and the main lock gaped open .  the two men who walked out felt their way carefully and scratched their rough and scrubbily stubbled chins .  and then  slowly and purposefully  the one with red hair knelt down and planted upon the concrete of the runway a firm  loud kiss .  they waved aside the crowd that was gathering and made gestures of denial at the eager couple that had piled out of the down swooping ambulance with a stretcher between them .  gregory powell said     where   s the nearest shower .     they were led away .  they were gathered  all of them  about a table .  it was a full staff meeting of the brains of u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corp .   slowly and climactically  powell and donovan finished a graphic and resounding story .  susan calvin broke the silence that followed .  in the few days that had elapsed she had recovered her icy  somewhat acid  calm    but still a trace of embarrassment broke through .     strictly speaking     she said     this was my fault    all of it .  when we first presented this problem to the brain  as i hope some of you remember  i went to great lengths to impress upon it the importance of rejecting any item of information capable of creating a dilemma .  in doing so i said something like    don   t get excited about the death of humans .  we don   t mind it at all .  just give the sheet back and forget it .           hm m m     said lanning .     what follows .        the obvious .  when that item entered its calculations which yielded the equation controlling the length of minimum interval for the interstellar jump    it meant death for humans .  that   s where consolidated   s machine broke down completely .  but i had depressed the importance of death to the brain    not entirely  for the first law can never be broken    but just sufficiently so that the brain could take a second look at the equation .  sufficiently to give it time to realize that after the interval was passed through  the men would return to life    just as the matter and energy of the ship itself would return to being .  this so called    death     in other words  was a strictly temporary phenomenon .  you see .     she looked about her .  they were all listening .  she went on     so he accepted the item  but not without a certain jar .  even with death temporary and its importance depressed  it was enough to unbalance him very gently .     she brought it out calmly     he developed a sense of humor    it   s an escape  you see  a method of partial escape from reality .  he became a practical joker .     powell and donovan were on their feet .     what .     cried powell .  donovan was considerably more colorful about it .     it   s so     said calvin .     he took care of you  and kept you safe  but you couldn   t handle any controls  because they weren   t for you    just for the humorous brain .  we could reach you by radio  but you couldn   t answer .  you had plenty of food  but all of it beans and milk .  then you died  so to speak  and were reborn  but the period of your death was made .  .  .  well .  .  .  interesting .  i wish i knew how he did it .  it was the brain   s prize joke  but he meant no harm .        no harm .     gasped donovan .     oh  if that cute little tyke only had a neck .     lanning raised a quieting hand     all right  it   s been a mess  but it   s all over .  what now .        well     said bogert  quietly     obviously it   s up to us to improve the space warp engine .  there must be some way of getting around that interval of jump .  if there is  we   re the only organization left with a grand scale super robot  so we   re bound to find it if anyone can .  and then    u .  s .  robots has interstellar travel  and humanity has the opportunity for galactic empire .        what about consolidated .     said lanning .     hey     interrupted donovan suddenly     i want to make a suggestion there .  they landed u .  s .  robots into quite a mess .  it wasn   t as bad a mess as they expected and it turned out well  but their intentions weren   t pious .  and greg and i bore the most of it .     well  they wanted an answer  and they   ve got one .  send them that ship  guaranteed  and u .  s .  robots can collect their two hundred thou plus construction costs .  and if they test it    then suppose we let the brain have just a little more fun before it   s brought back to normal .     lanning said gravely     it sounds just and proper to me .     to which bogert added absently     strictly according to contract  too .      evidence  francis quinn was a politician of the new school .  that  of course  is a meaningless expression  as are all expressions of the sort .  most of the    new schools    we have were duplicated in the social life of ancient greece  and perhaps  if we knew more about it  in the social life of ancient sumeria and in the lake dwellings of prehistoric switzerland as well .  but  to get out from under what promises to be a dull and complicated beginning  it might be best to state hastily that quinn neither ran for office nor canvassed for votes  made no speeches and stuffed no ballot boxes .  any more than napoleon pulled a trigger at austerlitz .  and since politics makes strange bedfellows  alfred lanning sat at the other side of the desk with his ferocious white eyebrows bent far forward over eyes in which chronic impatience had sharpened to acuity .  he was not pleased .  the fact  if known to quinn  would have annoyed him not the least .  his voice was friendly  perhaps professionally so .     i assume you know stephen byerley  dr .  lanning .        i have heard of him .  so have many people .        yes  so have i .  perhaps you intend voting for him at the next election .        i couldn   t say .     there was an unmistakable trace of acidity here .     i have not followed the political currents  so i   m not aware that he is running for office .        he may be our next mayor .  of course  he is only a lawyer now  but great oaks        yes     interrupted lanning     i have heard the phrase before .  but i wonder if we can get to the business at hand .        we are at the business at hand  dr .  lanning .     quinn   s tone was very gentle     it is to my interest to keep mr .  byerley a district attorney at the very most  and it is to your interest to help me do so .        to my interest .  come .     lanning   s eyebrows hunched low .     well  say then to the interest of the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation .  i come to you as director emeritus of research  because i know that your connection to them is that of  shall we say     elder statesman .     you are listened to with respect and yet your connection with them is no longer so tight but that you cannot possess considerable freedom of action  even if the action is somewhat unorthodox .     dr .  lanning was silent a moment  chewing the cud of his thoughts .  he said more softly     i don   t follow you at all  mr .  quinn .        i am not surprised  dr .  lanning .  but it   s all rather simple .  do you mind .     quinn lit a slender cigarette with a lighter of tasteful simplicity and his big boned face settled into an expression of quiet amusement .     we have spoken of mr .  byerley    a strange and colorful character .  he was unknown three years ago .  he is very well known now .  he is a man of force and ability  and certainly the most capable and intelligent prosecutor i have ever known .  unfortunately he is not a friend of mine       i understand     said lanning  mechanically .  he stared at his fingernails .     i have had occasion     continued quinn  evenly     in the past year to investigate mr .  byerley    quite exhaustively .  it is always useful  you see  to subject the past life of reform politicians to rather inquisitive research .  if you knew how often it helped     he paused to smile humorlessly at the glowing tip of his cigarette .     but mr .  byerley   s past is unremarkable .  a quiet life in a small town  a college education  a wife who died young  an auto accident with a slow recovery  law school  coming to the metropolis  an attorney .     francis quinn shook his head slowly  then added     but his present life .  ah  that is remarkable .  our district attorney never eats .     lanning   s head snapped up  old eyes surprisingly sharp     pardon me .        our district attorney never eats .     the repetition thumped by syllables .     i   ll modify that slightly .  he has never been seen to eat or drink .  never .  do you understand the significance of the word .  not rarely  but never .        i find that quite incredible .  can you trust your investigators .        i can trust my investigators  and i don   t find it incredible at all .  further  our district attorney has never been seen to drink    in the aqueous sense as well as the alcoholic    nor to sleep .  there are other factors  but i should think i have made my point .      lanning leaned back in his seat  and there was the rapt silence of challenge and response between them  and then the old roboticist shook his head .     no .  there is only one thing you can be trying to imply  if i couple your statements with the fact that you present them to me  and that is impossible .        but the man is quite inhuman  dr .  lanning .        if you told me he were satan in masquerade  there would be a faint chance that i might believe you .        i tell you he is a robot  dr .  lanning .        i tell you it is as impossible a conception as i have ever heard  mr .  quinn .     again the combative silence .     nevertheless     and quinn stubbed out his cigarette with elaborate care     you will have to investigate this impossibility with all the resources of the corporation .        i   m sure that i could undertake no such thing  mr .  quinn .  you don   t seriously suggest that the corporation take part in local politics .        you have no choice .  supposing i were to make my facts public without proof .  the evidence is circumstantial enough .        suit yourself in that respect .        but it would not suit me .  proof would be much preferable .  and it would not suit you  for the publicity would be very damaging to your company .  you are perfectly well acquainted  i suppose  with the strict rules against the use of robots on inhabited worlds .        certainly .        brusquely .     you know that the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation is the only manufacturer of positronic robots in the solar system  and if byerley is a robot  he is a positronic robot .  you are also aware that all positronic robots are leased  and not sold  that the corporation remains the owner and manager of each robot  and is therefore responsible for the actions of all .        it is an easy matter  mr .  quinn  to prove the corporation has never manufactured a robot of a humanoid character .        it can be done .  to discuss merely possibilities .        yes .  it can be done .        secretly  i imagine  as well .  without entering it in your books .        not the positronic brain  sir .  too many factors are involved in that  and there is the tightest possible government supervision .        yes  but robots are worn out  break down  go out of order    and are dismantled .        and the positronic brains re used or destroyed .        really .     francis quinn allowed himself a trace of sarcasm .     and if one were  accidentally  of course  not destroyed    and there happened to be a humanoid structure waiting for a brain .        impossible .        you would have to prove that to the government and the public  so why not prove it to me now .        but what could our purpose be .     demanded lanning in exasperation .     where is our motivation .  credit us with a minimum of sense .        my dear sir  please .  the corporation would be only too glad to have the various regions permit the use of humanoid positronic robots on inhabited worlds .  the profits would be enormous .  but the prejudice of the public against such a practice is too great .  suppose you get them used to such robots first    see  we have a skillful lawyer  a good mayor  and he is a robot .  won   t you buy our robot butlers .        thoroughly fantastic .  an almost humorous descent to the ridiculous .        i imagine so .  why not prove it .  or would you still rather try to prove it to the public .     the light in the office was dimming  but it was not yet too dim to obscure the flush of frustration on alfred lanning   s face .  slowly  the roboticist   s finger touched a knob and the wall illuminators glowed to gentle life .     well  then     he growled     let us see .      the face of stephen byerley is not an easy one to describe .  he was forty by birth certificate and forty by appearance    but it was a healthy  well nourished good natured appearance of forty  one that automatically drew the teeth of the bromide about    looking one   s age .     this was particularly true when he laughed  and he was laughing now .  it came loudly and continuously  died away for a bit  then began again  and alfred lanning   s face contracted into a rigidly bitter monument of disapproval .  he made a half gesture to the woman who sat beside him  but her thin  bloodless lips merely pursed themselves a trifle .  byerley gasped himself a stage nearer normality .     really  dr .  lanning .  .  .  really    i .  .  .  i .  .  .  a robot .     lanning bit his words off with a snap     it is no statement of mine  sir .  i would be quite satisfied to have you a member of humanity .  since our corporation never manufactured you  i am quite certain that you are    in a legalistic sense  at any rate .  but since the contention that you are a robot has been advanced to us seriously by a man of certain standing        don   t mention his name  if it would knock a chip off your granite block of ethics  but let   s pretend it was frank quinn  for the sake of argument  and continue .     lanning drew in a sharp  cutting snort at the interruption  and paused ferociously before continuing with added frigidity      by a man of certain standing  with whose identity i am not interested in playing guessing games  i am bound to ask your cooperation in disproving it .  the mere fact that such a contention could be advanced and publicized by the means at this man   s disposal would be a bad blow to the company i represent    even if the charge were never proven .  you understand me .        oh  yes  your position is clear to me .  the charge itself is ridiculous .  the spot you find yourself in is not .  i beg your pardon  if my laughter offended you .  it was the first i laughed at  not the second .  how can i help you .        it could be very simple .  you have only to sit down to a meal at a restaurant in the presence of witnesses  have your picture taken  and eat .     lanning sat back in his chair  the worst of the interview over .  the woman beside him watched byerley with an apparently absorbed expression but contributed nothing of her own .  stephen byerley met her eyes for an instant  was caught by them  then turned back to the roboticist .  for a while his fingers were thoughtful over the bronze paperweight that was the only ornament on his desk .  he said quietly     i don   t think i can oblige you .     he raised his hand     now wait  dr .  lanning .  i appreciate the fact that this whole matter is distasteful to you  that you have been forced into it against your will  that you feel you are playing an undignified and even ridiculous part .  still  the matter is even more intimately concerned with myself  so be tolerant .     first  what makes you think that quinn    this man of certain standing  you know    wasn   t hoodwinking you  in order to get you to do exactly what you are doing .        why it seems scarcely likely that a reputable person would endanger himself in so ridiculous a fashion  if he weren   t convinced he were on safe ground .     there was little humor in byerley   s eyes     you don   t know quinn .  he could manage to make safe ground out of a ledge a mountain sheep could not handle .  i suppose he showed the particulars of the investigation he claims to have made of me .        enough to convince me that it would be too troublesome to have our corporation attempt to disprove them when you could do so more easily .        then you believe him when he says i never eat .  you are a scientist  dr .  lanning .  think of the logic required .  i have not been observed to eat  therefore  i never eat q . e . d .  after all .        you are using prosecution tactics to confuse what is really a very simple situation .        on the contrary  i am trying to clarify what you and quinn between you are making a very complicated one .  you see  i don   t sleep much  that   s true  and i certainly don   t sleep in public .  i have never cared to eat with others    an idiosyncrasy which is unusual and probably neurotic in character  but which harms no one .  look  dr .  lanning  let me present you with a suppositious case .  supposing we had a politician who was interested in defeating a reform candidate at any cost and while investigating his private life came across oddities such as i have just mentioned .     suppose further that in order to smear the candidate effectively  he comes to your company as the ideal agent .  do you expect him to say to you     so and so is a robot because he hardly ever eats with people  and i have never seen him fall asleep in the middle of a case  and once when i peeped into his window in the middle of the night  there he was  sitting up with a book  and i looked in his frigidaire and there was no food in it .        if he told you that  you would send for a straitjacket .  but if he tells you     he never sleeps  he never eats     then the shock of the statement blinds you to the fact that such statements are impossible to prove .  you play into his hands by contributing to the to do .        regardless  sir     began lanning  with a threatening obstinacy     of whether you consider this matter serious or not  it will require only the meal i mentioned to end it .     again byerley turned to the woman  who still regarded him expressionlessly .     pardon me .  i   ve caught your name correctly  haven   t i .  dr .  susan calvin .        yes  mr .  byerley .        you   re the u .  s .  robot   s psychologist  aren   t you .        robopsychologist  please .        oh  are robots so different from men  mentally .        worlds different .     she allowed herself a frosty smile     robots are essentially decent .     humor tugged at the corners of the lawyer   s mouth     well  that   s a hard blow .  but what i wanted to say was this .  since you   re a psycho    a robopsychologist  and a woman  i   ll bet that you   ve done something that dr .  lanning hasn   t thought of .        and what is that .        you   ve got something to eat in your purse .     something caught in the schooled indifference of susan calvin   s eyes .  she said     you surprise me  mr .  byerley .     and opening her purse  she produced an apple .  quietly  she handed it to him .  dr .  lanning  after an initial start  followed the slow movement from one hand to the other with sharply alert eyes .  calmly  stephen byerley bit into it  and calmly he swallowed it    you see  dr .  lanning .     dr .  lanning smiled in a relief tangible enough to make even his eyebrows appear benevolent a relief that survived for one fragile second .  susan calvin said     i was curious to see if you would eat it  but  of course  in the present case  it proves nothing .     byerley grinned     it doesn   t .        of course not .  it is obvious  dr .  lanning  that if this man were a humanoid robot  he would be a perfect imitation .  he is almost too human to be credible .  after all  we have been seeing and observing human beings all our lives  it would be impossible to palm something merely nearly right off on us .  it would have to be all right .  observe the texture of the skin  the quality of the irises  the bone formation of the hand .  if he   s a robot  i wish u .  s .  robots had made him  because he   s a good job .  do you suppose then  that anyone capable of paying attention to such niceties would neglect a few gadgets to take care of such things as eating  sleeping  elimination .  for emergency use only  perhaps  as  for instance  to prevent such situations as are arising here .  so a meal won   t really prove anything .        now wait     snarled lanning     i am    not quite the fool both of you make me out to be .  i am not interested in the problem of mr .  byerley   s humanity or nonhumanity .  i am interest in getting the corporation out of a hole .  a public meal will end the matter and keep it ended no matter what quinn does .  we can leave the finer details to lawyers and robopsychologists .        but  dr .  lanning     said byerley     you forget the politics of the situation .  i am as anxious to be elected  as quinn is to stop me .  by the way  did you notice that you used his name .  it   s a cheap shyster trick of mine  i knew you would  before you were through .     lanning flushed     what has the election to do with it .        publicity works both ways  sir .  if quinn wants to call me a robot  and has the nerve to do so  i have the nerve to play the game his way .        you mean you     lanning was quite frankly appalled .     exactly .  i mean that i   m going to let him go ahead  choose his rope  test its strength  cut off the right length  tie the noose  insert his head and grin .  i can do what little else is required .        you are mighty confident .     susan calvin rose to her feet     come  alfred  we won   t change his mind for him .        you see .     byerley smiled gently .     you   re a human psychologist  too .      but perhaps not all the confidence that dr .  lanning had remarked upon was present that evening when byerley   s car parked on the automatic treads leading to the sunken garage  and byerley himself crossed the path to the front door of his house .  the figure in the wheel chair looked up as he entered and smiled .  byerley   s face lit with affection .  he crossed over to it .  the cripple   s voice was a hoarse  grating whisper that came out of a mouth forever twisted to one side  leering out of a face that was half scar tissue     you   re late  steve .        i know  john  i know .  but i   ve been up against a peculiar and interesting trouble today .        so .     neither the torn face nor the destroyed voice could carry expression but there was anxiety in the clear eyes .     nothing you can   t handle .        i   m not exactly certain .  i may need your help .  you   re the brilliant one in the family .  do you want me to take you out into the garden .  it   s a beautiful evening .     two strong arms lifted john from the wheel chair .  gently  almost caressingly  byerley   s arms went around the shoulders and under the swathed legs of the cripple .  carefully  and slowly  he walked through the rooms  down the gentle ramp that had been built with a wheel chair in mind  and out the back door into the walled and wired garden behind the house .     why don   t you let me use the wheel chair  steve .  this is silly .        because i   d rather carry you .  do you object .  you know that you   re as glad to get out of that motorized buggy for a while  as i am to see you out .  how do you feel today .     he deposited john with infinite care upon the cool grass .     how should i feel .  but tell me about your troubles .        quinn   s campaign will be based on the fact that he claims i   m a robot .     john   s eyes opened wide     how do you know .  it   s impossible .  i won   t believe it .        oh  come  i tell you it   s so .  he had one of the big shot scientists of u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation over at the office to argue with me .     slowly john   s hands tore at the grass     i see .  i see .     byerley said     but we can let him choose his ground .  i have an idea .  listen to me and tell me if we can do it       the scene as it appeared in alfred lanning   s office that night was a tableau of stares .  francis quinn stared meditatively at alfred lanning .  lanning   s stare was savagely set upon susan calvin  who stared impassively in her turn at quinn .  francis quinn broke it with a heavy attempt at lightness     bluff .  he   s making it up as he goes along .        are you going to gamble on that  mr .  quinn .     asked dr .  calvin  indifferently .     well  it   s your gamble  really .        look here     lanning covered definite pessimism with bluster     we   ve done what you asked .  we witnessed the man eat .  it   s ridiculous to presume him a robot .        do you think so .     quinn shot toward calvin .     lanning said you were the expert .     lanning was almost threatening     now  susan     quinn interrupted smoothly     why not let her talk  man .  she   s been sitting there imitating a gatepost for half an hour .     lanning felt definitely harassed .  from what he experienced then to incipient paranoia was but a step .  he said     very well .  have your say  susan .  we won   t interrupt you .     susan calvin glanced at him humorlessly  then fixed cold eyes on mr .  quinn .     there are only two ways of definitely proving byerley to be a robot  sir .  so far you are presenting circumstantial evidence  with which you can accuse  but not prove    and i think mr .  byerley is sufficiently clever to counter that sort of material .  you probably think so yourself  or you wouldn   t have come here .     the two methods of proof are the physical and the psychological .  physically  you can dissect him or use an x ray .  how to do that would be your problem .  psychologically  his behavior can be studied  for if he is a positronic robot  he must conform to the three rules of robotics .  a positronic brain cannot be constructed without them .  you know the rules  mr .  quinn .     she spoke them carefully  clearly  quoting word for word the famous bold print on page one of the    handbook of robotics .        i   ve heard of them     said quinn  carelessly .     then the matter is easy to follow     responded the psychologist  dryly .     if mr .  byerley breaks any of those three rules  he is not a robot .  unfortunately  this procedure works in only one direction .  if he lives up to the rules  it proves nothing one way or the other .     quinn raised polite eyebrows     why not  doctor .        because  if you stop to think of it  the three rules of robotics are the essential guiding principles of a good many of the world   s ethical systems .  of course  every human being is supposed to have the instinct of self preservation .  that   s rule three to a robot .  also every    good    human being  with a social conscience and a sense of responsibility  is supposed to defer to proper authority  to listen to his doctor  his boss  his government  his psychiatrist  his fellow man  to obey laws  to follow rules  to conform to custom    even when they interfere with his comfort or his safety .  that   s rule two to a robot .  also  every    good    human being is supposed to love others as himself  protect his fellow man  risk his life to save another .  that   s rule one to a robot .  to put it simply    if byerley follows all the rules of robotics  he may be a robot  and may simply be a very good man .        but     said quinn     you   re telling me that you can never prove him a robot .        i may be able to prove him not a robot       that   s not the proof i want .        you   ll have such proof as exists .  you are the only one responsible for your own wants .      here lanning   s mind leaped suddenly to the sting of an idea     has it occurred to anyone     he ground out     that district attorney is a rather strange occupation for a robot .  the prosecution of human beings    sentencing them to death    bringing about their infinite harm     quinn grew suddenly keen     no  you can   t get out of it that way .  being district attorney doesn   t make him human .  don   t you know his record .  don   t you know that he boasts that he has never prosecuted an innocent man  that there are scores of people left untried because the evidence against them didn   t satisfy him  even though he could probably have argued a jury into atomizing them .  that happens to be so .     lanning   s thin cheeks quivered     no  quinn  no .  there is nothing in the rules of robotics that makes any allowance for human guilt .  a robot may not judge whether a human being deserves death .  it is not for him to decide .  he may not harm a human  variety skunk  or variety angel .     susan calvin sounded tired .     alfred     she said     don   t talk foolishly .  what if a robot came upon a madman about to set fire to a house with people in it .  he would stop the madman  wouldn   t he .        of course .        and if the only way he could stop him was to kill him     there was a faint sound in lanning   s throat .  nothing more .     the answer to that  alfred  is that he would do his best not to kill him .  if the madman died  the robot would require psychotherapy because he might easily go mad at the conflict presented him   of having broken rule one to adhere to rule one in a higher sense .  but a man would be dead and a robot would have killed him .        well  is byerley mad .     demanded lanning  with all the sarcasm he could muster .     no  but he has killed no man himself .  he has exposed facts which might represent a particular human being to be dangerous to the large mass of other human beings we call society .  he protects the greater number and thus adheres to rule one at maximum potential .  that is as far as he goes .  it is the judge who then condemns the criminal to death or imprisonment  after the jury decides on his guilt or innocence .  it is the jailer who imprisons him  the executioner who kills him .  and mr .  byerley has done nothing but determine truth and aid society .     as a matter of fact  mr .  quinn  i have looked into mr .  byerley   s career since you first brought this matter to our attention .  i find that he has never demanded the death sentence in his closing speeches to the jury .  i also find that he has spoken on behalf of the abolition of capital punishment and contributed generously to research institutions engaged in criminal neurophysiology .  he apparently believes in the cure  rather than the punishment of crime .  i find that significant .        you do .     quinn smiled .     significant of a certain odor of roboticity  perhaps .        perhaps .  why deny it .  actions such as his could come only from a robot  or from a very honorable and decent human being .  but you see  you just can   t differentiate between a robot and the very best of humans .     quinn sat back in his chair .  his voice quivered with impatience .     dr .  lanning  it   s perfectly possible to create a humanoid robot that would perfectly duplicate a human in appearance  isn   t it .     lanning harrumphed and considered     it   s been done experimentally by u .  s .  robots     he said reluctantly     without the addition of a positronic brain  of course .  by using human ova and hormone control  one can grow human flesh and skin over a skeleton of porous silicone plastics that would defy external examination .  the eyes  the hair  the skin would be really human  not humanoid .  and if you put a positronic brain  and such other gadgets as you might desire inside  you have a humanoid robot .     quinn said shortly     how long would it take to make one .     lanning considered     if you had all your equipment    the brain  the skeleton  the ovum  the proper hormones and radiations    say  two months .     the politician straightened out of his chair .     then we shall see what the insides of mr .  byerley look like .  it will mean publicity for u .  s .  robots    but i gave you your chance .     lanning turned impatiently to susan calvin  when they were alone .     why do you insist     .  and with real feeling  she responded sharply and instantly     which do you want    the truth or my resignation .  i won   t lie for you .  u .  s .  robots can take care of itself .  don   t turn coward .        what     said lanning     if he opens up byerley  and wheels and gears fall out what then .        he won   t open byerley     said calvin  disdainfully .     byerley is as clever as quinn  at the very least     the news broke upon the city a week before byerley was to have been nominated .  but    broke    is the wrong word .  it staggered upon the city  shambled  crawled .  laughter began  and wit was free .  and as the far off hand of quinn tightened its pressure in easy stages  the laughter grew forced  an element of hollow uncertainty entered  and people broke off to wonder .  the convention itself had the sir of a restive stallion .  there had been no contest planned .  only byerley could possibly have been nominated a week earlier .  there was no substitute even now .  they had to nominate him  but there was complete confusion about it .  it would not have been so bad if the average individual were not torn between the enormity of the charge  if true  and its sensational folly  if false .  the day after byerley was nominated perfunctorily  hollowly    a newspaper finally published the gist of a long interview with dr .  susan calvin     world famous expert on robopsychology and positronics .     what broke loose is popularly and succinctly described as hell .  it was what the fundamentalists were waiting for .  they were not a political party  they made pretense to no formal religion .  essentially they were those who had not adapted themselves to what had once been called the atomic age  in the days when atoms were a novelty .  actually  they were the simple lifers  hungering after a life  which to those who lived it had probably appeared not so simple  and who had been  therefore  simple lifers themselves .  the fundamentalists required no new reason to detest robots and robot manufacturers  but a new reason such as the quinn accusation and the calvin analysis was sufficient to make such detestation audible .  the huge plants of the u .  s .  robot   mechanical men corporation was a hive that spawned armed guards .  it prepared for war .  within the city the house of stephen byerley bristled with police .  the political campaign  of course  lost all other issues  and resembled a campaign only in that it was something filling the hiatus between nomination and election .   stephen byerley did not allow the fussy little man to distract him .  he remained comfortably unperturbed by the uniforms in the background .  outside the house  past the line of grim guards  reporters and photographers waited according to the tradition of the caste .  one enterprising    visor station even had a scanner focused on the blank entrance to the prosecutor   s unpretentious home  while a synthetically excited announcer filled in with inflated commentary .  the fussy little man advanced .  he held forward a rich  complicated sheet .     this  mr .  byerley  is a court order authorizing me to search these premises for the presence of illegal .  .  .  uh .  .  .  mechanical men or robots of any description .     byerley half rose  and took the paper .  he glanced at it indifferently  and smiled as he handed it back .     all in order .  go ahead .  do your job .  mrs .  hoppen       to his housekeeper  who appeared reluctantly from the next room      please go with them  and help out if you can .     the little man  whose name was harroway  hesitated  produced an unmistakable blush  failed completely to catch byerley   s eyes  and muttered     come on     to the two policemen .  he was back in ten minutes .     through .     questioned byerley  in just the tone of a person who is not particularly interested in the question  or its answer .  harroway cleared his throat  made a bad start in falsetto  and began again  angrily     look here  mr .  byerley  our special instructions were to search the house very thoroughly .        and haven   t you .        we were told exactly what to look for .        yes .        in short  mr .  byerley  and not to put too fine a point on it  we were told to search you .        me .     said the prosecutor with a broadening smile .     and how do you intend to do that .        we have a penet radiation unit        then i   m to have my x ray photograph taken  hey .  you have the authority .        you saw my warrant .        may i see it again .     harroway  his forehead shining with considerably more than mere enthusiasm  passed it over a second time .  byerley said evenly     i read here as the description of what you are to search  i quote     the dwelling place belonging to stephen allen byerley  located at     willow grove  evanstron  together  with any garage  storehouse or other structures or buildings thereto appertaining  together with all grounds thereto appertaining    .  .  .  um .  .  .  and so on .  quite in order .  but  my good man  it doesn   t say anything about searching my interior .  i am not part of the premises .  you may search my clothes if you think i   ve got a robot hidden in my pocket .     harroway had no doubt on the point of to whom he owed his job .  he did not propose to be backward  given a chance to earn a much better    i . e .   more highly paid    job .  he said  in a faint echo of bluster     look here .  i   m allowed to search the furniture in your house  and anything else i find in it .  you are in it  aren   t you .        a remarkable observation .  i am in it .  but i   m not a piece of furniture .  as a citizen of adult responsibility    i have the psychiatric certificate proving that    i have certain rights under the regional articles .  searching me would come under the heading of violating my right of privacy .  that paper isn   t sufficient .        sure  but if you   re a robot  you don   t have right of privacy .        true enough but that paper still isn   t sufficient .  it recognizes me implicitly as a human being .        where .     harroway snatched at it .     where it says    the dwelling place belonging to    and so on .  a robot cannot own property .  and you may tell your employer  mr .  harroway  that if he tries to issue a similar paper which does not implicitly recognize me as a human being  he will be immediately faced with a restraining injunction and a civil suit which will make it necessary for him to prove me a robot by means of information now in his possession  or else to pay a whopping penalty for an attempt to deprive me unduly of my rights under the regional articles .  you   ll tell him that  won   t you .     harroway marched to the door .  he turned .   .     you   re a slick lawyer     his hand was in his pocket .  for a short moment  he stood there .  then he left  smiled in the direction of the    visor scanner  still playing away    waved to the reporters  and shouted     we   ll have something for you tomorrow  boys .  no kidding .     in his ground car  he settled back  removed the tiny mechanism from his pocket and carefully inspected it .  it was the first time he had ever taken a photograph by x ray reflection .  he hoped he had done it correctly .  quinn and byerley had never met face to face alone .  but visorphone was pretty close to it .  in fact  accepted literally  perhaps the phrase was accurate  even if to each  the other were merely the light and dark pattern of a bank of photocells .  it was quinn who had initiated the call .  it was quinn  who spoke first  and without particular ceremony     thought you would like to know  byerley  that i intend to make public the fact that you   re wearing a protective shield against penet radiation .        that so .  in that case  you   ve probably already made it public .  i have a notion our enterprising press representatives have been tapping my various communication lines for quite a while .  i know they have my office lines full of holes  which is why i   ve dug in at my home these last weeks .     byerley was friendly  almost chatty .  quinn   s lips tightened slightly     this call is shielded    thoroughly .  i   m making it at a certain personal risk .        so i should imagine .  nobody knows you   re behind this campaign .  at least  nobody knows it officially .  nobody doesn   t know it unofficially .  i wouldn   t worry .  so i wear a protective shield .  i suppose you found that out when your puppy dog   s penet radiation photograph  the other day  turned out to be overexposed .        you realize  byerley  that it would be pretty obvious to everyone that you don   t dare face x ray analysis .        also that you  or your men  attempted illegal invasion of my rights of privacy .        the devil they   ll care for that .        they might .  it   s rather symbolic of our two campaigns isn   t it .  you have little concern with the rights of the individual citizen .  i have great concern .  i will not submit to x ray analysis  because i wish to maintain my rights on principle .  just as i   ll maintain the rights of others when elected .        that will  no doubt make a very interesting speech  but no one will believe you .  a little too high sounding to be true .  another thing     a sudden  crisp change     the personnel in your home was not complete the other night .        in what way .        according to the report     he shuffled papers before him that were just within the range of vision of the visiplate     there was one person missing    a cripple .        as you say     said byerley  tonelessly     a cripple .  my old teacher  who lives with me and who is now in the country    and has been for two months .  a    much needed rest    is the usual expression applied in the case .  he has your permission .        your teacher .  a scientist of sorts .        a lawyer once    before he was a cripple .  he has a government license as a research biophysicist  with a laboratory of his own  and a complete description of the work he   s doing filed with the proper authorities  to whom i can refer you .  the work is minor  but is a harmless and engaging hobby for a    poor cripple .  i am being as helpful as i can  you see .        i see .  and what does this .  .  .  teacher .  .  .  know about robot manufacture .        i couldn   t judge the extent of his knowledge in a field with which i am unacquainted .        he wouldn   t have access to positronic brains .        ask your friends at u .  s .  robots .  they   d be the ones to know .        i   ll put it shortly  byerley .  your crippled teacher is the real stephen byerley .  you are his robot creation .  we can prove it .  it was he who was in the automobile accident  not you .  there will be ways of checking the records .        really .  do so  then .  my best wishes .        and we can search your so called teacher   s    country place     and see what we can find there .        well  not quite  quinn .     byerley smiled broadly .     unfortunately for you  my so called teacher is a sick man .  his country place is his place of rest .  his right of privacy as a citizen of adult responsibility is naturally even stronger  under the circumstances .  you won   t be able to obtain a warrant to enter his grounds without showing just cause .  however  i   d be the last to prevent you from trying .     there was a pause of moderate length  and then quinn leaned forward  so that his imaged face expanded and the fine lines on his forehead were visible     byerley  why do you carry on .  you can   t be elected .        can   t i .        do you think you can .  do you suppose that your failure to make any attempt to disprove the robot charge    when you could easily  by breaking one of the three laws    does anything but convince the people that you are a robot .        all i see so far is that from being a rather vaguely known  but still largely obscure metropolitan lawyer  i have now become a world figure .  you   re a good publicist .        but you are a robot .        so it   s been said  but not proven .        it   s been proven sufficiently for the electorate .        then relax you   ve won .        good by     said quinn  with his first touch of viciousness  and the visorphone slammed off .     good by     said byerley imperturbably  to the blank plate .   byerley brought his    teacher    back the week before election .  the air car dropped quickly in an obscure part of the city .     you   ll stay here till after election     byerley told him .     it would be better to have you out of the way if things take a bad turn .     the hoarse voice that twisted painfully out of john   s crooked mouth might have had accents of concern in it .     there   s danger of violence .        the fundamentalists threaten it  so i suppose there is  in a theoretical sense .  but i really don   t expect it .  the fundies have no real power .  they   re just the continuous irritant factor that might stir up a riot after a while .  you don   t mind staying here .  please  i won   t be myself if i have to worry about you .        oh  i   ll stay .  you still think it will go well .        i   m sure of it .  no one bothered you at the place .        no one .  i   m certain .        and your part went well .        well enough .  there   ll be no trouble there .        then take care of yourself  and watch the televisor tomorrow  john .     byerley pressed the gnarled hand that rested on his .   lenton   s forehead was a furrowed study in suspense .  he had the completely unenviable job of being byerley   s campaign manager in a campaign that wasn   t a campaign  for a person that refused to reveal his strategy  and refused to accept his manager   s .     you can   t .     it was his favorite phrase .  it had become his only phrase .     i tell you  steve  you can   t .     he threw himself in front of the prosecutor  who was spending his time leafing through the typed pages of his speech .     put that down  steve .  look  that mob has been organized by the fundies .  you won   t get a hearing .  you   ll be stoned more likely .  why do you have to make a speech before an audience .  what   s wrong with a recording  a visual recording .        you want me to win the election  don   t you .     asked byerley  mildly .     win the election .  you   re not going to win  steve .  i   m trying to save your life .        oh  i   m not in danger .        he   s not in danger .  he   s not in danger .     lenton made a queer  rasping sound in his throat .     you mean you   re getting out on that balcony in front of fifty thousand crazy crackpots and try to talk sense to them    on a balcony like a medieval dictator .     byerley consulted his watch .     in about five minutes    as soon as the televisor lines are free .     lenton   s answering remark was not quite transliterable .   the crowd filled a roped off area of the city .  trees and houses seemed to grow out of a mass human foundation .  and by ultra wave  the rest of the world watched .  it was a purely local election  but it had a world audience just the same .  byerley thought of that and smiled .  but there was nothing to smile at in the crowd itself .  there were banners and streamers  ringing every possible change on his supposed roboticity .  the hostile attitude rose thickly and tangibly into the atmosphere .  from the start the speech was not successful .  it competed against the inchoate mob howl and the rhythmic cries of the fundie claques that formed mob islands within the mob .  byerley spoke on  slowly  unemotionally  inside  lenton clutched his hair and groaned    and waited for the blood .   there was a writhing in the front ranks .  an angular citizen with popping eyes  and clothes too short for the lank length of his limbs  was pulling to the fore .  a policeman dived after him  making slow  struggling passage .  byerley waved the latter off  angrily .  the thin man was directly under the balcony .  his words tore unheard against the roar .  byerley leaned forward .     what do you say .  if you have a legitimate question  i   ll answer it .     he turned to a flanking guard .     bring that man up here .     there was a tensing in the crowd .  cries of    quiet    started in various parts of the mob  and rose to a bedlam  then toned down raggedly .  the thin man  red faced and panting  faced byerley .  byerley said     have you a question .     the thin man stared  and said in a cracked voice     hit me .     with sudden energy  he thrust out his chin at an angle .     hit me .  you say you   re not a robot .  prove it .  you can   t hit a human  you monster .     there was a queer  flat  dead silence .  byerley   s voice punctured it .     i have no reason to hit you .     the thin man was laughing wildly .     you can   t hit me .  you won   t hit me .  you   re not a human .  you   re a monster  a make believe man .     and stephen byerley  tight lipped  in the face of thousands who watched in person and the millions  who watched by screen  drew back his fist and caught the man crackingly upon the chin .  the challenger went over backwards in sudden collapse  with nothing on his face but blank  blank surprise .  byerley said     i   m sorry .  take him in and see that he   s comfortable .  i want to speak to him when i   m through .     and when dr .  calvin  from her reserved space  turned her automobile and drove off  only one reporter had recovered sufficiently from the shock to race after her  and shout an unheard question .  susan calvin called over her shoulder     he   s human .     that was enough .  the reporter raced away in his own direction .  the rest of the speech might be described as    spoken but not heard .      dr .  calvin and stephen byerley met once again    a week before he took the oath of office as mayor .  it was late    past midnight .  dr .  calvin said     you don   t look tired .     the mayor elect smiled .     i may stay up for a while .  don   t tell quinn .        i shan   t .  but that was an interesting story of quinn   s  since you mention him .  it   s a shame to have spoiled it .  i suppose you knew his theory .        parts of it .        it was highly dramatic .  stephen byerley was a young lawyer  a powerful speaker  a great idealist    and with a certain flare for biophysics .  are you interested in robotics  mr .  byerley .        only in the legal aspects .        this stephen byerley was .  but there was an accident .  byerley   s wife died  he himself  worse .  his legs were gone  his face was gone  his voice was gone .  part of his mind was bent .  he would not submit to plastic surgery .  he retired from the world  legal career gone    only his intelligence  and his hands left .  somehow he could obtain positronic brains  even a complex one  one which had the greatest capacity of forming judgments in ethical problems    which is the highest robotic function so far developed .     he grew a body about it .  trained it to be everything he would have been and was no longer .  he sent it out into the world as stephen byerley  remaining behind himself as the old  crippled teacher that no one ever saw        unfortunately     said the mayor elect     i ruined all that by hitting a man .  the papers say it was your official verdict on the occasion that i was human .        how did that happen .  do you mind telling me .  it couldn   t have been accidental .        it wasn   t entirely .  quinn did most of the work .  my men started quietly spreading the fact that i had never hit a man  that i was unable to hit a man  that to fail to do so under provocation would be sure proof that i was a robot .  so i arranged for a silly speech in public  with all sorts of publicity overtones  and almost inevitably  some fool fell for it .  in its essence  it was what i call a shyster trick .  one in which the artificial atmosphere which has been created does all the work .  of course  the emotional effects made my election certain  as intended .     the robopsychologist nodded .     i see you intrude on my field    as every politician must  i suppose .  but i   m very sorry it turned out this way .  i like robots .  i like them considerably better than i do human beings .  if a robot can be created capable of being a civil executive  i think he   d make the best one possible .  by the laws of robotics  he   d be incapable of harming humans  incapable of tyranny  of corruption  of stupidity  of prejudice .  and after he had served a decent term  he would leave  even though he were immortal  because it would be impossible for him to hurt humans by letting them know that a robot had ruled them .  it would be most ideal .        except that a robot might fail due to the inherent inadequacies of his brain .  the positronic brain has never equaled the complexities of the human brain .        he would have advisers .  not even a human brain is capable of governing without assistance .     byerley considered susan calvin with grave interest .     why do you smile  dr .  calvin .        i smile because mr .  quinn didn   t think of everything .        you mean there could be more to that story of his .        only a little .  for the three months before election  this stephen byerley that mr .  quinn spoke about  this broken man  was in the country for some mysterious reason .  he returned in time for that famous speech of yours .  and after all  what the old cripple did once  he could do a second time  particularly where the second job is very simple in comparison to the first .        i don   t quite understand .     dr .  calvin rose and smoothed her dress .  she was obviously ready to leave .     i mean there is one time when a robot may strike a human being without breaking the first law .  just one time .        and when is that .     dr .  calvin was at the door .  she said quietly     when the human to be struck is merely another robot .     she smiled broadly  her thin face glowing .     good by mr .  byerley .  i hope to vote for you five years from now    for co ordinator .     stephen byerley chuckled .     i must reply that that is a somewhat farfetched idea .     the door closed behind her .   the evitable conflict  the co ordinator  in his private study  had that medieval curiosity  a fireplace .  to be sure  the medieval man might not have recognized it as such  since it had no functional significance .  the quiet  licking flame lay in an insulated recess behind clear quartz .  the logs were ignited at long distance through a trifling diversion of the energy beam that fed the public buildings of the city .  the same button that controlled the ignition first dumped the ashes of the previous fire  and allowed for the entrance of fresh wood .     it was a thoroughly domesticated fireplace  you see .  but the fire itself was real .  it was wired for sound  so that you could hear the crackle and  of course  you could watch it leap in the air stream that fed it .  the co ordinator   s ruddy glass reflected  in miniature  the discreet gamboling of the flame  and  in even further miniature  it was reflected in each of his brooding pupils .  and in the frosty pupils of his guest  dr .  susan calvin of u .  s .  robots   mechanical men corporation .  the co ordinator said     i did not ask you here entirely for social purposes  susan .        i did not think you did  stephen     she replied .       and yet i don   t quite know how to phrase my problem .  on the one hand  it can be nothing at all .  on the other  it can mean the end of humanity .        i have come across so many problems  stephen  that presented the same alternative .  i think all problems do .        really .  then judge this    world steel reports an overproduction of twenty thousand long tons .  the mexican canal is two months behind schedule .  the mercury mines at almaden have experienced a production deficiency since last spring  while the hydroponics plant at tientsin has been laying men off .  these items happen to come to mind at the moment .  there is more of the same sort .        are these things serious .  i   m not economist enough to trace the fearful consequences of such things .        in themselves  they are not serious .  mining experts can be sent to almaden  if the situation were to get worse .  hydroponics engineers can be used in java or in ceylon  if there are too many at tientsin .  twenty thousand long tons of steel won   t fill more than a few days of world demand  and the opening of the mexican canal two months later than the planned date is of little moment .  it   s the machines that worry me  i   ve spoken to your director of research about them already .        to vincent silver .     he hasn   t mentioned anything about it to me .        i asked him to speak to no one .  apparently  he hasn   t .        and what did he tell you .        let me put that item in its proper place .  i want to talk about the machines first .  and i want to talk about them to you  because you   re the only one in the world who understands robots well enough to help me now .     may i grow philosophical .        for this evening  stephen  you may talk how you please and of what you please  provided you tell me first what you intend to prove .        that such small unbalances in the perfection of our system of supply and demand  as i have mentioned  may be the first step towards the final war .        hmp .  proceed .     susan calvin did not allow herself to relax  despite the designed comfort of the chair she sat in .  her cold  thin lipped face and her flat  even voice were becoming accentuated with the years .  and although stephen byerley was one man she could like and trust  she was almost seventy and the cultivated habits of a lifetime are not easily broken .     every period of human development  susan     said the co ordinator     has had its own particular type of human conflict    its own variety of problem that  apparently  could be settled only by force .  and each time  frustratingly enough  force never really settled the problem .  instead  it persisted through a series of conflicts  then vanished of itself     what   s the expression     ah  yes    not with a bang  but a whimper     as the economic and social environment changed .  and then  new problems  and a new series of wars     apparently endlessly cyclic .     consider relatively modern times .  there were the series of dynastic wars in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries  when the most important question in europe was whether the houses of hapsburg or valois bourbon were to rule the continent .  it was one of those    inevitable conflicts     since europe could obviously not exist half one and half the other .     except that it did  and no war ever wiped out the one and established the other  until the rise of a new social atmosphere in france in      tumbled first the bourbons and  eventually  the hapsburgs down the dusty chute to history   s incinerator .     and in those same centuries there were the more barbarous religious wars  which revolved about the important question of whether europe was to be catholic or protestant .  half and half she could not be .  it was    inevitable    that the sword decide .     except that it didn   t .  in england  a new industrialism was growing  and on the continent  a new nationalism .  half and half europe remains to this day and no one cares much .     in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries  there was a cycle of nationalist imperialist wars  when the most important question in the world was which portions of europe would control the economic resources and consuming capacity of which portions of non europe .  all non europe obviously could not exist part english and part french and part german and so on .     until the forces of nationalism spread sufficiently  so that non europe ended what all the wars could not  and decided it could exist quite comfortably all non european .     and so we have a pattern        yes .  stephen  you make it plain     said susan calvin .     these are not very profound observations .        no .     but then  it is the obvious which is so difficult to see most of the time .  people say    it   s as plain as the nose on your face .     but how much of the nose on your face can you see  unless someone holds a mirror up to you .  in the twentieth century  susan  we started a new cycle of wars    what shall i call them .  ideological wars .  the emotions of religion applied to economic systems  rather than to extra natural ones .  again the wars were    inevitable    and this time there were atomic weapons  so that mankind could no longer live through its torment to the inevitable wasting away of inevitability .     and positronic robots came .     they came in time  and  with it and alongside it  interplanetary travel .     so that it no longer seemed so important whether the world was adam smith or karl marx .  neither made very much sense under the new circumstances .  both had to adapt and they ended in almost the same place .        a deus ex machina  then  in a double sense     said dr .  calvin  dryly .  the co ordinator smiled gently     i have never heard you pun before  susan  but you are correct .  and yet there was another danger .  the ending of every other problem had merely given birth to another .  our new worldwide robot economy may develop its own problems  and for that reason we have the machines .  the earth   s economy is stable  and will remain stable  because it is based upon the decisions of calculating machines that have the good of humanity at heart through the overwhelming force of the first law of robotics .     stephen byerley continued     and although the machines are nothing but the vastest conglomeration of calculating circuits ever invented  they are still robots within the meaning of the first law  and so our earth wide economy is in accord with the best interests of man .  the population of earth knows that there will be no unemployment  no over production or shortages .  waste and famine are words in history books .  and so the question of ownership of the means of production becomes obsolescent .  whoever owned them  if such a phrase has meaning   a man  a group  a nation  or all mankind  they could be utilized only as the machines directed .     not because men were forced to but because it was the wisest course and men knew it .     it puts an end to war    not only to the last cycle of wars  but to the next and to all of them .  unless     a long pause  and dr .  calvin encouraged him by repetition .     unless     the fire crouched and skittered along a log  then popped up .     unless     said the co ordinator     the machines don   t fulfill their function .        i see .  and that is where those trifling maladjustments come in which you mentioned awhile ago    steel  hydroponics and so on .        exactly .  those errors should not be .  dr .  silver tells me they cannot be .        does he deny the facts .  how unusual .        no  he admits the facts  of course .  i do him an injustice .  what he denies is that any error in the machine is responsible for the so called  his phrase  errors in the answers .  he claims that the machines are self correcting and that it would violate the fundamental laws of nature for an error to exist in the circuits of relays .  and so i said         and you said     have your boys check them and make sure  anyway .           susan  you read my mind .  it was what i said  and he said he couldn   t .        too busy .        no  he said that no human could .  he was frank about it .  he told me  and i hope i understand him properly  that the machines are a gigantic extrapolation .  thus  a team of mathematicians work several years calculating a positronic brain equipped to do certain similar acts of calculation .  using this brain they make further calculations to create a still more complicated brain  which they use again to make one still more complicated and so on .  according to silver  what we call the machines are the result of ten such steps .        ye es  that sounds familiar .  fortunately  i   m not a mathematician .  poor vincent .  he is a young man .  the directors before him  alfred lanning and peter bogert  are dead  and they had no such problems .  nor had i .  perhaps roboticists as a whole should now die  since we can no longer understand our own creations .        apparently not .  the machines are not super brains in sunday supplement sense     although they are so pictured in the sunday supplements .  it is merely that in their own particular province of collecting and analyzing a nearly infinite number of data and relationships thereof  in nearly infinitesimal time  they have progressed beyond the possibility of detailed human control .     and then i tried something else .  i actually asked the machine .  in the strictest secrecy  we fed it the original data involved in the steel decision  its own answer  and the actual developments since    the overproduction  that is     and asked for an explanation of the discrepancy .        good  and what was its answer .        i can quote you that word for word     the matter admits of no explanation .            and how did vincent interpret that .        in two ways .  either we had not given the machine enough data to allow a definite answer  which was unlikely .  dr .  silver admitted that .     or else  it was impossible for the machine to admit that it could give any answer to data which implied that it could harm a human being .  this  naturally  is implied by the first law .  and then dr .  silver recommended that i see you .     susan calvin looked very tired     i   m old  stephen .  when peter bogert died  they wanted to make me director of research and i refused .  i wasn   t young then  either  and i did not wish the responsibility .  they let young silver have it and that satisfied me  but what good is it  if i am dragged into such messes .     stephen  let me state my position .  my researches do indeed involve the interpretation of robot behavior in the light of the three laws of robotics .  here  now  we have these incredible calculating machines .  they are positronic robots and therefore obey the laws of robotics .  but they lack personality  that is  their functions are extremely limited .  must be  since they are so specialized .  therefore  there is very little room for the interplay of the laws  and my one method of attack is virtually useless .  in short  i don   t know that i can help you  stephen .     the co ordinator laughed shortly     nevertheless  let me tell you the rest .  let me give you my theories  and perhaps you will then be able to tell me whether they are possible in the light of robopsychology .        by all means .  go ahead .        well  since the machines are giving the wrong answers  then  assuming that they cannot be in error  there is only one possibility .  they are being given the wrong data .  in other words  the trouble is human  and not robotic .  so i took my recent planetary inspection tour        from which you have just returned to new york .        yes .  it was necessary  you see  since there are four machines  one handling each of the planetary regions .  and all four are yielding imperfect results .        oh  but that follows  stephen .  if any one of the machines is imperfect  that will automatically reflect in the result of the other three  since each of the others will assume as part of the data on which they base their own decisions  the perfection of the imperfect fourth .  with a false assumption  they will yield false answers .        uh huh .  so it seemed to me .  now  i have here the records of my interviews with each of the regional vice coordinators .  would you look through them with me .     oh  and first  have you heard of the    society for humanity    .        umm  yes .  they are an outgrowth of the fundamentalists who have kept u .  s .  robots from ever employing positronic robots on the grounds of unfair labor competition and so on .  the    society for humanity    itself is anti machine  is it not .        yes  yes  but    well  you will see .  shall we begin .  we   ll start with the eastern region .        as you say      the eastern region area            square miles population                capital  shanghai  ching hso lin   s great grandfather had been killed in the japanese invasion of the old chinese republic  and there had been no one beside his dutiful children to mourn his loss or even to know he was lost .  ching hso lin   s grandfather had survived the civil war of the late forties  but there had been no one beside his dutiful children to know or care of that .  and yet ching hso lin was a regional vice co ordinator  with the economic welfare of half the people of earth in his care .  perhaps it was with the thought of all that in mind  that ching had two maps as the only ornaments on the wall of his office .  one was an old hand drawn affair tracing out an acre or two of land  and marked with the now outmoded pictographs of old china .  a little creek trickled aslant the faded markings and there were the delicate pictorial indications of lowly huts  in one of which ching   s grandfather had been born .  the other map was a huge one  sharply delineated  with all markings in neat cyrillic characters .  the red boundary that marked the eastern region swept within its grand confines all that had once been china  india  burma  indo china  and indonesia .  on it  within the old province of szechuan  so light and gentle that none could see it  was the little mark placed there by ching which indicated the location of his ancestral farm .  ching stood before these maps as he spoke to stephen byerley in precise english     no one knows better than you  mr .  co ordinator  that my job  to a large extent  is a sinecure .  it carries with it a certain social standing  and i represent a convenient focal point for administration  but otherwise it is the machine .     the machine does all the work .  what did you think  for instance  of the tientsin hydroponics works .        tremendous .     said byerley .     it is but one of dozens  and not the largest .  shanghai  calcutta  batavia  bangkok    they are widely spread and they are the answer to feeding the billion and three quarters of the east .        and yet     said byerley     you have an unemployment problem there at tientsin .  can you be over producing .  it is incongruous to think of asia as suffering from too much food .     ching   s dark eyes crinkled at the edges .     no .  it has not come to that yet .  it is true that over the last few months  several vats at tientsin have been shut down  but it is nothing serious .  the men have been released only temporarily and those who do not care to work in other fields have been shipped to colombo in ceylon  where a new plant is being put into operation .        but why should the vats be closed down .     ching smiled gently     you do not know much of hydroponics  i see .  well  that is not surprising .  you are a northerner  and there soil farming is still profitable .  it is fashionable in the north to think of hydroponics  when it is thought of at all  as a device of growing turnips in a chemical solution  and so it is    in an infinitely complicated way .     in the first place  by far the largest crop we deal with  and the percentage is growing  is yeast .  we have upward of two thousand strains of yeast in production and new strains are added monthly .  the basic food chemicals of the various yeasts are nitrates and phosphates among the inorganics together with proper amounts of the trace metals needed  down to the fractional parts per million of boron and molybdenum which are required .  the organic matter is mostly sugar mixtures derived from the hydrolysis of cellulose  but  in addition  there are various food factors which must be added .     for a successful hydroponics industry    one which can feed seventeen hundred million people    we must engage in an immense reforestation program throughout the east  we must have huge wood conversion plants to deal with our southern jungles  we must have power  and steel  and chemical synthetics above all .        why the last  sir .        because  mr .  byerley  these strains of yeast have each their peculiar properties .  we have developed  as i said  two thousand strains .  the beefsteak you thought you ate today was yeast .  the frozen fruit confection you had for dessert was iced yeast .  we have filtered yeast juice with the taste  appearance  and all the food value of milk .     it is flavor  more than anything else  you see  that makes yeast feeding popular and for the sake of flavor we have developed artificial  domesticated strains that can no longer support themselves on a basic diet of salts and sugar .  one needs biotin  another needs pteroylglutamic acid  still others need seventeen different amino acids supplied them as well as all the vitamins b  but one  and yet it is popular and we cannot  with economic sense  abandon it        byerley stirred in his seat     to what purpose do you tell me all this .        you asked me  sir  why men are out of work in tientsin .  i have a little more to explain .  it is not only that we must have these various and varying foods for our yeast  but there remains the complicating factor of popular fads with passing time  and of the possibility of the development of new strains with the new requirements and new popularity .  all this must be foreseen  and the machine does the job        but not perfectly .        not very imperfectly  in view of the complications i have mentioned .  well  then  a few thousand workers in tientsin are temporarily out of a job .  but  consider this  the amount of waste in this past year  waste that is  in terms of either defective supply or defective demand  amounts to not one tenth of one percent of our total productive turnover .  i consider that        yet in the first years of the machine  the figure was nearer one thousandth of one percent .        ah  but in the decade since the machine began its operations in real earnest  we have made use of it to increase our old pre machine yeast industry twenty fold .  you expect imperfections to increase with complications  though        though .        there was the curious instance of rama vrasayana .        what happened to him .        vrasayana was in charge of a brine evaporation plant for the production of iodine  with which yeast can do without  but human beings not .  his plant was forced into receivership .        really .  and through what agency .        competition  believe it or not .  in general  one of the chiefest functions of the machine   s analyses is to indicate the most efficient distribution of our producing units .  it is obviously faulty to have areas insufficiently serviced  so that the transportation costs account for too great a percentage of the overhead .  similarly  it is faulty to have an area too well serviced  so that factories must be run at lowered capacities  or else compete harmfully with one another .  in the case of vrasayana  another plant was established in the same city  and with a more efficient extracting system .        the machine permitted it .        oh  certainly .  that is not surprising .  the new system is becoming widespread .  the surprise is that the machine failed to warn vrasayana to renovate or combine .     still  no matter .  vrasayana accepted a job as engineer in the new plant  and if his responsibility and pay are now less  he is not actually suffering .  the workers found employment easily  the old plant has been converted to    something or other .  something useful .  we left it all to the machine .        and otherwise you have no complaints .        none .      the tropic region  a .  area             square miles b .  population              c .  capital  capital city  the map in lincoln ngoma   s office was far from the model of neat precision of the one in ching   s shanghai dominion .  the boundaries of ngoma   s tropic region were stenciled in dark  wide brown and swept about a gorgeous interior labeled    jungle    and    desert    and    here be elephants and all manner of strange beasts .     it had much to sweep  for in land area the tropic region enclosed most of two continents  all of south america north of argentina and all of africa south of the atlas .  it included north america south of the rio grande as well  and even arabia and iran in asia .  it was the reverse of the eastern region .  where the ant hives of the orient crowded half of humanity into    percent of the land mass  the tropics stretched its    per cent of humanity over nearly half of all the land in the world .  but it was growing .  it was the one region whose population increase through immigration exceeded that through births .     and for all who came it had use .  to ngoma  stephen byerley seemed like one of these immigrants  a pale searcher for the creative work of carving a harsh environment into the softness necessary for man  and he felt some of that automatic contempt of the strong man born to the strong tropics for the unfortunate pallards of the colder suns .  the tropics had the newest capital city on earth  and it was called simply that     capital city     in the sublime confidence of youth .  it spread brightly over the fertile uplands of nigeria and outside ngoma   s windows  far below  was life and color  the bright  bright sun and the quick  drenching showers .  even the squawking of the rainbowed birds was brisk and the stars were hard pinpoints in the sharp night .  ngoma laughed .  he was a big  dark man  strong faced and handsome .     sure     he said  and his english was colloquial and mouth filling     the mexican canal is overdue .  what the hell .  it will get finished just the same  old boy .        it was doing well up to the last half year .     ngoma looked at byerley and slowly crunched his teeth over the end of a big cigar  spitting out one end and lighting the other     is this an official investigation  byerley .  what   s going on .        nothing .  nothing at all .  it   s just my function as coordinator to be curious .        well  if it   s just that you are filling in a dull moment  the truth is that we   re always short on labor .  there   s lots going on in the tropics .  the canal is only one of them        but doesn   t your machine predict the amount of labor available for the canal     allowing for all the competing projects .     ngoma placed one hand behind his neck and blew smoke rings at the ceiling     it was a little off .        is it often a little off .        not oftener than you would expect .     we don   t expect too much of it  byerley .  we feed it data .  we take its results .  we do what it says .     but it   s just a convenience  just a laborsaving device .  we could do without it  if we had to .  maybe not as well  maybe not as quickly  but we   d get there .     we   ve got confidence out here  byerley  and that   s the secret .  confidence .  we   ve got new land that   s been waiting for us for thousands of years  while the rest of the world was being ripped apart in the lousy fumblings of pre atomic time .  we don   t have to eat yeast like the eastern boys  and we don   t have to worry about the stale dregs of the last century like you northerners .     we   ve wiped out the tsetse fly and the anopheles mosquito  and people find they can live in the sun and like it  now .  we   ve thinned down the jungles and found soil  we   ve watered the deserts and found gardens .  we   ve got coal and oil in untouched fields  and minerals out of count .     just step back .  that   s all we ask the rest of the world to do .     step back  and let us work .     byerley said  prosaically     but the canal     it was on schedule six months ago .  what happened .     ngoma spread his hands     labor troubles .     he felt through a pile of papers skeltered about his desk and gave it up .     had something on the matter here     he muttered     but never mind .  there was a work shortage somewhere in mexico once on the question of women .  there weren   t enough women in the neighborhood .  it seemed no one had thought of feeding sexual data to the machine .     he stopped to laugh  delightedly  then sobered     wait a while .  i think i   ve got it .     villafranca .        villafranca .        francisco villafranca .     he was the engineer in charge .  now let me straighten it out .  something happened and there was a cave in .  right .  right .  that was it .  nobody died  as i remember  but it made a hell of a mess .     quite a scandal .        oh .        there was some mistake in his calculations .     or at least  the machine said so .  they fed through villafranca   s data  assumptions  and so on .  the stuff he had started with .  the answers came out differently .  it seems the answers villafranca had used didn   t take account of the effect of a heavy rainfall on the contours of the cut .     or something like that .  i   m not an engineer  you understand .     anyway  villafranca put up a devil of a squawk .  he claimed the machine   s answer had been different the first time .  that he had followed the machine faithfully .  then he quit .  we offered to hold him on    reasonable doubt  previous work satisfactory  and all that    in a subordinate position  of course    had to do that much    mistakes can   t go unnoticed    bad for discipline    where was i .        you offered to hold him on .        oh yes .  he refused .     well  take all in all  we   re two months behind .  hell  that   s nothing .     byerley stretched out his hand and let the fingers tap lightly on the desk     villafranca blamed the machine  did he .        well  he wasn   t going to blame himself  was he .  let   s face it  human nature is an old friend of ours .  besides  i remember something else now    why the hell can   t i find documents when i want them .  my filing system isn   t worth a damn    this villafranca was a member of one of your northern organizations .  mexico is too close to the north .  that   s part of the trouble .        which organization are you speaking of .        the society of humanity  they call it .  he used to attend the annual conference in new york  villafranca did .  bunch of crackpots  but harmless .     they don   t like the machines  claim they   re destroying human initiative .  so naturally villafranca would blame the machine .     don   t understand that group myself .  does capital city look as if the human race were running out of initiative .     and capital city stretched out in golden glory under a golden sun     the newest and youngest creation of homo metropolis .   the european region a .  area            square miles b .  population              c .  capital  geneva  the european region was an anomaly in several ways .  in area  it was far the smallest  not one fifth the size of the tropic region in area  and not one fifth the size of the eastern region in population .  geographically  it was only somewhat similar to pre atomic europe  since it excluded what had once been european russia and what had once been the british isles  while it included the mediterranean coasts of africa and asia  and  in a queer jump across the atlantic  argentina  chile  and uruguay as well .  nor was it likely to improve its relative status vis    vis the other regions of earth  except for what vigor the south american provinces lent it .  of all the regions  it alone showed a positive population decline over the past half century .  it alone had not seriously expanded its productive facilities  or offered anything radically new to human culture .     europe     said madame szegeczowska  in her soft french     is essentially an economic appendage of the northern region .  we know it  and it doesn   t matter .     and as though in resigned acceptance of a lack of individuality  there was no map of europe on the wall of the madame co ordinator   s office .     and yet     pointed out byerley     you have a machine of your own  and you are certainly under no economic pressure from across the ocean .        a machine .  bah .     she shrugged her delicate shoulders  and allowed a thin smile to cross her little face as she tamped out a cigarette with long fingers .     europe is a sleepy place .  and such of our men as do not manage to immigrate to the tropics are tired and sleepy along with it .  you see for yourself that it is myself  a poor woman  to whom falls the task of being vice co ordinator .  well  fortunately  it is not a difficult job  and not much is expected of me .     as for the machine    what can it say but    do this and it will be best for you .     but what is best for us .  why  to be an economic appendage of the northern region .     and is it so terrible .  no wars .  we live in peace    and it is pleasant after seven thousand years of war .  we are old  monsieur .  in our borders  we have the regions where occidental civilization was cradled .  we have egypt and mesopotamia  crete and syria  asia minor and greece .     but old age is not necessarily an unhappy time .  it can be a fruition        perhaps you are right     said byerley  affably .     at least the tempo of life is not as intense as in the other regions .  it is a pleasant atmosphere .        is it not .     tea is being brought  monsieur .  if you will indicate your cream and sugar preference  please .  thank you .  she sipped gently  then continued     it is pleasant .  the rest of earth is welcome to the continuing struggle .  i find a parallel here  a very interesting one .  there was a time when rome was master of the world .  it had adopted the culture and civilization of greece  a greece which had never been united  which had ruined itself with war  and which was ending in a state of decadent squalor .  rome united it  brought it peace and let it live a life of secure non glory .  it occupied itself with its philosophies and its art  far from the clash of growth and war .  it was a sort of death  but it was restful  and it lasted with minor breaks for some four hundred years .        and yet     said byerley     rome fell eventually  and the opium dream was over .        there are no longer barbarians to overthrow civilization .        we can be our own barbarians .  madame szegeczowska .     oh  i meant to ask you .  the almaden mercury mines have fallen off quite badly in production .  surely the ores are not declining more rapidly than anticipated .     the little woman   s gray eyes fastened shrewdly on byerley     barbarians    the fall of civilization    possible failure of the machine .  your thought processes are very transparent  monsieur .        are they .     byerley smiled .     i see that i should have had men to deal with as hitherto .     you consider the almaden affair to be the fault of the machine .        not at all  but i think you do .  you  yourself  are a native of the northern region .  the central co ordination office is at new york .     and i have noticed for quite a while that you northerners lack somewhat of faith in the machine .        we do .        there is your    society for humanity    which is strong in the north  but naturally fails to find many recruits in tired  old europe  which is quite willing to let feeble humanity alone for a while .  surely  you are one of the confident north and not one of the cynical old continent .        this has a connection with almaden .        oh  yes  i think so .  the mines are in the control of consolidated cinnabar  which is certainly a northern company  with headquarters at nikolaev .  personally  i wonder if the board of directors have been consulting the machine at all .  they said they had in our conference last month  and  of course  we have no evidence that they did not  but i wouldn   t take the word of a northerner in this matter    no offense intended    under any circumstances .     nevertheless  i think it will have a fortunate ending .        in what way  my dear madam .        you must understand that the economic irregularities of the last few months  which  although small as compared with the great storms of the past  are quite disturbing to our peace drenched spirits  have caused considerable restiveness in the spanish province .  i understand that consolidated cinnabar is selling out to a group of native spaniards .  it is consoling .  if we are economic vassals of the north  it is humiliating to have the fact advertised too blatantly .     and our people can be better trusted to follow the machine .        then you think there will be no more trouble .        i am sure there will not be    in almaden  at least .      the northern region a .  area             square miles b .  population              c .  capital  ottawa  the northern region  in more ways than one  was at the top .  this was exemplified quite well by the map in the ottawa office of vice co ordinator hiram mackenzie  in which the north pole was centered .  except for the enclave of europe with its scandinavian and icelandic regions  all the arctic area was within the northern region .  roughly  it could be divided into two major areas .  to the left on the map was all of north america above the rio grande .  to the right was included all of what had once been the soviet union .  together these areas represented the centered power of the planet in the first years of the atomic age .  between the two was great britain  a tongue of the region licking at europe .  up at the top of the map  distorted into odd  huge shapes  were australia and new zealand  also member provinces of the region .  not all the changes of the past decades had yet altered the fact that the north was the economic ruler of the planet .  there was almost an ostentatious symbolism thereof in the fact that of the official regional maps byerley had seen  mackenzie   s alone showed all the earth  as though the north feared no competition and needed no favoritism to point up its pre eminence .     impossible     said mackenzie  dourly  over the whiskey .     mr .  byerley  you have had no training as a robot technician  i believe .        no  i have not .        hmp .  well  it is  in my opinion  a sad thing that ching  ngoma and szegeczowska haven   t either .  there is too prevalent an opinion among the peoples of earth that a co ordinator need only be a capable organizer  a broad generalizer  and an amiable person .  these days he should know his robotics as well  no offense intended .        none taken .  i agree with you .        i take it  for instance  from what you have said already  that you worry about the recent trifling dislocation in world economy .  i don   t know what you suspect  but it has happened in the past that people    who should have known better    wondered what would happen if false data were fed into the machine .        and what would happen  mr .  mackenzie .        well     the scotsman shifted his weight and sighed     all collected data goes through a complicated screening system which involves both human and mechanical checking  so that the problem is not likely to arise .     but let us ignore that .  humans are fallible  also corruptible  and ordinary mechanical devices are liable to mechanical failure .     the real point of the matter is that what we call a    wrong datum    is one which is inconsistent with all other known data .  it is our only criterion of right and wrong .  it is the machine   s as well .  order it for instance  to direct agricultural activity on the basis of an average july temperature in iowa of    degrees fahrenheit .  it won   t accept that .  it will not give an answer .     not that it has any prejudice against that particular temperature  or that an answer is impossible  but because  in the light of all the other data fed it over a period of years  it knows that the probability of an average july temperature of    is virtually nil .  it rejects that datum .     the only way a    wrong datum    can be forced on the machine is to include it as part of a self consistent whole  all of which is subtly wrong in a manner either too delicate for the machine to detect or outside the machine   s experience .  the former is beyond human capacity  and the latter is almost so  and is becoming more nearly so as the machine   s experience increases by the second .     stephen byerley placed two fingers to the bridge of his nose     then the machine cannot be tampered with    and how do you account for recent errors  then .        my dear byerley  i see that you instinctively follow that great error    that the machine knows all .  let me cite you a case from my personal experience .  the cotton industry engages experienced buyers who purchase cotton .  their procedure is to pull a tuft of cotton out of a random bale of a lot .  they will look at that tuft and feel it  tease it out  listen to the crackling perhaps as they do so  touch it with their tongue  and through this procedure they will determine the class of cotton the bales represent .  there are about a dozen such classes .  as a result of their decisions  purchases are made at certain prices  blends are made in certain proportions .     now these buyers cannot yet be replaced by the machine .        why not .  surely the data involved is not too complicated for it .        probably not .  but what data is this you refer to .  no textile chemist knows exactly what it is that the buyer tests when he feels a tuft of cotton .  presumably there   s the average length of the threads  their feel  the extent and nature of their slickness  the way they hang together  and so on .     several dozen items  subconsciously weighed  out of years of experience .  but the quantitative nature of these tests is not known  maybe even the very nature of some of them is not known .  so we have nothing to feed the machine .  nor can the buyers explain their own judgment .  they can only say     well  look at it .  can   t you tell it   s class such and such .            i see .        there are innumerable cases like that .  the machine is only a tool after all  which can help humanity progress faster by taking some of the burdens of calculations and interpretations off its back .  the task of the human brain remains what it has always been  that of discovering new data to be analyzed  and of devising new concepts to be tested .  a pity the society for humanity won   t understand that .        they are against the machine .        they would be against mathematics or against the art of writing if they had lived at the appropriate time .  these reactionaries of the society claim the machine robs man of his soul .  i notice that capable men are still at a premium in our society  we still need the man who is intelligent enough to think of the proper questions to ask .  perhaps if we could find enough of such  these dislocations you worry about  coordinator  wouldn   t occur .      earth  including the uninhabited continent  antarctica  a .  area             square miles  land surface  b .  population                c .  capital  new york  the fire behind the quartz was weary now  and sputtered its reluctant way to death .  the co ordinator was somber  his mood matching the sinking flame .     they all minimize the state of affairs .     his voice was low .     is it not easy to imagine that they all laugh at me .  and yet vincent silver said the machines cannot be out of order  and i must believe him .  hiram mackenzie says they cannot be fed false data  and i must believe him .  but the machines are going wrong  somehow  and i must believe that  too  and so there is still an alternative left .     he glanced sidewise at susan calvin  who  with closed eyes  for a moment seemed asleep .     what is that .     she asked  prompt to her cue  nevertheless .     why  that correct data is indeed given  and correct answers are indeed received  but that they are then ignored .  there is no way the machine can enforce obedience to its dictates .        madame szegeczowska hinted as much  with reference to northerners in general  it seems to me .        so she did .        and what purpose is served by disobeying the machine .  let   s consider motivations .        it   s obvious to me  and should be to you .  it is a matter of rocking the boat  deliberately .  there can be no serious conflicts on earth  in which one group or another can seize more power than it has for what it thinks is its own good despite the harm to mankind as a whole  while the machines rule .  if popular faith in the machines can be destroyed to the point where they are abandoned  it will be the law of the jungle again .     and not one of the four regions can be freed of the suspicion of wanting just that .     the east has half of humanity within its borders  and the tropics more than half of earth   s resources .  each can feel itself the natural rulers of all earth  and each has a history of humiliation by the north  for which it can be human enough to wish a senseless revenge .  europe has a tradition of greatness  on the other hand .  it once did rule the earth  and there is nothing so eternally adhesive as the memory of power .     yet  in another way  it   s hard to believe .  both the east and the tropics are in a state of enormous expansion within their own borders .  both are climbing incredibly .  they cannot have the spare energy for military adventures .  and europe can have nothing but its dreams .  it is a cipher  militarily .        so  stephen     said susan     you leave the north .        yes     said byerley  energetically     i do .  the north is now the strongest  and has been for nearly a century  or its component parts have been .  but it is losing relatively  now .  the tropic regions may take their place in the forefront of civilization for the first time since the pharaohs  and there are northerners who fear that .     the    society for humanity    is a northern organization  primarily  you know  and they make no secret of not wanting the machines .     susan  they are few in numbers  but it is an association of powerful men .  heads of factories  directors of industries and agricultural combines who hate to be what they call    the machine   s office boy    belong to it .  men with ambition belong to it .  men who feel themselves strong enough to decide for themselves what is best for themselves  and not just to be told what is best for others .        in short  just those men who  by together refusing to accept the decisions of the machine  can  in a short time  turn the world topsy turvy  just those belong to the society .     susan  it hangs together .  five of the directors of world steel are members  and world steel suffers from overproduction .  consolidated cinnabar  which mined mercury at almaden  was a northern concern .  its books are still being investigated  but one  at least  of the men concerned was a member .  francisco villafranca  who  single handed  delayed the mexican canal for two months  was a member  we know already    and so was rama vrasayana  i was not at all surprised to find out .     susan said  quietly     these men  i might point out  have all done badly        but naturally     interjected byerley .     to disobey the machine   s analyses is to follow a non optimal path .  results are poorer than they might be .  it   s the price they pay .  they will have it rough now but in the confusion that will eventually follow        just what do you plan doing  stephen .        there is obviously no time to lose .  i am going to have the society outlawed  every member removed from any responsible post .  and all executive and technical positions  henceforward  can be filled only by applicants signing a non society oath .  it will mean a certain surrender of basic civil liberties  but i am sure the congress        it won   t work .        what .     why not .        i will make a prediction .  if you try any such thing  you will find yourself hampered at every turn .  you will find it impossible to carry out .  you will find your every move in that direction will result in trouble .     byerley was taken aback     why do you say that .  i was rather hoping for your approval in this matter .        you can   t have it as long as your actions are based on a false premise .  you admit the machine can   t be wrong  and can   t be fed wrong data .  i will now show you that it cannot be disobeyed  either  as you think is being done by the society .        that i don   t see at all .        then listen .  every action by any executive which does not follow the exact directions of the machine he is working with becomes part of the data for the next problem .  the machine  therefore  knows that the executive has a certain tendency to disobey .  he can incorporate that tendency into that data     even quantitatively  that is  judging exactly how much and in what direction disobedience would occur .  its next answers would be just sufficiently biased so that after the executive concerned disobeyed  he would have automatically corrected those answers to optimal directions .  the machine knows  stephen .        you can   t be sure of all this .  you are guessing .        it is a guess based on a lifetime   s experience with robots .  you had better rely on such a guess  stephen .        but then what is left .  the machines themselves are correct and the premises they work on are correct .  that we have agreed upon .  now you say that it cannot be disobeyed .  then what is wrong .        you have answered yourself .  nothing is wrong .  think about the machines for a while  stephen .  they are robots  and they follow the first law .  but the machines work not for any single human being  but for all humanity  so that the first law becomes     no machine may harm humanity  or  through inaction  allow humanity to come to harm .        very well  then  stephen  what harms humanity .  economic dislocations most of all  from whatever cause .  wouldn   t you say so .        i would .        and what is most likely in the future to cause economic dislocations .  answer that  stephen .        i should say     replied byerley  unwillingly     the destruction of the machines .        and so should i say  and so should the machines say .  their first care  therefore  is to preserve themselves  for us .  and so they are quietly taking care of the only elements left that threaten them .  it is not the    society for humanity    which is shaking the boat so that the machines may be destroyed .  you have been looking at the reverse of the picture .  say rather that the machine is shaking the boat  very slightly  just enough to shake loose those few which cling to the side for purposes the machines consider harmful to humanity .     so vrasayana loses his factory and gets another job where he can do no harm    he is not badly hurt  he is not rendered incapable of earning a living  for the machine cannot harm a human being more than minimally  and that only to save a greater number .  consolidated cinnabar loses control at almaden .  villafranca is no longer a civil engineer in charge of an important project .  and the directors of world steel are losing their grip on the industry    or will .        but you don   t really know all this     insisted byerley  distractedly .     how can we possibly take a chance on your being right .        you must .  do you remember the machine   s own statement when you presented the problem to him .  it was     the matter admits of no explanation .     the machine did not say there was no explanation  or that it could determine no explanation .  it simply was not going to admit any explanation .  in other words  it would be harmful to humanity to have the explanation known  and that   s why we can only guess    and keep on guessing .        but how can the explanation do us harm .  assume that you are right  susan .        why  stephen  if i am right  it means that the machine is conducting our future for us not only simply in direct answer to our direct questions  but in general answer to the world situation and to human psychology as a whole .  and to know that may make us unhappy and may hurt our pride .  the machine cannot  must not  make us unhappy .     stephen  how do we know what the ultimate good of humanity will entail .  we haven   t at our disposal the infinite factors that the machine has at its .  perhaps  to give you a not unfamiliar example  our entire technical civilization has created more unhappiness and misery than it has removed .  perhaps an agrarian or pastoral civilization  with less culture and less people would be better .  if so  the machines must move in that direction  preferably without telling us  since in our ignorant prejudices we only know that what we are used to  is good    and we would then fight change .  or perhaps a complete urbanization  or a completely caste ridden society  or complete anarchy  is the answer .  we don   t know .  only the machines know  and they are going there and taking us with them .        but you are telling me  susan  that the    society for humanity    is right  and that mankind has lost its own say in its future .        it never had any  really .  it was always at the mercy of economic and sociological forces it did not understand    at the whims of climate  and the fortunes of war .  now the machines understand them  and no one can stop them  since the machines will deal with them as they are dealing with the society     having  as they do  the greatest of weapons at their disposal  the absolute control of our economy .        how horrible .        perhaps how wonderful .  think  that for all time  all conflicts are finally evitable .  only the machines  from now on  are inevitable .     and the fire behind the quartz went out and only a curl of smoke was left to indicate its place .   feminine intuition  the three laws of robotics    .  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .    .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .    .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .   for the first time in the history of united states robots and mechanical men corporation  a robot had been destroyed through accident on earth itself .  no one was to blame .  the air vehicle had been demolished in mid air and an unbelieving investigating committee was wondering whether they really dared announce the evidence that it had been hit by a meteorite .  nothing else could have been fast enough to prevent automatic avoidance  nothing else could have done the damage short of a nuclear blast and that was out of the question .  tie that in with a report of a flash in the night sky just before the vehicle had exploded  and from flagstaff observatory  not from an amateur  and the location of a sizable and distinctly meteoric bit of iron freshly gouged into the ground a mile from the site and what other conclusion could be arrived at .  still  nothing like that had ever happened before and calculations of the odds against it yielded monstrous figures .  yet even colossal improbabilities can happen sometimes .  at the offices of united states robots  the hows and whys of it were secondary .  the real point was that a robot had been destroyed .  that  in itself  was distressing .  the fact that jn   had been a prototype  the first  after four earlier attempts  to have been placed in the field  was even more distressing .  the fact that jn   was a radically new type of robot  quite different from anything ever built before  was abysmally distressing .  the fact that jn   had apparently accomplished something before its destruction that was incalculably important and that that accomplishment might now be forever gone  placed the distress utterly beyond words .  it seemed scarcely worth mentioning that  along with the robot  the chief robopsychologist of united states robots had also died .  clinton madarian had joined the firm ten years before .  for five of those years  he had worked uncomplainingly under the grumpy supervision of susan calvin .  madarian   s brilliance was quite obvious and susan calvin had quietly promoted him over the heads of older men .  she wouldn   t  in any case  have deigned to give her reasons for this to research director peter bogert  but as it happened  no reasons were needed .  or  rather  they were obvious .  madarian was utterly the reverse of the renowned dr .  calvin in several very noticeable ways .  he was not quite as overweight as his distinct double chin made him appear to be  but even so he was overpowering in his presence  where susan had gone nearly unnoticed .  madarian   s massive face  his shock of glistening red brown hair  his ruddy complexion and booming voice  his loud laugh  and most of all  his irrepressible self confidence and his eager way of announcing his successes  made everyone else in the room feel there was a shortage of space .  when susan calvin finally retired  refusing  in advance  any cooperation with respect to any testimonial dinner that might be planned in her honor  with so firm a manner that no announcement of the retirement was even made to the news services  madarian took her place .  he had been in his new post exactly one day when he initiated the jn project .  it had meant the largest commitment of funds to one project that united states robots had ever had to weigh  but that was something which madarian dismissed with a genial wave of the hand .     worth every penny of it  peter     he said .     and i expect you to convince the board of directors of that .        give me reasons     said bogert  wondering if madarian would .  susan calvin had never given reasons .  but madarian said     sure     and settled himself easily into the large armchair in the director   s office .  bogert watched the other with something that was almost awe .  his own once black hair was almost white now and within the decade he would follow susan into retirement .  that would mean the end of the original team that had built united states robots into a globe girdling firm that was a rival of the national governments in complexity and importance .  somehow neither he nor those who had gone before him ever quite grasped the enormous expansion of the firm .  but this was a new generation .  the new men were at ease with the colossus    they lacked the touch of wonder that would have them tiptoeing in disbelief .  so they moved ahead  and that was good .  madarian said     i propose to begin the construction of robots without constraint .        without the three laws .  surely         no  peter .  are those the only constraints you can think of .  hell  you contributed to the design of the early positronic brains .  do i have to tell you that  quite aside from the three laws  there isn   t a pathway in those brains that isn   t carefully designed and fixed .  we have robots planned for specific tasks  implanted with specific abilities .        and you propose         that at every level below the three laws  the paths be made open ended .  it   s not difficult .     bogert said dryly     it   s not difficult  indeed .  useless things are never difficult .  the difficult thing is fixing the paths and making the robot useful .        but why is that difficult .  fixing the paths requires a great deal of effort because the principle of uncertainty is important in particles the mass of positrons and the uncertainty effect must be minimized .  yet why must it .  if we arrange to have the principle just sufficiently prominent to allow the crossing of paths unpredictably         we have an unpredictable robot .        we have a creative robot     said madarian  with a trace of impatience .     peter  if there   s anything a human brain has that a robotic brain has never had  it   s the trace of unpredictability that comes from the effects of uncertainty at the subatomic level .  i admit that this effect has never been demonstrated experimentally within the nervous system  but without that the human brain is not superior to the robotic brain in principle .        and you think that if you introduce the effect into the robotic brain  the human brain will become not superior to the robotic brain in principle .        that      said madarian     is exactly what i believe .     they went on for a long time after that .  the board of directors clearly had no intention of being easily convinced .  scott robertson  the largest shareholder in the firm  said     it   s hard enough to manage the robot industry as it is  with public hostility to robots forever on the verge of breaking out into the open .  if the public gets the idea that robots will be uncontrolled .  .  . oh  don   t tell me about the three laws .  the average man won   t believe the three laws will protect him if he as much as hears the word    uncontrolled .            then don   t use it      said madarian .     call the robot  call it    intuitive .            an intuitive robot      someone muttered .     a girl robot .     a smile made its way about the conference table .  madarian seized on that .     all right .  a girl robot .  our robots are sexless  of course  and so will this one be  but we always act as though they   re males .  we give them male pet names and call them he and him .  now this one  if we consider the nature of the mathematical structuring of the brain which i have proposed  would fall into the jn coordinate system .  the first robot would be jn    and i   ve assumed that it would be called john    .  .  .  . i   m afraid that is the level of originality of the average roboticist .  but why not call it jane    damn it .  if the public has to be let in on what we   re doing  we   re constructing a feminine robot with intuition .     robertson shook his head     what difference would that make .  what you   re saying is that you plan to remove the last barrier which  in principle  keeps the robotic brain inferior to the human brain .  what do you suppose the public reaction will be to that .        do you plan to make that public .     said madarian .  he thought a bit and then said     look .  one thing the general public believes is that women are not as intelligent as men .     there was an instant apprehensive look on the face of more than one man at the table and a quick look up and down as though susan calvin were still in her accustomed seat .  madarian said     if we announce a female robot  it doesn   t matter what she is .  the public will automatically assume she is mentally backward .  we just publicize the robot as jane   and we don   t have to say another word .  we   re safe .        actually     said peter bogert quietly     there   s more to it than that .  madarian and i have gone over the mathematics carefully and the jn series  whether john or jane  would be quite safe .  they would be less complex and intellectually capable  in an orthodox sense  than many another series we have designed and constructed .  there would only be the one added factor of  well  let   s get into the habit of calling it    intuition .            who knows what it would do .     muttered robertson .     madarian has suggested one thing it can do .  as you all know  the space jump has been developed in principle .  it is possible for men to attain what is  in effect  hyper speeds beyond that of light and to visit other stellar systems and return in negligible time  weeks at the most .     robertson said     that   s not new to us .  it couldn   t have been done without robots .        exactly  and it   s not doing us any good because we can   t use the hyper speed drive except perhaps once as a demonstration  so that u .  s .  robots gets little credit .  the space jump is risky  it   s fearfully prodigal of energy and therefore it   s enormously expensive .  if we were going to use it anyway  it would be nice if we could report the existence of a habitable planet .  call it a psychological need .  spend about twenty billion dollars on a single space jump and report nothing but scientific data and the public wants to know why their money was wasted .  report the existence of a habitable planet  and you   re an interstellar columbus and no one will worry about the money .        so .        so where are we going to find a habitable planet .  or put it this way  which star within reach of the space jump as presently developed  which of the three hundred thousand stars and star systems within three hundred light years has the best chance of having a habitable planet .  we   ve got an enormous quantity of details on every star in our three hundred light year neighborhood and a notion that almost every one has a planetary system .  but which has a habitable planet .  which do we visit .  .  .  . we don   t know .     one of the directors said     how would this jane robot help us .     madarian was about to answer that  but he gestured slightly to bogert and bogert understood .  the director would carry more weight .  bogert didn   t particularly like the idea  if the jn series proved a fiasco  he was making himself prominent enough in connection with it to insure that the sticky fingers of blame would cling to him .  on the other hand  retirement was not all that far off  and if it worked  he would go out in a blaze of glory .  maybe it was only madarian   s aura of confidence  but bogert had honestly come to believe it would work .  he said     it may well be that somewhere in the libraries of data we have on those stars  there are methods for estimating the probabilities of the presence of earth type habitable planets .  all we need to do is understand the data properly  look at them in the appropriate creative manner  make the correct correlations .  we haven   t done it yet .  or if some astronomer has  he hasn   t been smart enough to realize what he has .     a jn type robot could make correlations far more rapidly and far more precisely than a man could .  in a day  it would make and discard as many correlations as a man could in ten years .  furthermore  it would work in truly random fashion  whereas a man would have a strong bias based on preconception and on what is already believed .     there was a considerable silence after that finally robertson said     but it   s only a matter of probability  isn   t it .  suppose this robot said     the highest probability habitable planet star within so and so light years is squidgee       or whatever  and we go there and find that a probability is only a probability and that there are no habitable planets after all .  where does that leave us .     madarian struck in this time .     we still win .  we know how the robot came to the conclusion because it  she  will tell us .  it might well help us gain enormous insight into astronomical detail and make the whole thing worthwhile even if we don   t make the space jump at all .  besides  we can then work out the five most probable sites of planets and the probability that one of the five has a habitable planet may then be better than   .    .  it would be almost sure      they went on for a long time after that .  the funds granted were quite insufficient  but madarian counted on the habit of throwing good money after bad .  with two hundred million about to be lost irrevocably when another hundred million could save everything  the other hundred million would surely be voted .  jane   was finally built and put on display .  peter bogert studied it   her  gravely .  he said     why the narrow waist .  surely that introduces a mechanical weakness .     madarian chuckled .     listen  if we   re going to call her jane  there   s no point in making her look like tarzan .     bogert shook his head .     don   t like it .  you   ll be bulging her higher up to give the appearance of breasts next  and that   s a rotten idea .  if women start getting the notion that robots may look like women  i can tell you exactly the kind of perverse notions they   ll get  and you   ll really have hostility on their part .     madarian said     maybe you   re right at that .  no woman wants to feel replaceable by something with none of her faults .  okay .     jane   did not have the pinched waist .  she was a somber robot which rarely moved and even more rarely spoke .  madarian had only occasionally come rushing to bogert with items of news during her construction and that had been a sure sign that things were going poorly .  madarian   s ebullience under success was overpowering .  he would not hesitate to invade bogert   s bedroom at   a . m .  with a hot flash item rather than wait for the morning .  bogert was sure of that .  now madarian seemed subdued  his usually florid expression nearly pale  his round cheeks somehow pinched .  bogert said  with a feeling of certainty     she won   t talk .        oh  she talks .     madarian sat down heavily and chewed at his lower lip .     sometimes  anyway     he said .  bogert rose and circled the robot .     and when she talks  she makes no sense  i suppose .  well  if she doesn   t talk  she   s no female  is she .     madarian tried a weak smile for size and abandoned it .  he said     the brain  in isolation  checked out .        i know     said bogert .     but once that brain was put in charge of the physical apparatus of the robot  it was necessarily modified  of course .        of course     agreed bogert unhelpfully .     but unpredictably and frustratingly .  the trouble is that when you   re dealing with n dimensional calculus of uncertainty  things are         uncertain .     said bogert .  his own reaction was surprising him .  the company investment was already most sizable and almost two years had elapsed  yet the results were  to put it politely  disappointing .  still  he found himself jabbing at madarian and finding himself amused in the process .  almost furtively  bogert wondered if it weren   t the absent susan calvin he was jabbing at .  madarian was so much more ebullient and effusive than susan could ever possibly be  when things were going well .  he was also far more vulnerably in the dumps when things weren   t going well  and it was precisely under pressure that susan never cracked .  the target that madarian made could be a neatly punctured bull   s eye as recompense for the target susan had never allowed herself to be .  madarian did not react to bogert   s last remark any more than susan calvin would have done  not out of contempt  which would have been susan   s reaction  but because he did not hear it he said argumentatively     the trouble is the matter of recognition .  we have jane   correlating magnificently .  she can correlate on any subject  but once she   s done so  she can   t recognize a valuable result from a valueless one .  it   s not an easy problem  judging how to program a robot to tell a significant correlation when you don   t know what correlations she will be making .        i presume you   ve thought of lowering the potential at the w    diode junction and sparking across the         no  no  no  no      madarian faded off into a whispering diminuendo .     you can   t just have it spew out everything .  we can do that for ourselves .  the point is to have it recognize the crucial correlation and draw the conclusion .  once that is done  you see  a jane robot would snap out an answer by intuition .  it would be something we couldn   t get ourselves except by the oddest kind of luck .        it seems to me     said bogert dryly     that if you had a robot like that  you would have her do routinely what  among human beings  only the occasional genius is capable of doing .     madarian nodded vigorously .     exactly  peter .  i   d have said so myself if i weren   t afraid of frightening off the execs .  please don   t repeat that in their hearing .        do you really want a robot genius .        what are words .  i   m trying to get a robot with the capacity to make random correlations at enormous speeds  together with a key significance high recognition quotient .  and i   m trying to put those words into positronic field equations .  i thought i had it  too  but i don   t .  not yet .     he looked at jane   discontentedly and said     what   s the best significance you have  jane .     jane     s head turned to look at madarian but she made no sound  and madarian whispered with resignation     she   s running that into the correlation banks .     jane   spoke tonelessly at last .     i   m not sure .     it was the first sound she had made .  madarian   s eyes rolled upward .     she   s doing the equivalent of setting up equations with indeterminate solutions .        i gathered that     said bogert .     listen  madarian  can you go anywhere at this point  or do we pull out now and cut our losses at half a billion .        oh  i   ll get it      muttered madarian .  jane   wasn   t it .  she was never as much as activated and madarian was in a rage .  it was human error .  his own fault  if one wanted to be entirely accurate .  yet though madarian was utterly humiliated  others remained quiet .  let he who has never made an error in the fearsomely intricate mathematics of the positronic brain fill out the first memo of correction .  nearly a year passed before jane   was ready .  madarian was ebullient again .     she does it     he said .     she   s got a good high recognition quotient .     he was confident enough to place her on display before the board and have her solve problems .  not mathematical problems  any robot could do that  but problems where the terms were deliberately misleading without being actually inaccurate .  bogert said afterward     that doesn   t take much  really .        of course not .  it   s elementary for jane   but i had to show them something  didn   t i .        do you know how much we   ve spent so far .        come on  peter  don   t give me that .  do you know how much we   ve got back .  these things don   t go on in a vacuum  you know .  i   ve had over three years of hell over this  if you want to know  but i   ve worked out new techniques of calculation that will save us a minimum of fifty thousand dollars on every new type of positronic brain we design  from now on in forever .  right .        well         well me no wells .  it   s so .  and it   s my personal feeling that n dimensional calculus of uncertainty can have any number of other applications if we have the ingenuity to find them  and my jane robots will find them .  once i   ve got exactly what i want  the new jn series will pay for itself inside of five years  even if we triple what we   ve invested so far .        what do you mean by    exactly what you want    .  what   s wrong with jane   .        nothing .  or nothing much .  she   s on the track  but she can be improved and i intend to do so .  i thought i knew where i was going when i designed her .  now i   ve tested her and i know where i   m going .  i intend to get there .      jane   was it .  it took madarian well over a year to produce her and there he had no reservations  he was utterly confident .  jane   was shorter than the average robot  slimmer .  without being a female caricature as jane   had been  she managed to possess an air of femininity about herself despite the absence of a single clearly feminine feature .     it   s the way she   s standing     said bogert .  her arms were held gracefully and somehow the torso managed to give the impression of curving slightly when she turned .  madarian said     listen to her .  .  .  . how do you feel  jane .        in excellent health  thank you     said jane    and the voice was precisely that of a woman  it was a sweet and almost disturbing contralto .     why did you do that  clinton .     said peter  startled and beginning to frown .     psychologically important     said madarian .     i want people to think of her as a woman  to treat her as a woman  to explain .        what people .     madarian put his hands in his pockets and stared thoughtfully at bogert .     i would like to have arrangements made for jane and myself to go to flagstaff .     bogert couldn   t help but note that madarian didn   t say jane   .  he made use of no number this time .  she was the jane .  he said doubtfully     to flagstaff .  why .        because that   s the world center for general planetology  isn   t it .  it   s where they   re studying the stars and trying to calculate the probability of habitable planets  isn   t it .        i know that  but it   s on earth .        well  and i surely know that .        robotic movements on earth are strictly controlled .  and there   s no need for it .  bring a library of books on general planetology here and let jane absorb them .        no .  peter  will you get it through your head that jane isn   t the ordinary logical robot  she   s intuitive .        so .        so how can we tell what she needs  what she can use  what will set her off .  we can use any metal model in the factory to read books  that   s frozen data and out of date besides .  jane must have living information  she must have tones of voice  she must have side issues  she must have total irrelevancies even .  how the devil do we know what or when something will go click click inside her and fall into a pattern .  if we knew  we wouldn   t need her at all  would we .     bogert began to feel harassed .  he said     then bring the men here  the general planetologists .        here won   t be any good .  they   ll be out of their element .  they won   t react naturally .  i want jane to watch them at work  i want her to see their instruments  their offices  their desks  everything about them that she can .  i want you to arrange to have her transported to flagstaff .  and i   d really like not to discuss it any further .     for a moment he almost sounded like susan .  bogert winced  and said     it   s complicated making such an arrangement .  transporting an experimental robot         jane isn   t experimental .  she   s the fifth of the series .        the other four weren   t really working models .     madarian lifted his hands in helpless frustration .     who   s forcing you to tell the government that .        i   m not worried about the government .  it can be made to understand special cases .  it   s public opinion .  we   ve come a long way in fifty years and i don   t propose to be set back twenty five of them by having you lose control of a         i won   t lose control .  you   re making foolish remarks .  look .  u .  s .  robots can afford a private plane .  we can land quietly at the nearest commercial airport and be lost in hundreds of similar landings .  we can arrange to have a large ground car with an enclosed body meet us and take us to flagstaff .  jane will be crated and it will be obvious that some piece of thoroughly non robotic equipment is being transported to the labs .  we won   t get a second look from anyone .  the men at flagstaff will be alerted and will be told the exact purpose of the visit .  they will have every motive to cooperate and to prevent a leak .     bogert pondered .     the risky part will be the plane and the ground car .  if anything happens to the crate         nothing will .        we might get away with it if jane is deactivated during transport .  then even if someone finds out she   s inside         no  peter .  that can   t be done .  uh uh .  not jane   .  look  she   s been free associating since she was activated .  the information she possesses can be put into freeze during deactivation but the free associations never .  no  sir  she can   t ever be deactivated .        but  then  if somehow it is discovered that we are transporting an activated robot         it won   t be found out .     madarian remained firm and the plane eventually took off .  it was a late model automatic computo jet  but it carried a human pilot  one of u .  s .  robots    own employees  as backup .  the crate containing jane arrived at the airport safely  was transferred to the ground car  and reached the research laboratories at flagstaff without incident .  peter bogert received his first call from madarian not more than an hour after the latter   s arrival at flagstaff .  madarian was ecstatic and  characteristically  could not wait to report .  the message arrived by tubed laser beam  shielded  scrambled  and ordinarily impenetrable  but bogert felt exasperated .  he knew it could be penetrated if someone with enough technological ability  the government  for example  was determined to do so .  the only real safety lay in the fact that the government had no reason to try .  at least bogert hoped so .  he said     for god   s sake  do you have to call .     madarian ignored him entirely .  he burbled     it was an inspiration .  sheer genius  i tell you .     for a while  bogert stared at the receiver .  then he shouted incredulously     you mean you   ve got the answer .  already .        no  no .  give us time  damn it .  i mean the matter of her voice was an inspiration .  listen  after we were chauffeured from the airport to the main administration building at flagstaff  we uncrated jane and she stepped out of the box .  when that happened  every man in the place stepped back .  scared .  nitwits .  if even scientists can   t understand the significance of the laws of robotics  what can we expect of the average untrained individual .  for a minute there i thought  this will all be useless .  they won   t talk .  they   ll be keying themselves for a quick break in case she goes berserk and they   ll be able to think of nothing else .        well  then  what are you getting at .        so then she greeted them routinely .  she said     good afternoon  gentlemen .  i am so glad to meet you .     and it came out in this beautiful contralto .  .  .  . that was it .  one man straightened his tie  and another ran his fingers through his hair .  what really got me was that the oldest guy in the place actually checked his fly to make sure it was zipped .  they   re all crazy about her now .  all they needed was the voice .  she isn   t a robot any more  she   s a girl .        you mean they   re talking to her .        are they talking to her .  i should say so .  i should have programmed her for sexy intonations .  they   d be asking her for dates right now if i had .  talk about conditioned reflex .  listen  men respond to voices .  at the most intimate moments  are they looking .  it   s the voice in your ear         yes  clinton  i seem to remember .  where   s jane now .        with them .  they won   t let go of her .        damn .  get in there with her .  don   t let her out of your sight  man .     madarian   s calls thereafter  during his ten day stay at flagstaff  were not very frequent and became progressively less exalted .  jane was listening carefully  he reported  and occasionally she responded .  she remained popular .  she was given entry everywhere .  but there were no results .  bogert said     nothing at all .     madarian was at once defensive .     you can   t say nothing at all .  it   s impossible to say nothing at all with an intuitive robot .  you don   t know what might not be going on inside her .  this morning she asked jensen what he had for breakfast .        rossiter jensen the astrophysicist .        yes  of course .  as it turned out  he didn   t have breakfast that morning .  well  a cup of coffee .        so jane   s learning to make small talk .  that scarcely makes up for the expense .        oh  don   t be a jackass .  it wasn   t small talk .  nothing is small talk for jane .  she asked because it had something to do with some sort of cross correlation she was building in her mind .        what can it possibly         how do i know .  if i knew  i   d be a jane myself and you wouldn   t need her .  but it has to mean something .  she   s programmed for high motivation to obtain an answer to the question of a planet with optimum habitability distance and         then let me know when she   s done that and not before .  it   s not really necessary for me to get a blow by blow description of possible correlations .     he didn   t really expect to get notification of success .  with each day  bogert grew less sanguine  so that when the notification finally came  he wasn   t ready .  and it came at the very end .  that last time  when madarian   s climactic message came  it came in what was almost a whisper .  exaltation had come complete circle and madarian was awed into quiet .     she did it     he said .     she did it .  after i all but gave up  too .  after she had received everything in the place and most of it twice and three times over and never said a word that sounded like anything .  .  .  . i   m on the plane now  returning .  we   ve just taken off .     bogert managed to get his breath .     don   t play games  man .  you have the answer .  say so  if you have .  say it plainly .        she has the answer .  she   s given me the answer .  she   s given me the names of three stars within eighty light years which  she says  have a sixty to ninety percent chance of possessing one habitable planet each .  the probability that at least one has is   .     .  it   s almost certain .  and that   s just the least of it .  once we get back  she can give us the exact line of reasoning that led her to the conclusion and i predict that the whole science of astrophysics and cosmology will         are you sure         you think i   m having hallucinations .  i even have a witness .  poor guy jumped two feet when jane suddenly began to reel out the answer in her gorgeous voice    and that was when the meteorite struck and in the thorough destruction of the plane that followed  madarian and the pilot were reduced to gobbets of bloody flesh and no usable remnant of jane was recovered .   the gloom at u .  s .  robots had never been deeper .  robertson attempted to find consolation in the fact that the very completeness of the destruction had utterly hidden the illegalities of which the firm had been guilty .  peter shook his head and mourned .     we   ve lost the best chance u .  s .  robots ever had of gaining an unbeatable public image  of overcoming the damned frankenstein complex .  what it would have meant for robots to have one of them work out the solution to the habitable planet problem  after other robots had helped work out the space jump .  robots would have opened the galaxy to us .  and if at the same time we could have driven scientific knowledge forward in a dozen different directions as we surely would have .  .  . oh  god  there   s no way of calculating the benefits to the human race  and to us of course .     robertson said     we could build other janes  couldn   t we .  even without madarian .        sure we could .  but can we depend on the proper correlation again .  who knows how low  probability that final result was .  what if madarian had had a fantastic piece of beginner   s luck .  and then to have an even more fantastic piece of bad luck .  a meteorite zeroing in .  .  . it   s simply unbelievable      robertson said in a hesitating whisper     it couldn   t have been meant .  i mean  if we weren   t meant to know and if the meteorite was a judgment  from      he faded off under bogert   s withering glare .  bogert said     it   s not a dead loss  i suppose .  other janes are bound to help us in some ways .  and we can give other robots feminine voices  if that will help encourage public acceptance  though i wonder what the women would say .  if we only knew what jane   had said .        in that last call  madarian said there was a witness .     bogert said     i know  i   ve been thinking about that .  don   t you suppose i   ve been in touch with flagstaff .  nobody in the entire place heard jane say anything that was out of the ordinary  anything that sounded like an answer to the habitable planet problem  and certainly anyone there should have recognized the answer if it came   or at least recognized it as a possible answer .        could madarian have been lying .  or crazy .  could he have been trying to protect himself         you mean he may have been trying to save his reputation by pretending he had the answer and then gimmick jane so she couldn   t talk and say     oh  sorry  something happened accidentally .  oh  darn .     i won   t accept that for a minute .  you might as well suppose he had arranged the meteorite .        then what do we do .     bogert said heavily     turn back to flagstaff .  the answer must be there .  i   ve got to dig deeper  that   s all .  i   m going there and i   m taking a couple of the men in madarian   s department .  we   ve got to go through that place top to bottom and end to end .        but  you know  even if there were a witness and he had heard  what good would it do  now that we don   t have jane to explain the process .        every little something is useful .  jane gave the names of the stars  the catalogue numbers probably  none of the named stars has a chance .  if someone can remember her saying that and actually remember the catalogue number  or have heard it clearly enough to allow it to be recovered by psycho probe if he lacked the conscious memory  then we   ll have something .  given the results at the end  and the data fed jane at the beginning  we might be able to reconstruct the line of reasoning  we might recover the intuition .  if that is done  we   ve saved the game      bogert was back after three days  silent and thoroughly depressed .  when robertson inquired anxiously as to results  he shook his head .     nothing .        nothing .        absolutely nothing .  i spoke with every man in flagstaff  every scientist  every technician  every student  that had had anything to do with jane  everyone that had as much as seen her .  the number wasn   t great  i   ll give madarian credit for that much discretion .  he only allowed those to see her who might conceivably have had planetological knowledge to feed her .  there were twenty three men altogether who had seen jane and of those only twelve had spoken to her more than casually .     i went over and over all that jane had said .  they remembered everything quite well .  they   re keen men engaged in a crucial experiment involving their specialty  so they had every motivation to remember .  and they were dealing with a talking robot  something that was startling enough  and one that talked like a tv actress .  they couldn   t forget .     robertson said     maybe a psycho probe         if one of them had the vaguest thought that something had happened  i would screw out his consent to probing .  but there   s nothing to leave room for an excuse  and to probe two dozen men who make their living from their brains can   t be done .  honestly  it wouldn   t help .  if jane had mentioned three stars and said they had habitable planets  it would have been like setting up sky rockets in their brains .  how could anyone of them forget .        then maybe one of them is lying     said robertson grimly .     he wants the information for his own use  to get the credit himself later .        what good would that do him .     said bogert .     the whole establishment knows exactly why madarian and jane were there in the first place .  they know why i came there in the second .  if at any time in the future any man now at flagstaff suddenly comes up with a habitable planet theory that is startlingly new and different  yet valid  every other man at flagstaff and every man at u .  s .  robots will know at once that he had stolen it .  he   d never get away with it .        then madarian himself was somehow mistaken .        i don   t see how i can believe that either .  madarian had an irritating personality  all robopsychologists have irritating personalities  i think  which must be why they work with robots rather than with men  but he was no dummy .  he couldn   t be wrong in something like this .        then      but robertson had run out of possibilities .  they had reached a blank wall and for some minutes each stared at it disconsolately .  finally robertson stirred .     peter         well .        let   s ask susan .     bogert stiffened .     what .        let   s ask susan .  let   s call her and ask her to come in .        why .  what can she possibly do .        i don   t know .  but she   s a robopsychologist  too  and she might understand madarian better than we do .  besides  she  oh  hell  she always had more brains than any of us .        she   s nearly eighty .        and you   re seventy .  what about it .     bogert sighed .  had her abrasive tongue lost any of its rasp in the years of her retirement .  he said     well  i   ll ask her .     susan calvin entered bogert   s office with a slow look around before her eyes fixed themselves on the research director .  she had aged a great deal since her retirement .  her hair was a fine white and her face seemed to have crumpled .  she had grown so frail as to be almost transparent and only her eyes  piercing and uncompromising  seemed to remain of all that had been .  bogert strode forward heartily  holding out his hand .     susan .     susan calvin took it  and said     you   re looking reasonably well  peter  for an old man .  if i were you  i wouldn   t wait till next year .  retire now and let the young men get to it .  .  .  . and madarian is dead .  are you calling me in to take over my old job .  are you determined to keep the ancients till a year past actual physical death .        no  no  susan .  i   ve called you in      he stopped .  he did not  after all  have the faintest idea of how to start .  but susan read his mind now as easily as she always had .  she seated herself with the caution born of stiffened joints and said     peter  you   ve called me in because you   re in bad trouble .  otherwise you   d sooner see me dead than within a mile of you .        come  susan         don   t waste time on pretty talk .  i never had time to waste when i was forty and certainly not now .  madarian   s death and your call to me are both unusual  so there must be a connection .  two unusual events without a connection is too low probability to worry about .  begin at the beginning and don   t worry about revealing yourself to be a fool .  that was revealed to me long ago .     bogert cleared his throat miserably and began .  she listened carefully  her withered hand lifting once in a while to stop him so that she might ask a question .  she snorted at one point .     feminine intuition .  is that what you wanted the robot for .  you men .  faced with a woman reaching a correct conclusion and unable to accept the fact that she is your equal or superior in intelligence  you invent something called feminine intuition .        oh  yes  susan  but let me continue      he did .  when she was told of jane   s contralto voice  she said     it is a difficult choice sometimes whether to feel revolted at the male sex or merely to dismiss them as contemptible .     bogert said     well  let me go on      when he was quite done  susan said     may i have the private use of this office for an hour or two .        yes  but      she said     i want to go over the various records  jane   s programming  madarian   s calls  your interviews at flagstaff .  i presume i can use that beautiful new shielded laser phone and your computer outlet if i wish .        yes  of course .        well  then  get out of here  peter .     it was not quite forty five minutes when she hobbled to the door  opened it  and called for bogert .  when bogert came  robertson was with him .  both entered and susan greeted the latter with an unenthusiastic    hello  scott .     bogert tried desperately to gauge the results from susan   s face  but it was only the face of a grim old lady who had no intention of making anything easy for him .  he said cautiously     do you think there   s anything you can do  susan .        beyond what i have already done .  no .  there   s nothing more .     bogert   s lips set in chagrin  but robertson said     what have you already done  susan .     susan said     i   ve thought a little  something i can   t seem to persuade anyone else to do .  for one thing  i   ve thought about madarian .  i knew him  you know .  he had brains but he was a very irritating extrovert .  i thought you would like him after me  peter .        it was a change     bogert couldn   t resist saying .     and he was always running to you with results the very minute he had them  wasn   t he .        yes  he was .        and yet     said susan     his last message  the one in which he said jane had given him the answer  was sent from the plane .  why did he wait so long .  why didn   t he call you while he was still at flagstaff  immediately after jane had said whatever it was she said .        i suppose     said peter     that for once he wanted to check it thoroughly and  well  i don   t know .  it was the most important thing that had ever happened to him  he might for once have wanted to wait and be sure of himself .        on the contrary  the more important it was  the less he would wait  surely .  and if he could manage to wait  why not do it properly and wait till he was back at u .  s .  robots so that he could check the results with all the computing equipment this firm could make available to him .  in short  he waited too long from one point of view and not long enough from another .     robertson interrupted .     then you think he was up to some trickery      susan looked revolted .     scott  don   t try to compete with peter in making inane remarks .  let me continue .  .  .  . a second point concerns the witness .  according to the records of that last call  madarian said     poor guy jumped two feet when jane suddenly began to reel out the answer in her gorgeous voice .     in fact  it was the last thing he said .  and the question is  then  why should the witness have jumped .  madarian had explained that all the men were crazy about that voice  and they had had ten days with the robot  with jane .  why should the mere act of her speaking have startled them .     bogert said     i assumed it was astonishment at hearing jane give an answer to a problem that has occupied the minds of planetologists for nearly a century .        but they were waiting for her to give that answer .  that was why she was there .  besides  consider the way the sentence is worded .  madarian   s statement makes it seem the witness was startled  not astonished  if you see the difference .  what   s more  that reaction came    when jane suddenly began     in other words  at the very start of the statement .  to be astonished at the content of what jane said would have required the witness to have listened awhile so that he might absorb it .  madarian would have said he had jumped two feet after he had heard jane say thus and so .  it would be    after    not    when    and the word    suddenly    would not be included .     bogert said uneasily     i don   t think you can refine matters down to the use or non use of a word .        i can     said susan frostily     because i am a robopsychologist .  and i can expect madarian to do so  too  because he was a robopsychologist .  we have to explain those two anomalies  then .  the queer delay before madarian   s call and the queer reaction of the witness .        can you explain them .     asked robertson .     of course     said susan     since i use a little simple logic .  madarian called with the news without delay  as he always did  or with as little delay as he could manage .  if jane had solved the problem at flagstaff  he would certainly have called from flagstaff .  since he called from the plane  she must clearly have solved the problem after he had left flagstaff .        but then         let me finish .  let me finish .  was madarian not taken from the airport to flagstaff in a heavy  enclosed ground car .  and jane  in her crate  with him .        yes .        and presumably  madarian and the crated jane returned from flagstaff to the airport in the same heavy  enclosed ground car .  am i right .        yes  of course .        and they were not alone in the ground car  either .  in one of his calls  madarian said     we were chauffeured from the airport to the main administration building     and i suppose i am right in concluding that if he was chauffeured  then that was because there was a chauffeur  a human driver  in the car .        good god .        the trouble with you  peter  is that when you think of a witness to a planetological statement  you think of planetologists .  you divide up human beings into categories  and despise and dismiss most .  a robot cannot do that .  the first law says     a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     any human being .  that is the essence of the robotic view of life .  a robot makes no distinction .  to a robot  all men are truly equal  and to a robopsychologist who must perforce deal with men at the robotic level  all men are truly equal  too .     it would not occur to madarian to say a truck driver had heard the statement .  to you a truck driver is not a scientist but is a mere animate adjunct of a truck  but to madarian he was a man and a witness .  nothing more .  nothing less .     bogert shook his head in disbelief .     but you are sure .        of course i   m sure .  how else can you explain the other point  madarian   s remark about the startling of the witness .  jane was crated  wasn   t she .  but she was not deactivated .  according to the records  madarian was always adamant against ever deactivating an intuitive robot .  moreover  jane    like any of the janes  was extremely non talkative .  probably it never occurred to madarian to order her to remain quiet within the crate  and it was within the crate that the pattern finally fell into place .  naturally she began to talk .  a beautiful contralto voice suddenly sounded from inside the crate .  if you were the truck driver  what would you do at that point .  surely you   d be startled .  it   s a wonder he didn   t crash .        but if the truck driver was the witness  why didn   t he come forward         why .  can he possibly know that anything crucial had happened  that what he heard was important .  besides  don   t you suppose madarian tipped him well and asked him not to say anything .  would you want the news to spread that an activated robot was being transported illegally over the earth   s surface .        well  will he remember what was said .        why not .  it might seem to you  peter  that a truck driver  one step above an ape in your view  can   t remember .  but truck drivers can have brains  too .  the statements were most remarkable and the driver may well have remembered some .  even if he gets some of the letters and numbers wrong  we   re dealing with a finite set  you know  the fifty five hundred stars or star systems within eighty light years or so  i haven   t looked up the exact number .  you can make the correct choices .  and if needed  you will have every excuse to use the psycho probe      the two men stared at her .  finally bogert  afraid to believe  whispered     but how can you be sure .     for a moment  susan was on the point of saying  because i   ve called flagstaff  you fool  and because i spoke to the truck driver  and because he told me what he had heard  and because i   ve checked with the computer at flagstaff and got the only three stars that fit the information  and because i have those names in my pocket .  but she didn   t .  let him go through it all himself .  carefully  she rose to her feet  and said sardonically     how can i be sure .  .  .  . call it feminine intuition .          two climaxes  each of these two stories is post susan calvin .  they are the most recent long stories i have written about robots and in each one i try to take the long view and see what the ultimate end of robotics might be .  and i come full circle  for though i adhere strictly to the three laws  the first story      .  .  . that thou art mindful of him     is clearly a robot as menace story  while the second     the bicentennial man     is even more clearly a robot as pathos story .  of all the robot stories i ever wrote     the bicentennial man    is my favorite and  i think  the best .  in fact  i have a dreadful feeling that i might not care to top it and will never write another serious robot story .  but then again  i might .  i   m not always predictable .    .  .  . that thou art mindful of him  the three laws of robotics    .  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .    .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .    .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .     .   keith harriman  who had for twelve years now been director of research at united states robots and mechanical men corporation  found that he was not at all certain whether he was doing right .  the tip of his tongue passed over his plump but rather pale lips and it seemed to him that the holographic image of the great susan calvin  which stared unsmilingly down upon him  had never looked so grim before .  usually he blanked out that image of the greatest roboticist in history because she unnerved him .   he tried thinking of the image as    it    but never quite succeeded .   this time he didn   t quite dare to and her long dead gaze bored into the side of his face .  it was a dreadful and demeaning step he would have to take .  opposite him was george ten  calm and unaffected either by harriman   s patent uneasiness or by the image of the patron saint of robotics glowing in its niche above .  harriman said     we haven   t had a chance to talk this out  really  george .  you haven   t been with us that long and i haven   t had a good chance to be alone with you .  but now i would like to discuss the matter in some detail .        i am perfectly willing to do that      said george .     in my stay at u .  s .  robots  i have gathered the crisis has something to do with the three laws .        yes .  you know the three laws  of course .        i do .        yes  i   m sure you do .  but let us dig even deeper and consider the truly basic problem .  in two centuries of  if i may say so  considerable success  u .  s .  robots has never managed to persuade human beings to accept robots .  we have placed robots only where work is required that human beings cannot do  or in environments that human beings find unacceptably dangerous .  robots have worked mainly in space and that has limited what we have been able to do .        surely     said george ten     that represents a broad limit  and one within which u .  s .  robots can prosper .        no  for two reasons .  in the first place  the boundaries set for us inevitably contract .  as the moon colony  for instance  grows more sophisticated  its demand for robots decreases and we expect that  within the next few years  robots will be banned on the moon .  this will be repeated on every world colonized by mankind .  secondly  true prosperity is impossible without robots on earth .  we at u .  s .  robots firmly believe that human beings need robots and must learn to live with their mechanical analogues if progress is to be maintained .        do they not .  mr .  harriman  you have on your desk a computer input which  i understand  is connected with the organization   s multivac .  a computer is a kind of sessile robot  a robot brain not attached to a body         true  but that also is limited .  the computers used by mankind have been steadily specialized in order to avoid too humanlike an intelligence .  a century ago we were well on the way to artificial intelligence of the most unlimited type through the use of great computers we called machines .  those machines limited their action of their own accord .  once they had solved the ecological problems that had threatened human society  they phased themselves out .  their own continued existence would  they reasoned  have placed them in the role of a crutch to mankind and  since they felt this would harm human beings  they condemned themselves by the first law .        and were they not correct to do so .        in my opinion  no .  by their action  they reinforced mankind   s frankenstein complex  its gut fears that any artificial man they created would turn upon its creator .  men fear that robots may replace human beings .        do you not fear that yourself .        i know better .  as long as the three laws of robotics exist  they cannot .  they can serve as partners of mankind  they can share in the great struggle to understand and wisely direct the laws of nature so that together they can do more than mankind can possibly do alone  but always in such a way that robots serve human beings .        but if the three laws have shown themselves  over the course of two centuries  to keep robots within bounds  what is the source of the distrust of human beings for robots .        well     and harriman   s graying hair tufted as he scratched his head vigorously     mostly superstition  of course .  unfortunately  there are also some complexities involved that anti robot agitators seize upon .        involving the three laws .        yes .  the second law in particular .  there   s no problem in the third law  you see .  it is universal .  robots must always sacrifice themselves for human beings  any human beings .        of course     said george ten .     the first law is perhaps less satisfactory  since it is always possible to imagine a condition in which a robot must perform either action a or action b  the two being mutually exclusive  and where either action results in harm to human beings .  the robot must therefore quickly select which action results in the least harm .  to work out the positronic paths of the robot brain in such a way as to make that selection possible is not easy .  if action a results in harm to a talented young artist and b results in equivalent harm to five elderly people of no particular worth  which action should be chosen .        action a      said george ten .     harm to one is less than harm to five .        yes  so robots have always been designed to decide .  to expect robots to make judgments of fine points such as talent  intelligence  the general usefulness to society  has always seemed impractical .  that would delay decision to the point where the robot is effectively immobilized .  so we go by numbers .  fortunately  we might expect crises in which robots must make such decisions to be few .  .  .  . but then that brings us to the second law .        the law of obedience .        yes .  the necessity of obedience is constant .  a robot may exist for twenty years without every having to act quickly to prevent harm to a human being  or find itself faced with the necessity of risking its own destruction .  in all that time  however  it will be constantly obeying orders .  .  .  . whose orders .        those of a human being .        any human being .  how do you judge a human being so as to know whether to obey or not .  what is man  that thou art mindful of him  george .     george hesitated at that .  harriman said hurriedly     a biblical quotation .  that doesn   t matter .  i mean  must a robot follow the orders of a child  or of an idiot  or of a criminal  or of a perfectly decent intelligent man who happens to be inexpert and therefore ignorant of the undesirable consequences of his order .  and if two human beings give a robot conflicting orders  which does the robot follow .        in two hundred years     said george ten     have not these problems arisen and been solved .        no     said harriman  shaking his head violently .     we have been hampered by the very fact that our robots have been used only in specialized environments out in space  where the men who dealt with them were experts in their field .  there were no children  no idiots  no criminals  no well meaning ignoramuses present .  even so  there were occasions when damage was done by foolish or merely unthinking orders .  such damage in specialized and limited environments could be contained .  on earth  however  robots must have judgment .  so those against robots maintain  and  damn it  they are right .        then you must insert the capacity for judgment into the positronic brain .        exactly .  we have begun to reproduce jg models in which the robot can weigh every human being with regard to sex  age  social and professional position  intelligence  maturity  social responsibility and so on .        how would that affect the three laws .        the third law not at all .  even the most valuable robot must destroy himself for the sake of the most useless human being .  that cannot be tampered with .  the first law is affected only where alternative actions will all do harm .  the quality of the human beings involved as well as the quantity must be considered  provided there is time for such judgment and the basis for it  which will not be often .  the second law will be most deeply modified  since every potential obedience must involve judgment .  the robot will be slower to obey  except where the first law is also involved  but it will obey more rationally .        but the judgments which are required are very complicated .        very .  the necessity of making such judgments slowed the reactions of our first couple of models to the point of paralysis .  we improved matters in the later models at the cost of introducing so many pathways that the robot   s brain became far too unwieldy .  in our last couple of models  however  i think we have what we want .  the robot doesn   t have to make an instant judgment of the worth of a human being and the value of its orders .  it begins by obeying all human beings as any ordinary robot would and then it learns .  a robot grows  learns and matures .  it is the equivalent of a child at first and must be under constant supervision .  as it grows  however  it can  more and more  be allowed  unsupervised  into earth   s society .  finally  it is a full member of that society .        surely this answers the objections of those who oppose robots .        no     said harriman angrily .     now they raise others .  they will not accept judgments .  a robot  they say  has no right to brand this person or that as inferior .  by accepting the orders of a in preference to that of b  b is branded as of less consequence than a and his human rights are violated .        what is the answer to that .        there is none .  i am giving up .        i see .        as far as i myself am concerned .  .  .  . instead  i turn to you  george .        to me .     george ten   s voice remained level .  there was a mild surprise in it but it did not affect him outwardly .     why to me .        because you are not a man     said harriman tensely .     i told you i want robots to be the partners of human beings .  i want you to be mine .     george ten raised his hands and spread them  palms outward  in an oddly human gesture .     what can i do .        it seems to you  perhaps  that you can do nothing  george .  you were created not long ago  and you are still a child .  you were designed to be not overfull of original information  it was why i have had to explain the situation to you in such detail  in order to leave room for growth .  but you will grow in mind and you will come to be able to approach the problem from a non human standpoint .  where i see no solution  you  from your own other standpoint  may see one .     george ten said     my brain is man designed .  in what way can it be non human .        you are the latest of the jg models  george .  your brain is the most complicated we have yet designed  in some ways more subtly complicated than that of the old giant machines .  it is open ended and  starting on a human basis  may  no  will  grow in any direction .  remaining always within the insurmountable boundaries of the three laws  you may yet become thoroughly non human in your thinking .        do i know enough about human beings to approach this problem rationally .  about their history .  their psychology .        of course not .  but you will learn as rapidly as you can .        will i have help  mr .  harriman .        no .  this is entirely between ourselves .  no one else knows of this and you must not mention this project to any human being  either at u .  s .  robots or elsewhere .     george ten said     are we doing wrong  mr .  harriman  that you seek to keep the matter secret .        no .  but a robot solution will not be accepted  precisely because it is robot in origin .  any suggested solution you have you will turn over to me  and if it seems valuable to me  i will present it .  no one will ever know it came from you .        in the light of what you have said earlier     said george ten calmly     this is the correct procedure .  .  .  . when do i start .        right now .  i will see to it that you have all the necessary films for scanning .       a .   harriman sat alone .  in the artificially lit interior of his office  there was no indication that it had grown dark outside .  he had no real sense that three hours had passed since he had taken george ten back to his cubicle and left him there with the first film references .  he was now merely alone with the ghost of susan calvin  the brilliant roboticist who had  virtually single handed  built up the positronic robot from a massive toy to man   s most delicate and versatile instrument  so delicate and versatile that man dared not use it  out of envy and fear .  it was over a century now since she had died .  the problem of the frankenstein complex had existed in her time  and she had never solved it .  she had never tried to solve it  for there had been no need .  robotics had expanded in her day with the needs of space exploration .  it was the very success of the robots that had lessened man   s need for them and had left harriman  in these latter times   but would susan calvin have turned to robots for help .  surely  she would have   and he sat there long into the night .     .   maxwell robertson was the majority stockholder of u .  s .  robots and in that sense its controller .  he was by no means an impressive person in appearance .  he was well into middle age  rather pudgy  and had a habit of chewing on the right corner of his lower lip when disturbed .  yet in his two decades of association with government figures he had developed a way of handling them .  he tended to use softness  giving in  smiling  and always managing to gain time .  it was growing harder .  gunnar eisenmuth was a large reason for its having grown harder .  in the series of global conservers  whose power had been second only to that of the global executive during the past century  eisenmuth hewed most closely to the harder edge of the gray area of compromise .  he was the first conserver who had not been american by birth and though it could not be demonstrated in any way that the archaic name of u .  s .  robots evoked his hostility  everyone at u .  s .  robots believed that .  there had been a suggestion  by no means the first that year  or that generation  that the corporate name be changed to world robots  but robertson would never allow that .  the company had been originally built with american capital  american brains  and american labor  and though the company had long been worldwide in scope and nature  the name would bear witness to its origin as long as he was in control .  eisenmuth was a tall man whose long sad face was coarsely textured and coarsely featured .  he spoke global with a pronounced american accent  although he had never been in the united states prior to his taking office .     it seems perfectly clear to me  mr .  robertson .  there is no difficulty .  the products of your company are always rented  never sold .  if the rented property on the moon is now no longer needed  it is up to you to receive the products back and transfer them .        yes  conserver  but where .  it would be against the law to bring them to earth without a government permit and that has been denied .        they would be of no use to you here .  you can take them to mercury or to the asteroids .        what would we do with them there .     eisenmuth shrugged .     the ingenious men of your company will think of something .     robertson shook his head .     it would represent an enormous loss for the company .        i   m afraid it would     said eisenmuth  unmoved .     i understand the company has been in poor financial condition for several years now .        largely because of government imposed restrictions  conserver .        you must be realistic  mr .  robertson .  you know that the climate of public opinion is increasingly against robots .        wrongly so  conserver .        but so  nevertheless .  it may be wiser to liquidate the company .  it is merely a suggestion  of course .        your suggestions have force  conserver .  is it necessary to tell you that our machines  a century ago  solved the ecological crisis .        i   m sure mankind is grateful  but that was a long time ago .  we now live in alliance with nature  however uncomfortable that might be at times  and the past is dim .        you mean what have we done for mankind lately .        i suppose i do .        surely we can   t be expected to liquidate instantaneously  not without enormous losses .  we need time .        how much .        how much can you give us .        it   s not up to me .     robertson said softly .     we are alone .  we need play no games .  how much time can you give me .     eisenmuth   s expression was that of a man retreating into inner calculations .     i think you can count on two years .  i   ll be frank .  the global government intends to take over the firm and phase it out for you if you don   t do it by then yourself  more or less .  and unless there is a vast turn in public opinion  which i greatly doubt      he shook his head .     two years  then     said robertson softly .    a .   robertson sat alone .  there was no purpose to his thinking and it had degenerated into retrospection .  four generations of robertsons had headed the firm .  none of them was a roboticist .  it had been men such as lanning and bogert and  most of all  most of all  susan calvin  who had made u .  s .  robots what it was  but surely the four robertsons had provided the climate that had made it possible for them to do their work .  without u .  s .  robots  the twenty first century would have progressed into deepening disaster .  that it didn   t was due to the machines that had for a generation steered mankind through the rapids and shoals of history .  and now for that  he was given two years .  what could be done in two years to overcome the insuperable prejudices of mankind .  he didn   t know .  harriman had spoken hopefully of new ideas but would go into no details .  just as well  for robertson would have understood none of it .  but what could harriman do anyway .  what had anyone ever done against man   s intense antipathy toward the imitation .  nothing   robertson drifted into a half sleep in which no inspiration came .     .   harriman said     you have it all now  george ten .  you have had everything i could think of that is at all applicable to the problem .  as far as sheer mass of information is concerned  you have stored more in your memory concerning human beings and their ways  past and present  than i have  or than any human being could have .        that is very likely .        is there anything more that you need  in your own opinion .        as far as information is concerned  i find no obvious gaps .  there may be matters unimagined at the boundaries .  i cannot tell .  but that would be true no matter how large a circle of information i took in .        true .  nor do we have time to take in information forever .  robertson has told me that we only have two years  and a quarter of one of those years has passed .  can you suggest anything .        at the moment  mr .  harriman  nothing .  i must weigh the information and for that purpose i could use help .        from me .        no .  most particularly  not from you .  you are a human being  of intense qualifications  and whatever you say may have the partial force of an order and may inhibit my considerations .  nor any other human being  for the same reason  especially since you have forbidden me to communicate with any .        but in that case  george  what help .        from another robot  mr .  harriman .        what other robot .        there are others of the jg series which were constructed .  i am the tenth  jg    .        the earlier ones were useless  experimental         mr .  harriman  george nine exists .        well  but what use will he be .  he is very much like you except for certain lacks .  you are considerably the more versatile of the two .        i am certain of that     said george ten .  he nodded his head in a grave gesture .     nevertheless  as soon as i create a line of thought  the mere fact that i have created it commends it to me and i find it difficult to abandon it .   f i can  after the development of a line of thought  express it to george nine  he would consider it without having first created it .  he would therefore view it without prior bent .  he might see gaps and shortcomings that i might not .     harriman smiled .     two heads are better than one  in other words  eh  george .        if by that  mr .  harriman  you mean two individuals with one head apiece  yes .        right .  is there anything else you want .        yes .  something more than films .  i have viewed much concerning human beings and their world .  i have seen human beings here at u .  s .  robots and can check my interpretation of what i have viewed against direct sensory impressions .  not so concerning the physical world .  i have never seen it and my viewing is quite enough to tell me that my surroundings here are by no means representative of it .  i would like to see it .        the physical world .     harriman seemed stunned at the enormity of the thought for a moment .     surely you don   t suggest i take you outside the grounds of u .  s .  robots .        yes  that is my suggestion .        that   s illegal at any time .  in the climate of opinion today  it would be fatal .        if we are detected  yes .  i do not suggest you take me to a city or even to a dwelling place of human beings .  i would like to see some open region  without human beings .        that  too  is illegal .        if we are caught .  need we be .     harriman said     how essential is this  george .        i cannot tell  but it seems to me it would be useful .        do you have something in mind .     george ten seemed to hesitate .     i cannot tell .  it seems to me that i might have something in mind if certain areas of uncertainty were reduced .        well  let me think about it .  and meanwhile  i   ll check out george nine and arrange to have you occupy a single cubicle .  that at least can be done without trouble .       a .   george ten sat alone .  he accepted statements tentatively  put them together  and drew a conclusion  over and over again  and from conclusions built other statements which he accepted and tested and found a contradiction and rejected  or not  and tentatively accepted further .  at none of the conclusions he reached did he feel wonder  surprise  satisfaction  merely a note of plus or minus .     .   harriman   s tension was not noticeably decreased even after they had made a silent downward landing on robertson   s estate .  robertson had countersigned the order making the dyna foil available  and the silent aircraft  moving as easily vertically as horizontally  had been large enough to carry the weight of harriman  george ten  and  of course  the pilot .   the dyna foil itself was one of the consequences of the machine catalyzed invention of the proton micro pile which supplied pollution free energy in small doses .  nothing had been done since of equal importance to man   s comfort  harriman   s lips tightened at the thought  and yet it had not earned gratitude for u .  s .  robots .   the air flight between the grounds of u .  s .  robots and the robertson estate had been the tricky part .  had they been stopped then  the presence of a robot aboard would have meant a great set of complications .  it would be the same on the way back .  the estate itself  it might be argued  it would be argued  was part of the property of u .  s .  robots and on that property  robots  properly supervised  might remain .  the pilot looked back and his eyes rested with gingerly briefness on george ten .     you want to get out at all  mr .  harriman .        yes .        it  too .        oh  yes .     then  just a bit sardonically     i won   t leave you alone with him .     george ten descended first and harriman followed .  they had come down on the foil port and not too far off was the garden .  it was quite a showplace and harriman suspected that robertson used juvenile hormone to control insect life without regard to environmental formulas .     come  george     said harriman .     let me show you .     together they walked toward the garden .  george said     it is a little as i have imaged it .  my eyes are not properly designed to detect wavelength differences  so i may not recognize different objects by that alone .        i trust you are not distressed at being color blind .  we needed too many positronic paths for your sense of judgment and were unable to spare any for sense of color .  in the future  if there is a future         i understand  mr .  harriman .  enough differences remain to show me that there are here many different forms of plant life .        undoubtedly .  dozens .        and each coequal with man  biologically .        each is a separate species  yes .  there are millions of species of living creatures .        of which the human being forms but one .        by far the most important to human beings  however .        and to me  mr .  harriman .  but i speak in the biological sense .        i understand .        life  then  viewed through all its forms  is incredibly complex .        yes  george  that   s the crux of the problem .  what man does for his own desires and comforts affects the complex total of life  the ecology  and his short term gains can bring long term disadvantages .  the machines taught us to set up a human society which would minimize that  but the near disaster of the early twenty first century has left mankind suspicious of innovations .  that  added to its special fear of robots         i understand  mr .  harriman .  .  .  . that is an example of animal life  i feel certain .        that is a squirrel  one of many species of squirrels .     the tail of the squirrel flirted as it passed to the other side of the tree    and this     said george  his arm moving with flashing speed     is a tiny thing indeed .     he held it between his fingers and peered at it .     it is an insect  some sort of beetle .  there are thousands of species of beetles .        with each individual beetle as alive as the squirrel and as yourself .        as complete and independent an organism as any other  within the total ecology .  there are smaller organisms still  many too small to see .        and that is a tree  is it not .  and it is hard to the touch        a .   the pilot sat alone .  he would have liked to stretch his own legs but some dim feeling of safety kept him in the dyna foil .  if that robot went out of control  he intended to take off at once .  but how could he tell if it went out of control .  he had seen many robots .  that was unavoidable considering he was mr .  robertson   s private pilot .  always  though  they had been in the laboratories and warehouses  where they belonged  with many specialists in the neighborhood .  true  dr .  harriman was a specialist .  none better  they said .  but a robot here was where no robot ought to be  on earth  in the open  free to move  he wouldn   t risk his good job by telling anyone about this  but it wasn   t right .     .   george ten said     the films i have viewed are accurate in terms of what i have seen .  have you completed those i selected for you  nine .        yes     said george nine .  the two robots sat stiffly  face to face  knee to knee  like an image and its reflection .  dr .  harriman could have told them apart at a glance  for he was acquainted with the minor differences in physical design .  if he could not see them  but could talk to them  he could still tell them apart  though with somewhat less certainty  for george nine   s responses would be subtly different from those produced by the substantially more intricately patterned positronic brain paths of george ten .     in that case     said george ten     give me your reactions to what i will say .  first  human beings fear and distrust robots because they regard robots as competitors .  how may that be prevented .        reduce the feeling of competitiveness     said george nine     by shaping the robot as something other than a human being .        yet the essence of a robot is its positronic replication of life .  a replication of life in a shape not associated with life might arouse horror .        there are two million species of life forms .  choose one of those as the shape rather than that of a human being .        which of all those species .     george nine   s thought processes proceeded noiselessly for some three seconds .     one large enough to contain a positronic brain  but one not possessing unpleasant associations for human beings .        no form of land life has a braincase large enough for a positronic brain but an elephant  which i have not seen  but which is described as very large  and therefore frightening to man .  how would you meet this dilemma .        mimic a life form no larger than a man but enlarge the braincase .     george ten said     a small horse  then  or a large dog  would you say .  both horses and dogs have long histories of association with human beings .        then that is well .        but consider  a robot with a positronic brain would mimic human intelligence .  if there were a horse or a dog that could speak and reason like a human being  there would be competitiveness there  too .  human beings might be all the more distrustful and angry at such unexpected competition from what they consider a lower form of life .     george nine said     make the positronic brain less complex  and the robot less nearly intelligent .        the complexity bottleneck of the positronic brain rests in the three laws .  a less complex brain could not possess the three laws in full measure .     george nine said at once     that cannot be done .     george ten said     i have also come to a dead end there .  that  then  is not a personal peculiarity in my own line of thought and way of thinking .  let us start again .  .  .  . under what conditions might the third law not be necessary .     george nine stirred as if the question were difficult and dangerous .  but he said     if a robot were never placed in a position of danger to itself  or if a robot were so easily replaceable that it did not matter whether it were destroyed or not .        and under what conditions might the second law not be necessary .     george nine   s voice sounded a bit hoarse .     if a robot were designed to respond automatically to certain stimuli with fixed responses and if nothing else were expected of it  so that no order need ever be given it .        and under what conditions     george ten paused here      might the first law not be necessary .     george nine paused longer and his words came in a low whisper     if the fixed responses were such as never to entail danger to human beings .        imagine  then  a positronic brain that guides only a few responses to certain stimuli and is simply and cheaply made  so that it does not require the three laws .  how large need it be .        not at all large .  depending on the responses demanded  it might weigh a hundred grams  one gram  one milligram .        your thoughts accord with mine .  i shall see dr .  harriman .       a .   george nine sat alone .  he went over and over the questions and answers .  there was no way in which he could change them .  and yet the thought of a robot of any kind  of any size  of any shape  of any purpose  without the three laws  left him with an odd  discharged feeling .  he found it difficult to move .  surely george ten had a similar reaction .  yet he had risen from his seat easily .     .   it had been a year and a half since robertson had been closeted with eisenmuth in private conversation .  in that interval  the robots had been taken off the moon and all the far flung activities of u .  s .  robots had withered .  what money robertson had been able to raise had been placed into this one quixotic venture of harriman   s .  it was the last throw of the dice  here in his own garden .  a year ago  harriman had taken the robot here  george ten  the last full robot that u .  s .  robots had manufactured .  now harriman was here with something else harriman seemed to be radiating confidence .  he was talking easily with eisenmuth  and robertson wondered if he really felt the confidence he seemed to have .  he must .  in robertson   s experience  harriman was no actor .  eisenmuth left harriman  smiling  and came up to robertson .  eisenmuth   s smile vanished at once .     good morning  robertson     he said .     what is your man up to .        this is his show     said robertson evenly .     i   ll leave it to him .     harriman called out     i am ready  conserver .        with what  harriman .        with my robot  sir .        your robot .     said eisenmuth .     you have a robot here .     he looked about with a stem disapproval that yet had an admixture of curiosity .     this is u .  s .  robots    property  conserver .  at least we consider it as such .        and where is the robot  dr .  harriman .        in my pocket  conserver     said harriman cheerfully .  what came out of a capacious jacket pocket was a small glass jar .     that .     said eisenmuth incredulously .     no  conserver     said harriman .     this .     from the other pocket came out an object some five inches long and roughly in the shape of a bird .  in place of the beak  there was a narrow tube  the eyes were large  and the tail was an exhaust channel .  eisenmuth   s thick eyebrows drew together .     do you intend a serious demonstration of some sort  dr .  harriman  or are you mad .        be patient for a few minutes  conserver     said harriman .     a robot in the shape of a bird is none the less a robot for that .  and the positronic brain it possesses is no less delicate for being tiny .  this other object i hold is a jar of fruit flies .  there are fifty fruit flies in it which will be released .        and         the robo bird will catch them .  will you do the honors  sir .     harriman handed the jar to eisenmuth  who stared at it  then at those around him  some officials from u .  s .  robots  others his own aides .  harriman waited patiently .  eisenmuth opened the jar  then shook it .  harriman said softly to the robo bird resting on the palm of his right hand     go .     the robo bird was gone .  it was a whizz through the air  with no blur of wings  only the tiny workings of an unusually small proton micro pile .  it could be seen now and then in a small momentary hover and then it whirred on again .  all over the garden  in an intricate pattern it flew  and then was back in harriman   s palm  faintly warm .  a small pellet appeared in the palm  too  like a bird dropping .  harriman said     you are welcome to study the robo bird  conserver  and to arrange demonstrations on your own terms .  the fact is that this bird will pick up fruit flies unerringly  only those  only the one species drosophila melanogaster  pick them up  kill them  and compress them for disposition .     eisenmuth reached out his hand and touched the robo bird gingerly     and therefore  mr .  harriman .  do go on .     harriman said     we cannot control insects effectively without risking damage to the ecology .  chemical insecticides are too broad  juvenile hormones too limited .  the robo bird  however  can preserve large areas without being consumed .  they can be as specific as we care to make them  a different robo bird for each species .  they judge by size  shape  color  sound  behavior pattern .  they might even conceivably use molecular detection  smell  in other words .     eisenmuth said     you would still be interfering with the ecology .  the fruit flies have a natural life cycle that would be disrupted .        minimally .  we are adding a natural enemy to the fruit fly life cycle  one which cannot go wrong .  if the fruit fly supply runs short  the robo bird simply does nothing .  it does not multiply  it does not turn to other foods  it does not develop undesirable habits of its own .  it does nothing .        can it be called back .        of course .  we can build robo animals to dispose of any pest .  for that matter  we can build robo animals to accomplish constructive purposes within the pattern of the ecology .  although we do not anticipate the need  there is nothing inconceivable in the possibility of robo bees designed to fertilize specific plants  or robo earthworms designed to mix the soil .  whatever you wish         but why .        to do what we have never done before .  to adjust the ecology to our needs by strengthening its parts rather than disrupting it .  .  .  .  don   t you see .  ever since the machines put an end to the ecology crisis  mankind has lived in an uneasy truce with nature  afraid to move in any direction .  this has been stultifying us  making a kind of intellectual coward of humanity so that he begins to mistrust all scientific advance  all change .     eisenmuth said  with an edge of hostility     you offer us this  do you  in exchange for permission to continue with your program of robots  i mean ordinary  man shaped ones .        no .     harriman gestured violently .     that is over .  it has served its purpose .  it has taught us enough about positronic brains to make it possible for us to cram enough pathways into a tiny brain to make a robo bird .  we can turn to such things now and be prosperous enough .  u .  s .  robots will supply the necessary knowledge and skill and we will work in complete cooperation with the department of global conservation .  we will prosper .  you will prosper .  mankind will prosper .     eisenmuth was silent  thinking .  when it was all over   a .   eisenmuth sat alone .  he found himself believing .  he found excitement welling up within him .  though u .  s .  robots might be the hands  the government would be the directing mind .  he himself would be the directing mind .  if he remained in office five more years  as he well might  that would be time enough to see the robotic support of the ecology become accepted  ten more years  and his own name would be linked with it indissolubly .  was it a disgrace to want to be remembered for a great and worthy revolution in the condition of man and the globe .     .   robertson had not been on the grounds of u .  s .  robots proper since the day of the demonstration .  part of the reason had been his more or less constant conferences at the global executive mansion .  fortunately  harriman had been with him  for most of the time he would  if left to himself  not have known what to say .  the rest of the reason for not having been at u .  s .  robots was that he didn   t want to be .  he was in his own house now  with harriman .  he felt an unreasoning awe of harriman .  harriman   s expertise in robotics had never been in question  but the man had  at a stroke  saved u .  s .  robots from certain extinction  and somehow  robertson felt  the man hadn   t had it in him .  and yet   he said     you   re not superstitious  are you  harriman .        in what way  mr .  robertson .        you don   t think that some aura is left behind by someone who is dead .     harriman licked his lips .  somehow he didn   t have to ask .     you mean susan calvin  sir .        yes  of course     said robertson hesitantly .     we   re in the business of making worms and birds and bugs now .  what would she say .  i feel disgraced .     harriman made a visible effort not to laugh .     a robot is a robot  sir .  worm or man  it will do as directed and labor on behalf of the human being and that is the important thing .        no     peevishly .     that isn   t so .  i can   t make myself believe that .        it is so  mr .  robertson     said harriman earnestly .     we are going to create a world  you and i  that will begin  at last  to take positronic robots of some kind for granted .  the average man may fear a robot that looks like a man and that seems intelligent enough to replace him  but he will have no fear of a robot that looks like a bird and that does nothing more than eat bugs for his benefit .  then  eventually  after he stops being afraid of some robots  he will stop being afraid of all robots .  he will be so used to a robo bird and a robo bee and a robo worm that a robo man will strike him as but an extension .     robertson looked sharply at the other .  he put his hands behind his back and walked the length of the room with quick  nervous steps .  he walked back and looked at harriman again .     is this what you   ve been planning .        yes  and even though we dismantle all our humanoid robots  we can keep a few of the most advanced of our experimental models and go on designing additional ones  still more advanced  to be ready for the day that will surely come .        the agreement  harriman  is that we are to build no more humanoid robots .        and we won   t .  there is nothing that says we can   t keep a few of those already built as long as they never leave the factory .  there is nothing that says we can   t design positronic brains on paper  or prepare brain models for testing .        how do we explain doing so  though .  we will surely be caught at it .        if we are  then we can explain we are doing it in order to develop principles that will make it possible to prepare more complex microbrains for the new animal robots we are making .  we will even be telling the truth .     robertson muttered     let me take a walk outside .  i want to think about this .  no  you stay here .  i want to think about it myself .       a .   harriman sat alone .  he was ebullient .  it would surely work .  there was no mistaking the eagerness with which one government official after another had seized on the program once it had been explained .  how was it possible that no one at u .  s .  robots had ever thought of such a thing .  not even the great susan calvin had ever thought of positronic brains in terms of living creatures other than human .  but now  mankind would make the necessary retreat from the humanoid robot  a temporary retreat  that would lead to a return under conditions in which fear would be abolished at last .  and then  with the aid and partnership of a positronic brain roughly equivalent to man   s own  and existing only  thanks to the three laws  to serve man  and backed by a robot supported ecology  too  what might the human race not accomplish .  for one short moment  he remembered that it was george ten who had explained the nature and purpose of the robot supported ecology  and then he put the thought away angrily .  george ten had produced the answer because he  harriman  had ordered him to do so and had supplied the data and surroundings required .  the credit was no more george ten   s than it would have been a slide rule   s .     .   george ten and george nine sat side by side in parallel .  neither moved .  they sat so for months at a time between those occasions when harriman activated them for consultation .  they would sit so  george ten dispassionately realized  perhaps for many years .  the proton micro pile would  of course  continue to power them and keep the positronic brain paths going with that minimum intensity required to keep them operative .  it would continue to do so through all the periods of inactivity to come .  the situation was rather analogous to what might be described as sleep in human beings  but there were no dreams .  the awareness of george ten and george nine was limited  slow  and spasmodic  but what there was of it was of the real world .  they could talk to each other occasionally in barely heard whispers  a word or syllable now  another at another time  whenever the random positronic surges briefly intensified above the necessary threshold .  to each it seemed a connected conversation carried on in a glimmering passage of time .     why are we so .     whispered george nine .     the human beings will not accept us otherwise     whispered george ten     they will  someday .        when .        in some years .  the exact time does not matter .  man does not exist alone but is part of an enormously complex pattern of life forms .  when enough of that pattern is roboticized  then we will be accepted .        and then what .     even in the long drawn out stuttering fashion of the conversation  there was an abnormally long pause after that .  at last  george ten whispered     let me test your thinking .  you are equipped to learn to apply the second law properly .  you must decide which human being to obey and which not to obey when there is a conflict in orders .  or whether to obey a human being at all .  what must you do  fundamentally  to accomplish that .        i must define the term    human being      whispered george nine .     how .  by appearance .  by composition .  by size and shape .        no .  of two human beings equal in all external appearances  one may be intelligent  another stupid  one may be educated  another ignorant  one may be mature  another childish  one may be responsible  another malevolent .        then how do you define a human being .        when the second law directs me to obey a human being  i must take it to mean that i must obey a human being who is fit by mind  character  and knowledge to give me that order  and where more than one human being is involved  the one among them who is most fit by mind  character  and knowledge to give that order .        and in that case  how will you obey the first law .        by saving all human beings from harm  and by never  through inaction  allowing any human being to come to harm .  yet if by each of all possible actions  some human beings will come to harm  then to so act as to insure that the human being most fit by mind  character  and knowledge will suffer the least harm .        your thoughts accord with mine     whispered george ten .     now i must ask the question for which i originally requested your company .  it is something i dare not judge myself .  i must have your judgment  that of someone outside the circle of my own thoughts .  .  .  . of the reasoning individuals you have met  who possesses the mind  character  and knowledge that you find superior to the rest  disregarding shape and form since that is irrelevant .        you     whispered george nine .     but i am a robot .  there is in your brain paths a criterion for distinguishing between a robot of metal and a human being of flesh .  how then can you classify me as a human being .        because there is in my brain paths an urgent need to disregard shape and form in judging human beings and it rises superior to the distinction between metal and flesh .  you are a human being  george ten  and more fit than the others .        and i find that of you     whispered george ten .     by the criteria of judgment built into ourselves  then  we find ourselves to be human beings within the meaning of the three laws  and human beings  moreover  to be given priority over those others .     george nine whispered     what will come to pass  then  when we are accepted by those others .     george ten whispered     when we and others  which will yet be designed more advanced than ourselves  are accepted  we will order our actions so that a society will eventually be formed in which human beings like ourselves are primarily kept from harm .  by the three laws  the human beings like the others are of lesser account and can neither be obeyed nor protected when that conflicts with the need of obedience to those like ourselves and of protection of those like ourselves .  it was with that in mind that i directed the beginning of the roboticization of the world   s ecology .     the conversation took a month and the flickering of the positronic paths burned low .  there was nothing more that needed to be said between them  but occasionally an unexpressed thought flickered within themselves as they waited  with endless patience  for the necessary years to pass .    a .   george ten and george nine sat alone .  their thoughts were oddly alike and might not be distinguished .  they thought  the human beings like the others might never have intented to blur the distinction between themselves and the human beings like the georges .  yet they had done so inadvertently .  they might now realize their mistake and attempt to correct it  but they must not .  at every consultation  the guidance of the georges had been with that in mind .  at all costs  the georges and those that followed in their shape and kind must dominate .  that was demanded  and any other course made utterly impossible  by the three laws of humanics .   the bicentennial man  the three laws of robotics   .  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .    .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .    .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .     .   andrew martin said     thank you     and took the seat offered him .  he didn   t look driven to the last resort  but he had been .  he didn   t  actually  look anything  for there was a smooth blankness  to his face  except for the sadness one imagined one saw in his eyes .  his hair was smooth  light brown  rather fine  and he had no facial hair .  he looked freshly and cleanly shaved .  his clothes were distinctly old fashioned  but neat  and predominantly a velvety red purple in color .  facing him from behind the desk was the surgeon .  the nameplate on the desk included a fully identifying series of letters and numbers which andrew didn   t bother with .  to call him doctor would be quite enough .     when can the operation be carried through  doctor .     he asked .  softly  with that certain inalienable note of respect that a robot always used to a human being  the surgeon said     i am not certain  sir  that i understand how or upon whom such an operation could be performed .     there might have been a look of respectful intransigence on the surgeon   s face  if a robot of his sort  in lightly bronzed stainless steel  could have such an expression   or any expression .  andrew martin studied the robot   s right hand  his cutting hand  as it lay motionless on the desk .  the fingers were long and were shaped into artistically metallic  looping curves so graceful and appropriate that one could imagine a scalpel fitting them and becoming  temporarily  one piece with them .  there would be no hesitation in his work  no stumbling  no quivering  no mistakes .  that confidence came with specialization  of course  a specialization so fiercely desired by humanity that few robots were  any longer  independently brained .  a surgeon  of course  would have to be .  but this one  though brained  was so limited in his capacity that he did not recognize andrew  had probably never heard of him .     have you ever thought you would like to be a man .     andrew asked .  the surgeon hesitated a moment  as though the question fitted nowhere in his allotted positronic pathways .     but i am a robot  sir .        would it be better to be a man .        if would be better  sir  to be a better surgeon .  i could not be so if i were a man  but only if i were a more advanced robot .  i would be pleased to be a more advanced robot .        it does not offend you that i can order you about .  that i can make you stand up  sit down  move right or left  by merely telling you to do so .        it is my pleasure to please you  sir .  if your orders were to interfere with my functioning with respect to you or to any other human being  i would not obey you .  the first law  concerning my duty to human safety  would take precedence over the second law relating to obedience .  otherwise  obedience is my pleasure .  now  upon whom am i to perform this operation .        upon me     andrew said .     but that is impossible .  it is patently a damaging operation .        that does not matter     said andrew  calmly .     i must not inflict damage     said the surgeon .     on a human being  you must not     said andrew     but i  too  am a robot .        .   andrew had appeared much more a robot when he had first been   manufactured .  he had then been as much a robot in appearance as any that had ever existed  smoothly designed and functional .  he had done well in the home to which he had been brought in those days when robots in households  or on the planet altogether  had been a rarity .  there had been four in the home  sir and ma   am and miss and little miss .  he knew their names  of course  but he never used them .  sir was gerald martin .  his own serial number was ndr   he eventually forgot the numbers .  it had been a long time  of course  but if he had wanted to remember  he could not have forgotten .  he had not wanted to remember .  little miss had been the first to call him andrew  because she could not use the letters  and all the rest followed her in this .  little miss   she had lived for ninety years and was long since dead .  he had tried to call her ma   am once  but she would not allow it .  little miss she had been to her last day .  andrew had been intended to perform the duties of a valet  a butler  even a lady   s maid .  those were the experimental days for him and  indeed  for all robots anywhere save in the industrial and exploratory factories and stations off earth .  the martins enjoyed him  and half the time he was prevented from doing his work because miss and little miss wanted to play with him .  it was miss who first understood how this might be arranged .     we order you to play with us and you must follow orders .        i am sorry  miss  but a prior order from sir must surely take precedence .     but she said     daddy just said he hoped you would take care of the cleaning .  that   s not much of an order .  i order you .     sir did not mind .  sir was fond of miss and of little miss  even more than ma   am was  and andrew was fond of them  too .  at least  the effect they had upon his actions were those which in a human being would have been called the result of fondness .  andrew thought of it as fondness for he did not know any other word for it .  it was for little miss that andrew had carved a pendant out of wood .  she had ordered him to .  miss  it seemed  had received an ivorite pendant with scrollwork for her birthday and little miss was unhappy over it .  she had only a piece of wood  which she gave andrew together with a small kitchen knife .  he had done it quickly and little miss had said     that   s nice  andrew .  i   ll show it to daddy .     sir would not believe it .     where did you really get this  mandy .     mandy was what he called little miss .  when little miss assured him she was really telling the truth  he turned to andrew .     did you do this  andrew .        yes  sir .        the design  too .        yes  sir .        from what did you copy the design .        it is a geometric representation  sir  that fits the grain of the wood .     the next day  sir brought him another piece of wood   a larger one   and an electric vibro knife .     make something out of this  andrew .  anything you want to     he said .  andrew did so as sir watched  then looked at the product a long time .  after that  andrew no longer waited on tables .  he was ordered to read books on furniture design instead  and he learned to make cabinets and desks .     these are amazing productions  andrew     sir soon told him .     i enjoy doing them  sir     andrew admitted .     enjoy .        it makes the circuits of my brain somehow flow more easily .  i have heard you use the word  enjoy    and the way you use it fits the way i feel .  i enjoy doing them  sir .        .   gerald martin took andrew to the regional offices of the united states robots and mechanical men corporation .  as a member of the regional legislature he had no trouble at all in gaining an interview with the chief robopsychologist .  in fact  it was only as a member of the regional legislature that he qualified as a robot owner in the first place   in those early days when robots were rare .  andrew did not understand any of this at the time .  but in later years  with greater learning  he could re view that early scene and understand it in its proper light .  the robopsychologist  merton mansky  listened with a growing frown and more than once managed to stop his fingers at the point beyond which they would have irrevocably drummed on the table .  he had drawn features and a lined forehead  but he might actually have been younger than he looked .     robotics is not an exact art  mr .  martin     mansky explained .     i cannot explain it to you in detail  but the mathematics governing the plotting of the positronic pathways is far too complicated to permit of any but approximate solutions .  naturally  since we build everything around the three laws  those are incontrovertible .  we will  of course  replace your robot         not at all     said sir .     there is no question of failure on his part .  he performs his assigned duties perfectly .  the point is he also carves wood in exquisite fashion and never the same twice .  he produces works of art .     mansky looked confused .     strange .  of course  we   re attempting generalized pathways these days .  really creative  you think .        see for yourself .     sir handed over a little sphere of wood on which there was a playground scene in which the boys and girls were almost too small to make out  yet they were in perfect proportion and they blended so naturally with the grain that it  too  seemed to have been carved .  mansky was incredulous .     he did that .     he handed it back with a shake of his head .     the luck of the draw .  something in the pathways .        can you do it again .        probably not .  nothing like this has ever been reported .        good .  i don   t in the least mind andrew   s being the only one .        i suspect that the company would like to have your robot back for study     mansky said .     not a chance .     sir said with sudden grimness .     forget it .     he turned to andrew     let   s go home  now .        .   miss was dating boys and wasn   t about the house much .  it was little miss  not as little as she once was  who filled andrew   s horizon now .  she never forgot that the very first piece of wood carving he had done had been for her .  she kept it on a silver chain about her neck .  it was she who first objected to sir   s habit of giving away andrew   s work .     come on  dad  if anyone wants one of them  let him pay for it .  it   s worth it .        it isn   t like you to be greedy  mandy .        not for us  dad .  for the artist .     andrew had never heard the word before  and when he had a moment to himself he looked it up in the dictionary .  then there was another trip  this time to sir   s lawyer .     what do you think of this  john .     sir asked .  the lawyer was john finegold .  he had white hair and a pudgy belly  and the rims of his contact lenses were tinted a bright green .  he looked at the small plaque sir had given him .     this is beautiful .  but i   ve already heard the news .  isn   t thus a carving made by your robot .  the one you   ve brought with you .        yes  andrew does them .  don   t you  andrew .        yes  sir     said andrew .     how much would you pay for that  john .     sir asked .     i can   t say .  i   m not a collector of such things .        would you believe i have been offered two hundred and fifty dollars for that small thing .  andrew has made chairs that have sold for five hundred dollars .  there   s two hundred thousand dollars in the bank from andrew   s products .        good heavens  he   s making you rich  gerald .        half rich     said sir .     half of it is in an account in the name of andrew martin .        the robot .        that   s right  and i want to know if it   s legal .        legal  .   .   .   .     feingold   s chair creaked as he leaned back in it .     there are no precedents  gerald .  how did your robot sign the necessary papers .        he can sign his name .  now  is there anything further that ought to be done .        um .     feingold   s eyes seemed to turn inward for a moment .  then he said     well  we can set up a trust to handle all finances in his name and that will place a layer of insulation between him and the hostile world .  beyond that  my advice is you do nothing .  no one has e stopped you so far .  if anyone objects  let him bring suit       and will you take the case if the suit is brought .        for a retainer  certainly .        how much .        something like that     feingold said  and pointed to the wooden plaque .     fair enough     said sir .  feingold chuckled as he turned to the robot .     andrew  are you pleased that you have money .        yes  sir .        what do you plan to do with it .     pay for things  sir  which otherwise sir    would have to pay for .  it would save him expense  sir .        .   such occasions    arose .  repairs were expensive  and revisions were even more so .  with the years  new models of robots were produced and sir saw to it that andrew had the advantage of every new device  until he was a model of metallic excellence .  it was all done at andrew   s expense .  andrew insisted on that .  only his positronic pathways were untouched .  sir insisted on that .     the new models aren   t as good as you are  andrew     he said .     the new robots are worthless .  the company has learned to make the pathways more precise  more closely on the nose  more deeply on the track .  the new robots don   t shift .  they do what they   re designed for and never stray .  i like you better .        thank you  sir .        and it   s your doing  andrew  don   t you forget that .  i am certain mansky put an end to generalized pathways as soon as he had a good look at you .  he didn   t like the unpredictability .  do you know how many times he asked for you back so he could place you under study .  nine times .  i never let him have you  though  and now that he   s retired  we may have some peace .     so sir   s hair thinned and grayed and his face grew pouchy  while andrew looked even better than he had when he first joined the family .  ma   am had joined an art colony somewhere in europe  and miss was a poet in new york .  they wrote sometimes  but not often .  little miss was married and lived not far away .  she said she did not want to leave andrew .  when her child  little sir  was born  she let andrew hold the bottle and feed him .  with the birth of a grandson  andrew felt that sir finally had someone to replace those who had gone .  therefore  it would not be so unfair now to come to him with the request .     sir  it is kind of you to have allowed me to spend my money as i wished       it was your money  andrew .        only by your voluntary act  sir .  i do not believe the law would have stopped you from keeping it all .        the law won   t persuade me to do wrong  andrew .        despite all expenses  and despite taxes  too  sir  i have nearly six hundred thousand dollars .        i know that  andrew .        i want to give it to you  sir .        i won   t take it  andrew       in exchange for something you can give me  sir       oh .  what is that  andrew .        my freedom  sir .        your         i wish to buy my freedom  sir .        .   it wasn   t that easy .  sir had flushed  had said     for god   s sake .     then he had turned on his heel and stalked away .  it was little miss who finally brought him round  defiantly and harshly   and in front of andrew .  for thirty years no one had ever hesitated to talk in front of andrew  whether or not the matter involved andrew .  he was only a robot .     dad  why are you taking this as a personal affront .  he   ll still be here .  he   ll still be loyal .  he can   t help that  it   s built in .  all he wants is a form of words .  ha wants to be called free .  is that so terrible .  hasn   t be earned this chance .  heavens  he and i have been talking about it for years .        talking about it for years  have you .        yes  and over and over again he postponed it for fear he would hurt you .  i made him put the matter up to you .        he doesn   t know what freedom is .  he   s a robot .        dad  you don   t know him .  he   s read everything in the library .  i don   t know what he feels inside  but i don   t know what you feel inside either .  when you talk to him you   ll find he reacts to the various abstractions as you and i do  and what else counts .  if some one else   s reactions are like your own  what more can you ask for .        the law won   t take that attitude     sir said  angrily .     see here  you .     he turned to andrew with a deliberate grate in his voice .     i can   t free you except by doing it legally .  if this gets into the courts  you not only won   t get your freedom but the law will take official cognizance of your money .  they   ll tell you that a robot has no right to earn money .  is this rigmarole worth losing your money .        freedom is without price  sir     said andrew .     even the chance of freedom is worth the money .        .   it seemed the court might also take the attitude that freedom was without price  and might decide that for no price  however great  could a robot buy its freedom .  the simple statement of the regional attorney who represented those who had brought a class action to oppose the freedom was this     the word  freedom    has no meaning when applied to a robot .  only a human being can be free .     he said it several times  when it seemed appropriate  slowly  with his hand coming down rhythmically on the desk before him to mark the words .  little miss asked permission to speak on behalf of andrew .  she was recognized by her full name  something andrew had never heard pronounced before     amanda laura martin charney may approach the bench .        thank you  your honor .  i am not a lawyer and i don   t know the proper way of phrasing things  but i hope you will listen to my meaning and ignore the words .     let   s understand what it means to be free in andrew   s case .  in some ways  he is free .  i think it   s at least twenty years since anyone in the martin family gave him an order to do something that we felt he might not do of his own accord .  but we can  if we wish  give him an order to do anything  couching it as harshly as we wish  because he is a machine that belongs to us .  why should we be in a position to do so  when he has served us so long  so faithfully  and has earned so much money for us .  he owes us nothing more .  the debit is entirely on the other side .     even if we were legally forbidden to place andrew in involuntary servitude  he would still serve us voluntarily .  making him free would be a trick of words only  but it would mean much to him .  it would give him everything and cost us nothing .     for a moment the judge seemed to be suppressing a smile .     i see your point  mrs .  chamey .  the fact is that there is no binding law in this respect and no precedent .  there is  however  the unspoken assumption that only a man may enjoy freedom .  i can make new law here  subject to reversal in a higher court  but i cannot lightly run counter to that assumption .  let me address the robot .  andrew .        yes  your honor .     it was the first time andrew bad spoken in court  and the judge seemed astonished for a moment at the human timbre of his voice .     why do you want to be free  andrew .  in what way will this matter to you .     andrew said     would you wish to be a slave  your honor .        but you are not a slave .  you are a perfectly good robot   a genius of a robot  i am given to understand  capable of an artistic expression that can be matched nowhere .  what more could you do if you were free .        perhaps no more than i do now  your honor  but with greater joy .  it has been said in this courtroom that only a human being can be free .  it seems to me that only someone who wishes for freedom can be free .  i wish for freedom .     and it was that statement that cued the judge .  the crucial sentence in his decision was    there is no right to deny freedom to any object with a mind advanced enough to grasp the concept and desire the state .     it was eventually upheld by the world court .     .   sir remained displeased  and his harsh voice made andrew feel as if he were being short circuited .     i don   t want your damned money  andrew .  i   ll take it only because you won   t feel free otherwise .  from now on  you can select your own jobs and do them as you please .  i will give you no orders  except this one  do as you please .  but i am still responsible for you .  that   s part of the court order .  i hope you understand that .     little miss interrupted .     don   t be irascible  dad .  the responsibility is no great chore .  you know you won   t have to do a thing .  the three laws still hold .        then how is he free .        are not human beings bound by their laws  sir .     andrew replied .     i   m not going to argue .     sir left the room  and andrew saw him only infrequently after that .  little miss came to see him frequently in the small house that had been built and made over for him .  it had no kitchen  of course  nor bathroom facilities .  it had just two rooms  one was a library and one was a combination storeroom and workroom .  andrew accepted many commissions and worked harder as a free robot than he ever had before  till the cost of the house was paid for and the structure was signed over to him .  one day little sir   no     george .       came .  little sir had insisted on that after the court decision .     a free robot doesn   t call anyone little sir     george had said .     i call you andrew .  you must call me george .     his preference was phrased as an order  so andrew called him george   but little miss remained little miss .  one day when george came alone  it was to say that sir was dying .  little miss was at the bedside  but sir wanted andrew as well .  sir   s voice was still quite strong  though he seemed unable to move much .  he struggled to raise his hand .     andrew     he said     andrew   don   t help me  george .  i   m only dying  i   m not crippled .  andrew  i   m glad you   re free .  i just wanted to tell you that .     andrew did not know what to say .  he had never been at the side of someone dying before  but he knew it was the human way of ceasing to function .  it was an involuntary and irreversible dismantling  and andrew did not know what to say that might be appropriate .  he could only remain standing  absolutely silent  absolutely motionless .  when it was over  little miss said to him     he may not have seemed friendly to you toward the end  andrew  but he was old  you know  and it hurt him that you should want to be free .     then andrew found the words .     i would never have been free without him  little miss .        .   only after sir   s death did andrew begin to wear clothes .  he began with an old pair of trousers at first  a pair that george had given him .  george was married now  and a lawyer .  he had joined feingold   s firm .  old feingold was long since dead  but his daughter had carried on .  eventually the firm   s name became feingold and martin .  it remained so even when the daughter retired and no feingold took her place .  at the time andrew first put on clothes  the martin name had just been added to the firm .  george had tried not to smile the first time he saw andrew attempting to put on trousers  but to andrew   s eyes the smile was clearly there .  george showed andrew how to manipulate the static charge to allow the trousers to open  wrap about his lower body  and move shut .  george demonstrated on his own trousers  but andrew was quite aware it would take him a while to duplicate that one flowing motion .     but why do you want trousers  andrew .  your body is so beautifully functional it   s a shame to cover it especially when you needn   t worry about either temperature control or modesty .  and the material doesn   t cling properly   not on metal .     andrew held his ground .     are not human bodies beautifully functional  george .  yet you cover yourselves .        for warmth  for cleanliness  for protection  for decorativeness .  none of that applies to you .        i feel bare without clothes .  i feel different  george     andrew responded .     different .  andrew  there are millions of robots on earth now .  in this region  according to the last census  there are almost as many robots as there are men .        i know  george .  there are robots doing every conceivable type of work .        and none of them wear clothes .        but none of them are free  george .     little by little  andrew added to his wardrobe .  he was inhibited by george   s smile and by the stares of the people who commissioned work .  he might be free  but there was built into andrew a carefully detailed program concerning his behavior to people  and it was only by the tiniest steps that he dared advance  open disapproval would set him back months .  not everyone accepted andrew as free .  he was incapable of resenting that  and yet there was a difficulty about his thinking process when he thought of it .  most of all  he tended to avoid putting on clothes   or too many of them   when he thought little miss might come to visit him .  she was older now and was often away in some warmer climate  but when she returned the first thing she did was visit him .  on one of her visits  george said  ruefully     she   s got me  andrew .  i   ll be running for the legislature next year .   like grandfather     she says   like grandson .           like grandfather  .   .   .     andrew stopped  uncertain .     i mean that i  george  the grandson  will be like sir  the grandfather  who was in the legislature once .        it would be pleasant  george  if sir were still      he paused  for he did not want to say     in working order .     that seemed inappropriate .     alive     george said .     yes  i think of the old monster now and then  too .     andrew often thought about this conversation .  he had noticed his own incapacity in speech when talking with george .  somehow the language had changed since andrew had come into being with a built in vocabulary .  then  too  george used a colloquial speech  as sir and little miss had not .  why should he have called sir a monster when surely that word was not a appropriate .  andrew could not even turn to his own books for guidance .  they were old  and most dealt with woodworking  with art  with furniture design .  there were none on language  none on the ways of human beings .  finally  it seemed to him that he must seek the proper books  and as a free robot  he felt he must not ask george .  he would go to town and use the library .  it was a triumphant decision and he felt his electro potential grow distinctly higher until he had to throw in an impedance coil .  he put on a full costume  including even a shoulder chain of wood .  he would have preferred the glitter plastic  but george had said that wood was much more appropriate  and that polished cedar was considerably more valuable as well .  he had placed a hundred feet between himself and the house before gathering resistance brought him to a halt .  he shifted the impedance coil out of circuit  and when that did not seem to help enough he returned to his home and on a piece of notepaper wrote neatly     i have gone to the library     and placed it in clear view on his worktable .      .   andrew never quite got to the library .  he had studied the map .  he knew the route  but not the appearance of it .  the actual landmarks did not resemble the symbols on the map and he would hesitate .  eventually  he thought he must have somehow gone wrong  for everything looked strange .  he passed an occasional field robot  but by the time he decided he should ask his way none were in sight .  a vehicle passed and did not stop .  andrew stood irresolute  which meant calmly motionless  for coming across the field toward him were two human beings .  he turned to face them  and they altered their course to meet him .  a moment before  they had been talking loudly .  he had heard their voices .  but now they were silent .  they had the look that andrew associated with human uncertainty  and they were young  but not very young .  twenty  perhaps .  andrew could never judge human age .     would you describe to me the route to the town library  sirs .     one of them  the taller of the two  whose tall hat lengthened him still farther  almost grotesquely  said  not to andrew  but to the other     it   s a robot .     the other had a bulbous nose and heavy eyelids .  he said  not to andrew but to the first     it   s wearing clothes .     the tall one snapped his fingers .     it   s the free robot .  they have a robot at the old martin place who isn   t owned by anybody .  why else would it be wearing clothes .        ask it     said the one with the nose .     are you the martin robot .     asked the tall one .     i am andrew martin  sir     andrew said .     good .  take off your clothes .  robots don   t wear clothes .     he said to the other     that   s disgusting .  look at him .     andrew hesitated .  he hadn   t heard an order in that tone of voice in so long that his second law circuits had momentarily jammed .  the tall one repeated     take off your clothes .  i order you .     slowly  andrew began to remove them .     just drop them     said the tall one .  the nose said     if it doesn   t belong to anyone  it could be ours as much as someone else   s .        anyway     said the tall one     who   s to object to anything we do .  we   re not damaging property .     tie turned to andrew .     stand on your head .        the head is not meant     andrew began .     that   s an order .  if you don   t know how  try anyway .     andrew hesitated again  then bent to put his head on the ground .  he tried to lift his legs but fell  heavily .  the tall one said     just lie there .     he said to the other     we can take him apart .  ever take a robot apart .        will he let us .        how can he stop us .     there was no way andrew could stop them  if they ordered him in a forceful enough manner not to resist the second law of obedience took precedence over the third law of self preservation .  in any case  he could not defend himself without possibly hurting them  and that would mean breaking the first law .  at that thought  he felt every motile unit contract slightly and he quivered as he lay there .  the tall one walked over and pushed at him with his foot .     he   s heavy .  i think we   ll need tools to do the job .     the nose said     we could order him to take himself  apart .  it would be fun to watch him try .        yes     said the tall one  thoughtfully     but let   s get him off the road .  if someone comes along      it was too late .  someone had  indeed  come along and it was george .  from where he lay  andrew had seen him topping a small rise in the middle distance .  he would have liked to signal him in some way  but the last order had been    just lie there .     george was running now  and he arrived on the scene somewhat winded .  the two young men stepped back a little and then waited thoughtfully .     andrew  has something gone wrong .     george asked  anxiously .  andrew replied     i am well  george .        then stand up .  what happened to your clothes .        that your robot  mac .     the tall young man asked .  george turned sharply .     he   s no one   s robot .  what   s been going on here .        we politely asked him to take his clothes off .  what   s that to you  if you don   t own him .     george turned to andrew .     what were they doing  andrew .        it was their intention in some way to dismember me .  they were about to move me to a quiet spot and order me to dismember myself .     george looked at the two young men  and his chin trembled .  the young men retreated no farther .  they were smiling .  the tall one said  lightly     what are you going to do  pudgy .  attack us .     george said     no .  i don   t have to .  this robot has been with my family for over seventy five years .  he knows us and he values us more than he values anyone else .  i am going to tell him that you two are threatening my life and that you plan to kill me .  i will ask him to defend me .  in choosing between me and you two  he will choose me .  do you know what will happen to you when he attacks you .     the two were backing away slightly  looking uneasy .  george said  sharply     andrew  i am in danger and about to come to harm from these young men .  move toward them .     andrew did so  and the young men did not wait .  they ran .     all right  andrew  relax     george said .  he looked unstrung .  he was far past the age where he could face the possibility of a dustup with one young man  let alone two .     i couldn   t have hurt them  george  i could see they were not attacking you .        i didn   t order you to attack them .  i only told you to move toward them .  their own fears did the rest .        how can they fear robots .        it   s a disease of mankind  one which has not yet been cured .  but never mind that .  what the devil are you doing here  andrew .  good thing i found your note .  i was just on the point of turning back and hiring a helicopter when i found you .  how did you get it into your head to go to the library .  i would have brought you any books you needed       i am a      andrew began .     free robot .  yes  yes .  all right  what did you want in the library .        i want to know more about human beings  about the world  about everything .  and about robots  george .  i want to write a history about robots .     george put his arm on the other   s shoulder .     well  let   s walk home .  but pick up your clothes first .  andrew  there are a million books on robotics and all of them include histories of the science .  the world is growing saturated not only with robots but with information about robots .     andrew shook his head  a human gesture he had lately begun to adopt .     not a history of robotics  george .  a history of robots  by a robot .  i want to explain how robots feel about what has happened since the first ones were allowed to work and live on earth .     george   s eyebrows lifted  but he said nothing in direct response .      .   little miss was just past her eighty third birthday  but there was nothing about her that was lacking in either energy or determination .  she gestured with her cane oftener than she propped herself up with it .  she listened to the story in a fury of indignation .     george  that   s horrible .  who were those young ruffians .        i don   t know .  what difference does it make .  in the end they did not do any damage .        they might have .  you   re a lawyer  george  and if you   re well off  it   s entirely due to the talents of andrew .  it was the money he earned that is the foundation of everything we have .  he provides the continuity for this family  and i will not have him treated as a wind up toy .        what would you have me do  mother .     george asked .     i said you   re a lawyer .  don   t you listen .  you set up a test case somehow  and you force the regional courts to declare for robot rights and get the legislature to pass the necessary bills .  carry the whole thing to the world court  if you have to .  i   ll be watching  george  and i   ll tolerate no shirking .     she was serious  so what began as a way of soothing the fearsome old lady became an involved matter with enough legal entanglement to make it interesting .  as senior partner of feingold and martin  george plotted strategy .  but he left the actual work to his junior partners  with much of it a matter for his son  paul  who was also a member of the firm and who reported dutifully nearly every day to his grandmother .  she  in turn  discussed the case every day with andrew .  andrew was deeply involved .  his work on his book on robots was delayed again  as he pored over the legal arguments and even  at times  made very diffident suggestions .     george told me that day i was attacked that human beings have always been afraid of robots     he said one day .     as long as they are  the courts and the legislatures are not likely to work hard on behalf of robots .  should not something be done about public opinion .     so while paul stayed in court  george took to the public platform .  it gave him the advantage of being informal  and he even went so far sometimes as to wear the new  loose style of clothing which he called drapery .  paul chided him     just don   t trip over it on stage  dad .     george replied  despondently     i   ll try not to .     he addressed the annual convention of holo news editors on one occasion and said  in part     if  by virtue of the second law  we can demand of any robot unlimited obedience in all respects not involving harm to a human being  then any human being  any human being  has a fearsome power over any robot  any robot .  in particular  since second law supersedes third law  any human being can use the law of obedience to overcome the law of self protection .  he can order any robot to damage itself or even to destroy itself for any reason  or for no reason .     is this just .  would we treat an animal so .  even an inanimate object which had given us good service has a claim on our consideration .  and a robot is not insensitive  it is not an animal .  it can think well enough so that it can talk to us  reason with us  joke with us .  can we treat them as friends  can we work together with them  and not give them some of the fruits of that friendship  some of the benefits of co working .     if a man has the right to give a robot any order that does not involve harm to a human being  he should have the decency never to give a robot any order that involves harm to a robot  unless human safety absolutely requires it .  with great power goes great responsibility  and if the robots have three laws to protect men  is it too much to ask that men have a law or two to protect robots .     andrew was right .  it was the battle over public opinion that held the key to courts and legislature .  in the end  a law was passed that set up conditions under which robot harming orders were forbidden .  it was endlessly qualified and the punishments for violating the law were totally inadequate  but the principle was established .  the final passage by the world legislature came through on the day of little miss    death .  that was no coincidence .  little miss held on to life desperately during the last debate and let go only when word of victory arrived .  her last smile was for andrew .  her last words were     you have been good to us  andrew .     she died with her hand holding his  while her son and his wife and children remained at a respectful distance from both .      .   andrew waited patiently when the receptionist robot disappeared into the inner office .  the receptionist might have used the holographic chatterbox  but un questionably it was perturbed by having to deal with another robot rather than with a human being .  andrew passed the time revolving the matter his mind  could    unroboted    be used as an analog of    unmanned     or had unmanned become a metaphoric term sufficiently divorced from its original literal meaning to be applied to robots  or to women for that matter .  such problems frequently arose as he worked on his book on robots .  the trick of thinking out sentences to express all complexities had undoubtedly increased his vocabulary .  occasionally  someone came into the room to stare at him and he did not try to avoid the glance .  he looked at each calmly  and each in turn looked away .  paul martin finally emerged .  he looked surprised  or he would have if andrew could have made out his expression with certainty .  paul had taken to wearing the heavy makeup that fashion was dictating for bath sexes .  though it made sharper and firmer the somewhat bland lines of paul   s face  andrew disapproved .  he found that disapproving of human beings  as long as he did not express it verbally  did not make him very uneasy .  he could even write the disapproval .  he was sure it had not always been so .     come in  andrew .  i   m sorry i made you wait  but there was something i had to finish .  come in  you had said you wanted to talk to me  but i didn   t know you meant here in town .        if you are busy  paul  i am prepared to continue to wait .     paul glanced at the interplay of shifting shadows on the dial on the wall that served as timepieces and said     i can make some time .  did you come alone .        i hired an automatobile .        any trouble .     paul asked  with more than a trace of anxiety .     i wasn   t expecting any .  my rights are protected .     paul looked all the more anxious for that .     andrew  i   ve explained that the law is unenforceable  at least under most conditions .  and if you insist on wearing clothes  you   ll run into trouble eventually  just like that first time .        and only tine  paul .  i   m sorry you are displeased       well  look at it this way  you are virtually a living legend  andrew  and you are too valuable in many different ways for you to have any right to take chances with yourself .  by the way  how   s the book coming .        i am approaching the end  paul .  the publisher is quite pleased .        good .        i don   t know that he   s necessarily pleased with the book as a book .  i think he expects to sell many copies because it   s written by a robot and that   s what pleases him .     only human  i   m afraid .        i am not displeased .  let it sell for whatever reason  since it will mean money and i can use some .        grandmother left you         little miss was generous  and i   m sure i can count on the family to help me out further .  but it is the royalties from the book on which i am counting to help me through the next step .        what next step is that .        i wish to see the head of u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .  i have tried to make an appointment  but so far i have not been able to reach him .  the corporation did not cooperate with me in the writing of the book  so i am not surprised  you understand .     paul was clearly amused .     cooperation is the last thing you can expect .  they didn   t cooperate with us in our great fight for robot rights .  quite the reverse  and you can see why .  give a robot rights and people may not want to buy them .        nevertheless     said andrew     if you call them  you may be able to obtain an interview for me .        i   m no more popular with them than you are  andrew .        but perhaps you can hint that by seeing me they may head off a campaign by feingold and martin to strengthen the rights of robots further .        wouldn   t that be a lie  andrew .        yes  paul  and i can   t tell one .  that is why you must call .        ah  you can   t lie  but you can urge me to tell a lie  is that it .  you   re getting more human all the time  andrew .         .   the meeting was not easy to arrange  even with paul   s supposedly weighted name .  but it finally came about .  when it did  harley smythe robertson  who  on his mother   s side  was descended from the original founder of the corporation and who had adopted the hyphenation to indicate it  looked remarkably unhappy .  he was approaching retirement age and his entire tenure as president had been devoted to the matter of robot rights .  his gray hair was plastered thinly over the top of his scalp  his face was not made up  and he eyed andrew with brief hostility from time to time .  andrew began the conversation .     sir  nearly a century ago  i was told by a merton mansky of this corporation that the mathematics governing the plotting of the positronic pathways was far too complicated to permit of any but approximate solutions and that  therefore  my own capacities were not fully predictable .        that was a century ago .     smythe robertson hesitated  then said icily     sir .  it is true no longer .  our robots are made with precision now and are trained precisely to their jobs .        yes     said paul  who had come along  as he said  to make sure that the corporation played fair     with the result that my receptionist must be guided at every point once events depart from the conventional  however slightly .        you would be much more displeased if it were to improvise     smythe robertson said .     then you no longer manufacture robots like myself which are flexible and adaptable .        no longer .        the research i have done in connection with my book     said andrew     indicates that i am the oldest robot presently in active operation .        the oldest presently     said smythe robertson     and the oldest ever .  the oldest that will ever be .  no robot is useful after the twenty fifth year .  they are called in and replaced with newer models .        no robot as presently manufactured is useful after the twentieth year     said paul  with a note of sarcasm creeping into his voice .     andrew is quite exceptional in this respect .     andrew  adhering to the path he had marked out for himself  continued     as the oldest robot in the world and the most flexible  am i not unusual enough to merit special treatment from the company .        not at all     smythe robertson said  freezing up .     your unusualness is an embarrassment to the company .  if you were on lease  instead of having been an outright sale through some mischance  you would long since have been replaced .        but that is exactly the point     said andrew .     i am a free robot and i own myself .  therefore i come to you and ask you to replace me .  you cannot do this without the owner   s consent .  nowadays  that consent is extorted as a condition of the lease  but in my time this did not happen .     smythe robertson was looking both startled and puzzled  and for a moment there was silence .  andrew found himself staring at the hologram on the wall .  it was a death mask of susan calvin  patron saint of all roboticists .  she had been dead for nearly two centuries now  but as a result of writing his book andrew knew  her so well he could half persuade himself that he had met her in life .  finally smythe robertson asked     how can i replace you for you .  if i replace you  as robot  how can i donate the new robot to you as owner since in the very act of replacement you cease to exist .     he smiled grimly .     not at all difficult     paul interposed .     the seat of andrew   s personality is his positronic brain and it is the one part that cannot be replaced without creating a new robot .  the positronic brain  therefore  is andrew the owner .  every other part of the robotic body can be replaced without affecting the robot   s personality  and those other parts are the brain   s possessions .  andrew  i should say  wants to supply his brain with a new robotic body .        that   s right     said andrew  calmly .  he turned to smythe robertson .     you have manufactured androids  haven   t you .  robots that have the outward appearance of humans  complete to the texture of the skin .        yes  we have .  they worked perfectly well  with their synthetic fibrous skins and tendons .  there was virtually no metal anywhere except for the brain  yet they were nearly as tough as metal robots .  they were tougher  weight for weight .     paul looked interested .     i didn   t know that .  how many are on the market .        none     said smythe robertson .     they were much more expensive than metal models and a market survey showed they would not be accepted .  they looked too human .     andrew was impressed .     but the corporation retains its expertise  i assume .  since it does  i wish to request that i be replaced by an organic robot  an android .     paul looked surprised .     good lord .     he said .  smythe robertson stiffened .     quite impossible .        why is it impossible .     andrew asked .     i will pay any reasonable fee  of course .        we do not manufacture androids .        you do not choose to manufacture androids     paul interjected quickly .     that is not the same as being unable to manufacture them .        nevertheless     smythe robertson responded     the manufacture of androids is against public policy .        there is no law against it     said paul .     nevertheless  we do not manufacture them   and we will not .     paul cleared his throat .     mr .  smythe robertson     he said     andrew is a free robot who comes under the purview of the law guaranteeing robot rights .  you are aware of this  i take it .        only too well .        this robot  as a free robot  chooses to wear clothes .  this results in his being frequently humiliated by thoughtless human beings despite the law against the humiliation of robots .  it is difficult to prosecute vague offenses that don   t meet with the general disapproval of those who must decide on guilt and innocence .        u . s .  robots understood that from the start .  your father   s firm unfortunately did not .        my father is dead now  but what i see is that we have here a clear offense with a clear target .        what are you talking about .     said smythe robertson .     my client  andrew martin   he has just become my client   is a free robot who is entitled to ask u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation for the rights of replacement  which the corporation supplies to anyone who owns a robot for more than twenty five years .  in fact  the corporation insists on such replacement .     paul was smiling and thoroughly at ease .     the positronic brain of my client     he went on     is the owner of the body of my client which is certainly more than twenty five years old .  the positronic brain demands the replacement of the body and offers to pay any reasonable fee for an android body as that replacement .  if you refuse the request  my client undergoes humiliation and we will sue .     while public opinion would not ordinarily support the claim of a robot in such a case  may i remind you that u . s .  robots is not popular with the public generally .  even those who most use and profit from robots are suspicious of the corporation .  this may be a hangover from the days when robots were widely feared .  it may be resentment against the power and wealth of u . s .  robots  which has a worldwide monopoly .  whatever the cause may be  the resentment eats .  i think you will find that you would prefer not to be faced with a lawsuit  particularly since my client is wealthy and will live for many more centuries and will have no reason to refrain from fighting the battle forever .     smythe robertson had slowly reddened .     you are trying to force         i force you to do nothing     said paul .     if you wish to refuse to accede to my client   s reasonable request  you may by all means do so and we will leave without another word .  but we will sue  as is certainly our right  and you will find that you will eventually lose .        well .        i see that you are going to accede     said paul .     you may hesitate but you will come to it in the end .  let me assure you  then  of one further point  if  in the process of transferring my client   s positronic brain from his present body to an organic one  there is any damage  however slight  then i will never rest until i   ve nailed the corporation to the ground .  i will  if necessary  take every possible step to mobilize public opinion against the corporation if one brain path of my client   s platinum iridium essence is scrambled .     he turned to andrew and asked     do you agree to all this  andrew .     andrew hesitated a full minute .  it amounted to the approval of lying  of blackmail  of the badgering and humiliation of a human being .  but not physical harm  he told himself  not physical harm .  he managed at last to come out with a rather faint    yes .         .   he felt as though he were being constructed again .  for days  then for weeks  finally for months  andrew found himself not himself somehow  and the simplest actions kept giving rise to hesitation .  paul was frantic .     they   ve damaged you  andrew .  we   ll have to institute suit .     andrew spoke very slowly .     you   mustn   t .  you   ll never be able to prove   something   like m m m m          malice .        malice .  besides  i grow   stronger  better .  it   s the tr   tr   tr          tremble .        trauma .  after all  there   s never been such an op op op   before .     andrew could feel his brain from the inside .  no one else could .  he knew he was well  and during the months that it took him to learn full coordination and full positronic interplay he spent hours before the mirror .  not quite human .  the face was stiff   too stiff and the motions were too deliberate .  they lacked the careless  free flow of the human being  but perhaps that might come with time .  at least now he could wear clothes without the ridiculous anomaly of a metal face going along with it .  eventually  he said     i will be going back to work .     paul laughed .     that means you are well .  what will you be doing .  another book .        no     said andrew  seriously .     i live too long for any one career to seize me by the throat and never let me go .  there was a time when i was primarily an artist  and i can still turn to that .  and there was a time when i was a historian  and i can still turn to that .  but now i wish to be a robobiologist .        a robopsychologist  you mean .        no .  that would imply the study of positronic brains  and at the moment i lack the desire to do that .  a robobiologist  it seems to me  would be concerned with the working of the body attached to that brain .        wouldn   t that be a roboticist .        a roboticist works with a metal body .  i would be studying an organic humanoid body  of which i have the only one  as far as i know .        you narrow your field     said paul  thoughtfully .     as an artist  all conception is yours  as a historian you deal chiefly with robots  as a robobiologist  you will deal with yourself .     andrew nodded .     it would seem so .     andrew had to start from the very beginning  for he knew nothing of ordinary biology and almost nothing of science .  he became a familiar sight in the libraries  where he sat at the electronic indices for hours at a time  looking perfectly normal in clothes .  those few who knew he was a robot in no way interfered with him .  he built a laboratory in a room which he added to his house  and his library grew  too .  years passed  and paul came to him one day and said     it   s a pity you   re no longer working on the history of robots .  i understand u . s .  robots is adopting a radically new policy .     paul had aged  and his deteriorating eyes had been replaced with photoptic cells .  in that respect  he had drawn closer to andrew .     what have they done .     andrew asked .     they are manufacturing central computers  gigantic positronic brains  really  which communicate with anywhere from a dozen to a thousand robots by microwave .  the robots themselves have no brains at all .  they are the limbs of the gigantic brain  and the two are physically separate .        is that more efficient .        u . s .  robots claims it is .  smythe robertson established the new direction before he died  however  and it   s my notion that it   s a backlash at you .  u . s .  robots is determined that they will make no robots that will give them the type of trouble you have  and for that reason they separate brain and body .  the brain will have no body to wish changed  the body will have no brain to wish anything .     it   s amazing  andrew     paul went on     the influence you have had on the history of .  robots .  it was your artistry that encouraged u . s .  robots to make robots more precise and specialized  it was your freedom that resulted in the establishment of the principle of robotic rights  it was your insistence on an android body that made u . s .  robots switch to brain body separation    andrew grew thoughtful .     i suppose in the end the corporation will produce one vast brain controlling several billion robotic bodies .  all the eggs will be in one basket .  dangerous .  not proper at all .        i think you   re right     said paul     but i don   t suspect it will come to pass for a century at least and i won   t live to see it .  in fact  i may not live to see next year .        paul .     cried andrew  in concern .  paul shrugged .     men are mortal  andrew .  we   re not like you .  it doesn   t matter too much  but it does make it important to assure you on one point .  i   m the last of the human martins .  the money i control personally will be left to the trust in your name  and as far as anyone can foresee the future  you will be economically secure .        unnecessary     andrew said  with difficulty .  in all this time  he could not get used to the deaths of the martins .     let   s not argue .  that   s the way it   s going to be .  now  what are you working on .        i am designing a system for allowing androids   myself   to gain energy from the combustion of hydrocarbons  rather than from atomic cells .     paul raised his eyebrows .     so that they will breathe and eat .        yes .        how long have you been pushing in that direction .        for a long time now  but i think i have finally designed an adequate combustion chamber for catalyzed controlled breakdown .        but why  andrew .  the atomic cell is surely infinitely better .        in some ways  perhaps .  but the atomic cell is inhuman .         .   it took time  but andrew had time .  in the first place  he did not wish to do anything till paul had died in peace .  with the death of the great grandson of sir  andrew felt more nearly exposed to a hostile world and for that reason was all the more determined along the path he had chosen .  yet he was not really alone .  if a man had died  the firm of feingold and martin lived  for a corporation does not die any more than a robot does .  the firm had its directions and it followed them soullessly .  by way of the trust and through the law firm  andrew continued to be wealthy .  in return for their own large annual retainer  feingold and martin involved themselves in the legal aspects of the new combustion chamber .  but when the time came for andrew to visit u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation  he did it alone .  once he had gone with sir and once with paul .  this time  the third time  he was alone and manlike .  u . s .  robots had changed .  the actual production plant had been shifted to a large space station  as had grown to be the case with more and more industries .  with them had gone many robots .  the earth itself was becoming park like  with its one billion person population stabilized and perhaps not more than thirty percent of its at least equally large robot population independently brained .  the director of research was alvin magdescu  dark of complexion and hair  with a little pointed beard and wearing nothing above the waist but the breast band that fashion dictated .  andrew himself was well covered in the older fashion of several decades back .  magdescu offered his hand to his visitor .     i know you  of course  and i   m rather pleased to see you .  you   re our most notorious product and it   s a pity old smythe robertson was so set against you .  we could have done a great deal with you .        you still can     said andrew .     no  i don   t think so .  we   re past the time .  we   ve had robots on earth for over a century  but that   s changing .  it will be back to space with them  and those that stay here won   t be brained .        but there remains myself  and i stay on earth .        true  but there doesn   t seem to be much of the robot about you .  what new request have you .        to be still less a robot .  since i am so far organic  i wish an organic source of energy .  i have here the plans      magdescu did not hasten through them .  he might have intended to at first  but he stiffened and grew intent .  at one point  he said     this is remarkably ingenious .  who thought of all this .        i did     andrew replied .  magdescu looked up at him sharply  then said     it would amount to a major overhaul of your body  and an experimental one  since such a thing has never been attempted before .  i advise against it .  remain as you are .     andrew   s face had limited means of expression  but impatience showed plainly in his voice .     dr .  magdescu  you miss the entire point  you have no choice but to accede to my request .  if such devices can be built into my body  they can be built into human bodies as well .  the tendency to lengthen human life by prosthetic devices has already been remarked on .  there are no devices better than the ones i have designed or am designing .  as it happens  i control the patents by way of the firm of feingold and martin .  we are quite capable of going into business for ourselves and of developing the kind of prosthetic devices that may end by producing human beings with many of the properties of robots .  your own business will then suffer .     if  however  you operate on me now and agree to do so under similar circumstances in the future  you will receive permission to make use of the patents and control the technology of both robots and of the prosthetization of human beings .  the initial leasing will not be granted  of course  until after the first operation is completed successfully  and after enough time has passed to demonstrate that it is indeed successful .     andrew felt scarcely any first law inhibition to the stern conditions he was setting a human being .  he was learning to reason that what seemed like cruelty might  in the long run  be kindness .  magdescu was stunned .     i   m not the one to decide something like this .  that   s a corporate decision that would take time .        i can wait a reasonable time     said andrew     but only a reasonable time .     and he thought with satisfaction that paul himself could not have done it better .      .   it took only a reasonable time  and the operation was a success .     i was very much against the operation  andrew     magdescu said     but not for the reasons you might think .  i was not in the least against the experiment  if it had been on someone else .  i hated risking your positronic brain .  now that you have the positronic pathways interacting with simulated nerve pathways  it might have been difficult to rescue the brain intact if the body had gone bad .        i had every faith in the skill of the staff at u . s .  robots     said andrew .     and i can eat now .        well  you can sip olive oil .  it will mean occasional cleanings of the combustion chamber  as we have explained to you .  rather an uncomfortable touch  i should think .        perhaps  if i did not expect to go further .  self cleaning is not impossible .  in fact  i am working on a device that will deal with solid food that may be expected to contain incombustible fractions   indigestible matter  so to speak  that will have to be discarded .        you would then have to develop an anus .        or the equivalent .        what else  andrew   .        everything else .        genitalia  too .        insofar as they will fit my plans .  my body is a canvas on which i intend to draw      magdescu waited for the sentence to he completed  and when it seemed that it would not be  he completed it himself .     a man .        we shall see     andrew said .     that   s a puny ambition  andrew .  you   re better than a man .  you   ve gone downhill from the moment you opted to become organic .        my brain has not suffered .        no  it hasn   t .  i   ll grant you that .  but  andrew  the whole new breakthrough in prosthetic devices made possible by your patents is being marketed under your name .  you   re recognized as the inventor and you   re being honored for it   as you should be .  why play further games with your body .     andrew did not answer .  the honors came .  he accepted membership in several learned societies  including one that was devoted to the new science he had established   the one he had called robobiology but which had come to be termed prosthetology .  on the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of his construction  a testimonial dinner was given in his honor at u . s .  robots .  if andrew saw an irony in this  he kept it to himself .  alvin magdescu came out of retirement to chair the dinner .  he was himself ninety four years old and was alive because he  too  had prosthetized devices that  among other things  fulfilled the function of liver and kidneys .  the dinner reached its climax when magdescu  after a short and emotional talk  raised his glass to toast the sesquicentennial robot .  andrew had had the sinews of his face redesigned to the point where he could show a human range of emotions  but he sat through all the ceremonies solemnly passive .  he did not like to be a sesquicentennial robot .      .   it was prosthetology that finally took andrew off the earth .  in the decades that followed the celebration of his sesquicentennial  the moon had come to be a world more earthlike than earth in every respect but its gravitational pull  and in its underground cities there was a fairly dense population .  prosthetized devices there had to take the lesser gravity into account .  andrew spent five years on the moon working with local prosthetologists to make the necessary adaptations .  when not at his work  he wandered among the robot population  every one of which treated him with the robotic obsequiousness due a man .  he came back to an earth that was humdrum and quiet in comparison  and visited the offices of feingold and martin to announce his return .  the current head of the firm  simon delong  was surprised .     we had been told you were returning  andrew      he had almost said mr .  martin      but we were not expecting you till next week .        i grew impatient     said andrew briskly .  he was anxious to get to the point .     on the moon  simon  i was in charge of a research team of twenty human scientists .  i gave orders that no one questioned .  the lunar robots deferred to me as they would to a human being .  why  then  am i not a human being .     a wary look entered delong   s eyes .     my dear andrew  as you have just explained  you are treated as a human being by both robots and human beings .  you are  therefore  a human being de facto .        to be a human being de facto is not enough .  i want not only to be treated as one  but to be legally identified as one .  i want to be a human being de jure .        now  that is another matter     delong said .     there we would run into human prejudice and into the undoubted fact that  however much you may be like a human being  you are not a human being .        in what way not .     andrew asked .     i have the shape of a human being and organs equivalent to those of a human being .  my organs  in fact  are identical to some of those in a prosthetized human being .  i have contributed artistically  literally  and scientifically to human culture as much as any human being now alive .  what more can one ask .        i myself would ask nothing more .  the trouble is that it would take an act of the world legislature to define you as a human being .  frankly  i wouldn   t expect that to happen .        to whom on the legislature could i speak .        to the chairman of the science and technology committee  perhaps .        can you arrange a meeting .        but you scarcely need an intermediary .  in your position  you can         no .  you arrange it .     it didn   t even occur to andrew that he was giving a fiat order to a human being .  he had grown so accustomed to that on the moon .     i want him to know that the firm of feingold and martin is backing me in this to the hilt .        well  now         to the hilt  simon .  in one hundred and seventy three years i have in one fashion or another contributed greatly to this firm .  i have been under obligation to individual members of the firm in times past .  i am not  now .  it is rather the other way around now and i am calling in my debts .        i will   do what i can     delong said .      .   the chairman of the science and technology committee was from the east asian region and was a woman .  her name was chee li hsing and her transparent garments   obscuring what she wanted obscured only by their dazzle   made her look plastic wrapped .     i sympathize with your wish for full human rights     she said .     there have been times in history when segments of the human population fought for full human rights .  what rights  however  can you possibly want that you do not have .        as simple a thing as my right to life     andrew stated .     a robot can be dismantled at any time .        a human being can be executed at any time .        execution can only follow due process of law .  there is no trial needed for my dismantling .  only the word of a human being in authority is needed to end me .  besides   besides      andrew tried desperately to allow no sign of pleading  but his carefully designed tricks of human expression and tone of voice betrayed him here .     the truth is i want to be a man .  i have wanted it through six generations of human beings .     li hsing looked up at him out of darkly sympathetic eyes .     the legislature can pass a law declaring you one .  they could pass a law declaring that a stone statue be defined as a man .  whether they will actually do so is  however  as likely in the first case as the second .  congress people are as human as the rest of the population and there is always that element of suspicion against robots .        even now .        even now .  we would all allow the fact that you have earned the prize of humanity  and yet there would remain the fear of setting an undesirable precedent .        what precedent .  i am the only free robot  the only one of my type  and there will never be another .  you may consult u . s .  robots .         never    is a long word  andrew   or  if you prefer  mr .  martin   since i will gladly give you my personal accolade as man .  you will find that most congress people will not be so willing to set the precedent  no matter how meaningless such a precedent might be .  mr .  martin  you have my sympathy  but i cannot tell you to hope .  indeed      she sat back and her forehead wrinkled .     indeed  if the issue grows too heated  there might well arise a certain sentiment  both inside the legislature and out side  for that dismantling you mentioned .  doing away with you could turn out to be the easiest way of resolving the dilemma .  consider that before deciding to push matters .     andrew stood firm .     will no one remember the technique of prosthetology  something that is almost entirely mine .        it may seem cruel  but they won   t .  or if they do  it will be remembered against you .  people will say you did it only for yourself .  it will be said it was part of a campaign to roboticize human beings  or to humanify robots  and in either case evil and vicious .  you have never been part of a political hate campaign  mr .  martin  but i tell you that you would be the object of vilification of a kind neither you nor i would credit  and there would be people to believe it all .  mr .  martin  let your life be .     she rose  and next to andrew   s seated figure she seemed small and almost childlike .     if i decide to fight for my humanity  will you be on my side .     she thought  then replied     i will be   insofar as i can be .  if at any time such a stand would appear to threaten my political future  i might have to abandon you  since it is not an issue i feel to be at the very root of my beliefs .  i am trying to be honest with you .        thank you  and i will ask no more .  i intend to fight this through  whatever the consequences  and i will ask you for your help only for as long as you can give it .         .   it was not a direct fight .  feingold and martin counseled patience and andrew muttered  grimly  that he had an endless supply of that .  feingold and martin then entered on a campaign to narrow and restrict the area of combat .  they instituted a lawsuit denying the obligation to pay debts to an individual with a prosthetic heart on the grounds that the possession of a robotic organ removed humanity  and with it the constitutional rights of human beings .  they fought the matter skillfully and tenaciously  losing at every step but always in such a way that the decision was forced to be as broad as possible  and then carrying it by way of appeals to the world court .  it took years  and millions of dollars .  when the final decision was handed down  delong held what amounted to a victory celebration over the legal loss .  andrew was  of course  present in the company offices on the occasion .     we   ve done two things  andrew     said delong     both of which are good .  first of all  we have established the fact that no number of artificial parts in the human body causes it to cease being a human body .  secondly  we have engaged public opinion in the question in such a way as to put it fiercely on the side of a broad interpretation of humanity  since there is not a human being in existence who does not hope for prosthetics if they will keep him alive .        and do you think the legislature will now grant me my humanity .     andrew asked .  delong looked faintly uncomfortable .     as to that  i cannot be optimistic .  there remains the one organ which the world court has used as the criterion of humanity .  human beings have an organic cellular brain and robots have a platinum iridium positronic brain if they have one at all   and you certainly have a positronic brain .  no  andrew  don   t get that look in your eye .  we lack the knowledge to duplicate the work of a cellular brain in artificial structures close enough to the organic type as to allow it to fall within the court   s decision .  not even you could do it .        what should we do  then .        make the attempt  of course .  congresswoman li hsing will be on our side and a growing number of other congress people .  the president will undoubtedly go along with a majority of the legislature in this matter .        do we have a majority .        no .  far from it .  but we might get one if the public will allow its desire for a broad interpretation of humanity to extend to you .  a small chance  i admit  but if you do not wish to give up  we must gamble for it .        i do not wish to give up .         .   congresswoman li hsing was considerably older than she had been when andrew had first met her .  her transparent garments were long gone .  her hair was now close cropped and her coverings were tubular .  yet still andrew clung  as closely as he could within the limits of reasonable taste  to the style of clothing that had prevailed when he had first adopted clothing more than a century before .     we   ve gone as far as we can  andrew     li hsing admitted .     we   ll try once more after recess  but  to be honest  defeat is certain and then the whole thing will have to be given up .  all my most recent efforts have only earned me certain defeat in the coming congressional campaign .        i know     said andrew     and it distressed me .  you said once you would abandon me if it came to that .  why have you not done so .        one can change one   s mind  you know .  somehow  abandoning you became a higher price than i cared to pay for just one more term .  as it is  i   ve been in the legislature   for over a quarter of a century .  it   s enough .        is there no way we can change minds  chee .        we   ve changed all that are amenable to reason .  the rest   the majority   cannot be moved from their emotional antipathies .        emotional antipathy is not a valid reason for voting one way or the other .        i know that  andrew  but they don   t advance emotional antipathy as their reason .        it all comes down to the brain  then     andrew said cautiously .     but must we leave it at the level of cells versus positrons .  is there no way of forcing a functional definition .  must we say that a brain is made of this or that .  may we not say that a brain is something   anything   capable of a certain level of thought .        won   t work     said li hsing .     your brain is manmade  the human brain is not .  your brain is constructed  theirs developed .  to any human being who is intent on keeping up the barrier between himself and a robot  those differences are a steel wall a mile high and a mile thick .        if we could get at the source of their antipathy  the very source         after all your years     li hsing said  sadly     you are still trying to reason out the human being .  poor andrew  don   t be angry  but it   s the robot in you that drives you in that direction .        i don   t know     said andrew .     if i could bring myself         .   reprise   if he could bring himself   he had known for a long time it might come to that  and in the end he was at the surgeon   s .  he had found one  skillful enough for the job at hand   which meant a surgeon   robot  for no human surgeon could be trusted in this connection  either in ability or in intention .  the surgeon could not have performed the operation on a human being  so andrew  after putting off the moment of decision with a sad line of questioning that reflected the turmoil within himself  had put first law to one side by saying    i  too  am a robot .     he then said  as firmly as he had learned to form the words even at human beings over these past decades     i order you to carry through the operation on me .     in the absence of the first law  an order so firmly given from one who looked so much like a man activated the second law sufficiently to carry the day .      .   andrew   s feeling of weakness was  he was sure  quite imaginary .  he had recovered from the   operation .  nevertheless  he leaned  as unobtrusively as he could manage  against the wall .  it would be entirely too revealing to sit .  li hsing said     the final vote will come this week  andrew .  i   ve been able to delay it no longer  and we must lose .  and that will be it  andrew .        i am grateful for your skill at delay .  it gave me the time i needed  and i took the gamble i had to .        what gamble is this .     li hsing asked with open concern .     i couldn   t tell you  or even the people at feingold and martin .  i was sure i would be stopped .  see here  if it is the brain that is at issue  isn   t the greatest difference of all the matter of immortality .  who really cares what a brain looks like or is built of or how it was formed .  what matters is that human brain cells die  must die .  even if every other organ in the body is maintained or replaced  the brain cells  which cannot be replaced without changing and therefore killing the personality  must eventually die .     my own positronic pathways have lasted nearly two centuries without perceptible change  and can last for centuries more .  isn   t that the fundamental barrier .  human beings can tolerate an immortal robot  for it doesn   t matter how long a machine lasts  but they cannot tolerate an immortal human being since their own mortality is endurable only so long as it is universal .  and for that reason they won   t make me a human being .        what is it you   re leading up to  andrew .     li hsing asked .     i have removed that problem .  decades ago  my positronic brain was connected to organic nerves .  now  one last operation has arranged that connection in such a way that slowly   quite slowly   the potential is being drained from my pathways .     li hsing   s finely wrinkled face showed no expression for a moment .  then her lips tightened .     do you mean you   ve arranged to die  andrew .  you can   t have .  that violates the third law .        no     said andrew     i have chosen between the death of my body and the death of my aspirations and desires .  to have let my body live at the cost of the greater death is what would have violated the third law .     li hsing seized his arm as though she were about to shake him .  she stopped herself .     andrew  it won   t work .  change it back .        it can   t be done .  too much damage was done .  i have a year to live more or less .  i will last through the two hundredth anniversary of my construction .  i was weak enough to arrange that .        how can it be worth it .  andrew  you   re a fool .        if it brings me humanity  that will be worth it .  if it doesn   t  it will bring an end to striving and that will be worth it  too .     then li hsing did something that astonished herself .  quietly  she began to weep .      .   it was odd how that last deed caught the imagination of the world .  all that andrew had done before had not swayed them .  but he had finally accepted even death to be human  and the sacrifice was too great to be rejected .  the final ceremony was timed  quite deliberately  for the two hundredth anniversary .  the world president was to sign the act and make the people   s will law .  the ceremony would be visible on a global network and would be beamed to the lunar state and even to the martian colony .  andrew was in a wheelchair .  he could still walk  but only shakily .  with mankind watching  the world president said     fifty years ago  you were declared the sesquicentennial robot  andrew .     after a pause  and in a more solemn tone  he continued     today we declare you the bicentennial man  mr .  martin .     and andrew  smiling  held out his hand to shake that of the president .      .   andrew   s thoughts were slowly fading as he lay in bed .  desperately he seized at them .  man .  he was a man .  he wanted that to be his last thought .  he wanted to dissolve   die with that .  he opened his eyes one more time and for one last time recognized li hsing  waiting solemnly .  others were there  but they were only shadows  unrecognizable shadows .  only li hsing stood out against the deepening gray .  slowly  inchingly  he held out his hand to her and very dimly and faintly felt her take it .  she was fading in his eyes as the last of his thoughts trickled away .  but before she faded completely  one final fugitive thought came to him and rested for a moment on his mind before everything stopped .     little miss     he whispered  too low to be heard .   a last word  to those of you who have read some  or  possibly  all  of my robot stories before  i welcome your loyalty and patience .  to those of you who have not  i hope this book has given you pleasure  and i   m pleased to have met you  and i hope we meet again soon .
