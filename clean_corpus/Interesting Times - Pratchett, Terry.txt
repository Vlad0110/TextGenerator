    there is a curse .     they say   may you live in interesting times      begin reading   this is where the gods play games with the lives of men  on a board which is at one and the same time a simple playing area and the whole world .   and fate always wins .   fate always wins .  most of the gods throw dice but fate plays chess  and you don   t find out until too late that he   s been using two queens all along .   fate wins .  at least  so it is claimed .  whatever happens  they say afterwards  it must have been fate .    gods can take any form  but the one aspect of themselves they cannot change is their eyes  which show their nature .  the eyes of fate are hardly eyes at all   just dark holes into an infinity speckled with what may be stars or  there again  may be other things .   he blinked them  smiled at his fellow players in the smug way winners do just before they become winners  and said      i accuse the high priest of the green robe in the library with the double handed axe .      and he won .   he beamed at them .      no one likeh a poor winner     grumbled offler the crocodile god  through his fangs .      it seems that i am favoring myself today     said fate .     anyone fancy something else .      the gods shrugged .      mad kings .     said fate pleasantly .     star crossed lovers .         i think we   ve lost the rules for that one     said blind io  chief of the gods .      or tempest wrecked mariners .         you always win     said io .      floods and droughts .     said fate .     that   s an easy one .      a shadow fell across the gaming table .  the gods looked up .      ah     said fate .      let a game begin     said the lady .   there was always an argument about whether the newcomer was a goddess at all .  certainly no one ever got anywhere by worshipping her  and she tended to turn up only where she was least expected  such as now .  and people who trusted in her seldom survived .  any temples built to her would surely be struck by lightning .  better to juggle axes on a tightrope than say her name .  just call her the waitress in the last chance saloon .   she was generally referred to as the lady  and her eyes were green  not as the eyes of humans are green  but emerald green from edge to edge .  it was said to be her favorite color .      ah     said fate again .     and what game will it be .      she sat down opposite him .  the watching gods looked sidelong at one another .  this looked interesting .  these two were ancient enemies .      how about       she paused        mighty empires .         oh  i hate that one     said offler  breaking the sudden silence .     everyone dief at the end .         yes     said fate     i believe they do .     he nodded at the lady  and in much the same voice as professional gamblers say    aces high .     said     the fall of great houses .  destinies of nations hanging by a thread .         certainly     she said .      oh  good .     fate waved a hand across the board .  the discworld appeared .      and where shall we play .     he said .      the counterweight continent     said the lady .     where five noble families have fought one another for centuries .         really .  which families are these .     said io .  he had little involvement with individual humans .  he generally looked after thunder and lightning  so from his point of view the only purpose of humanity was to get wet or  in occasional cases  charred .      the hongs  the sungs  the tangs  the mcsweeneys and the fangs .         them .  i didn   t know they were noble     said io .      they   re all very rich and have had millions of people butchered or tortured to death merely for reasons of expediency and pride     said the lady .   the watching gods nodded solemnly .  that was certainly noble behavior .  that was exactly what they would have done .      mcfweeneyf .     said offler .      very old established family     said fate .      oh .         and they wrestle one another for the empire     said fate .     very good .  which will you be .      the lady looked at the history stretched out in front of them .      the hongs are the most powerful .  even as we speak  they have taken yet more cities     she said .     i see they are fated to win .         so  no doubt  you   ll pick a weaker family .      fate waved his hand again .  the playing pieces appeared  and started to move around the board as if they had a life of their own  which was of course the case .      but     he said     we shall play without dice .  i don   t trust you with dice .  you throw them where i can   t see them .  we will play with steel  and tactics  and politics  and war .      the lady nodded .   fate looked across at his opponent .      and your move .     he said .   she smiled .     i   ve already made it .      he looked down .     but i don   t see your pieces on the board .         they   re not on the board yet     she said .   she opened her hand .   there was something black and yellow on her palm .  she blew on it  and it unfolded its wings .   it was a butterfly .   fate always wins     at least  when people stick to the rules .      according to the philosopher ly tin wheedle  chaos is found in greatest abundance wherever order is being sought .  it always defeats order  because it is better organized .      this is the butterfly of the storms .   see the wings  slightly more ragged than those of the common fritillary .  in reality  thanks to the fractal nature of the universe  this means that those ragged edges are infinite   in the same way that the edge of any rugged coastline  when measured to the ultimate microscopic level  is infinitely long   or  if not infinite  then at least so close to it that infinity can be seen on a clear day .   and therefore  if their edges are infinitely long  the wings must logically be infinitely big .   they may look about the right size for a butterfly   s wings  but that   s only because human beings have always preferred common sense to logic .   the quantum weather butterfly  papilio tempestae  is an undistinguished yellow color  although the mandelbrot patterns on the wings are of considerable interest .  its outstanding feature is its ability to create weather .   this presumably began as a survival trait  since even an extremely hungry bird would find itself inconvenienced by a nasty localized tornado .   from there it possibly became a secondary sexual characteristic  like the plumage of birds or the throat sacs of certain frogs .  look at me  the male says  flapping his wings lazily in the canopy of the rain forest .  i may be an undistinguished yellow color but in a fortnight   s time  a thousand miles away  freak gales cause road chaos .   this is the butterfly of the storms .   it flaps its wings        this is the discworld  which goes through space on the back of a giant turtle .   most worlds do  at some time in their perception .  it   s a cosmological view the human brain seems pre programmed to take .   on veldt and plain  in cloud jungle and silent red desert  in swamp and reed marsh  in fact in any place where something goes    plop    off a floating log as you approach  variations on the following take place at a crucial early point in the development of the tribal mythology        you see dat .         what .         it just went plop off dat log .         yeah .  well .         i reckon   i reckon   like  i reckon der world is carried on der back of one of dem .      a moment of silence while this astrophysical hypothesis is considered  and then        the whole world .         of course  when i say one of dem  i mean a big one of dem .         it   d have to be  yeah .         like   really big .            s funny  but   i see what you mean .         makes sense  right .         makes sense  yeah .  thing is           what .         i just hope it never goes plop .      but this is the discworld  which has not only the turtle but also the four giant elephants on which the wide  slowly turning wheel of the world revolves .    there is the circle sea  approximately halfway between the hub and the rim .  around it are those countries which  according to history  constitute the civilized world  i . e .  a world that can support historians  ephebe  tsort  omnia  klatch  and the sprawling city state of ankh morpork .   this is a story that starts somewhere else  where a man is lying on a raft in a blue lagoon under a sunny sky .  his head is resting on his arms .  he is happy   in his case  a mental state so rare as to be almost unprecedented .  he is whistling an amiable little tune  and dangling his feet in the crystal clear water .   they   re pink feet with ten toes that look like little piggy wiggies .   from the point of view of a shark  skimming over the reef  they look like lunch  dinner and tea .      it was  as always  a matter of protocol .  of discretion .  of careful etiquette .  of  ultimately  alcohol .  or at least the illusion of alcohol .   lord vetinari  as supreme ruler of ankh morpork  could in theory summon the archchancellor of unseen university to his presence and  indeed  have him executed if he failed to obey .   on the other hand mustrum ridcully  as head of the college of wizards  had made it clear in polite but firm ways that he could turn him into a small amphibian and  indeed  start jumping around the room on a pogo stick .   alcohol bridged the diplomatic gap nicely .  sometimes lord vetinari invited the archchancellor to the palace for a convivial drink .  and of course the archchancellor went  because it would be bad manners not to .  and everyone understood the position  and everyone was on their best behavior  and thus civil unrest and slime on the carpet were averted .   it was a beautiful afternoon .  lord vetinari was sitting in the palace gardens  watching the butterflies with an expression of mild annoyance .  he found something very slightly offensive about the way they just fluttered around enjoying themselves in an unprofitable way .   he looked up .      ah  archchancellor     he said .     so good to see you .  do sit down .  i trust you are well .         yes indeed     said mustrum ridcully .     and yourself .  you are in good health .         never better .  the weather  i see  has turned out nice again .         i thought yesterday was particularly fine  certainly .         tomorrow  i am told  could well be even better .         we could certainly do with a fine spell .         yes  indeed .         yes .         ah           certainly .      they watched the butterflies .  a butler brought long  cool drinks .      what is it they actually do with the flowers .     said lord vetinari .      what .      the patrician shrugged .     never mind .  it was not at all important .  but   since you are here  archchancellor  having dropped by on your way to something infinitely more important  i am sure  most kind   i wonder if you could tell me  who is the great wizard .      ridcully considered this .      the dean  possibly     he said .     he must be all of twenty stone .         somehow i feel that is not perhaps the right answer     said lord vetinari .     i suspect from context that    great    means superior .         not the dean  then     said ridcully .   lord vetinari tried to recollect the faculty of unseen university .  the mental picture that emerged was of a small range of foothills in pointy hats .      the context does not  i feel  suggest the dean     he said .      er   what context would this be .     said ridcully .   the patrician picked up his walking stick .      come this way     he said .     i suppose you had better see for yourself .  it is very vexing .      ridcully looked around with interest as he followed lord vetinari .  he did not often have a chance to see the gardens  which had been written up in the    how not to do it    section of gardening manuals everywhere .   they had been laid out  and a truer phrase was never used  by the renowned or at least notorious landscape gardener and all round inventor    bloody stupid    johnson  whose absent mindedness and blindness to elementary mathematics made every step a walk with danger .  his genius   well  as far as ridcully understood it  his genius was exactly the opposite of whatever kind of genius it was that built earthworks that tapped the secret yet beneficent forces of the leylines .   no one was quite certain what forces bloody stupid   s designs tapped  but the chiming sundial frequently exploded  the crazy paving had committed suicide and the cast iron garden furniture was known to have melted on three occasions .   the patrician led the way through a gate and into something like a dovecot .  a creaking wooden stairway led around the inside .  a few of ankh morpork   s indestructible feral pigeons muttered and sniggered in the shadows .      what   s this .     said ridcully  as the stairs groaned under him .   the patrician took a key out of his pocket .     i have always understood that mr .  johnson originally planned this to be a beehive     he said .     however  in the absence of bees ten feet long we have found   other uses .      he unlocked a door to a wide  square room with a big unglazed window in each wall .  each rectangle was surrounded by a wooden arrangement to which was affixed a bell on a spring .  it was apparent that anything large enough  entering by one of the windows  would cause the bell to ring .   in the center of the room  standing on a table  was the largest bird ridcully had ever seen .  it turned and fixed him with a beady yellow eye .   the patrician reached into a pocket and took out a jar of anchovies .     this one caught us rather unexpectedly     he said .     it must be almost ten years since a message last arrived .  we used to keep a few fresh mackerel on ice .         isn   t that a pointless albatross .     said ridcully .      indeed     said lord vetinari .     and a highly trained one .  it will return this evening .  six thousand miles on one jar of anchovies and a bottle of fish paste my clerk drumknott found in the kitchens .  amazing .         i   m sorry .     said ridcully .     return to where .      lord vetinari turned to face him .      not  let me make it clear  to the counterweight continent     he said .     this is not one of those birds the agatean empire uses for its message services .  it is a well known fact that we have no contact with that mysterious land .  and this bird is not the first to arrive here for many years  and it did not bring a strange and puzzling message .  do i make myself clear .         no .         good .         this is not an albatross .      the patrician smiled .     ah  i can see you   re getting the hang of it .      mustrum ridcully  though possessed of a large and efficient brain  was not at home with duplicity .  he looked at the long vicious beak .      looks like a bloody albatross to me     he said .     and you just said it was .  i said  isn   t that a        the patrician waved a hand irritably .     leaving aside our ornithological studies     he said     the point is that this bird had  in its message pouch  the following piece of paper           you mean did not have the following piece of paper .     said ridcully  struggling for a grip .      ah  yes .  of course  that is what i mean .  and this isn   t it .  observe .      he handed a single small sheet to the archchancellor .      looks like paintin        said ridcully .      those are agatean pictograms     said the patrician .      you mean they   re not agatean pictograms .         yes  yes  certainly     sighed the patrician     i can see you are well alongside the essential business of diplomacy .  now   your views  please .         looks like slosh  slosh  slosh  slosh  wizzard     said ridcully .      and from that you deduce    .         he took art because he wasn   t any good at spelling .  i mean  who wrote it .  painted it  i mean .         i don   t know .  the grand viziers used to send the occasional message  but i gather there has been some turmoil in recent years .  it is unsigned  you notice .  however  i cannot ignore it .         wizzard  wizzard     said ridcully  thoughtfully .      the pictograms mean    send us instantly the great        said lord vetinari .         wizzard       said ridcully to himself  tapping the paper .   the patrician tossed an anchovy to the albatross  which swallowed it greedily .      the empire has a million men under arms     he said .     happily  it suits the rulers to pretend that everywhere outside the empire is a valueless howling waste peopled only by vampires and ghosts .  they usually have no interest whatsoever in our affairs .  this is fortunate for us  because they are both cunning  rich  and powerful .  frankly  i had hoped they had forgotten about us altogether .  and now this .  i was hoping to be able to dispatch the wretched person and forget about it .            wizzard       said ridcully .      perhaps you would like a holiday .     said the patrician  a hint of hope in his voice .      me .  no .  can   t abide foreign food     said ridcully quickly .  he repeated  half to himself     wizzard           the word seems to fascinate you     said lord vetinari .      seen it spelled like that before     said ridcully .     can   t remember where .         i   m sure you will remember .  and will be in a position to send the great wizard  however he is spelled  to the empire by teatime .      ridcully   s jaw dropped .      six thousand miles .  by magic .  do you know how hard that is .         i cherish my ignorance on the subject     said lord vetinari .      besides     ridcully went on     they   re  well   foreign over there .  i thought they had enough wizards of their own .         i really couldn   t say .         we don   t know why they want this wizard .         no .  but i   m sure there is someone you could spare .  there seems to be such a lot of you down there .         i mean  it could be for some terrible foreign purpose     said ridcully .  for some reason the face of the dean waddled across his mind  and he brightened up .     they might be happy with a great wizard  do you think .     he mused .      i leave that entirely to you .  but by tonight i would like to be able to send back a message saying that the great wizzard is duly on his way .  and then we can forget about it .         of course  it would be very hard to bring the chap back     said ridcully .  he thought of the dean again .     practically impossible     he added  in an inappropriately happy way .     i expect we   d try for months and months without succeeding .  i expect we   d attempt everything with no luck .  damn it .         i can see you are agog to rise to this challenge     said the patrician .     let me not detain you from rushing back to the university and putting measures in hand .         but      wizzard          ridcully murmured .     rings a faint bell  that .  think i   ve seen it before  somewhere .         the shark didn   t think much .  sharks don   t .  their thought processes can largely be represented by       .      you see it   you eat it .   but  as it arrowed through the waters of the lagoon  its tiny brain began to receive little packages of selachian existential dread that could only be called doubts .   it knew it was the biggest shark around .  all the challengers had fled  or run up against good old       .      yet its body told it that something was coming up fast behind it .   it turned gracefully  and the first thing it saw was hundreds of legs and thousands of toes  a whole pork pie factory of piggy wiggies .      many things went on at unseen university and  regrettably  teaching had to be one of them .  the faculty had long ago confronted this fact and had perfected various devices for avoiding it .  but this was perfectly all right because  to be fair  so had the students .   the system worked quite well and  as happens in such cases  had taken on the status of a tradition .  lectures clearly took place  because they were down there on the timetable in black and white .  the fact that no one attended was an irrelevant detail .  it was occasionally maintained that this meant that the lectures did not in fact happen at all  but no one ever attended them to find out if this was true .  anyway  it was argued  by the reader in woolly thinking   that lectures had taken place in essence  so that was all right  too .   and therefore education at the university mostly worked by the age old method of putting a lot of young people in the vicinity of a lot of books and hoping that something would pass from one to the other  while the actual young people put themselves in the vicinity of inns and taverns for exactly the same reason .   it was the middle of the afternoon .  the chair of indefinite studies was giving a lecture in room  b and therefore his presence asleep in front of the fire in the uncommon room was a technicality upon which no diplomatic man would comment .   ridcully kicked him on the shins .      ow .         sorry to interrupt  chair     said ridcully  in a very perfunctory way .     gods help me  i need the council of wizards .  where is everybody .      the chair of indefinite studies rubbed his leg .     i know the lecturer in recent runes is giving a lecture in  b        he said .     but i don   t know where he is .  you know  that really hurt           round everyone up .  my study .  ten minutes     said ridcully .  he was a great believer in this approach .  a less direct archchancellor would have wandered around looking for everyone .  his policy was to find one person and make their life difficult until everything happened the way he wanted it to .        nothing in nature had that many feet .  true  some things had that many legs   damp  wriggling things that live under rocks   but those weren   t legs with feet  they were just legs that ended without ceremony .   something brighter than the shark might have been wary .  but           swung treacherously into play and shot it forward .   that was its first mistake .   in these circumstances  one mistake   oblivion .      ridcully was waiting impatiently when  one by one  the senior wizards filed in from serious lecturing in room  b .  senior wizards needed a lot of lecturing in order to digest their food .      everyone here .     he said .     right .  sit down .  listen carefully .  now   vetinari hasn   t had an albatross .  it hasn   t come all the way from the counterweight continent  and there isn   t a strange message that we   ve got to obey  apparently .  follow me so far .      the senior wizards exchanged glances .      i think we may be a shade unclear on the detail     said the dean .      i was using diplomatic language .         could you  perhaps  try to be a little more indiscreet .         we   ve got to send a wizard to the counterweight continent     said ridcully .     and we   ve got to do it by teatime .  someone   s asked for a great wizard and it seems we   ve got to send one .  only they spell it wizzard           oook .         yes  librarian .      unseen university   s librarian  who had been dozing with his head on the table  was suddenly sitting bolt upright .  then he pushed back his chair and  arms waving wildly for balance  left the room at a bowlegged run .      probably remembered an overdue book     said the dean .  he lowered his voice .     am i alone in thinking  by the way  that it doesn   t add to the status of this university to have an ape on the faculty .         yes     said ridcully flatly .     you are .  we   ve got the only librarian who can rip off your arm with his leg .  people respect that .  only the other day the head of the thieves    guild was asking me if we could turn their librarian into an ape and  besides  he   s the only one of you buggers who stays awake more   n an hour a day .  anyway           well  i find it embarrassing     said the dean .     also  he   s not a proper orang utan .  i   ve been reading a book .  it says a dominant male should have huge cheek pads .  has he got huge cheek pads .  i don   t think so .  and           shut up  dean     said ridcully     or i won   t let you go to the counterweight continent .         i don   t see what raising a perfectly valid   what .         they   re asking for the great wizzard     said ridcully .     and i immediately thought of you .     as the only man i know who can sit on two chairs at the same time  he added silently .      the empire .     squeaked the dean .     me .  but they hate foreigners .         so do you .  you should get on famously .         it   s six thousand miles .     said the dean  trying a new tack .     everyone knows you can   t get that far by magic .         er .  as a matter of fact you can  i think     said a voice from the other end of the table .   they all looked at ponder stibbons  the youngest and most depressingly keen member of the faculty .  he was holding a complicated mechanism of sliding wooden bars and peering at the other wizards over the top of it .      er .  shouldn   t be too much of a problem     he added .     people used to think it was  but i   m pretty sure it   s all a matter of energy absorption and attention to relative velocities .      the statement was followed with the kind of mystified and suspicious silence that generally succeeded one of his remarks .      relative velocities     said ridcully .      yes  archchancellor .     ponder looked down at his prototype slide rule and waited .  he knew that ridcully would feel it necessary to add a comment at this point in order to demonstrate that he   d grasped something .      my mother could move like lightning when           i mean how fast things are going when compared to other things     ponder said quickly  but not quite quickly enough .     we should be able to work it out quite easily .  er .  on hex .         oh  no     said the lecturer in recent runes  pushing his chair back .     not that .  that   s meddling with things you don   t understand .         well  we are wizards     said ridcully .     we   re supposed to meddle with things we don   t understand .  if we hung around waitin    till we understood things we   d never get anything done .         look  i don   t mind summoning some demon and asking it     said the lecturer in recent runes .     that   s normal .  but building some mechanical contrivance to do your thinking for you  that   s   against nature .  besides     he added in slightly less foreboding tones     last time you did a big problem on it the wretched thing broke and we had ants all over the place .         we   ve sorted that out     said ponder .     we           i must admit there was a ram   s skull in the middle of it last time i looked     said ridcully .      we had to add that to do occult transformations     said ponder     but           and cogwheels and springs     the archchancellor went on .      well  the ants aren   t very good at differential analysis  so           and that strange wobbly thing with the cuckoo .         the unreal time clock     said ponder .     yes  we think that   s essential for working out           anyway  it   s all quite immaterial  because i certainly have no intention of going anywhere     said the dean .     send a student  if you must .  we   ve got a lot of spare ones .         good so be would you if  duff plum of helping second a     said the bursar .   the table fell silent .      anyone understand that .     said ridcully .   the bursar was not technically insane .  he had passed through the rapids of insanity some time previously  and was now sculling around in some peaceful pool on the other side .  he was often quite coherent  although not by normal human standards .      um  he   s going through yesterday again     said the senior wrangler .     backwards  this time .         we should send the bursar     said the dean firmly .      certainly not .  you probably can   t get dried frog pills there           oook .      the librarian re entered the study at a bandylegged run  waving something in the air .   it was red  or at least had at some time been red .  it might well once have been a pointy hat  but the point had crumpled and most of the brim was burned away .  a word had been embroidered on it in sequins .  many had been burned off  but   wizzard     could just be made out as pale letters on the scorched cloth .      i knew i   d seen it before     said ridcully .     on a shelf in the library  right .         oook .      the archchancellor inspected the remnant .      wizzard .     he said .     what kind of sad  hopeless person needs to write wizzard on their hat .         a few bubbles broke the surface of the sea  causing the raft to rock a little .  after a while  a couple of pieces of shark skin floated up .   rincewind sighed and put down his fishing rod .  the rest of the shark would be dragged ashore later  he knew it .  he couldn   t imagine why .  it wasn   t as if they were good eating .  they tasted like old boots soaked in urine .   he picked up a makeshift oar and set out for the beach .   it wasn   t a bad little island .  storms seemed to pass it by .  so did ships .  but there were coconuts  and breadfruit  and some sort of wild fig .  even his experiments in alcohol had been quite successful  although he hadn   t been able to walk properly for two days .  the lagoon provided prawns and shrimps and oysters and crabs and lobsters  and in the deep green water out beyond the reef big silver fish fought each other for the privilege of biting a piece of bent wire on the end of a bit of string .  after six months on the island  in fact  there was only one thing rincewind lacked .  he   d never really thought about it before .  now he thought about it   or  more correctly  them   all the time .   it was odd .  he   d hardly ever thought about them in ankh morpork  because they were there if ever he wanted them .  now they weren   t  and he craved .   his raft bumped the white sand at about the same moment as a large canoe rounded the reef and entered the lagoon .      ridcully was sitting at his desk now  surrounded by his senior wizards .  they were trying to tell him things  despite the known danger of trying to tell ridcully things  which was that he picked up the facts he liked and let the others take a running jump .      so     he said     not a kind of cheese .         no  archchancellor     said the chair of indefinite studies .     rincewind is a kind of wizard .         was     said the lecturer in recent runes .      not a cheese     said ridcully  unwilling to let go of a fact .      no .         sounds a sort of name you   d associate with cheese .  i mean  a pound of mature rincewind  it rolls off the tongue           godsdammit  rincewind is not a cheese .     shouted the dean  his temper briefly cracking .     rincewind is not a yogurt or any kind of sour milk derivative .  rincewind is a bloody nuisance .  a complete and utter disgrace to wizardry .  a fool .  a failure .  anyway  he hasn   t been seen here since that   unpleasantness with the sourcerer  years ago .         really .     said ridcully  with a certain kind of nasty politeness .     a lot of wizards behaved very badly then  i understand .         yes indeed     said the lecturer in recent runes  scowling at the dean  who bridled .      i don   t know anything about that  runes .  i wasn   t dean at the time .         no  but you were very senior .         perhaps  but it just so happens that at the time i was visiting my aunt  for your information .         they nearly blew up the whole city .         she lives in quirm .         and quirm was heavily involved  as i recall .            near quirm .  near quirm .  not all that near  actually .  quite a way along the coast           hah .         anyway  you seem to be very well informed  eh  runes .     said the dean .      i   what .    i   was studying hard at the time .  hardly knew what was going on           half the university was blown down .     the dean remembered himself and added     that is  so i heard .  later .  after getting back from my aunt   s .         yes  but i   ve got a very thick door           and i happen to know the senior wrangler was here  because              with that heavy green baize stuff you can hardly hear any           nap my for time it   s think i .         will you all shut up right now this minute .      ridcully glared at his faculty with the clear  innocent glare of someone who was blessed at birth with no imagination whatsoever  and who had genuinely been hundreds of miles away during the university   s recent embarrassing history .      right     he said  when they had quietened down .     this rincewind .  bit of an idiot  yes .  you talk  dean .  everyone else will shut up .      the dean looked uncertain .      well  er   i mean  it makes no sense  archchancellor .  he couldn   t even do proper magic .  what good would he be to anyone .  besides   where rincewind went      he lowered his voice      trouble followed behind .      ridcully noticed that the wizards drew a little closer together .      sounds all right to me     he said .     best place for trouble  behind .  you certainly don   t want it in front .         you don   t understand  archchancellor     said the dean .     it followed behind on hundreds of little legs .      the archchancellor   s smile stayed where it was while the rest of his face went solid behind it .      you been on the bursar   s pills  dean .         i assure you  mustrum           then don   t talk rubbish .         very well  archchancellor .  but you do realize  don   t you  that it might take years to find him .         er     said ponder     if we can work out his thaumic signature  i think hex could probably do it in a day        the dean glared .      that   s not magic .     he snapped .     that   s just   engineering .         rincewind trudged through the shallows and used a sharp rock to hack the top off a coconut that had been cooling in a convenient shady rock pool .  he put it to his lips .   a shadow fell across him .   it said     er  hello .         it was possible  if you kept on talking at the archchancellor for long enough  that some facts might squeeze through .      so what you   re tellin    me     said ridcully  eventually     is that this rincewind fella has been chased by just about every army in the world  has been bounced around life like a pea on a drum  and probably is the one wizard who knows anything about the agatean empire on account of once being friends with     he glanced at his notes        a strange little man in glasses    who came from there and gave him this funny thing with the legs you all keep alluding to .  and he can speak the lingo .  am i right so far .         exactly  archchancellor .  call me an idiot if you like     said the dean     but why would anyone want him .      ridcully looked down at his notes again .     you   ve decided to go  then .     he said .      no  of course not           what i don   t think you   ve spotted here  dean     he said  breaking into a determinedly cheery grin     is what i might call the common denominator .  chap stays alive .  talented .  find him .  and bring him here .  wherever he is .  poor chap could be facing something dreadful .         the coconut stayed where it was  but rincewind   s eyes swivelled madly from side to side .   three figures stepped into his line of vision .  they were obviously female .  they were abundantly female .  they were not wearing a great deal of clothing and seemed to be altogether too fresh from the hairdressers for people who have just been paddling a large war canoe  but this is often the case with beautiful amazonian warriors .   a thin trickle of coconut milk began to dribble off the end of rincewind   s beard .   the leading woman brushed aside her long blonde hair and gave him a bright smile .      i know this sounds a little unlikely     she said     but i and my sisters here represent a hitherto undiscovered tribe whose menfolk were recently destroyed in a deadly but short lived and highly specific plague .  now we have been searching these islands for a man to enable us to carry on our line .         how much do you think he weighs .      rincewind   s eyebrows raised .  the woman looked down shyly .      you may be wondering why we are all blonde and white skinned when everyone else in the islands around here is dark     she said .     it just seems to be one of those genetic things .         about          pounds .  put another pound or two of junk on the heap .  er .  can you detect   you know   it .         this is all going to go wrong  mr .  stibbons  i just know it .         he   s only six hundred miles away and we know where we are  and he   s on the right half of the disc .  anyway  i   ve worked this out on hex so nothing can possibly go wrong .         yes  but can anyone see   that   you know   with the   feet .      rincewind   s eyebrows waggled .  a sort of choking noise came from his throat .      can   t see   it .  will you lot stop huffing on my crystal ball .         and  of course  if you were to come with us we could promise you   earthly and sensual pleasures such as those of which you may have dreamed           all right .  on the count of three        the coconut dropped away .  rincewind swallowed .  there was a hungry  dreamy look in his eyes .      can i have them mashed .     he said .      now .         first there was the sensation of pressure .  the world opened up in front of rincewind and sucked him into it .   then it stretched out thin and went twang .   cloud rushed past him  blurred by speed .  when he dared open his eyes again it was to see  far ahead of him  a tiny black dot .   it got bigger .   it resolved itself into a tight cloud of objects .  there were a couple of heavy saucepans  a large brass candlestick  a few bricks  a chair  and a large brass blancmange mold in the shape of a castle .   they hit him one after the other  the blancmange mold making a humorous clang as it bounced off his head  and then whirled away behind him .   the next thing ahead of him was an octagon .  a chalked one .   he hit it .      ridcully stared down .      a shade less than     pounds  i fancy     he said .     all the same   well done  gentlemen .      the disheveled scarecrow in the center of the circle staggered to its feet and beat out one or two small fires in its clothing .  then it looked around blearily and said     hehehe .         he could be a little disorientated     the archchancellor went on .     more than six hundred miles in two seconds  after all .  don   t give him a nasty shock .         like sleepwalkers  you mean .     said the senior wrangler .      what do you mean  sleepwalkers .         if you wake sleepwalkers  their legs drop off .  so my grandmother used to aver .         and are we sure it   s rincewind .     said the dean .      of course it   s rincewind     said the senior wrangler .     we spent hours looking for him .         it could be some dangerous occult creature     said the dean stubbornly .      with that hat .      it was a pointy hat .  in a way .  a kind of cargocult pointy hat  made out of split bamboo and coconut leaves  in the hope of attracting passing wizardliness .  picked out on it  in seashells held in place with grass  was the word wizzard .   its wearer gazed right through the wizards and  as if driven by some sudden recollection of purpose  lurched abruptly out of the octagon and headed towards the door of the hall .   the wizards followed cautiously .      i   m not sure i believe her .  how many times did she see it happen .         i don   t know .  she never said .         the bursar sleepwalks most nights  you know .         does he .  tempting        rincewind  if that was the creature   s name  headed out into sator square .   it was crowded .  the air shimmered over the braziers of chestnut sellers and hot potato merchants and echoed with the traditional street cries of old ankh morpork .    the figure sidled up to a skinny man in a huge overcoat who was frying something over a little oilheater in a wide tray around his neck .   the possibly rincewind grabbed the edge of the tray .      got   any   potatoes .     it growled .      potatoes .  no  squire .  got some sausages inna bun .      the possibly rincewind froze .  and then it burst into tears .      sausage inna buuunnnnn .     it bawled .     dear old sausage inna inna inna buuunnn .  gimme saussaaage inna buunnnnn .      it grabbed three off the tray and tried to eat them all at once .      good grief .     said ridcully .   the figure half ran  half capered away  fragments of bun and pork product debris cascading from its unkempt beard .      i   ve never seen anyone eat three of throat dibbler   s sausages inna bun and look so happy     said the senior wrangler .      i   ve never seen someone eat three of throat dibbler   s sausages inna bun and look so upright     said the dean .      i   ve never seen anyone eat anything of dibbler   s and get away without paying     said the lecturer in recent runes .   the figure spun happily around the square  tears streaming down its face .  the gyrations took it past an alley mouth  whereupon a smaller figure stepped out behind it and with some difficulty hit it on the back of the head .   the sausage eater fell to his knees  saying  to the world in general     ow .         nonononononono .      a rather older man stepped out and removed the cosh from the young man   s hesitant hands  while the victim knelt and moaned .      i think you ought to apologize to the poor gentleman     said the older man .     i don   t know  what   s he going to think .  i mean  look at him  he made it so easy for you and what does he get .  i mean  what did you think you were doing .         mumblemumble  mr .  boggis     said the boy  looking at his feet .      what was that again .  speak up .         overarm belter  mr .  boggis .         that was an overarm belter .  you call that an overarm belter .  that was an overarm belter  was it .  this   excuse me  sir  we   ll just have you up on your feet for a moment  sorry about this   this is an overarm belter           ow .     shouted the victim and then  to the surprise of all concerned  he added     hahahaha .         what you did was   sorry to impose again  sir  this won   t take a minute   what you did was this           ow .  hahahaha .         now  you lot  you saw that .  come on  gather round        half a dozen other youths slouched out of the alleyway and formed a ragged audience around mr .  boggis  the luckless student and the victim  who was staggering in a circle and making little    oomph oomph    sounds but still  for some reason  apparently enjoying himself immensely .      now     said mr .  boggis  with the air of an old skilled craftsman imparting his professional expertise to an ungrateful posterity     when inconveniencing a customer from your basic alley entrance  the correct procedure is   oh  hello  mr .  ridcully  didn   t see you there .      the archchancellor gave him a friendly nod .      don   t mind us  mr .  boggis .  thieves    guild training  is it .      boggis rolled his eyes .      dunno what they teaches    em at school     he said .     it   s jus    nothing but reading and writing all the time .  when i was a lad school was where you learned somethin    useful .  right   you  wilkins  stop that giggling  you have a go  excuse us just another moment  sir           ow .         nononononono .  my old granny could do better than that .  now look  you steps up trimly  places one hand on his shoulder here  for control   go on  you do it   and then smartly           ow .         all right  can anyone tell me what he was doing wrong .      the figure crawled away unnoticed  except by the wizards  while mr .  boggis was demonstrating the finer points of head percussion on wilkins .   it staggered to its feet and plunged on along the road  still moving like one hypnotized .      he   s crying     said the dean .      not surprising     said the archchancellor .     but why   s he grinnin    at the same time .         curiouser and curiouser     said the senior wrangler .   bruised and possibly poisoned  the figure headed back for the university  the wizards still trailing behind .      you must mean    curious and more curious     surely .  and even then it doesn   t make much sense        it entered the gates but  this time  hurried jerkily through the main hall and into the library .   the librarian was waiting  holding   with something of a smirk on his face  and an orang utan can really smirk   the battered hat .      amazin        said ridcully .     it   s true .  a wizard will always come back for his hat .      the figure grabbed the hat  evicted some spiders  threw away the sad affair made of leaves and put the hat on his head .   rincewind blinked at the puzzled faculty .  a light came on behind his eyes for the first time  as if up to now he   d merely been operating by reflex action .      er .  what have i just eaten .         er .  three of mr .  dibbler   s finest sausages     said ridcully .     well  when i say finest  i mean    most typical     don   tcheknow .         i see .  and who just hit me .         thieves    guild apprentices out trainin    .      rincewind blinked .     this is ankh morpork  isn   t it .         yes .         i thought so .     rincewind blinked  slowly .     well     he said  just as he fell forward     i   m back .         lord hong was flying a kite .  it was something he did perfectly .   lord hong did everything perfectly .  his watercolors were perfect .  his poetry was perfect .  when he folded paper  every crease was perfect .  imaginative  original  and definitely perfect .  lord hong had long ago ceased pursuing perfection because he already had it nailed up in a dungeon somewhere .   lord hong was twenty six  and thin  and handsome .  he wore very small  very circular steel rimmed spectacles .  when asked to describe him  people often used the word    smooth    or even    lacquered .      and he had risen to the leadership of one of the most influential families in the empire by relentless application  total focusing of his mental powers  and six well executed deaths .  the last one had been that of his father  who   d died happy in the knowledge that his son was maintaining an old family tradition .  the senior families venerated their ancestors  and saw no harm in prematurely adding to their number .   and now his kite  the black kite with the two big eyes  plunged out of the sky .  he   d calculated the angle  needless to say  perfectly .  its string  coated with glue and ground glass  sawed through those of his fellow contestants and sent their kites tumbling .   there was genteel applause from the bystanders .  people generally found it advisable to applaud lord hong .   he handed the string to a servant  nodded curtly at the fellow flyers  and strode towards his tent .   once inside  he sat down and looked at his visitor .     well .     he said .      we sent the message     said the visitor .     no one saw us .         on the contrary     said lord hong .     twenty people saw you .  do you know how hard it is for a guard to look straight ahead and see nothing when people are creeping around making a noise like an army and whispering to one another to be quiet .  frankly  your people do not seem to possess that revolutionary spark .  what is the matter with your hand .         the albatross bit it .      lord hong smiled .  it occurred to him that it might have mistaken his visitor for an anchovy  and with some justification .  there was the same fishy look about the eyes .      i don   t understand  o lord     said the visitor  whose name was two fire herb .      good .         but they believe in the great wizzard and you want him to come here .         oh  certainly .  i have my   people in      he tried the alien syllables      ankh more pork .  the one so foolishly called the great wizzard does exist .  but  i might tell you  he is renowned for being incompetent  cowardly  and spineless .  quite proverbially so .  so i think the red army should have their leader  don   t you .  it will   raise their morale .      he smiled again .     this is politics     he said .      ah .         now go .      lord hong picked up a book as his visitor left .  but it was hardly a real book  pieces of paper had simply been fastened together with string  and the text was handwritten .   he   d read it many times before .  it still amused him  mainly because the author had managed to be wrong about so many things .   now  every time he finished a page  he ripped it out and  while reading the next page  carefully folded the paper into the shape of a chrysanthemum .      great wizard     he said  aloud .     oh  indeed .  very great .         rincewind awoke .  there were clean sheets and no one was saying    go through his pockets     so he chalked that up as a promising beginning .   he kept his eyes shut  just in case there was anyone around who  once he was seen to be awake  would make life complicated for him .   elderly male voices were arguing .      you   re all missin    the point .  he survives .  you keep on tellin    me he   s had all these adventures and he   s still alive .         what do you mean .  he   s got scars all over him .         my point exactly  dean .  most of    em on his back  too .  he leaves trouble behind .  someone up there smiles on him .      rincewind winced .  he had always been aware that someone up there was doing something on him .  he   d never considered it was smiling .      he   s not even a proper wizard .  he never got more than two percent in his exams .         i think he   s awake     said someone .   rincewind gave in  and opened his eyes .  a variety of bearded  overly pink faces looked down upon him .      how   re you feeling  old chap .     said one  extending a hand .     name   s ridcully .  archchancellor .  how   re you feeling .         it   s all going to go wrong     said rincewind flatly .      what d   you mean  old fellow .         i just know it .  it   s all going to go wrong .  something dreadful   s going to happen .  i thought it was too good to last .         you see .     said the dean .     hundreds of little legs .  i told you .  would you listen .      rincewind sat up .     don   t start being nice to me     he said .     don   t start offering me grapes .  no one ever wants me for something nice .     a confused memory of his very recent past floated across his mind and he experienced a brief moment of regret that potatoes  while uppermost in his mind at that point  had not been similarly positioned in the mind of the young lady .  no one dressed like that  he was coming to realize  could be thinking of any kind of root vegetable .   he sighed .     all right  what happens now .         how do you feel .      rincewind shook his head .     it   s no good     he said .     i hate it when people are nice to me .  it means something bad is going to happen .  do you mind shouting .      ridcully had had enough .     get out of that bed you horrible little man and follow me this minute or it will go very hard for you .         ah  that   s better .  i feel right at home now .  now we   re cooking with charcoal     said rincewind  glumly .  he swung his legs off the bed and stood up carefully .   ridcully stopped halfway to the door  where the other wizards had lined up .      runes .         yes  archchancellor .     said the lecturer in recent runes  his voice oozing innocence .      what is that you   ve got behind your back .         sorry  archchancellor .     said the lecturer in recent runes .      looks like some kind of tool     said ridcully .      oh  this     said the lecturer in recent runes  as if he   d only just at that moment noticed the eight pound lump hammer he   d been holding .     my word   it   s a hammer  isn   t it .  my word .  a hammer .  i suppose i must just have   picked it up somewhere .  you know .  to keep the place tidy .         and i can   t help noticing     said ridcully     that the dean seems to be tryin    to conceal a battle axe about his person .      there was a musical twang from the rear of the chair of indefinite studies .      and that sounded like a saw to me     said ridcully .     is there anyone here not concealin    some kind of implement .  right .  would anyone care to explain what the hell you think you   re doin    .         hah  you don   t know what it was like     muttered the dean  not meeting the archchancellor   s eye .     a man daren   t turn his back for five minutes in those days .  you   d hear the patter of those damn feet and        ridcully ignored him .  he put an arm around rincewind   s bony shoulders and led the way towards the great hall .      well  now  rincewind     he said .     they tell me you   re no good at magic .         that   s right .         never passed any exams or anything .         none  i   m afraid .         but everyone calls you rincewind the wizard .      rincewind looked at his feet .     well  i kind of worked here as sort of deputy librarian              an ape   s number two       said the dean .         and  you know  did odd jobs and things and kind of  you know  helped out           i say  did anyone notice that .  an ape   s number two .  rather clever  i thought .         but you have never  in fact  actually been entitled to call yourself a wizard .     said ridcully .      not technically  i suppose           i see .  that is a problem .         i   ve got this hat with the word    wizzard    on it     said rincewind hopefully .      not a great help  i   m afraid .  hmm .  this presents us with a bit of a difficulty  i   m afraid .  let me see   how long can you hold your breath .         i don   t know .  a couple of minutes .  is that important .         it is in the context of being nailed upside down to one of the supports of the brass bridge for two high tides and then being beheaded which  i   m afraid  is the statutory punishment for impersonating a wizard .  i looked it up .  no one was more sorry than me  i can tell you .  but the lore is the lore .         oh  no .         sorry .  no alternative .  otherwise we   d be knee deep in people in pointy hats they   d no right to .  it   s a terrible shame .  can   t do a thing .  wish i could .  hands tied .  the statutes say you can only be a wizard by passing through the university in the normal way or by performing some great service of benefit to magic  and i   m afraid that           couldn   t you just send me back to my island .  i liked it there .  it was dull .      ridcully shook his head sadly .      no can do  i   m afraid .  the offence has been committed over a period of many years .  and since you haven   t passed any exams or performed     ridcully raised his voice slightly     any service of great benefit to magic  i   m afraid i shall have to instruct the bledlows  to fetch some rope and           er .  i think i may have saved the world a couple of times     said rincewind .     does that help .         did anyone from the university see you do it .         no  i don   t think so .      ridcully shook his head .     probably doesn   t count  then .  it   s a shame  because if you had performed any service of great benefit to magic then i   d be happy to let you keep that hat and  of course  something to wear it on .      rincewind looked crestfallen .  ridcully sighed  and had one last try .      so     he said     since it seems that you haven   t actually passed your exams or performed a service of great benefit to magic  then           i suppose   i could try to perform some great service .     said rincewind  with the expression of one who knows that the light at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train .      really .  hmm .  well  that   s definitely a thought     said ridcully .      what sort of services are they .         oh  typically you   d be expected to  for the sake of example  go on a quest  or find the answer to some very ancient and important question   what the hell is that thing with all the legs .      rincewind didn   t even bother to look around .  the expression on ridcully   s face  as it stared over his shoulder  was quite familiar .      ah     he said     i think i know that one .         magic isn   t like maths .  like the discworld itself  it follows common sense rather than logic .  and nor is it like cookery .  a cake   s a cake .  mix the ingredients up right and cook them at the right temperature and a cake happens .  no casserole requires moonbeams .  no souffl   ever demanded to be mixed by a virgin .   nevertheless  those afflicted with an enquiring turn of mind have often wondered whether there are rules of magic .  there are more than five hundred known spells to secure the love of another person  and they range from messing around with fern seed at midnight to doing something rather unpleasant with a rhino horn at an unspecified time  but probably not just after a meal .  was it possible  the enquiring minds enquired  that an analysis of all these spells might reveal some small powerful common denominator  some meta spell  some simple little equation which would achieve the required end far more simply  and incidentally come as a great relief to all rhinos .   to answer such questions hex had been built  although ponder stibbons was a bit uneasy about the word    built    in this context .  he and a few keen students had put it together  certainly  but   well   sometimes he thought bits of it  strange though this sounded  just turned up .   for example  he was pretty sure no one had designed the phase of the moon generator  but there it was  clearly a part of the whole thing .  they had built the unreal time clock  although no one seemed to have a very clear idea how it worked .   what he suspected they were dealing with was a specialized case of formative causation  always a risk in a place like unseen university  where reality was stretched so thin and therefore blown by so many strange breezes .  if that was so  then they weren   t exactly designing something .  they were just putting physical clothes on an idea that was already there  a shadow of something that had been waiting to exist .   he   d explained at length to the faculty that hex didn   t think .  it was obvious that it couldn   t think .  part of it was clockwork .  a lot of it was a giant ant farm  the interface  where the ants rode up and down on a little paternoster that turned a significant cogwheel was a little masterpiece  he thought  and the intricately controlled rushing of the ants through their maze of glass tubing was the most important part of the whole thing .   but a lot of it had just   accumulated  like the aquarium and wind chimes which now seemed to be essential .  a mouse had built a nest in the middle of it all and had been allowed to become a fixture  since the thing stopped working when they took it out .  nothing in that assemblage could possibly think  except in fairly limited ways about cheese or sugar .  nevertheless   in the middle of the night  when hex was working hard  and the tubes rustled with the toiling ants  and things suddenly went    clonk    for no obvious reason  and the aquarium had been lowered on its davits so that the operator would have something to watch during the long hours   nevertheless  then a man might begin to speculate about what a brain was and what thought was and whether things that weren   t alive could think and whether a brain was just a more complicated version of hex  or  around   a . m .   when bits of the clockwork reversed direction suddenly and the mice squeaked  a less complicated version of hex  and wonder if the whole produced something not apparently inherent in the parts .   in short  ponder was just a little bit worried .   he sat down at the keyboard .  it was almost as big as the rest of hex  to allow for the necessary levers and armatures .  the various keys allowed little boards with holes in them to drop briefly into slots  forcing the ants into new paths .   it took him some time to compose the problem  but at last he braced one foot on the structure and tugged on the enter lever .   the ants scurried on new paths .  the clockwork started to move .  a small mechanism which ponder would be prepared to swear had not been there yesterday  but which looked like a device for measuring wind speed  began to spin .   after several minutes a number of blocks with occult symbols on them dropped into the output hopper .      thank you     said ponder  and then felt extremely silly for saying so .   there was a tension to the thing  a feeling of mute straining and striving towards some distant and incomprehensible goal .  as a wizard  it was something that ponder had only before encountered in acorns  a tiny soundless voice which said  yes  i am but a small  green  simple object   but i dream about forests .   only the other day adrian turnipseed had typed in    why .     to see what happened .  some of the students had forecast that hex would go mad trying to work it out  ponder had expected hex to produce the message  .  .  .  .  .   which it did with depressing frequency .   instead  after some unusual activity among the ants  it had laboriously produced     because .      with everyone else watching from behind a hastily overturned desk  turnipseed had volunteered     why anything .      the reply had finally turned up     because everything .   .  .  .  .  .  eternal domain error .        redo from start       .      no one knew who redo from start was  or why he was sending messages .  but there were no more funny questions .  no one wanted to risk getting answers .   it was shortly afterwards that the thing like a broken umbrella with herrings on it appeared just behind the thing like a beachball that went    parp    every fourteen minutes .   of course  books of magic developed a certain   personality  derived from all that power in their pages .  that   s why it was unwise to go into the library without a stick .  and now ponder had helped build an engine for studying magic .  wizards had always known that the act of observation changed the thing that was observed  and sometimes forgot that it also changed the observer  too .   he was beginning to suspect that hex was redesigning itself .   and he   d just said    thank you .     to a thing that looked like it had been made by a glassblower with hiccups .   he looked at the spell it had produced  hastily wrote it down and hurried out .   hex clicked to itself in the now empty room .  the thing that went    parp    went parp .  the unreal time clock ticked sideways .   there was a rattle in the output slot .      dont mention it .     .  .  .  .  .    out of cheese error .  redo from start .         it was five minutes later .      fascinatin        said ridcully .     sapient pearwood  eh .     he knelt down in an effort to see underneath .   the luggage backed away .  it was used to terror  horror  fear  and panic .  it had seldom encountered interest before .   the archchancellor stood up and brushed himself off .      ah     he said  as a dwarfish figure approached .     here   s the gardener with the stepladder .  the dean   s in the chandelier  modo .         i   m quite happy up here  i assure you     said a voice from the ceiling regions .     perhaps someone would be kind enough to pass me up my tea .         and i was amazed the senior wrangler could ever fit in the sideboard     said ridcully .     it   s amazin    how a man can fold himself up .         i was just   just inspecting the silverware     said a voice from the depths of a drawer .   the luggage opened its lid .  several wizards jumped back hurriedly .   ridcully examined the shark teeth stuck here and there in the woodwork .      kills sharks  you say .     he said .      oh  yes     said rincewind .     sometimes it drags them ashore and jumps up and down on them .      ridcully was impressed .  sapient pearwood was very rare in the countries between the ramtops and the circle sea .  there were probably no living trees left .  a few wizards were lucky enough to have inherited staffs made out of it .   economy of emotion was one of ridcully   s strong points .  he had been impressed .  he had been fascinated .  he   d even  when the thing had landed in the middle of the wizards and caused the dean   s remarkable feat of vertical acceleration  been slightly aghast .  but he hadn   t been frightened  because he didn   t have the imagination .      my goodness     said a wizard .   the archchancellor looked up .      yes  bursar .         it   s this book the dean loaned me  mustrum .  it   s about apes .         really .         it   s most fascinating     said the bursar  who was on the median part of his mental cycle and therefore vaguely on the right planet even if insulated from it by five miles of mental cotton wool .     it   s true what he said .  it says here that an adult male orang utan doesn   t grow the large flamboyant cheek pads unless he   s the dominant male .         and that   s fascinating  is it .         well  yes  because he hasn   t got    em .  i wonder why .  he certainly dominates the library  i should think .         ah  yes     said the senior wrangler     but he knows he   s a wizard  too .  so it   s not as though he dominates the whole university .      one by one  as the thought sank in  they grinned at the archchancellor .      don   t you look at my cheeks like that .     said ridcully .     i don   t dominate anybody .         i was only           so you can all shut up or there will be big trouble .         you should read it     said the bursar  still happily living in the valley of the dried frogs .     it   s amazing what you can learn .         what .  like   how to show your bottom to people .     said the dean  from on high .      no  dean .  that   s baboons     said the senior wrangler .      i beg your pardon  i think you   ll find it   s gibbons     said the chair of indefinite studies .      no  gibbons are the ones that hoot .  it   s baboons if you want to see bottoms .         well  he   s never shown me one     said the archchancellor .      hah  well  he wouldn   t  would he .     said a voice from the chandelier .     not with you being dominant male and everything .         two chairs  you come down here this minute .         i seem to be entangled  mustrum .  a candle is giving me some difficulty .         hah .      rincewind shook his head and wandered away .  there had certainly been some changes around the place since he had been there and  if it came to it  he didn   t know how long ago that had been     he   d never asked for an exciting life .  what he really liked  what he sought on every occasion  was boredom .  the trouble was that boredom tended to explode in your face .  just when he thought he   d found it he   d be suddenly involved in what he supposed other people   thoughtless  feckless people   would call an adventure .  and he   d be forced to visit many strange lands and meet exotic and colorful people  although not for very long because usually he   d be running .  he   d seen the creation of the universe  although not from a good seat  and had visited hell and the afterlife .  he   d been captured  imprisoned  rescued  lost  and marooned .  sometimes it had all happened on the same day .   adventure .  people talked about the idea as if it was something worthwhile  rather than a mess of bad food  no sleep  and strange people inexplicably trying to stick pointed objects in bits of you .   the root problem  rincewind had come to believe  was that he suffered from pre emptive karma .  if it even looked as though something nice was going to happen to him in the near future  something bad would happen right now .  and it went on happening to him right through the part where the good stuff should be happening  so that he never actually experienced it .  it was as if he always got the indigestion before the meal and felt so dreadful that he never actually managed to eat anything .   somewhere in the world  he reasoned  there was someone who was on the other end of the seesaw  a kind of mirror rincewind whose life was a succession of wonderful events .  he hoped to meet him one day  preferably while holding some sort of weapon .   now people were babbling about sending him to the counterweight continent .  he   d heard that life was dull there .  and rincewind really craved dullness .   he   d really liked that island .  he   d enjoyed coconut surprise .  you cracked it open and  hey  there was coconut inside .  that was the kind of surprise he liked .   he pushed open a door .   the place inside had been his room .  it was a mess .  there was a large and battered wardrobe  and that was about the end of it as far as proper furniture was concerned unless you wanted to broaden the term to include a wicker chair with no bottom and three legs and a mattress so full of the life that inhabits mattresses that it occasionally moved sluggishly around the floor  bumping into things .  the rest of the room was a litter of objects dragged in from the street   old crates  bits of planking  sacks     rincewind felt a lump in his throat .  they   d left his room just as it was .   he opened the wardrobe and rummaged through the moth haunted darkness within  until his questing hand located        an ear        which was attached to a dwarf .      ow .         what     said rincewind     are you doing in my wardrobe .         wardrobe .  er   er   isn   t this the magic kingdom of scrumptiousness .     said the dwarf  trying not to look guilty .      no  and these shoes you   re holding aren   t the golden jewels of the queen of the fairies     said rincewind  snatching them out of the thief   s hands .     and this isn   t the wand of invisibility and these aren   t giant grumblenose   s wonderful socks but this is my boot           ow .         and stay out .      the dwarf ran for the door and paused  but only briefly  to shout     i   ve got a thieves    guild card .  and you shouldn   t hit dwarfs .  that   s speciesism .         good     said rincewind  retrieving items of clothing .   he found another robe and put it on .  here and there moths had worked their lacemaking skills and most of the red color had faded to shades of orange and brown  but to his relief it was a proper wizard   s robe .  it   s hard to be an impressive magic user with bare knees .   gentle footsteps pattered to a halt behind him .  he turned .      open .      the luggage obediently cracked its lid .  in theory it should have been full of shark  in fact it was half full of coconuts .  rincewind turfed them out on to the floor and put the rest of the clothes inside .      shut .      the lid slammed .      now go down to the kitchen and get some potatoes .      the chest did a complicated  many legged about turn and trotted away .  rincewind followed it out and headed towards the archchancellor   s study .  behind him he could hear the wizards still arguing .   he   d become familiar with the study through long years at unseen .  generally he was there to answer quite difficult questions  like    how can anyone get a negative mark in basic firemaking .     he   d spent a lot of time staring at the fixtures while people harangued him .   there had been changes here  too .  gone were the alembics and bubbling flagons that were the traditional props of wizardry  ridcully   s study was dominated by a full size snooker table  on which he   d piled papers until there was no room for any more and no sign of green felt .  ridcully assumed that anything people had time to write down couldn   t be important .   the stuffed heads of a number of surprised animals stared down at him .  from the antlers of one stag hung a pair of corroded boots ridcully had won as a rowing brown for the university in his youth .    there was a large model of the discworld on four wooden elephants in a corner of the room .  rincewind was familiar with it .  every student was     the counterweight continent was a blob .  it was a shaped blob  a not very inviting comma shape .  sailors had brought back news of it .  they   d said that at one point it broke into a pattern of large islands  stretching around the disc to the even more mysterious island of bhangbhangduc and the completely mythical continent known only on the charts as    xxxx .      not that many sailors went near the counterweight continent .  the agatean empire was known to ignore a very small amount of smuggling  presumably ankh morpork had some things it wanted .  but there was nothing official  a boat might come back loaded with silk and rare wood and  these days  a few wild eyed refugees  or it might come back with its captain riveted upside down to the mast  or it might not come back .   rincewind had been very nearly everywhere  but the counterweight continent was an unknown land  or terror incognita .  he couldn   t imagine why they   d want any kind of wizard .   rincewind sighed .  he knew what he should do now .   he shouldn   t even wait for the return of the luggage from its argosy to the kitchens  from which the sound of yelling and something being repeatedly hit with a large brass preserving pan suggested it was going about his business .   he should just gather up what he could carry and get the hell out of here .  he        ah  rincewind     said the archchancellor  who had an amazingly silent walk for such a large man .     keen to leave  i see .         yes  indeed     said rincewind .     oh  yes .  very much so .         the red army met in secret session .  they opened their meeting by singing revolutionary songs and  since disobedience to authority did not come easily to the agatean character  these had titles like    steady progress and limited disobedience while retaining well formulated good manners .      then it was time for the news .      the great wizard will come .  we sent the message  at great personal risk .         how will we know when he arrives .         if he   s the great wizard  we   ll hear about it .  and then           gently push over the forces of repression .     they chorused .   two fire herb looked at the rest of the cadre .     exactly     he said .     and then  comrades  we must strike at the very heart of the rottenness .  we must storm the winter palace .      there was silence from the cadre .  then someone said     excuse me  two fire herb  but it is june .         then we can storm the summer palace .         a similar session  although without singing and with rather older participants  was taking place in unseen university  although one member of the college council had refused to come down from the chandelier .  this was of some considerable annoyance to the librarian  who usually occupied it .      all right  if you don   t trust my calculations  then what are the alternatives .     said ponder stibbons hotly .      boat .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      they sink     said rincewind .      it   d get you there in no time at all     said the senior wrangler .     we   re wizards  after all .  we could give you your own bag of wind .         ah .  forward the dean     said ridcully  pleasantly .      i heard that     said a voice from above .      overland     said the lecturer in recent runes .     up around the hub .  it   s ice practically all the way .         no     said rincewind .      but you don   t sink on ice .         no .  you tip up and then you sink and then the ice hits you on the head .  also killer whales .  and great big seals vif teece ike iff .         this is off the wall  i know     said the bursar  brightly .      what is .     said the lecturer in recent runes .      a hook for hanging pictures on .      there was a brief embarrassed silence .      good lord  is it that time already .     said the archchancellor  taking out his watch .     ah  so it is .  the bottle   s in your left hand pocket  old chap .  take three .         no  magic is the only way     said ponder stibbons .     it worked when we brought him here  didn   t it .         oh  yes     said rincewind .     just send me thousands of miles with my pants on fire and you don   t even know where i   ll land .  oh  yes  that   s ideal  that is .         good     said ridcully  a man impervious to sarcasm .     it   s a big continent  we can   t possibly miss it even with mr .  stibbons    precise calculations .         supposing i end up crushed in the middle of a mountain .     said rincewind .      can   t .  the rock   ll be brought back here when we do the spell     said ponder  who hadn   t liked the crack about his maths .      so i   ll still be in the middle of a mountain but in a me shaped hole     said rincewind .     oh  good .  instant fossil .         don   t worry     said ridcully .     it   s just a matter of   thingummy  you know  all that stuff about three right angles making a triangle           is it possible you   re talking about geometry .     said rincewind  eyeing the door .      that kind of thing  yes .  and you   ll have your amazing luggage item .  why  it   ll practically be a holiday .  it   ll be easy .  they probably just want to   to   ask you something  or something .  and i hear you   ve got a talent for languages  so no problem there .   you   ll probably be away for a couple of hours at the most .  why do you keep sayin       hah    under your breath .         was i .         and everyone will be so grateful if you come back .      rincewind looked around   and  in one case  up   at the council .      how will i get back .     he said .      same way you went .  we   ll find you and bring you out .  with surgical precision .      rincewind groaned .  he knew what surgical precision meant in ankh morpork .  it meant    to within an inch or two  accompanied by a lot of screaming  and then they pour hot tar on you just where your leg was .      but   if you put aside for the moment the certainty that something would definitely go horribly wrong  it looked foolproof .  the trouble was that wizards were such ingenious fools .      and then i can have my old job back .         certainly .         and officially call myself a wizard .         of course .  with any kind of spelling .         and never have to go anywhere again as long as i live .         fine .  we   ll actually ban you leaving the premises  if you like .         and a new hat .         what .         a new hat .  this one   s practically had it .         two new hats .         sequins .         of course .  and those  you know  like glass chandelier things .  lots of those all round the brim .  as many as you like .  and we   ll spell wizard with three zs .      rincewind sighed .     oh  all right .  i   ll do it .         ponder   s genius found itself rather cramped when it came to explaining things to people .  and this was the case now  as the wizards forgathered to kick some serious magic .      yes  but you see  archchancellor  he   s being sent to the opposite side of the disc  you see        ridcully sighed .     it   s spinnin     isn   t it     he said .     we   re all going the same way .  it stands to reason .  if people   re going the other way just because they   re on the counterweight continent we   d crash into them once a year .  i mean twice .         yes  yes  they   re spinning the same way  of course  but the direction of motion is entirely opposite .  i mean     said ponder  lapsing into logic     you have to think about vectors  you  you have to ask yourself  what direction would they go in if the disc wasn   t here .      the wizards stared at him .      down     said ridcully .      no  no  no  archchancellor     said ponder .     they wouldn   t go down because there   d be nothing to pull them down  they           you don   t need anything to pull you down .  down   s where you go if there   s nothing to keep you up .         they   d keep on going in the same direction .     shouted ponder .      right .  round and round     said ridcully .  he rubbed his hands together .     you   ve got to maintain a grip if you want to be a wizard  lad .  how   re we doing  runes .         i   i can make out something     said the lecturer in recent runes  squinting into the crystal ball .     there   s a lot of interference        the wizards gathered round .  white specks filled the crystal .  there were vague shapes just visible in the mush .  some of them could be human .      very peaceful place  the agatean empire     said ridcully .     very tranquil .  very cultured .  they set great store in politeness .         well  yes     said the lecturer in recent runes     i heard it was because people who aren   t tranquil and quiet get serious bits cut off  don   t they .  i heard the empire has a tyrannical and repressive government .         what form of government is that .     said ponder stibbons .      a tautology     said the dean  from above .      how serious are these bits .     said rincewind .  they ignored him .      i heard that gold   s very common there     said the dean .     lying around like dirt  they say .  rincewind could bring back a sackful .         i   d rather bring back all my bits     said rincewind .   after all  he thought  i   m only the one who   s going to end up in the middle of it all .  so please don   t anyone bother to listen to me .      can   t you stop it blurring like that .     said the archchancellor .      i   m sorry  archchancellor           these bits   big bits or small bits .     said rincewind  unheard .      just find us an open space with something about the right size and weight .         it   s very hard to           very serious bits .  are we in arms and legs territory here .         they say it   s very boring there .  their biggest curse is    may you live in interesting times     apparently .         there   s a thing   it   s very blurry .  looks like a wheelbarrow or something .  quite small  i think .            or toes  ears  that kind of thing .         good  let   s get started     said ridcully .      er  i think it   ll help if he   s a bit heavier than the thing we move here     said ponder .     he won   t arrive at any speed  then .  i think           yes  yes  thank you very much  mister stibbons  now get in the circle and let us see that staff crackle  there   s a good chap .         fingernails .  hair .      rincewind tugged at the robe of ponder stibbons  who seemed slightly more sensible than the others .      er .  what   s my next move here .     he said .      um .  about six thousand miles  i hope     said ponder stibbons .      but   i mean   have you got any advice .      ponder wondered how to put things .  he thought  i   ve done my best with hex  but the actual business will be undertaken by a bunch of wizards whose idea of experimental procedure is to throw it and then sit down and argue about where it   s going to land .  we want to change your position with that of something six thousand miles away which  whatever the archchancellor says  is heading through space in a quite different direction .  the key is precision .  it   s no good using any old traveling spell .  it   d come apart halfway  and so would you .  i   m pretty sure that we   ll get you there in one or  at worst  two pieces .  but we   ve no way of knowing the weight of the thing we change you with .  if it   s pretty much the same weight as you  then it might just all work out provided you don   t mind jogging on the spot when you land .  but if it   s a lot heavier than you  then my suspicion is that you   ll appear over there traveling at the sort of speed normally only experienced by sleepwalkers in clifftop villages in a very terminal way .      er     he said .     be afraid .  be very afraid .         oh  that     said rincewind .     no problem there .  i   m good at that .         we   re going to try to put you in the center of the continent  where hunghung is believed to be     said ponder .      the capital city .         yes .  er .     ponder felt guilty .     look  whatever happens i   m sure you   ll get there alive  which is more than would happen if it   d just been left to them .  and i   m pretty sure you   ll end up on the right continent .         oh  good .         come along  mr .  stibbons .  we   re all agog to hear how you wish us to do this     said ridcully .      ah  er  yes .  right .  now  you  mr .  rincewind  if you will go and stand in the center of the octagon   thank you .  um .  you see  gentlemen  what has always been the problem with teleporting over large distances is heisenberg   s uncertainty principle   since the object teleported  that   s from tele     i see     and porte     to go     the whole meaning    i see it   s gone     er  the object teleported  er  no matter how large  is reduced to a thaumic particle and is therefore the subject of an eventually fatal dichotomy  it can either know what it is or where it is going  but not both .  er  the tension this creates in the morphic field eventually causes it to disintegrate  leaving the subject as a randomly shaped object  er  smeared across up to eleven dimensions .  but i   m sure you all know this .      there was a snore from the chair of indefinite studies  who was suddenly giving a lecture in room  b .   rincewind was grinning .  at least  his mouth had gaped open and his teeth were showing .      er  excuse me     he said .     i don   t remember anyone saying anything about being sm           of course     said ponder     the subject would not  er  actually experience this           oh .            as far as we know           what .            although it is theoretically possible for the psyche to remain present           eh .            to briefly witness the explosive discorporation .         hey .         now  we   re all familiar with the use of the spell as a fulcrum  er  so that one does not actually move one object but simply exchanges the position of two objects of similar mass .  it is my aim tonight  er  to demonstrate that by imparting exactly the right amount of spin and the maximum velocity to the object           me .            from the very first moment  it is virtually certain           virtually .            to hold together for distances of up to  er  six thousand miles           up to .            give or take ten percent           give or take .         so if you   d   excuse me  dean  i   d be obliged if you   d stop dripping wax   if you   d all take up the positions i   ve marked on the floor        rincewind looked longingly towards the door .  it was no distance at all for the experienced coward .  he could just trot out of here and they could   they could     what could they do .  they could just take his hat away and stop him ever coming back to the university .  now he came to think about it  they probably wouldn   t be bothered about the nailing bit if he was too much bother to find .   and that was the problem .  he wouldn   t be dead  but then neither would he be a wizard .  and  he thought  as the wizards shuffled into position and screwed down the knobs on the ends of their staffs  not being able to think of himself as a wizard was being dead .   the spell began .   rincewind the shoemaker .  rincewind the beggar .  rincewind the thief .  just about everything apart from rincewind the corpse demanded training or aptitudes that he didn   t have .   he was no good at anything else .  wizardry was the only refuge .  well  actually he was no good at wizardry either  but at least he was definitively no good at it .  he   d always felt he had a right to exist as a wizard in the same way that you couldn   t do proper maths without the number    which wasn   t a number at all but  if it went away  would leave a lot of larger numbers looking bloody stupid .  it was a vaguely noble thought that had kept him warm during those occasional   a . m .  awakenings when he had evaluated his life and found it weighed a little less than a puff of warm hydrogen .  and he probably had saved the world a few times  but it had generally happened accidentally  while he was trying to do something else .  so you almost certainly didn   t actually get any karmic points for that .  it probably only counted if you started out by thinking in a loud way    by criminy  it   s jolly well time to save the world  and no two ways about it .     instead of    oh  shit  this time i   m really going to die .      the spell continued .   it didn   t seem to be going very well .      come on  you chaps     said ridcully .     put some backbone into it .         are you sure   it   s   just something small .     said the dean  who   d broken into a sweat .      looks like a   wheelbarrow       muttered the lecturer in recent runes .   the knob on the end of ridcully   s staff began to smoke .      will you look at the magic i   m using .     he said .     what   s goin    on  mr .  stibbons .         er .  of course  size isn   t the same as mass        and then  in the same way that it can take considerable effort to push at a sticking door and no effort at all to fall full length into the room beyond  the spell caught .   ponder hoped  afterwards  that what he saw was an optical illusion .  certainly no one normally was suddenly stretched to about twelve feet tall and then snapped back into shape so fast that their boots ended up under their chin .   there was a brief cry of    oooooohhhhshhhhhh       which ended abruptly  and this was probably just as well .      the first thing that struck rincewind when he appeared on the counterweight continent was a cold sensation .   the next things  in order of the direction of travel  were  a surprised man with a sword  another man with a sword  a third man who   d dropped his sword and was trying to run away  two other men who were less alert and didn   t even see him  a small tree  about fifty yards of stunted undergrowth  a snowdrift  a bigger snowdrift  a few rocks  and one more and quite final snowdrift .      ridcully looked at ponder stibbons .      well  he   s gone     he said .     but aren   t we supposed to get something back .         i   m not sure the transit time is instantaneous     said ponder .      you   ve got to allow for zooming through the occult dimensions time .         something like that .  according to hex  we might have to wait several        something appeared in the octagon with a    pop     exactly where rincewind had been  and rolled a few inches .   it did  at least  have four small wheels such as might carry a cart .  but these weren   t workmanlike wheels  these were mere discs such as may be put on something heavy for those rare occasions it needs to be moved .   above the wheels things became rather more interesting .   there was a large round cylinder  like a barrel on its side .  a considerable amount of effort had been put into its construction  large amounts of brass had gone into making it look like a very large  fat dog with its mouth open .  a minor feature was a length of string  which was smoking and hissing because it was on fire .   it didn   t do anything dangerous .  it just sat there  while the smoldering string slowly got shorter .   the wizards gathered round .      looks pretty heavy     said the lecturer in recent runes .      a statue of a dog with a big mouth     said the chair of indefinite studies .     that   s rather dull .         bit of a lap dog  too     said ridcully .      lot of work gone into it     said the dean .     can   t imagine why anyone   d want to set fire to it .      ridcully poked his head into the wide tube .      some kind of big round ball in here     he said  his voice echoing a little .     someone pass me a staff or something .  i   ll see if i can wiggle it out .      ponder was staring at the fizzing string .      er     he said     i   er   think we should all just step away from it  archchancellor .  er .  we should all just step back  yes  step back a little way .  er .         hah  yes  really .  so much for research     said ridcully .     you don   t mind messing around with cogwheels and ants but when it comes to really trying to find out how things work and           getting your hands dirty     said the lecturer in recent runes .      yes  getting your hands dirty  you come over all shy .         it   s not that  archchancellor     said ponder .     but i believe it may be dangerous .         i think i   m working it loose     said ridcully  poking in the depths of the tube .     come on  you fellows  tip the thing up a bit        ponder took a few more steps back .     er  i really don   t think       he began .      don   t think  eh .  call yourself a wizard and you don   t think .  blast .  i   ve got my staff wedged now .  that   s what comes of listening to you when i should have been paying attention  mr .  stibbons .      ponder heard a scuffling behind him .  the librarian  with an animal   s instinct for danger and a human   s instinct for trouble  had upturned a table and was peering over the top of it with a small cauldron on his head  the handle under one of his chins like a strap .      archchancellor  i really do think           oh  you think  do you .  did anyone tell you it   s your job to think .  ow .  it   s got my fingers now  thanks to you .      it needed all ponder   s courage to say     i think   it might perhaps be some kind of firework  sir .      the wizards turned their attention to the fizzling string .      what   colored lights  stars  that sort of thing .     said ridcully .      possibly  sir .         must be planning a hell of a display .  apparently they   re very keen on firecrackers  over in the empire .     ridcully spoke in the tone of voice of a man over whom the thought is slowly stealing that he just might have done something very silly .      would you like me to extinguish the string  sir .     said ponder .      yes  dear boy  why not .  good idea .  good thinking  that man .      ponder stepped forward and pinched the string .      i do hope we haven   t ruined something     he said .      rincewind opened his eyes .   this was not cool sheets .  it was white  and it was cold  but it lacked basic sheetness .  it made up for this by having vast amounts of snowosity .   and a groove .  a long groove .   let   s see now   he could remember the sensation of movement .  and he vaguely remembered something small but incredibly heavy looking roaring past in the opposite direction .  and then he was here  moving so fast that his feet left this        groove .  yes  groove  he thought  in the easygoing way of the mildly concussed .  with people lying around it groaning .   but they looked like people who  once they   d stopped crawling around groaning  were going to draw the swords they had about their persons and pay detailed attention to serious bits .   he stood up  a little shakily .  there didn   t seem to be anywhere to run to .  there was just this wide  snowy waste with a border of mountains .   the soldiers were definitely looking a lot more conscious .  rincewind sighed .  a few hours ago he   d been sitting on a warm beach with young women about to offer him potatoes   and here he was on a windswept  chilly plain with some large men about to offer him violence .   the soles of his shoes  he noticed  were steaming .   and then someone said     hey .  are you   you   re not  are you   are you   whatsyername   rincewind  isn   t it .      rincewind turned .   there was a very old man behind him .  despite the bitter wind he was wearing nothing except a leather loincloth and a grubby beard so long that the loincloth wasn   t really necessary  at least from the point of view of decency .  his legs were blue from the cold and his nose was red from the wind  giving him overall quite a patriotic look if you were from the right country .  he had a patch over one eye but rather more notable than that were his teeth .  they glittered .      don   t stand there gawping like a big gawper .  get these damn things off me .      there were heavy shackles around his ankles and wrists  a chain led to a group of more or less similarly clad men who were huddling in a crowd and watching rincewind in terror .      heh .  they think you   re some kind of demon     cackled the old man .     but i knows a wizard when i sees one .  that bastard over there   s got the keys .  go and give him a good kicking .      rincewind took a few hesitant steps towards a recumbent guard and snatched at his belt .      right     said the old man     now chuck    em over here .  and then get out of the way .         why .            cos you don   t want to get blood all over you .         but you haven   t got a weapon and there   s one of you and they   ve got big swords and there   s five of them .         i know     said the old man  wrapping the chain around one of his fists in a businesslike manner .     it   s unfair  but i can   t wait around all day .      he grinned .   gems glittered in the morning light .  every tooth in the man   s head was a diamond .  and rincewind knew of only one man who had the nerve to wear troll teeth .      here .  cohen the barbarian .         ssh .  ingconitar .  now get out of the way  i said .     the teeth flashed at the guards  who were now vertical .     come on  boys .  there   s five of you  after all .  an    i   m an old man .  mumble  mumble  oo me leg  ekcetra        to their credit  the guards hesitated .  it was probably not  to judge from their faces  because there   s something reprehensible about five large  heavily beweaponed men attacking a frail old man .  it might have been because there   s something odd about a frail old man who keeps on grinning in the face of obvious oblivion .      oh  come on     said cohen .  the men edged closer  each waiting for one of the others to make the first move .   cohen took a few steps forward  waving his arms wearily .     oh  no     he said .     it makes me ashamed  honestly it does .  this is not how you attack someone  all milling around like a lot of millers  when you attack someone the important thing to remember is the element of   surprise        ten seconds later he turned to rincewind .      all right  mister wizard .  you can open your eyes now .      one guard was upside down in a tree  one was a pair of feet sticking out of a snowdrift  two were slumped against rocks  and one was   generally around the place .  here and there .  certainly hanging out .   cohen sucked his wrist thoughtfully .      i reckon that last one came within an inch of getting me     he said .     i must be getting old .         why are you h       rincewind paused .  one packet of curiosity overtook the first one .     how old are you  exactly .         is this still the century of the fruitbat .         yes .         oh  i dunno .  ninety .  could be ninety .  maybe ninety five .     cohen fished the keys out of the snow and ambled over to the group of men  who were cowering even more .  he unlocked the first set of manacles and handed the shocked prisoner the keys .      bugger off  the lot of you     he said  not unkindly .     and don   t get caught again .      he strolled back to rincewind .      what brings you into this dump  then .         well           interestin        said cohen  and that was that .     but can   t stay chatting all day  got work to do .  you coming  or what .         what .         please yourself .     cohen tied the chain around his waist as a makeshift belt and wedged a couple of swords in it .      incidentally     he said     what did you do with the barking dog .         what dog .         i expect it doesn   t matter .      rincewind scuttled after the retreating figure .  it wasn   t that he felt safe when cohen the barbarian was around .  no one was safe when cohen the barbarian was around .  something seemed to have gone wrong with the ageing process there .  cohen had always been a barbarian hero because barbaric heroing was all he knew how to do .  and while he got old he seemed to get harder  like oak .   but he was a known figure  and therefore comforting .  he just wasn   t in the right place .      no future in it  back around the ramtops     said cohen  as they trudged through the snow .     fences and farms  fences and farms everywhere .  you kill a dragon these days  people complain .  you know what .  you know what happened .         no .  what happened .         man came up to me  said my teeth were offensive to trolls .  what about that  eh .         well  they are made of           i said they never complained to me .         er  did you ever give them a cha           i said  i see a troll up in the mountains with a necklace o    human skulls  i say good luck to him .  silicon anti defamation league  my bottom .  it   s the same all over .  so i thought i   d try my luck the other side of the icecap .         isn   t it dangerous  going around the hub .     said rincewind .      used to be     said cohen  grinning horribly .      until you left  you mean .            s right .  you still got that box on legs .         on and off .  it hangs around .  you know .     cohen chuckled .      i   ll get the bloody lid off that thing one day  mark my words .  ah .  horses .      there were five  looking depressed in a small depression .   rincewind looked back at the freed prisoners  who seemed to be milling around aimlessly .      we   re not taking all five horses  are we .     he said .      sure .  we might need    em .         but   one for me  one for you   what   s the rest for .         lunch  dinner  and breakfast .         it   s a little   unfair  isn   t it .  those people look a bit   bewildered .      cohen sneered the sneer of a man who has never been truly imprisoned even when he   s been locked up .      i freed    em     he said .     first time they   ve ever been free .  comes as a bit of a shock  i expect .  they   re waiting for someone to tell    em what to do next .         er           i could tell    em to starve to death  if you like .         er           oh  all right .  you lot .  formee uppee right now toot sweet chop chop .      the small crowd hurried over to cohen and stood expectantly behind his horse .      i tell you  i don   t regret it .  this is the land of opportunity     said cohen  urging the horse into a trot .  the embarrassed free men jogged behind .     know what .  swords are banned .  no one except the army  the nobles and the imperial guard are allowed to own weapons .  couldn   t believe it .  gods    own truth  though .  swords are outlawed  so only outlaws have swords .  and that     said cohen  giving the landscape another glittering grin     suits me fine .         but   you were in chains       rincewind ventured .      glad you reminded me     said cohen .     yeah .  we   ll find the rest of the lads  then i   d better try and find who did it and talk to them about that .      the tone of his voice suggested very clearly that all they were likely to say would be     highly enjoyable .  your wife is a big hippo .         lads .         no future in one man barbarianing     said cohen .     got myself a   well  you   ll see .      rincewind turned to look at the trailing party  and at the snow  and at cohen .      er .  do you know where hunghung is .         yeah .  it   s the boss city .  we   re on our way .  sort of .  it   s under siege right now .         siege .  you mean like   lots of armies outside  everyone inside eating rats  that sort of thing .         yeah  but this is the counterweight continent  see  so it   s a polite siege .  well  i call it a siege   the old emperor   s dying  so the big families are all waiting to move in .  that   s how it goes in these parts .  there   s five different top nobs and they   re all watching one another  and no one   s going to be the first to move .  you   ve got to think sideways to understand anything in this place .         cohen .         yes  lad .         what the hell   s going on .         lord hong was watching the tea ceremony .  it took three hours  but you couldn   t hurry a good cuppa .   he was also playing chess  against himself .  it was the only way he could find an opponent of his calibre but  currently  things were stalemated because both sides were adopting a defensive strategy which was  admittedly  brilliant .   lord hong sometimes wished he could have an enemy as clever as himself .  or  because lord hong was indeed very clever  he sometimes wished for an enemy almost as clever as himself  one perhaps given to flights of strategic genius with nevertheless the occasional fatal flaw .  as it was  people were so stupid .  they seldom thought more than a dozen moves ahead .   assassination was meat and drink to the hunghung court  in fact  meat and drink were often the means .  it was a game that everyone played .  it was just another kind of move .  it was not considered good manners to assassinate the emperor  of course .  the correct move was to put the emperor in a position where you had control .  but moves at this level were very dangerous  happy as the warlords were to squabble amongst themselves  they could be relied upon to unite against any who looked in danger of rising above the herd .  and lord hong had risen like bread  by making everyone else believe that  while they were the obvious candidate for the emperorship  lord hong would be better than any of the alternatives .   it amused him to know that they thought he was plotting for the imperial pearl     he glanced up from the board and caught the eye of the young woman who was busy at the tea table .  she blushed and looked away .   the door slid back .  one of his men entered  on his knees .      yes .     said lord hong .      er   o lord        lord hong sighed .  people seldom began like this when the news was good .      what happened .     he said .      the one they call the great wizard arrived  o lord .  up in the mountains .  riding on a dragon of wind .  or so they say     the messenger added quickly  aware of lord hong   s views about superstition .      good .  but .  i assume there is a but .         er   one of the barking dogs has been lost .  the new batch .  that you commanded should be tested .  we don   t quite   that is to say   we think captain three high trees was ambushed  perhaps   our information is somewhat confused   the  um  the informant says the great wizard magicked it away       the messenger crouched lower .   lord hong merely sighed again .  magic .  it had fallen out of favor in the empire  except for the most mundane purposes .  it was uncultured .  it put power in the hands of people who couldn   t write a decent poem to save their lives  and sometimes hadn   t .   he believed in coincidence a lot more than he did in magic .      this is most vexing     said lord hong .   he stood up and took his sword off the rack .  it was long and curved and had been made by the finest sword maker in the empire  who was lord hong .  he   d heard it took twenty years to learn the art  so he had stretched himself a little .  it had taken him three weeks .  people never concentrated  that was their trouble     the messenger groveled .      the officer concerned has been executed .     he said .   the messenger tried to scrabble through the floor and decided to let truth stand in for honesty .      yes .     he piped .   lord hong swung .  there was a hiss like the fall of silk  a thump and clatter as of a coconut hitting the ground  and the tinkle of crockery .   the messenger opened his eyes .  he concentrated on his neck region  fearful that the slightest movement might leave him a good deal shorter .  there were dire stories about lord hong   s swords .      oh  do get up     said lord hong .  he wiped the blade carefully and replaced the sword .  then he reached across and pulled a small black bottle from the robe of the tea girl .   uncorked  it produced a few drops that hissed when they hit the floor .      really     said lord hong .     i wonder why people bother .     he looked up .     lord tang or lord mcsweeney has probably stolen the dog to vex me .  did the wizard escape .         so it seems  o lord .         good .  see that harm almost comes to him .  and send me another tea girl .  one with a head .         there was this to be said about cohen .  if there was no reason for him to kill you  such as you having any large amount of treasure or being between him and somewhere he wanted to get to  then he was good company .  rincewind had met him a few times before  generally while running away from something .   cohen didn   t bother overmuch with questions .  as far as cohen was concerned  people appeared  people disappeared .  after a five year gap he   d just say     oh  it   s you .     he never added     and how are you .     you were alive  you were upright  and beyond that he didn   t give a damn .   it was a lot warmer beyond the mountains .  to rincewind   s relief a spare horse didn   t have to be eaten because a leopardly sort of creature dropped off a tree branch and tried to disembowel cohen .   it had a rather strong flavor .   rincewind had eaten horse .  over the years he   d nerved himself to eat anything that couldn   t actually wriggle off his fork .  but he was feeling shaken enough without eating something you could call dobbin .      how did they catch you .     he said  when they were riding again .      i was busy .         cohen the barbarian .  too busy to fight .         i didn   t want to upset the young lady .  couldn   t help meself .  went down to a village to pick up some news  one thing led to another  next thing a load of soldiers were all over the place like cheap armor  and i can   t fight that well with my arms shackled behind my back .  real nasty bugger in charge  face i won   t forget in a hurry .  half a dozen of us were rounded up  made to push the barking dog thing all the way out here  then we were chained to that tree and someone lit the bit of string and they all legged it behind a snowdrift .  except you came along and vanished it .         i didn   t vanish it .  not exactly  anyway .      cohen leaned across towards rincewind .     i reckon i know what it was     he said  and sat back looking pleased with himself .      yes .         i reckon it was some kind of firework .  they   re very big on fireworks here .         you mean the sort of things where you light the blue touch paper and stick it up your nose .          they use    em to drive evil spirits away .  there   s a lot of evil spirits  see .  because of all the slaughtering .         slaughtering .      rincewind had always understood that the agatean empire was a peaceful place .  it was civilized .  they invented things .  in fact  he recalled  he   d been instrumental in introducing a few of their devices to ankh morpork .  simple  innocent things  like clocks worked by demons  and boxes that painted pictures  and extra glass eyes you could wear over the top of your own eyes to help you see better  even if it did mean you made a spectacle of yourself .   it was supposed to be dull .      oh  yeah .  slaughtering     said cohen .     like  supposing the population is being a bit behind with its taxes .  you pick some city where people are being troublesome and kill everyone and set fire to it and pull down the walls and plough up the ashes .  that way you get rid of the trouble and all the other cities are suddenly really well behaved and polite and all your back taxes turn up in a big rush  which is handy for governments  i understand .  then if they ever give trouble you just have to say    remember nangnang .     or whatever  and they say    where   s nangnang .     and you say     my point exactly .            good grief .  if that sort of thing was tried back home           ah  but this place has been going a long time .  people think that   s how a country is supposed to run .  they do what they   re told .  the people here are treated like slaves .      cohen scowled .     now  i   ve got nothing against slaves  you know  as slaves .  owned a few in my time .  been a slave once or twice .  but where there   s slaves  what   ll you expect to find .      rincewind thought about this .     whips .     he said at last .      yeah .  got it in one .  whips .  there   s something honest about slaves and whips .  well   they ain   t got whips here .  they got something worse than whips .         what .     said rincewind  looking slightly panicky .      you   ll find out .      rincewind found himself looking around at the half dozen other prisoners  who had trailed after them and were watching in awe from a distance .  he   d given them a bit of leopard  which they   d looked at initially as if it was poison and then eaten as if it was food .      they   re still following us     he said .      yeah  well   you did give    em meat     cackled cohen  starting to roll a post prandial cigarette .     shouldn   t have done that .  should   ve let    em have the whiskers and the claws and you   d   ve been amazed at what they   d cook up .  you know their big dish down on the coast .         no .         pig   s ear soup .  now  what   s that tell you about a place  eh .      rincewind shrugged .     very provident people .         some other bugger pinches the pig .      he turned in the saddle .  the group of ex prisoners shrank back .      now  see here     he said .     i told you .  you   re free .  understand .      one of the braver men spoke up .     yes  master .         i ain   t your master .  you   re free .  you can go wherever you like  excepting if you follow me i   ll kill the lot of you .  and now   go away .         where  master .         anywhere .  somewhere not here .      the men gave one another some worried looks and then the whole group  as one man  turned and trotted away along the path .      probably go straight back to their village     he said  rolling his eyes .     worse than whips  i tell you .      he waved a scrawny hand at the landscape as they rode on .      strange bloody country     he said .     did you know there   s a wall all round the empire .         that   s to keep   barbarian invaders   out           oh  yes  very defensive     said cohen sarcastically .     like  oh my goodness  there   s a twenty foot wall  dear me  i suppose we   d just better ride off back over a thousand miles of steppe and not  e . g .   take a look at the ladder possibilities inherent in that pine wood over there .  nah .  it   s to keep the people in .  and rules .  they   ve got rules for everything .  no one even goes to the privy without a piece of paper .         well  as a matter of fact i myself           a piece of paper saying they can go  is what i meant .  can   t leave your village without a chit .  can   t get married without a chit .  can   t even have a sh   ah  we   re here .         yes  indeed     said rincewind .   cohen glared at him .     how did you know .     he demanded .   rincewind tried to think .  it had been a long day .  in fact it had  because of the thaumic equivalent of jetlag  been several hours longer than most other days he   d experienced and had contained two lunchtimes  neither of which had contained anything worth eating .      er   i thought you were making a general philosophical point     he hazarded .     er .  like     we   d better make the best of it    .         i meant we   re here at my hideout     said cohen .  rincewind stared around them .  there were scrubby bushes  a few rocks  and a sheer cliff face .      i can   t see anything     he said .      yep .  that   s how you can tell it   s mine .         the art of war was the ultimate basis of diplomacy in the empire .   clearly war had to exist .  it was a cornerstone of the processes of government .  it was the way the empire got its leaders .  the competitive examination system was how it got its bureaucrats and public officials  and warfare was for its leaders  perhaps  only a different kind of competitive examination .  admittedly  if you lost you probably weren   t allowed to re sit next year .   but there had to be rules .  otherwise it was just a barbaric scuffle .   so  hundreds of years ago  the art of war had been formulated .  it was a book of rules .  some were very specific  there was to be no fighting within the forbidden city  the person of the emperor was sacrosanct   and some were more general guidelines for the good and civilized conduct of warfare .  there were the rules of position  of tactics  of the enforcement of discipline  of the correct organization of supply lines .  the art laid down the optimum course to take in every conceivable eventuality .  it meant that warfare in the empire had become far more sensible  and generally consisted of short periods of activity followed by long periods of people trying to find things in the index .   no one remembered the author .  some said it was one tzu sung  some claimed it was three sun sung .  possibly it was even some unsung genius who had penned  or rather painted  the very first principle  know the enemy  and know yourself .   lord hong felt that he knew himself very well  and seldom had trouble knowing his enemies .  and he made a point of keeping his enemies alive and healthy .   take the lords sung  fang  tang  and mcsweeney .  he cherished them .  he cherished their adequacy .  they had adequate military brains  which was to say that they had memorized the five rules and nine principles of the art of war .  they wrote adequate poetry  and were cunning enough to counter such coups as were attempted in their own ranks .  they occasionally sent against him assassins who were sufficiently competent to keep lord hong interested and observant and entertained .   he even admired their adequate treachery .  no one could fail to realize that lord hong would be the next emperor  but when it came to it they would nevertheless contest the throne .  at least  officially .  in fact  each warlord had privately pledged his personal support to lord hong  being adequately bright to know what was likely to happen if he didn   t .  there would still have to be a battle  of course  for custom   s sake .  but lord hong had a place in his heart for any leader who would sell his own men .   know your enemy .  lord hong had decided to find a worthwhile one .  so lord hong had seen to it that he got books and news from ankh morpork .  there were ways .  he had his spies .  at the moment ankh morpork didn   t know it was the enemy  and that was the best kind of enemy to have .   and he had been amazed  and then intrigued  and finally lost in admiration for what he saw     i should have been born there  he thought as he watched the other members of the serene council .  oh  for a game of chess with someone like lord vetinari .  no doubt he would carefully watch the board for three hours before he even made his first move     lord hong turned to the serene council   s minutes eunuch .      can we get on .     he said .   the man licked his brush nervously .     nearly finished  o lord     he said .   lord hong sighed .   damn calligraphy .  there would be changes .  a written language of seven thousand letters and it took all day to write a thirteen syllable poem about a white pony trotting through wild hyacinths .  and that was fine and beautiful  he had to concede  and no one did it better than lord hong .  but ankh morpork had an alphabet of twenty six unexpressive  ugly  crude letters  suitable only for peasants and artisans   and had produced poems and plays that left white hot trails across the soul .  and you could also use it to write the bloody minutes of a five minute meeting in less than a day .      how far have you got .     he said .   the eunuch coughed politely .         how softly the bloom of the apric          he began .      yes  yes  yes     said lord hong .     could we on this occasion dispense with the poetic framework  please .         uh .     the minutes of the last meeting were duly signed .            is that all .         uh   you see  i have to finish painting the petals on           i wish this council to be concluded by this evening .  go away .      the eunuch looked anxiously around the table  grabbed his scrolls and brushes and scuttled out .      good     said lord hong .  he nodded at the other warlords .  he saved a special friendly nod for lord tang .  lord hong had prodded the thought with some intrigued interest  but it really did seem that lord tang was a man of honor .  it was a rather cowed and crabbed honor  but it was definitely in there somewhere  and would have to be dealt with .      it would be better in any case  my lords  if we spoke in private     he said .     on the matter of the rebels .  disturbing intelligence has reached me of their activities .      lord mcsweeney nodded .     i have seen to it that thirty rebels in sum dim have been executed     he said .     as an example .      as an example of the mindlessness of lord mcsweeney  thought lord hong .  to his certain knowledge  and none had better knowledge than he  there had not even been a cadre of the red army in sum dim .  but  almost certainly  there was one now .  it was really too easy .   the other warlords also made small but proud speeches about their efforts to turn barely noticeable unrest into bloody revolution  although they hadn   t managed to see it like that .   they were nervous  under the bravado  like sheepdogs who   d had a glimpse of a world where the sheep did not run .   lord hong cherished the nervousness .  he intended to use it  by and by .  he smiled and smiled .   finally he said     however  my lords  despite your sterling efforts the situation remains grave .  i have information that a very senior wizard from ankh morpork has arrived to assist the rebels here in hunghung  and that there is a plot to overthrow the good organization of the celestial world and assassinate the emperor  may he live for ten thousand years .  i must naturally assume that the foreign devils are behind this .         i know nothing of this .     snapped lord tang .      my dear lord tang  i was not suggesting that you should     said lord hong .      i meant       lord tang began .      your devotion to the emperor is unquestioned     lord hong continued  as smoothly as a knife through warm butter .     it is true that there is almost certainly someone highly placed assisting these people  but not one shred of evidence points to you .         i should hope not .         indeed .      the lords fang and mcsweeney moved very slightly away from lord tang .      how can we have let this happen .     said lord fang .     certainly it is true that people  foolish deranged people  have sometimes ventured out beyond the wall .  but to let one come back           i am afraid the grand vizier at the time was a man of changeable humors     said lord hong .     he thought it would be interesting to see what intelligence was brought back .         intelligence .     said lord fang .     this city of ank   more   pork is an abomination .  mere anarchy .  there appear to be no nobles of consequence and the society is that of a termite nest .  it would be better for us  my lords  if it was wiped from the face of the world .         your incisive comments are duly noted  lord fang     said lord hong  while part of him rolled on the floor laughing .     in any event     he went on     i shall see that extra guards are posted in the emperor   s chambers .  however all this trouble began  we must see that it ends here .      he watched them watching him .  they think i want to rule the empire  he thought .  so they   re all   except for lord tang  rebel fellow traveler as he will undoubtedly prove to be   working out how this will be to their advantage     he dismissed them  and retired to his chambers .   it was a fact that the ghosts and devils who lived beyond the wall had no grasp of culture and certainly no concept of books  and being in possession of such a patently impossible object was punishable by eventual death .  and confiscation .   lord hong had built up quite a library .  he had even acquired maps .   and more than maps .  there was a box he kept locked  in the room with the full length mirror     not now .  later on     ankh morpork .  even the name sounded rich .   all he needed was a year .  the dreadful scourge of the rebellion would allow him to wield the kind of powers that even the maddest emperor had not dreamed of .  and then it would be unthinkable not to build a vengeful fleet to wreak terror on the foreign devils .  thank you  lord fang .  your point is duly noted .   as if it mattered who was emperor .  the empire was possibly a bonus  to be acquired later  perhaps  in passing .  let him just have ankh morpork  with its busy dwarfs and its grasp  above all  of machinery .  look at the barking dogs .  half the time they blew up .  they were inaccurate .  the principle was sound but the execution was terrible  especially when they blew up .   it had come as a revelation to lord hong when he looked at the problem the ankh morpork way and realized that it might just possibly be better to give the job of auspicious dog maker to some peasant with a fair idea about metal and explosive earths than to some clerk who   d got the highest marks in an examination to find the best poem about iron .  in ankh morpork people did things .   let him just walk down broadway as owner  and eat the pies of the famous mr .  dibbler .  let him play one game of chess against lord vetinari .  of course  it would mean leaving the man one arm .   he was shaking with excitement .  not later   now .  his fingers reached for the secret key on its chain around his neck .      it was barely a track .  rabbits would have walked right past it .  and you   d have sworn there was a sheer  passless rock wall until you found the gap .   once you did find it  it was hardly worth the bother .  it led to a long gully with a few natural caves in it  and a bit of grass  and a spring .   and  as it turned out  cohen   s gang .  except that he called it a horde .  they were sitting in the sun  complaining about how it wasn   t as warm as it used to be .      i   m back then  lads     said cohen .      been away  have you .         whut .  whut   s he say .         he said he   s back .         black what .      cohen beamed at rincewind .     i brought    em with me     he said .     like i said  no future in going it alone these days .         er     said rincewind  after surveying the little scene     are any of these men under eighty years old .         stand up  boy willie     said cohen .   a dehydrated man only marginally less wrinkled than the others got to his feet .  it was his feet that were particularly noticeable .  he wore boots with extremely thick soles .      so   s me feet touch the ground     he said .      don   t they   er   touch the ground in ordinary boots .         nope .  orthopedic problem  see .  like   you know how a lot of people   ve got one leg shorter than the other .  funny thing  with me it   s           don   t tell me     said rincewind .     sometimes i get these amazing flashes   both legs are shorter than the other  right .         amazing .  o    course  i can see you   re a wizard     said boy willie .     you   d know about this sort of thing .      rincewind gave the next member of the horde a bright mad smile .  it was almost certainly a human being  because wizened little monkeys didn   t usually go around in a wheelchair while wearing a helmet with horns on it .  it grimaced at rincewind .      this is           whut .  whut .         mad hamish     said cohen .      whut .  whozee .         i bet that wheelchair terrifies them     said rincewind .     especially the blades .         we had the devil of a job getting it over the wall     cohen conceded .     but you   d be amazed at his turn of speed .         whut .         and this is truckle the uncivil .         sod off  wizard .      rincewind beamed at exhibit b .     those walking sticks   fascinating .  very impressive the way you   ve got love and hate written on them .      cohen smiled proprietorially .      truckle used to be reckoned one of the biggest badasses in the world     he said .      really .  him .         but it   s amazing what you can do with a herbal suppository .         up yours  mister     said truckle .   rincewind blinked .     er .  can i have a word  cohen .      he drew the ancient barbarian aside .      i don   t want to seem to be making trouble here     he said     but it doesn   t strike you  does it  that these men are a bit  well  past their sell by date .  a little  not to put too fine a point on it  old .         whut .  whutzeesayin    .         he says it   s cold .         whut .         what   re you saying .  there   s nearly five hundred years of concentrated barbarian hero experience in    em     said cohen .      five hundred years    experience in a fighting unit is good     said rincewind .     it   s good .  but it should be spread over more than one person .  i mean  what are you expecting them to do .  fall over on people .         nothin    wrong with    em     said cohen  indicating a frail man who was staring intently at a large block of teak .     look at ole caleb the ripper over there .  see .  killed more   n four hundred men with his bare hands .  eighty five now and but for the dust he   s marvellous .         what the hell is he doing .         ah  see  they   re into bare handed combat here .  very big thing  unarmed combat  on account of most people not being allowed weapons .  so caleb reckons he   s on to a good thing .  see that big lump of teak .  it   s amazin    .  he just gives this blood curdlin    shout and           cohen  they   re all very old men .         they   re the cream .      rincewind sighed .      cohen  they   re the cheese .  why   ve you brought them all the way here .         gonna help me steal something     said cohen .      what .  a jewel or something .            s something     said cohen  sulkily .        s in hunghung .         really .  my word     said rincewind .     and there   s a lot of people in hunghung  i expect .         about half a million     said cohen .      lots of guards  no doubt .         about forty thousand  i heard .  about three quarters of a million if you count all the armies .         right     said rincewind .     so  with these half dozen old men           the silver horde     said cohen  with a touch of pride .      what .  pardon .         that   s their name .  got to have a name in the horde business .  the silver horde .      rincewind turned around .  several of the horde had fallen asleep .      the silver horde     he said .     right .  matches the color of their hair .  those that have got hair .  so   with this   silver horde you   re going to rush the city  kill all the guards and steal all the treasure .      cohen nodded .     yeah   something like that .  of course  we won   t have to kill all the guards           oh  no .         it   d take too long .         yes  and of course you   ll want to leave something to do tomorrow .         i mean they   ll be busy  what with the revolution and everything .         a revolution  too .  my word .         they say it   s a time of portents     said cohen .     they           i   m surprised they   ve got time to worry about the state of their camping equipment     said rincewind .      you   d be well advised to stay along o    us     said ghenghiz cohen .     you   ll be safer with us .         oh  i   m not sure about that     said rincewind  grinning horribly .     i   m not sure about that at all .      by myself  he thought  only ordinary horrible things can happen to me .   cohen shrugged  and then stared around the clearing until his gaze lighted on a slight figure who was sitting a little apart from the rest  reading a book .      look at him     he said  benevolently  like a man pointing out a dog doing a good trick .     always got his nose in a book .     he raised his voice .     teach .  come and show this wizard the way to hunghung .      he turned back to rincewind .     teach   ll tell you anything you want to know     cos he knows everything .  i   ll leave you with him .  i   ve got to go and have a talk with old vincent .     he waved a hand dismissively .     not that there   s anything wrong with him  at all     he said defiantly .     it   s just that his memory   s bad .  we had a bit of trouble on the way over .  i keep telling him  it   s rape the women and set fire to the houses .         rape .     said rincewind .     that   s not very           he   s eighty seven     said cohen .     don   t go and spoil an old man   s dreams .      teach turned out to be a tall  stick like man with an amiably absentminded expression and a fringe of white hair so that  when viewed from above  he would appear to be a daisy .  he certainly did not appear to be a bloodthirsty brigand  even though he was wearing a chain mail vest slightly too big for him and a huge scabbard strapped across his back  which contained no sword but held a variety of scrolls and brushes .  his chain mail shirt had a breast pocket with three different colored pens in a leather pocket protector .      ronald saveloy     he said  shaking rincewind   s hand .     the gentlemen do rather assume considerable knowledge on my part .  let me see   you want to go to hunghung  yes .      rincewind had been thinking about this .      i want to know the way to hunghung     he said guardedly .      yes .  well .  at this time of year i   d head towards the setting sun until i left the mountains and reached the alluvial plain where you   ll see evidence of drumlins and some quite fine examples of obviously erratic boulders .  it   s about ten miles .      rincewind stared at him .  a brigand   s directions were usually more on the lines of    keep straight on past the burning city and turn right when you   ve passed all the citizens hanging up by their ears .         those drumlins sound dangerous     he said .      they   re just a type of post glacial hill     said mr .  saveloy .      what about these erratic boulders .  they sound like the kind of thing that   d pounce on           just boulders dropped a long way from home by a glacier     said mr .  saveloy .     nothing to worry about .  the landscape is not hostile .      rincewind didn   t believe him .  he   d had the ground hit him very hard many times .      however     said mr .  saveloy     hunghung is a little dangerous at the moment .         no  really .     said rincewind wearily .      it   s not exactly a siege .  everyone   s waiting for the emperor to die .  these are what they call here      he smiled      interesting times .         i hate interesting times .      the other horders had wandered off  fallen asleep again  or were complaining to one another about their feet .  the voice of cohen could be heard somewhere in the distance     look  this is a match  and this is           you know  you sound a very educated man for a barbarian     said rincewind .      oh  dear me  i didn   t start out a barbarian .  i used to be a school teacher .  that   s why they call me teach .         what did you teach .         geography .  and i was very interested in auriental  studies .  but i decided to give it up and make a living by the sword .         after being a teacher all your life .         it did mean a change of perspective  yes .         but   well   surely   the privation  the terrible hazards  the daily risk of death        mr .  saveloy brightened up .     oh  you   ve been a teacher  have you .      rincewind looked around when someone shouted .  he turned  to see two of the horde arguing nose to nose .   mr .  saveloy sighed .      i   m trying to teach them chess     he said .     it   s vital to the understanding of the auriental mind .  but i am afraid they have no concept of taking turns at moving  and their idea of an opening gambit is for the king and all the pawns to rush up the board together and set fire to the opposing rooks .      rincewind leaned closer .      look  i mean   ghenghiz cohen .     he said .     has he gone off his head .  i mean   just killing half a dozen geriatric priests and nicking some paste gems  yes .  attacking forty thousand guards all by himself is certain death .         oh  he won   t be by himself     said mr .  saveloy .   rincewind blinked .  there was something about cohen .  people caught optimism off him as though it was the common cold .      oh  yes .  of course .  sorry .  i   d forgotten that .  seven against forty thousand .  i shouldn   t think you   ll have any problems .  i   ll just be going .  fairly quickly  i think .         we have a plan .  it   s a sort of       mr .  saveloy hesitated .  his eyes unfocused slightly .     you know .  thing .  bees do it .  wasps  too .  also some jellyfish  i believe   had the word only a moment ago   er .  it   s going to be the biggest one ever  i think .      rincewind gave him another blank stare .     i   m sure i saw a spare horse     he said .      let me give you this     said mr .  saveloy .     then perhaps you   ll understand .  it   s what it   s all about  really        he handed rincewind a small bundle of papers fastened together by a loop of string through one corner .   rincewind  shoving it hastily into his pocket  noticed only the title on the first page .   it said      what i did on my holidays     the choices seemed very clear to rincewind .  there was the city of hunghung  under siege  apparently throbbing with revolution and danger  and there was everywhere else .   therefore it was important to know where hunghung was so that he didn   t blunder into it by accident .  he paid a lot of attention to mr .  saveloy   s instructions  and then rode the other way .   he could get a ship somewhere .  of course  the wizards would be surprised to see him back  but he could always say there   d been no one in .   the hills gave way to scrubland which in turn led down to an apparently endless damp plain which contained  in the misty distance  a river so winding that half the time it must have been flowing backwards .   the land was a checkerboard of cultivation .  rincewind liked the countryside in theory  providing it wasn   t rising up to meet him and was for preference happening on the far side of a city wall  but this was hardly countryside .  it was more like one big  hedgeless farm .  occasional huge rocks  looking dangerously erratic  rose out of the fields .   sometimes he   d see people hard at work in the distance .  as far as he could tell  their chief activity was moving mud around .   occasionally he   d see a man standing ankle deep in a flooded field holding a water buffalo on the end of a length of string .  the buffalo grazed and occasionally moved its bowels .  the man held the string .  it seemed to be his entire goal and occupation in life .   there were a few other people on the road .  usually they were pushing wheelbarrows loaded with water buffalo dung or  possibly  mud .  they didn   t pay any attention to rincewind .  in fact they made a point of not paying attention  they scurried past staring intently at the scenes of mud dynamics or bovine bowel movement happening in the fields .   rincewind would be the first to admit that he was a slow thinker .   but he   d been around long enough to spot the signs .  these people weren   t paying him any attention because they didn   t see people on horseback .   they were probably descended from people who learned that if you look too hard at anyone on horseback you receive a sharp stinging sensation such as might be obtained by a stick around the ear .  not looking up at people on horseback had become hereditary .  people who stared at people on horseback in what was considered to be a funny way never survived long enough to breed .   he decided to try an experiment .  the next wheelbarrow that trundled past was carrying not mud but people  about half a dozen of them  on seats either side of the huge central wheel .  the method of propulsion was secondarily by a small sail erected to catch the wind but primarily by that pre eminent source of motive power in a peasant community  someone   s great grandfather  or at least someone who looked like someone   s great grandfather .   cohen had said     there   s men here who can push a wheelbarrow for thirty miles on a bowl of millet with a bit of scum in it .  what does that tell you .  it tells me someone   s porking all the beef .      rincewind decided to explore the social dynamics and also try out the language .  it had been years since he   d last used it  but he had to admit that ridcully had been right .  he did have a gift for languages .  agatean was a language of few basic syllables .  it was really all in the tone  inflection  and context .  otherwise  the word for military leader was also the word for long tailed marmot  male sexual organ  and ancient chicken coop .      hey there  you .     he shouted .     er   to bend bamboo .  an expression of disapproval .  er   i mean   stop .      the barrow slewed to a halt .  no one looked at him .  they looked past him  or around him  or towards his feet .   eventually the wheelbarrow pusher  in the manner of a man who knows he   s in for it no matter what he does  mumbled     your honor commands .      rincewind felt very sorry  later  for what he said next .   he said     just give me all your food and   unwilling dogs  will you .      they watched him impassively .      damn .  i mean   arranged beetles .    variety of waterfall .    oh  yes   money .      there was a general fumbling and shifting among the passengers .  then the wheelbarrow pusher sidled towards rincewind  head down  and held up his hat .  it contained some rice  some dried fish  a highly dangerous looking egg .  and about a pound of gold  in big round coins .   rincewind stared at the gold .   gold was as common as copper on the counterweight continent .  that was one of the few things everyone knew about the place .  there was no point in cohen trying any kind of big robbery .  there was a limit to what anyone could carry .  he might as well rob one peasant village and live like a king for the rest of his life .  it wouldn   t be as if he   d need that much     the    later    suddenly caught up with him  and he did indeed feel quite ashamed .  these people had hardly anything  apart from loads of gold .      er .  thanks .  thank you .  yes .  just checking .  yes .  you can all have it back now .  i   ll   er   keep   the elderly grandmother   to run sideways   oh  damn   fish .      rincewind had always been on the bottom of the social heap .  it didn   t matter what size heap it was .  the top got higher or lower  but the bottom was always in the same place .  but at least it was an ankh morpork heap .   no one bowed to anyone in ankh morpork .  and anyone who tried what he   d just tried in ankh morpork would  by now  be scrabbling in the gutter for his teeth and whimpering about the pain in his groin and his horse would already have been repainted twice and sold to a man who   d be swearing he   d owned it for years .   he felt oddly proud of the fact .   something strange welled up from the sludgy depths of his soul .  it was  to his amazement  a generous impulse .   he slid off the horse and held out the reins .  a horse was useful  but he was used to doing without one .  besides  over a short distance a man could run faster than a horse  and this was a fact very dear to rincewind   s heart .      here     he said .     you can have it .  for the fish .      the wheelbarrow pusher screamed  grabbed the handles of his conveyance  and hurtled desperately away .  several people were thrown off  took one almost look at rincewind  also screamed  and ran after him .   worse than whips  cohen had said .  they   ve got something here worse than whips .  they don   t need whips anymore .  rincewind hoped he   d never find out what it was  if it had done this to people .   he rode on through an endless panorama of fields .  there weren   t even any patches of roadside scrub  or taverns .  away among the fields were shapes that might be small towns or villages  but no apparent paths to them  possibly because paths used up valuable agricultural mud .   finally he sat down on a rock that presumably not even the peasants    most concerted efforts had been able to move  and reached into his pocket for his shameful dried fish lunch .   his hand touched the bundle of papers mr .  saveloy had given him .  he pulled them out  and got crumbs on them .   this is what it   s all about  the barbarian teacher had said .  he hadn   t explained what    it    was .   what i did on my holidays  said the title .  it was in bad handwriting or  rather  bad painting   the agateans wrote with paintbrushes  assembling little word pictures out of handy components .  one picture wasn   t just worth a thousand words  it was a thousand words .   rincewind wasn   t much good at reading the language .  there were very few agatean books even in the unseen university library .  and this one looked as though whoever had written it had been trying to make sense of something unfamiliar .   he turned over a couple of pages .  it was a story about a great city  containing magnificent things      beer strong like an ox     it said  and    pies containing many many parts of pig .     everyone in the city seemed to be wise  kind  strong  or all three  especially some character called the great wizard who seemed to feature largely in the text .   and there were mystifying little comments  as in     i saw a man tread upon the toes of a city guard who said to him    your wife is a big hippo .     to which the man responded    place it where the sun does not shed daylight  enormous person     upon which the guard  this bit was in red ink and the handwriting was shaky  as if the writer was quite excited  did not remove the man   s head according to ancient custom .     the statement was followed by a pictogram of a dog passing water  which was for some obscure reason the agatean equivalent of an exclamation mark .  there were five of these .   rincewind flicked through the pages .  they were filled with the same dull stuff  sentences stating the blindingly obvious but often followed by several incontinent dogs .  such as     the innkeeper said the city had demanded tax but he did not intend to pay  and when i asked if he was not afraid he vouch safed      complicated pictogram  them all except one and he can  complicated pictogram  himself     urinating dog  urinating dog  .  he went on to say     the  pictogram indicating supreme ruler  is a  another pictogram which  after some thought and holding up the picture at various angles  rincewind decided meant    a horse   s bottom     and you can tell him i said so     at which point a guard in the tavern did not disembowel him  urinating dog  urinating dog  but said     tell him from me also     urinating dog  urinating dog  urinating dog  urinating dog  urinating dog  .      what was so odd about that .  people talked like that in ankh morpork all the time  or at least expressed those sentiments .  apart from the dog .   mind you  a country that   d wipe out a whole city to teach the other cities a lesson was a mad place .  perhaps this was a book of jokes and he just hadn   t seen the point .  perhaps comedians here got big laughs with lines like     i say  i say  i say  i met a man on the way to the theater and he didn   t chop my legs off  urinating dog  urinating dog        he had been aware of the jingle of harness on the road  but hadn   t paid it any attention .  he hadn   t even looked up at the sound of someone approaching .  by the time he did think of looking up it was too late  because someone had their boot on his neck .      oh  urinating dog     he said  before passing out .      there was a puff of air and the luggage appeared  dropping heavily into a snowdrift .   there was a meat cleaver sticking into its lid .   it remained motionless for some time and then  its legs moving in a complicated little dance  it turned around     degrees .   the luggage did not think .  it had nothing to think with .  whatever processes went on inside it probably had more to do with the way a tree reacts to sun and rain and sudden storms  but speeded up very fast .   after a while it seemed to get its bearings and ambled off across the melting snow .   the luggage did not feel  either .  it had nothing to feel with .  but it reacted  in the same way that a tree reacts to the changing of the seasons .   its pace quickened .   it was close to home .      rincewind had to concede that the shouting man was right .  not  that is  about rincewind   s father being the diseased liver of a type of mountain panda and his mother being a bucket of turtle slime  rincewind had no personal experience of either parent but felt that they were probably at least vaguely humanoid  if only briefly .  but on the subject of appearing to own a stolen horse he had rincewind bang to rights and  also  a foot on his neck .  a foot on the neck is nine points of the law .   he felt hands rummaging in his pockets .   another person   rincewind was not able to see much beyond a few inches of alluvial soil  but from context it appeared to be an unsympathetic person   joined in the shouting .   rincewind was hauled upright .   the guards were pretty much like guards as rincewind had experienced them everywhere .  they had exactly the amount of intellect required to hit people and drag them off to the scorpion pit .  they were league champions at shouting at people a few inches from their face .   the effect was made surreal by the fact that the guards themselves had no faces  or at least no faces they could call their own .  their ornate  black enameled helmets had huge moustached visages painted on them  leaving only the owner   s mouth uncovered so that he could  for example  call rincewind   s grandfather a box of inferior goldfish droppings .   what i did on my holidays was waved in front of his face .      bag of rotted fish .         i don   t know what it means     said rincewind .     someone just gave it to           feet of extreme decayed milk .         could you perhaps not shout quite so loud .  i think my eardrum has just exploded .      the guard subsided  possibly only because he had run out of breath .  rincewind had a moment to look at the scenery .   there were two carts on the road .  one of them seemed to be a cage on wheels  he made out faces watching him in terror .  the other was an ornate palanquin carried by eight peasants  rich curtains covered the sides but he could see where they had been twitched aside so that someone within could look at him .   the guards were aware of this .  it seemed to make them awkward .      if i could just expl           silence  mouth of       the guard hesitated .      you   ve used turtle  goldfish  and what you probably meant to be cheese     said rincewind .      mouth of chicken gizzards .      a long  thin hand emerged from the curtains and beckoned  just once .   rincewind was hustled forward .  the hand had the longest fingernails he   d ever seen on something that didn   t purr .      kowtow .         sorry .     said rincewind .      kowtow .      swords were produced .      i don   t know what you mean .     rincewind wailed .      kowtow  please     whispered a voice by his ear .  it was not a particularly friendly voice but compared to all the other voices it was positively affectionate .  it sounded as though it belonged to quite a young man .  and it was speaking very good morporkian .      how .         you don   t know that .  kneel down  press your forehead on the ground .  that   s if you want to be able to wear a hat again .      rincewind hesitated .  he was a free born morporkian  and on the list of things a citizen didn   t do was bow down to any  not to put too fine a point on it  foreigner .   on the other hand  right at the top of the list of things a citizen didn   t do was get their head chopped off .      that   s better .  that   s good .  how did you know you ought to tremble .         oh  i thought up that bit myself .      the hand beckoned with a finger .   a guard slapped rincewind in the face with the mud encrusted what i did   rincewind clutched it guiltily as the guard scurried towards his master   s digit .      voice .     said rincewind .      yes .         what happens if i claim immunity because i   m a foreigner .         there   s a special thing they do with a wiremesh waistcoat and a cheesegrater .         oh .         and there are torturers in hunghung who can keep a man alive for years .         i suppose you   re not talking about healthy early morning runs and a high fiber diet .         no .  so keep quiet and with any luck you   ll be sent to be a slave in the palace .         luck is my middle name     said rincewind  indistinctly .     mind you  my first name is bad .         remember to gibber and grovel .         i   ll do my very best .      the white hand emerged bearing a scrap of paper .  the guard took it  turned towards rincewind  and cleared his throat .      harken to the wisdom and justice of district commissioner kee  ball of swamp emanations .  not him  i mean you .      he cleared his throat again and peered closer at the paper in the manner of one who learned to read by saying the name of each letter very carefully to himself .         the white pony runs through the   the           the guard turned and held a whispered conversation with the curtains  and turned back again .               chrysanthemum   mumum blossoms   the cold wind stirs the  apricot trees .  send him to  the palace to slave  until all appendages drop  off .            several of the other guards applauded .      look up and clap     said the voice .      i   m afraid my appendages will drop off .         it   s a big cheesegrater .         encore .  wow .  superb .  that bit about the chrysanthemumums .  wonderful .         good .  listen .  you   re from bes pelargic .  you   ve got the right accent  damned if i know why .  it   s a seaport and people there are a little strange .  you were robbed by bandits and escaped on one of their horses .  that   s why you haven   t got your papers .  you need pieces of paper for everything here  including being anybody .  and pretend you don   t know me .         i don   t know you .         good .  long live the changing things to a more equitable state while retaining due respect for the traditions of our forebears and of course not harming the august personage of the emperor endeavor .         good .  yes .  what .      a guard kicked rincewind in the region of the kidneys .  this suggested  in the universal language of the boot  that he should get up .   he managed to get up on one knee  and saw the luggage .   it wasn   t his  and there were three of them .      the luggage trotted to the crest of a low hill and stopped so fast that it left a lot of little grooves in the dirt .   in addition to not having any equipment with which to think or feel  the luggage also had no means of seeing .  the manner in which it perceived events was a complete mystery .   it perceived the other luggages .   the three of them stood patiently in a line behind the palanquin .  they were big .  they were black .   the luggage   s legs disappeared inside its body .   after a while it very cautiously opened its lid  just a fraction .      of the three things that most people know about the horse  the third is that  over a short distance  it can   t run as fast as a man .  as rincewind had learned to his advantage  it has more legs to sort out .   there are additional advantages if a  the people on horseback aren   t expecting you to run and b  you happen to be  very conveniently  in an athletic starting position .   rincewind rose like a boomerang curry from a sensitive stomach .   there was a lot of shouting but the comforting thing  the important thing  was that it was all behind him .  it would soon try to catch him up but that was a problem for the future .  he could also consider where he was running to as well  but an experienced coward never bothered with the to when the from held such fascination .   a less practiced runner would have risked a glance behind  but rincewind instinctively knew all about wind drag and the tendency of inconvenient rocks to position themselves under the unwary foot .  besides  why look behind .  he was already running as fast as he could .  nothing he could see would make him run any faster .   there was a large shapeless village ahead  a construction apparently of mud and dung .  in the fields in front of it a dozen peasants looked up from their toil at the accelerating wizard .   perhaps it was rincewind   s imagination  but as he passed them he could have sworn that he heard the cry      necessarily extended duration to the red army .  regrettable decease without undue suffering to the forces of oppression .      rincewind dived through the huts as the soldiers charged at the peasants .   cohen had been right .  there seemed to be a revolution .  but the empire had been in unchanged existence for thousands of years  courtesy and a respect for protocol were part of its very fabric  and by the sound of it the revolutionaries had yet to master the art of impolite slogans .   rincewind preferred running to hiding .  hiding was all very well  but if you were found then you were stuck .  but the village was the only cover for miles around  and some of the soldiers had horses .  a man might be faster than a horse over a short distance  but over this panorama of flat  open fields a horse had a running man done up like a clam .   so he ducked into a building at random and pushed aside the first door he came to .   it had  pasted on it  the words  examination .  silence .   forty expectant and slightly worried faces looked up at him from their writing stools .  they weren   t children  but full grown adults .   there was a lectern at the end of the room and  on it  a pile of papers sealed with string and wax .   rincewind felt the atmosphere was familiar .  he   d breathed it before  even if it had been a world away .  it was full of those cold sweaty odours created by the sudden realization that it was probably too late to do that revision you   d kept on putting off .  rincewind had faced many horrors in his time  but none held quite the same place in the lexicon of dread as those few seconds after someone said     turn over your papers now .      the candidates were watching him .   there was shouting somewhere outside .   he hurried up to the lectern  tore at the string and distributed the papers as fast as he could .  then he dived back to the safety of the lectern  removed his hat  and was bent low when the door opened slowly .      go away .     he screamed .     examination in progress .      the unseen figure behind the door murmured something to someone else .  the door was closed again .   the candidates were still staring at him .      er .  very well .  turn over your papers .      there was a rustle  a few moments of that dreadful silence  and then much activity with brushes .   competitive examinations .  oh  yes .  that was another thing people knew about the empire .  they were the only way to get any kind of public post and the security that brought .  people had said that this must be a very good system  because it opened up opportunities for people of merit .   rincewind picked up a spare paper and read it .   it was headed  examination for the post of assistant night soil operative for the district of w   ung .   he read question one .  it required candidates to write a sixteen line poem on evening mist over the reed beds .   question two seemed to be about the use of metaphor in some book rincewind had never heard of .   then there was a question about music     rincewind turned the paper over a couple of times .  there didn   t seem to be any mention  anywhere  of words like    compost    or    bucket    or    wheelbarrow .     but presumably all this produced a better class of person than the ankh morpork system  which asked just one question     got your own shovel  have you .      the shouting outside seemed to have died away  rincewind risked poking his head out of the door .  there was a commotion near the road but it no longer seemed rincewind orientated .   he ran for it .   the students got on with their examination .  one of the more enterprising  however  rolled up his trouser leg and copied down a poem about mist he   d composed  at great effort  some time previously .  after a while you got to know what kind of questions the examiners asked .   rincewind trotted onwards  trying to keep to ditches wherever these weren   t knee deep in sucking mud .  it wasn   t a landscape built for concealment .  the agateans grew crops on any piece of ground the seeds wouldn   t roll off .  apart from the occasional rocky outcrop there was a distinct lack of places in which to lurk .   no one paid him much attention once he   d left the village far behind .  the occasional water buffalo operative would turn to watch him until he was out of sight  but displayed no special curiosity  it was merely that rincewind was marginally more interesting than watching a water buffalo defecate .   he kept the road just in sight and  by evening  reached a crossroads .   there was an inn .   rincewind hadn   t eaten since the leopard .  the inn meant food  but food meant money .  he was hungry  and he had no money .   he chided himself for this kind of negative thinking .  that was not the right approach .  what he should do was go in and order a large  nourishing meal .  then instead of being hungry with no money he   d be well fed with no money  a net gain on his current position .  of course  the world was likely to raise some objections  but in rincewind   s experience there were few problems that couldn   t be solved with a scream and a good ten yards    start .  and  of course  he would just have had a strengthening meal .   besides  he liked hunghungese food .  a few refugees had opened restaurants in ankh morpork and rincewind considered himself something of an expert on the dishes .    the one huge room was thick with smoke and  insofar as this could be determined through the swirls and coils  quite busy .  a couple of old men were sitting in front of a complicated pile of ivory tiles  playing shibo yangcong san .  he wasn   t sure what they were smoking but  by the looks on their faces  they were happy they   d chosen it .   rincewind made his way to the fireplace  where a skinny man was tending a cauldron .   he gave him a cheery smile .     good morning .  can i partake of your famous delicacy    meal a for two people with extra prawn cracker    .         never heard of it .         um .  then   could i see a painful ear   a croak of a frog   a menu .         what   s a menu  friend .      rincewind nodded .  he knew what it meant when a stranger called you    friend    like that .  no one who called someone else    friend    was feeling very kindly disposed .      what is there to eat  i meant .         noodles  boiled cabbage  and pork whiskers .         is that all .         pork whiskers don   t grow on trees  san .         i   ve been seeing water buffalo all day     rincewind said .     don   t you people ever eat beef .      the ladle splashed into the cauldron .  somewhere behind him a shibo tile dropped on to the floor .  the back of rincewind   s head prickled under the stares .      we don   t serve rebels in this place     said the landlord loudly .   probably too meaty  rincewind thought .  but it seemed to him that the words had been addressed to the world in general rather than to him .      glad to hear it     he said     because           yes indeed     said the landlord  a little louder .     no rebels welcome here .         that   s fine by me  because           if i knew of any rebels i would be certain to alert the authorities     the landlord bellowed .      i   m not a rebel  i   m just hungry     said rincewind .     i   d  er  like a bowlful  please .      a bowl was filled .  rainbow patterns shimmered on its oily surface .      that   ll be half a rhinu     said the landlord .      you mean you want me to pay before i eat it .     said rincewind .      you might not want to afterwards  friend .      a rhinu was more gold than rincewind had ever owned .  he patted his pockets theatrically .      in fact  it seems that       he began .  there was a small thump beside him .  what i did on my holidays had fallen on to the floor .      yes  thank you  that will do nicely     said the landlord to the room at large .  he pushed the bowl into rincewind   s hand and  in one movement  scooped up the booklet and crammed it back into the wizard   s pocket .      go and sit down in the corner .     he hissed .     and you   ll be told what to do .         but i   m sure i know what to do .  dip spoon in bowl  raise spoon to mouth           sit down .      rincewind found the darkest corner and sat down .  people were still watching him .   to avoid the group gaze he pulled out what i did and opened it at random  in an effort to find out why it had a magical effect on the landlord .         sold me a bun containing what was called a  complicated pictogram  made entirely of the inside of pigs  urinating dog     he read .     and such as these could be bought for small coin at any time  and so replete were the citizens that hardly any bought these  complicated pictogram  from the stall of  complicated pictogram  but it seemed to involve a razor  san .      sausages filled with pig parts  thought rincewind .  well  perhaps they might be amazing if  up until then  a bowl of dishwater with something congealing on the top of it had been your idea of a hearty meal .   hah .  mister what i did on my holidays should try coming to ankh morpork next time  and see how much he liked one of old   dibbler   s sausages   full of genuine   pig product     the spoon splashed into the bowl .   rincewind turned the pages hurriedly .         peaceful streets  along which i walked  were quite free of crime and brigandage           of course they were  you four eyed little git .     shouted rincewind .     that was because it was all happening to me .            a city where all men are free           free .  free .  well  yes  free to starve  get robbed by the thieves    guild       said rincewind to the book .   he fumbled through to another page .         my companion was the great wizard  complicated pictogram  but now that rincewind studied it he realized with a plummeting heart it had a few lines that looked like the agatean for    wind      the most prominent and powerful wizard in the entire country           i never said that .  i       rincewind stopped .  memory treacherously dredged up a few phrases  such as oh  the archchancellor listens to everything i say and that place would just fall down without me around .  but that was just the sort of thing you said after a few beers  surely no one would be so gullible as to write     a picture focused itself in rincewind   s memory .  it was of a happy  smiling little man with huge spectacles and a trusting  innocent approach to life which brought terror and destruction everywhere he wandered .  twoflower had been quite unable to believe that the world was a bad place and that was largely because  to him  it wasn   t .  it saved it all up for rincewind .   rincewind   s life had been quite uneventful before he   d met twoflower .  since then  as far as he could remember  it had contained events in huge amounts .   and the little man had gone back home  hadn   t he .  to bes pelargic   the empire   s only proper seaport .   surely no one would be so gullible as to write this sort of thing .   surely no one apart from one person would be so gullible .   rincewind was not politically minded but there were some things he could work out not because they were to do with politics but because they had a lot to do with human nature .  nasty images moved into place like bad scenery .   the empire had a wall around it .  if you lived in the empire then you learned how to make soup out of pig squeals and swallow spit because that   s how it was done  and you were bullied by soldiers all the time because that was how the world worked .   but if someone wrote a cheerful little book about        what i did on my holidays        in a place where the world worked quite differently        then however fossilized the society there would always be some people who asked themselves dangerous questions like    where   s the pork .      rincewind stared glumly at the wall .  peasants of the empire  rebel .  you have nothing to lose but your heads and hands and feet and there   s this thing they do with a wire waistcoat and a cheesegrater     he turned the book over .  there was no author   s name .  there was simply a little message  increased luck .  make copies .  extended duration and happiness to the endeavor .   ankh morpork had had the occasional rebellion  too  over the years .  but no one went around organizing things .  they just grabbed themselves a weapon and took to the streets .  no one bothered with a formal battlecry  relying instead on the well tried    there    e goes .  get    im .  got    im .  now kick    im inna fork .      the point was   whatever caused that sort of thing wasn   t usually the reason for it .  when mad lord snapcase had been hung up by his figgin  it hadn   t really been because he   d made poor old spooner boggis eat his own nose  it had been because years of inventive nastiness had piled on one another until the grievances reached     there was a terrible scream from the far side of the room .  rincewind was half out of his seat before he noticed the little stage  and the actors .   a trio of musicians had squatted down on the floor .  the inn   s customers turned to watch .   it was  in a way  quite enjoyable .  rincewind didn   t quite follow the plot  but it went something like  man gets girl  man loses girl to other man  man cuts couple in half  man falls on own sword  all come up front for a bow to what might be the agatean equivalent of    happy days are here again .     it was a little hard to make out the fine detail because the actors shouted    hoorrrrrraa .     a lot and spent much of their time talking to the audience and their masks all looked the same to rincewind .  the musicians were in a world of their own or  by the sound of it  three different worlds .      fortune cookie .         huh .      rincewind re emerged from the thickets of thespianism to see the landlord beside him .   a dish of vaguely bivalvular biscuits was thrust under his nose .      fortune cookie .      rincewind reached out .  just as his fingers were about to close on one  the plate was jerked sideways an inch or two  bringing another under his hand .   oh  well .  he took it .   the thing was   his thoughts resumed  as the play screamed on   at least in ankh morpork you could lay your hands on real weapons .   poor devils .  it took more than well turned slogans and a lot of enthusiasm to run a good rebellion .  you needed well trained fighters and  above all  a good leader .  he hoped they found one when he was well away .   he unrolled the fortune and read it idly  oblivious to the landlord walking around behind him .   instead of the usual    you have just enjoyed an inferior meal    it was quite a complicated pictogram .   rincewind   s fingers traced the brush strokes .         many   many   apologies       what kind        the musician with the cymbals clashed them together sharply .   the wooden cosh bounced off rincewind   s head .   the old men playing shibo nodded happily to themselves and turned back to their game .      it was a fine morning .  the hideout echoed to the sounds of the silver horde getting up  groaning  adjusting various homemade surgical supports  complaining that they couldn   t find their spectacles  and mistakenly gumming one another   s dentures .   cohen sat with his feet in a bath of warm water  enjoying the sunshine .      teach .      the former geography teacher concentrated on a map he was making .      yes  ghenghiz .         what   s mad hamish going on about .         he says the bread   s stale and he can   t find his teeth .         tell him if things go right for us he can have a dozen young women just to chew his bread for him     said cohen .      that is not very hygienic  ghenghiz     said mr .  saveloy  without bothering to look up .     remember  i explained about hygiene .      cohen didn   t bother to answer .  he was thinking  six old men .  and you can   t really count teach  he   s a thinker  not a fighter     self doubt was not something regularly entertained within the cohen cranium .  when you   re trying to carry a struggling temple maiden and a sack of looted temple goods in one hand and fight off half a dozen angry priests with the other there is little time for reflection .  natural selection saw to it that professional heroes who at a crucial moment tended to ask themselves questions like    what is my purpose in life .     very quickly lacked both .   but  six old men   and the empire had almost a million men under arms .   when you looked at the odds in the cold light of dawn  or even this rather pleasant warm light of dawn  they made you stop and do the arithmetic of death .  if the plan went wrong     cohen bit his lip thoughtfully .  if the plan went wrong  it   d take weeks to kill all of them .  maybe he should have let old thog the butcher come along  too  even though he had to stop fighting every ten minutes to go to the lavatory .   oh  well .  he was committed now  so he might as well make the best of it .   cohen   s father had taken him to a mountain top  when he was no more than a lad  and explained to him the hero   s creed and told him that there was no greater joy than to die in battle .   cohen had seen the flaw in this straight away  and a lifetime   s experience had reinforced his belief that in fact a greater joy was to kill the other bugger in battle and end up sitting on a heap of gold higher than your horse .  it was an observation that had served him well .   he stood up and stretched in the sunshine .      it   s a lovely morning  lads     he said .     i feel like a million dollars .  don   t you .      there was a murmur of reluctant agreement .      good     said cohen .     let   s go and get some .         the great wall completely surrounds the agatean empire .  the word is completely .   it is usually about twenty feet high and sheer on its inner side .  it is built along beaches and across howling deserts and even on the lip of sheer cliffs where the possibility of attack from outside is remote .  on subject islands like bhangbhangduc and tingling there are similar walls  all metaphorically the same wall  and that seems strange to those of an unthinking military disposition who do not realize what its function really is .   it is more than just a wall  it is a marker .  on one side is the empire  which in the agatean language is a word identical with    universe .     on the other side is   nothing .  after all  the universe is everything there is .   oh  there may appear to be things  like sea  islands  other continents and so on .  they may even appear solid  it may be possible to conquer them  walk on them   but they are not ultimately real .  the agatean word for foreigner is the same as the word for ghost  and only one brush stroke away from the word for victim .   the walls are sheer in order to discourage those boring people who persist in believing that there might be anything interesting on the other side .  amazingly enough there are people who simply won   t take the hint  even after thousands of years .  the ones near the coast build rafts and head out across lonely seas to lands that are a fable .  the ones inland resort to man carrying kites and chairs propelled by fireworks .  many of them die in the attempt  of course .  most of the others are soon caught  and made to live in interesting times .   but some did make it to the great melting pot called ankh morpork .  they arrived with no money   sailors charged what the market would bear  which was everything   but they had a mad gleam in their eye and they opened shops and restaurants and worked twenty four hours a day .  people called this the ankh morpork dream  of making piles of cash in a place where your death was unlikely to be a matter of public policy  .  and it was dreamed all the stronger by people who didn   t sleep .      rincewind sometimes thought that his life was punctuated by awakenings .  they were not always rude ones .  sometimes they were merely impolite .  a very few   one or two  perhaps   had been quite nice  especially on the island .  the sun had come up in its humdrum fashion  the waves had washed the beach in quite a boring way  and on several occasions he   d managed to erupt from unconsciousness without his habitual small scream .   this one wasn   t just rude .  it was downright insolent .  he was being bumped about and someone had tied his hands together .  it was dark  a fact occasioned by the sack over his head .   rincewind did some calculation  and reached a conclusion .      this is the seventeenth worst day of my life so far     he thought .   being knocked unconscious in pubs was quite commonplace .  if it happened in ankh morpork then you   d likely as not wake up lying on the ankh with all your money gone or  if a ship was due out on a long and unpopular voyage  chained up in some scupper somewhere with no option for the next two years but to plough the ocean wave .   but generally the knocker wanted to keep you alive .  the thieves    guild were punctilious about that .  as they said     hit a man too hard and you can only rob him once     hit him just hard enough and you can rob him every week .      if he was in what felt like a cart then someone had some purpose in keeping him alive .   he wished he hadn   t thought of that .   someone pulled the sack off .  a terrifying visage stared down at him .         i would like to eat your foot .        said rincewind .      don   t worry .  i am a friend .      the mask was lifted away .  there was a young woman behind it   round faced  snub nosed  and quite different from any other citizen rincewind had met hitherto .  that was  he realized  because she was looking straight at him .  her clothes  if not her face  had last been seen on the stage .      don   t cry out     she said .      why .  what are you going to do .         we would have welcomed you properly but there was no time .     she sat down among the bundles in the back of the swaying cart and regarded him critically .      four big sandal said you arrived on a dragon and slaughtered a regiment of soldiers     she said .      i did .         and then you worked magic on a venerable old man and he became a great fighter .         he did .         and you gave him whole meat  even though four big sandal is only of the pung class .         i did .         and you have your hat .         yes  yes  got my hat .         and yet     said the girl     you don   t look like a great wizard .         ah .  well  the fact is        the girl looked as fragile as a flower .  but she had just pulled out  from somewhere in the folds of her costume  a small but perfectly serviceable knife .   rincewind had picked up an instinct for this sort of thing .  this was probably not the time to deny great wizardry .      the fact is       he repeated     that   how do i know i can trust you .      the girl looked indignant .     do you not have amazing wizardly powers .         oh  yes .  yes .  certainly .  but           say something in wizard language .         er .  stercus  stercus  stercus  moriturus sum     said rincewind  his eye on the knife .         o excrement  i am about to die .            it   s   er   a special mantra i say to raise the magical fluxes .      the girl subsided a little .      but it takes it out of you  wizarding     said rincewind .     flying on dragons  magically turning old men into warriors   i can only do so much of that sort of thing before it   s time for a rest .  right now i   m very weak on account of the tremendous amounts of magic i   ve just used  you see .      she looked at him with doubt still in her eyes .      all the peasants believe in the imminent arrival of the great wizard     she said .     but  in the words of the great philosopher ly tin wheedle     when many expect a mighty stallion they will find hooves on an ant .         she gave him another calculating look .      when you were on the road     she said     you grovelled in front of district commissioner kee .  you could have blasted him with terrible fire .         biding my time  spying out the land  not wanting to break my cover     rincewind gabbled .     er .  no good revealing myself straight away  is there .         you are maintaining a disguise .         yes .         it is a very good one .         thank you  because           only a great wizard would dare to look like such a pathetic piece of humanity .         thank you .  er   how did you know i was on the road .         they would have killed you there and then if i had not told you what to do .         you were the guard .         we had to catch up with you quickly .  it was sheer luck you were seen by four big sandal .         we .      she ignored the question .     they are only provincial soldiers .  i would not have got away with it in hunghung .  but i can play many roles .     she put away the knife  but rincewind had a feeling that he hadn   t talked her into believing him  only into not killing him .   he groped for a straw .      i   ve got a magic box on legs     he said  with a touch of pride .     it follows me around .  it seems to have got itself mislaid right now  but it   s quite an amazing thing .      the girl gave him a wooden look .  then she reached down with a delicate hand and hauled him upright .      is it     she said     something like this .      she twitched aside the curtains at the rear of the cart .   two boxes were trundling along in the dust .  they were more battered and cheaper looking than the luggage  but recognizably the same general species  if you could apply the word to travel accessories .      er .  yes .      she let go .  rincewind   s head hit the floor .      listen to me     she said .     a lot of bad things are happening .  i don   t believe in great wizards  but other people do  and sometimes people need something to believe in .  and if these other people die because we   ve got a wizard who is not so very great  then he will be a very unlucky wizard indeed .  you may be the great wizard .  if you are not  then i suggest you study very hard to be great .  do i make myself clear .         er .  yes .      rincewind had been faced with death on numerous occasions .  often there were armor and swords involved .  this occasion just involved a pretty girl and a knife  but somehow managed to be among the worst .  she sat back .      we are a traveling theater     she said .     it is convenient .  noh actors are allowed to move around .         aren   t they .     said rincewind .      you do not understand .  we are noh actors .         oh  you weren   t too bad .         great wizard     noh    is a non realist symbolic form of theater employing archaic language  stylized gestures and an accompaniment of flutes and drums .  your pretence of stupidity is masterly .  so much so that i could even believe that you are no actor .         excuse me  what is your name .     rincewind said .      pretty butterfly .         er .  yes .      she glared at him and slipped away towards the front of the cart .   it rumbled on .  rincewind lay with his head in a sack smelling of onions and methodically cursed things .  he cursed women with knives  and history generally  and the entire faculty of unseen university  and his absent luggage  and the population of the agatean empire .  but right now  at the top of the list  was whoever had designed this cart .  by the feel of it  whoever had thought that rough  splintery wood was the right surface for a floor was also the person who thought    triangular    was a nice shape for a wheel .      the luggage lurked in a ditch  watched without much interest by a man holding a water buffalo on the end of a piece of string .   it was feeling ashamed  and baffled  and lost .  it was lost because everywhere around it was   familiar .  the light  the smells  the feel of the soil   but it didn   t feel owned .   it was made of wood .  wood is sensitive to these things .   one of its many feet idly traced an outline in the mud .  it was a random  wretched pattern familiar to anyone who   s had to stand in front of the class and be scolded .   finally  it reached something that was probably as close as timber can get to a decision .   it had been given away .  it had spent many years trailing through strange lands  meeting exotic creatures and jumping up and down on them .  now it was back in the country where it had once been a tree .  therefore  it was free .   it was not the most logical chain of thought  but pretty good when all you   ve got to think with are knotholes .   and there was something it very much wanted to do .         when you   re ready  teach .         sorry  ghenghiz .  i   m just finishing        cohen sighed .  the horde were taking advantage of the rest to sit in the shade of a tree and tell one another lies about their exploits  while mr .  saveloy stood on top of a boulder squinting through some kind of homemade device and doodling on his maps .   bits of paper ruled the world now  cohen told himself .  it certainly ruled this part of it .  and teach   well  teach ruled bits of paper .  he might not be traditional barbarian hero material  despite his deeply held belief that all headmasters should be riveted to a cowshed door  but the man was amazing with bits of paper .   and he could speak agatean .  well  speak it better than cohen  who   d picked it up in a rough and ready way .  he said he   d learned it out of some old book .  he said it was amazing how much interesting stuff was in old books .   cohen struggled up alongside him .      what exactly you plannin     teach .     he said .   mr .  saveloy squinted at hunghung  just visible on the dusty horizon .      do you see that hill behind the city .     he said .     the huge round mound .         looks like my dad   s burial mound to me     said cohen .      no  it must be a natural formation .  it   s far too big .  there   s some kind of pagoda on top  i see .  interesting .  perhaps  later  i shall take a closer look .      cohen peered at the big round hill .  it was a big round hill .  it wasn   t threatening him and it didn   t look valuable .  end of saga as far as he was concerned .  there were more pressing matters .      people appear to be entering and leaving the outer city     mr .  saveloy continued .     the siege is more a threat than a reality .  so getting inside should not be a problem .  of course  getting into the forbidden city itself will be a lot more difficult .         how about if we kill everyone .     said cohen .      a good idea  but impractical     said mr .  saveloy .     and liable to cause comment .  no  my current methodology is predicated on the fact that hunghung is some considerable way from the river yet has almost a million inhabitants .         predicated  yeah     said cohen .      and the local geography is quite wrong for artesian wells .         yeah     s what i thought           and yet there is no visible aqueduct  you notice .         no aqueduct  right     said cohen .     prob   ly flown to the rim for the summer .  some birds do that .         which rather leads me to doubt the saying that not even a mouse can get into the forbidden city     said mr .  saveloy  with just a trace of smugness .     i suspect a mouse could get into the forbidden city if it could hold its breath .         or ride on one of them invisible ducks     said cohen .      indeed .          the cart stopped .  the sack came off .  instead of the cheesegrater rincewind was secretly expecting  the view consisted of a couple of young  concerned faces .  one of them was female  but rincewind was relieved to see that she wasn   t pretty butterfly .  this one looked younger  and made rincewind think a little of potatoes .       how you are .     she said  in fractured but recognizable morporkian .     we are very sorry .  all better now .  we speak you in language of celestial city of ankh more pork .  language of freedom and progress .  language of one man  one vote .         yes     said rincewind .  a vision of ankh morpork   s patrician floated across his memory .  one man  one vote .  yes .     i   ve met him .  he   s definitely got the vote .  but           extra luck to the people   s endeavor .     said the boy .     advance judiciously .     he looked as though he   d been built with bricks .      excuse me     said rincewind     but why did you   a paper lantern for ceremonial purposes   bale of cotton   rescue me .  uh  that is  when i say rescue  i suppose i mean  why did you hit me on the head  tie me up  and bring me to wherever this is .  because the worst that could have happened to me in the inn was a ding around the ear for not paying for lunch           the worst that would have happened was an agonizing death over several years     said the voice of butterfly .  she appeared around the cart and smiled grimly at rincewind .  her hands were tucked demurely in her kimono  presumably to hide the knives .      oh .  hello     he said .      great wizard     said butterfly  bowing .     i you already know  but these two are lotus blossom and three yoked oxen  other members of our cadre .  we had to bring you here like this .  there are spies everywhere .         timely demise to all enemies .     said the boy  beaming .      good  yes  right     said rincewind .     all enemies  yes .      the cart was in a courtyard .  the general noise level on the other side of the very high walls suggested a large city .  nasty certainty crystallized .      and you   ve brought me to hunghung  haven   t you .     he said .   lotus blossom   s eyes widened .      then it are true     she said  in rincewind   s own language .     you are the great wizard .         oh  you   d be amazed at the things i can foresee     said rincewind despondently .      you two  go and stable the horses     said butterfly  not taking her eyes off rincewind .  when they   d hurried away  with several backward glances  she walked up to him .      they believe     she said .     personally  i have my doubts .  but ly tin wheedle says an ass may do the work of an ox in a time of no horses .  one of his less convincing aphorisms  i   ve always thought .         thank you .  what is a cadre .         have you heard of the red army .         no .  well   i heard someone shout something           according to legend  an unknown person known only as the great wizard led the first red army to an impossible victory .  of course  that was thousands of years ago .  but the people believe that he   that is  you   will return to do it again .  so   there should be a red army ready and waiting .         well  of course  a man can get a little stiff after several thousand years        her face was suddenly level with his own .      personally i suspect there has been a misunderstanding     she hissed .     but now you   re here you   ll be a great wizard .  if i have to prod you every step of the way .      the other two returned .  butterfly went from snarling tiger to demure doe in an instant .      and now you must come and meet the red army     she said .      won   t they be a little smelly       rincewind began  and stopped when he saw her expression .      the original red army was clearly only a legend     she said  in fast and faultless ankh morporkian .     but legends have their uses .  you   d better know the legend   great wizard .  when one sun mirror was fighting all the armies of the world the great wizard came to his aid and the earth itself rose up and fought for the new empire .  and lightning was involved .  the army was made from the earth but in some way driven by the lightning .  now  lightning may kill but i suspect it lacks discipline .  and earth cannot fight .  but no doubt our army of the earth and sky was nothing more nor less than an uprising of the peasants themselves .  well  now we have a new army  and a name that fires the imagination .  and a great wizard .  i don   t believe in legends .  but i believe that other people believe .      the younger girl  who had been trying to follow this  stepped forward and gripped his arm .      you come seeing red army now     she said .      forward motion with masses .     said the boy  taking rincewind   s other arm .      does he always talk like that .     said rincewind  as he was propelled gently towards a door .      three yoked oxen does not study     said the girl .      extra success attend our leaders .            tuppence a bucket  well stamped down .        said rincewind encouragingly .      much ownership of means of production .            how   s your granny off for soap .         three yoked oxen beamed .   butterfly opened the door .  that left rincewind outside with the other two .      very useful slogans     he said  moving sideways just a little .     but i would draw your attention to the famous saying of the great wizard rincewind .         indeed  i am all ear     said lotus blossom politely .      rincewind  he say   goodbyeeeeeeeee        his sandals skidded on the cobbles but he was already traveling fast when he hit the doors  which turned out to be made of bamboo and smashed apart easily .   there was a street market on the other side .  that was something rincewind remembered later about hunghung  as soon as there was a space  any kind of space  even the space created by the passage of a cart or a mule  people flowed into it  usually arguing with one another at the tops of their voices over the price of a duck which was being held upside down and quacking .   his foot went through a wicker cage containing several chickens  but he pressed on  scattering people and produce .  in an ankh morpork street market something like this would have caused some comment  but since everyone around him already seemed to be screaming into other people   s faces rincewind was merely a momentary and unremarked nuisance as he half ran  half limped with one squawking foot past the stalls .   behind him  the people flowed back .  there may have been some cries of pursuit  but they were lost in the hubbub .   he didn   t stop until he found an overlooked alcove between a stall selling songbirds and another purveying something that bubbled in bowls .  his foot crowed .   he smashed it against cobbles until the cage broke  the cockerel  maddened by the heady air of freedom  pecked him on the knee and fluttered away .   there were no sounds of pursuit .  however  a battalion of trolls in tin boots would have had trouble making themselves heard above a normal hunghung street market .   he let himself get his breath back .   well  he was his own man again .  so much for the red army .  admittedly he was in the capital city  where he didn   t want to be  and it was only a matter of time before something else unpleasant happened to him  but it wasn   t actually happening at the moment .  let him find his bearings and five minutes    start and they could watch his dust .  or mud .  there was a lot of both  here .   so   this was hunghung     there didn   t seem to be streets in the sense rincewind understood the term .  alleys opened on to alleys  all of them narrow and made narrower by the stalls that lined them .  there was a large animal population in the marketplace .  most of the stalls had their share of caged chickens  ducks in sacks  and strange wriggling things in bowls .  from one stall a tortoise on top of a struggling heap of other tortoises under a sign saying   r .  each  good for ying gave rincewind a slow     you think you   ve got troubles .     look .   but it was hard to tell where the stalls ended and the buildings began in any case .  dried up things hanging on a string might be merchandise or someone   s washing or quite possibly next week   s dinner .   the hunghungese were an outdoor kind of people  from the look of it  they conducted most of their lives on the street and at the top of their voice .   progress was made by viciously elbowing and shoving people until they got out of the way .  standing still and saying     er  excuse me    was a recipe for immobility .   the crowds did part  though  at the banging of a gong and a succession of loud    pops .     a group of people in white robes danced past  throwing fireworks around and banging on gongs  saucepans and odd bits of metal .  the din contrived to be louder than the street noise  but only by very great effort .   rincewind had been getting the occasional puzzled glance from people who stopped screaming long enough to notice him .  perhaps it was time to act like a native .   he turned to the nearest person and screamed     pretty good  eh .      the person  a little old lady in a straw hat  stared at him in distaste .      it   s mr .  whu   s funeral     she snapped  and walked off .   there were a couple of soldiers nearby .  if this had been ankh morpork  then they   d have been sharing a cigarette and trying not to see anything that might upset them .  but these had an alert look .   rincewind backed into another alley .  an untutored visitor could clearly find himself in big trouble here .   this alley was quieter and  at the far end  opened into something much wider and empty looking .  on the basis that people also meant trouble  rincewind headed in that direction .   here  at last  was an open space .  it was very open indeed .  it was a paved square  big enough to hold a couple of armies .  it had cherry trees growing along the verges .  and  given the heaving mob everywhere else  a surprising absence of anyone        you .         apart from the soldiers .   they appeared abruptly from behind every tree and statue .   rincewind tried to back away  but that proved unfortunate since there was a guard behind him .   a terrifying armored mask confronted him .      peasant .  do you not know this is the imperial square .         was that a capital s on square  please .     said rincewind .      you do not ask questions .         ah .  i   ll take that as a    yes .     so it   s important  then .  sorry .  i   ll just sort of go away  then           you stay .      but what struck rincewind as amazingly odd was that none of them actually took hold of him .  and then he realized that this must be because they hardly ever needed to .  people did what they were told .   there   s something worse than whips in the empire  cohen had said .   at this point  he realized  he should be on his knees .  he crouched down  hands placed lightly in front of him .      i wonder     he said brightly  rising into the starting position     if this is the time to draw your attention to a famous saying .         cohen was familiar with city gates .  he   d broken down a number in his time  by battering ram  siege gun  and on one occasion with his head .   but the gates of hunghung were pretty damn good gates .  they weren   t like the gates of ankh morpork  which were usually wide open to attract the spending customer and whose concession to defense was the sign    thank you for not attacking our city .  bonum diem .     these things were big and made of metal and there was a guardhouse and a squad of unhelpful men in black armor .      teach .         yes  cohen .         why   re we doing this .  i thought we were going to use the invisible duck the mice use .      mr .  saveloy waggled a finger .      that   s for the forbidden city itself .  i hope we   ll find that inside .  now  remember your lessons     he said .     it   s important that you all learn how to behave in cities .         i know how to bloody well behave in cities     said truckle the uncivil .     pillage  ravish  loot  set fire to the damn place on your way out .  just like towns only it takes longer .         that   s all very well if you   re just passing through     said mr .  saveloy     but what if you want to come back next day .         it ain   t bloody well there next day  mister .         gentlemen .  bear with me .  you will have to learn the ways of civilization .      people couldn   t just walk through .  there was a line .  and the guards gathered rather offensively around each cowering visitor to examine their papers .   and then it was cohen   s turn .      papers  old man .      cohen nodded happily  and handed the guard captain a piece of paper on which was written  in mr .  saveloy   s best handwriting      we are wandering madmen who have no papers .  sorry .      the guard   s gaze lifted from the paper and met cohen   s cheerful grin .      indeed     he said nastily .     can   t you speak  grandfather .      cohen  still grinning  looked questioningly at mr .  saveloy .  they hadn   t rehearsed this part .      foolish dummy     said the guard .   mr .  saveloy looked outraged .      i thought you were supposed to show special consideration for the insane .     he said .      you cannot be insane without papers to say you   re insane     said the guard .      oh  i   m fed up with this     said cohen .     i said it wouldn   t work if we came across a thick guard .         insolent peasant .         i   m not as insolent as my friends here     said cohen .   the horde nodded .      that   s us  flatfoot .         bum to you .         whut .         extremely foolish soldier .         whut .      the captain was taken aback .  deeply ingrained in the agatean psyche was the habit of obedience .  but even stronger was a veneration of one   s ancestors and a respect for the elderly  and the captain had never seen anyone so elderly while still vertical .  they practically were ancestors .  the one in the wheelchair certainly smelled like one .      take them to the guardhouse .     he shouted .   the horde let themselves be manhandled  and did it quite well .  mr .  saveloy had spent hours training them in this  since he knew he was dealing with men whose response to a tap on the shoulder was to turn around and hack off someone   s arm .   it was crowded in the guardhouse  with the horde and the guards and with mad hamish   s wheelchair .  one of the guards looked down at hamish  glowering under his blanket .      what do you have there  grandfather .      a sword came up through the cloth and stabbed the guard in the thigh .      whut .  whut .  whutzeesay .         he said     aargh .      hamish     said cohen  a knife appearing in his hand .  with one movement his skinny arms had the captain in a lock  the knife at his throat .      whut .         he said     aargh .            whut .  i ain   t even married .      cohen put a little more pressure on the captain   s neck .      now then  friend     he said .     you can have it the easy way  see  or the hard way .  it   s up to you .         blood sucking pig .  you call this the easy way .         well  i ain   t sweatin    .         may you live in interesting times .  i would rather die than betray my emperor .         fair enough .      it took the captain only a fraction of a second to realize that cohen  being a man of his word  assumed that other people were too .  he might  if he had time  have reflected that the purpose of civilization is to make violence the final resort  while to a barbarian it is the first  preferred  only and above all most enjoyable option .  but by then it was too late .  he slumped forward .      i always lives in interestin    times     said cohen  in the satisfied voice of someone who did a lot to keep them interesting .   he pointed his knife at the other guards .  mr .  saveloy   s mouth was wide open in horror .      by rights i should be cleanin    this     said cohen .     but i ain   t goin    to bother if it   s only goin    to get dirty again .  now  person   ly  i   d as soon kill you as look at you but teach here says i   ve got to stop doin    that and become respectable .      one of the guards looked sideways at his fellows and then fell on his knees .      what is your wish  o master .     he said .      ah  officer material     said cohen .     what   s your name  lad .         nine orange trees  master .      cohen looked at mr .  saveloy .      what do i do now .         take them prisoner  please .         how do i do that .         well   i suppose you tie them up  that sort of thing .         ah .  and then cut their throats .         no .  no .  you see  once you   ve got them at your mercy  you   re not allowed to kill them .      the silver horde  to a man  stared at the ex teacher .      i   m afraid that   s civilization for you     he added .      but you said the sods haven   t got any bloody weapons .     said truckle .      yes     said mr .  saveloy  shuddering a little .     that   s why you   re not allowed to kill them .         are you mad .  got mad papers  have you .      cohen scratched his stubbly chin .  the remainder of the guard watched him in trepidation .  they were used to cruel and unusual punishment  but they were unaccustomed to argument first .      you haven   t had a tot of military experience  have you  teach .     he said .      apart from form four .  not a lot .  but i   m afraid this is the way it has to be done .  i   m sorry .  you did say you wanted me           well  i vote we just cuts their throats right now     said boy willie .     i can   t be having with this prisoner business either .  i mean  who   s gonna feed them .         i   m afraid you have to .         who  me .  not likely .  i vote we make them eat their own eyeballs .  hands up all in favor .      there was a chorus of assent from the horde and  among the raised hands  cohen noticed one belonging to nine orange trees .      what you voting for  lad .     he said .      please  sir  i would like to go to the lavatory .         you listen to me  you lot     said cohen .     this slaughtering and butchering business isn   t how you do it these days  right .  that   s what mr .  saveloy says and he knows how to spell words like    marmalade    which is more than you do .  now  we know why we   re here  and we   d better start as we mean to go on .         yeah  but you just killed that guard     said truckle .      i   m breaking myself in     said cohen .     you   ve got to creep up on civilization a bit at a time .         i still say we should cut their heads off .  that   s what i did to the mad demon sucking priests of ee .      the kneeling guard had cautiously raised his hand again .      please  master .         yes  lad .         you could lock us up in that cell over there .  then we wouldn   t be any trouble to anyone .         good thinking     said cohen .     good lad .  the boy keeps his head in a crisis .  lock    em up .      thirty seconds later the horde had limped off  into the city .   the guards sat in the cramped  hot cell .   eventually one said     what were they .         i think they might have been ancestors .         i thought you had to be dead to be an ancestor .         the one in the wheelchair looked dead .  right up to the point where he stabbed four white fox .         should we shout for help .         they might hear us .         yes  but if we don   t get let out we   ll be stuck in here .  and the walls are very thick and the door is very strong .         good .         rincewind stopped running in some alley somewhere .  he hadn   t bothered to see if they   d followed him .  it was true   here  with one mighty bound  you could be free .  provided you realized it was one of your options .   freedom did  of course  include man   s age old right to starve to death .  it seemed a long time since his last proper meal .   the voice erupted further down the alley  as if on cue .      rice cakes .  rice cakes .  get chore nice rice cakes .  tea .  hundred year old eggs .  eggs .  get them while they   re nice and vintage .  get chore   yeah  what is it .      an elderly man had approached the salesman .      dibhala san .  this egg you sold me           what about it  venerable squire .         would you care to smell it .      the street vendor took a sniff .      ah  yes  lovely     he said .      lovely .  lovely .  this egg     said the customer     this egg is practically fresh .         hundred years old if it   s a day  shogun     said the vendor happily .     look at the color of that shell  nice and black           it rubs off .      rincewind listened .  there was  he thought  probably something in the idea that there were only a few people in the world .  there were lots of bodies  but only a few people .  that   s why you kept running into the same ones .  there was probably some mold somewhere .      you saying my produce is fresh .  may i disembowel myself honorably .  look  i   ll tell you what i   ll do        yes  there seemed to be something familiar and magical about that trader .  someone had come to complain about a fresh egg  and yet within a couple of minutes he   d somehow been talked into forgetting this and purchasing two rice cakes and something strange wrapped in leaves .   the rice cakes looked nice .  well   nicer than the other things .   rincewind sidled over .  the trader was idly jigging from one foot to the other and whistling under his breath  but he stopped and gave rincewind a big  honest  friendly grin .      nice ancient egg  shogun .      the bowl in the middle of the tray was full of gold coins .  rincewind   s heart sank .  the price of one of mr .  dibhala   s foul eggs would have bought a street in ankh morpork .      i suppose you don   t give   credit .     he suggested .   dibhala gave him a look .      i   ll pretend i never heard that  shogun     he said .      tell me     said rincewind .     do you know if you have any relatives overseas .      this got him another look   a sideways one  full of sudden appraisal .      what .  there   s nothing but evil blood sucking ghosts beyond the seas .  everyone knows that  shogun .  i   m surprised you don   t .         ghosts .     said rincewind .      trying to get here  do us harm     said disembowel meself honorably .     maybe even steal our merchandise .  give    em a dose of the old firecracker  that   s what i say .  they don   t like a good loud bang  ghosts .      he gave rincewind another look  even longer and more calculating .      where you from  shogun .     he asked  and his voice suddenly had the little barbed edge of suspicion .      bes pelargic     said rincewind quickly .     that explains my strange accent and mannerisms that might otherwise lead people to think i was some sort of foreigner     he added .      oh  bes pelargic     said disembowel meself honorably .     well  in that case  i expect you know my old friend five tongs who lives in the street of heavens  yes .      rincewind was ready for this old trick .      no     he said .     never heard of him  never heard of the street .      disembowel meself honorably dibhala grinned happily .     if i yell    foreign devil    loud enough you won   t get three steps     he said in conversational tones .     the guards will drag you off to the forbidden city where there   s this special thing they do with           i   ve heard about it     said rincewind .      five tongs has been the district commissioner for three years and the street of heavens is the main street     said disembowel meself honorably .     i   ve always wanted to meet a blood sucking foreign ghost .  have a rice cake .      rincewind   s gaze darted this way and that .  but strangely enough the situation didn   t seem dangerous  or at least inevitably dangerous .  it seemed that danger was negotiable .      supposing i was to admit i was from behind the wall .     he said  keeping his voice as low as possible .   dibhala nodded .  one hand reached into his robe and  in a quick movement  revealed and then concealed the corner of something which rincewind was not entirely surprised to see was entitled what i did        some people say that beyond the wall there   s nothing but deserts and burning wastes and evil ghosts and terrible monsters     said dibhala     but i say  what about the merchandizing opportunities .  a man with the right contacts   know what i mean  shogun .  he could go a long way in the land of blood sucking ghosts .      rincewind nodded .  he didn   t like to point out that if you turned up in ankh morpork with a handful of gold then about three hundred people would turn up with a handful of steel .      the way i see it  what with all this uncertainty about the emperor and talk of rebels and that   long live his excellency the son of heaven  of course   there might just be a nitch for the open minded trader  am i right .         nitch .         nitch .  like   we   ve got this stuff      he leaned closer      comes out of a caterpillar   s  unidentified pictogram  .     s called   silk .  it   s           yes  i know .  we get it from klatch     said rincewind .      or  well  there   s this bush  see  you dry the leaves  but then you put it in hot water and you drin           tea  yes     said rincewind .     that comes from howondaland .      d .  m .  h .  dibhala looked taken aback .      well   we   ve got this powder  you put it in tubes           fireworks .  got fireworks .         how about this really fine china  it   s so           in ankh morpork we   ve got dwarfs that can make china you can read a book through     said rincewind .     even if it   s got tiny footnotes in it .      dibhala frowned .      sounds like you are very clever blood sucking ghosts     he said  backing away .     maybe it   s true and you are dangerous .         us .  don   t worry about us     said rincewind .     we hardly ever kill foreigners in ankh morpork .  it makes it so hard to sell them things afterwards .         what   ve we got that you want  though .  go on  have a rice cake .  on the pagoda .  wanna try some pork balls .  onna chopstick .      rincewind selected a cake .  he didn   t like to ask about the other stuff .      you   ve got gold     he said .      oh  gold .  it   s too soft to do much with     said dibhala .     it   s all right for pipes and putting on roofs  though .         oh   i daresay people in ankh morpork could find a use for some     said rincewind .  his gaze returned to the coins in dibhala   s tray .   a land where gold was as cheap as lead        what   s that .     he said  pointing to a crumpled rectangle half covered with coins .   d .  m .  h .  dibhala looked down .     it   s this thing we have here     he said  speaking slowly .     of course  it   s probably all new to you .  it   s called mon ey .  it   s a way of carrying around your           i meant the bit of paper     said rincewind .      so did i     said dibhala .     that   s a ten rhinu note .         what does that mean .     said rincewind .      means what it says     said dibhala .     means it   s worth ten of these .     he held up a gold coin about the size of a rice cake .      why   d you want to buy a piece of paper .     said rincewind .      you don   t buy it  it   s for buying things with     said dibhala .   rincewind looked blank .      you go to a mark et stall     said dibhala  getting back into the slow voice for the hard of thinking     and you say     good morn ing  but cher  how much for those dog noses .     and he says     three rhinu  shogun     and you say     i   ve only got a pony  okay .      look  there   s an etch ing of a pony on it  see  that   s what you get on ten rhinu notes  and he gives you the dog noses and seven coins in what we call    change .     now  if you had a monkey  that   s fifty rhinu  he   d say    got anything smal ler .     and           but it   s only a bit of paper .     rincewind wailed .      it may be a bit of paper to you but it   s ten rice cakes to me     said dibhala .     what do you foreign blood suckers use .  big stones with holes in them .      rincewind stared at the paper money .   there were dozens of papermills in ankh morpork  and some of the craftsmen in the engravers    guild could engrave their name and address on a pinhead .   he suddenly felt immensely proud of his countrymen .  they might be venal and greedy  but by heaven they were good at it and they never assumed that there wasn   t any more to learn .      i think you   ll find     he said     that there   s a lot of buildings in ankh morpork that need new roofs .         really .     said dibhala .      oh  yes .  the rain   s just pouring in .         and people can pay .  only i heard        rincewind looked at the paper money again .  he shook his head .  worth more than gold        they   ll pay with notes at least as good as that     he said .     probably even better .  i   ll put in a good word for you .  and now     he added hurriedly     which way is out .      dibhala scratched his head .      could be a bit tricky     he said .     there   s armies outside .  you look a bit foreign with that hat .  could be tricky        there was a commotion further along the alley or  rather  a general increase in the commotion .  the crowd parted in that hurried way common to unarmed crowds in the presence of weaponry  and a group of guards hurried towards disembowel meself honorably .   he stepped back and gave them the friendly grin of one happy to sell at a discount to anyone with a knife .   a limp figure was being dragged between two of the guards .  as it went past it raised a slightly bloodstained head and said     extended duration to the       before a gloved fist smacked across its mouth .   and then the guards were heading down the street .  the crowd flowed back .      tch  tch     said d .  m .  h .     seems to be   hello .  where   d you go .      rincewind reappeared from around a corner .  d .  m .  h .  looked impressed .  there had actually been a small thunderclap when rincewind moved .      see they got another of    em     he said .     putting up wall posters again  i expect .         another one of who .     said rincewind .      red army .  huh .         oh .         i don   t pay much attention     said d .  m .  h .     they say some old legend   s going to come true about emperors and stuff .  can   t see it myself .         he didn   t look very legendary     said rincewind .      ach  some people will believe anything .         what   ll happen to him .         difficult to say  with the emperor about to die .  hands and feet cut off  probably .         what .  why .            cos he   s young .  that   s leniency .  a bit older and it   s his head on a spike over one of the gates .         that   s punishment for putting up a poster .         stops    em doing it again  see     said d .  m .  h .  rincewind backed away .      thank you     he said  and hurried off .      oh  no     he said  pushing his way through the crowds .     i   m not getting mixed up in people   s heads getting chopped off        and then someone hit him again .  but politely .   as he sank to his knees  and then to his chin  he wondered what had happened to the good old fashioned    hey  you .         the silver horde wandered through the alleys of hunghung .      i don   t call this bloody well sweeping through a city  slaughtering every bugger     muttered truckle .     when i was riding with bruce the hoon  we never walked in through a front gate like a bunch of soppy mother           mr .  uncivil     said mr .  saveloy hurriedly     i wonder if this might be a good time to refer you to that list i drew up for you .         what bloody list .     said truckle  sticking out his jaw belligerently .      the list of acceptable civilized words  yes .     he turned to the others .     remember i was telling you about civ il ized be hav ior .  civilized behavior is vital to our long term strategy .         what   s a long term strategy .     said caleb the ripper .      it   s what we   re going to do later     said cohen .      and what   s that  then .         it   s the plan     said cohen .      well  i   ll be f       truckle began .      the list  mr .  uncivil  only the words on the list     snapped mr .  saveloy .     listen  i bow to your expertise when it comes to crossing wilderness  but this is civilization and you must use the right words .  please .         better do what he says  truckle     said cohen .   with bad grace  truckle fished a grubby piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolded it .         dang    .     he said .     wassat mean .  and what   s this    darn    and    heck    .         they are   civilized swearwords     said mr .  saveloy .      well  you can take    em and           ah .     said mr .  saveloy  raising a cautionary finger .      you can shove them up           ah .         you can           ah .      truckle shut his eyes and clenched his fists .      dang it all to heck .     he shouted .      good     said mr .  saveloy .     that   s much better .      he turned to cohen  who was grinning happily at truckle   s discomfort .      cohen     he said     there   s an apple stall over there .  do you fancy an apple .         yeah  might do     cohen conceded  in the cautious manner of someone giving a conjuror his watch while remaining aware that the man is grinning and holding a hammer .      right .  now  then  cla   i mean  gentlemen .  ghenghiz wants an apple .  there   s a stall over there selling fruit and nuts .  what does he do .     mr .  saveloy looked hopefully at his charges .     anyone .  yes .         easy .  you kill that little      there was a rustle of unfolding paper again      chap behind the stall  then           no  mr .  uncivil .  anyone else .         whut .         you set fire to           no  mr .  vincent .  anyone else    .         you rape           no  no  mr .  ripper     said mr .  saveloy .     we take out some muh   muh    .     he looked at them expectantly .         money       chorused the horde .         and we   what do we do .  now  we   ve gone through this hundreds of times .  we        this was the difficult bit .  the horde   s lined faces creased and puckered still further as they tried to force their minds out of the chasms of habit .      gi    .     said cohen hesitantly .  mr .  saveloy gave him a big smile and a nod of encouragement .      give .    it   to       cohen   s lips tensed around the word       him .         yes .  well done .  in exchange for the apple .  we   ll talk about making change and saying    thank you    later on  when you   re ready for it .  now then  cohen  here   s the coin .  off you go .      cohen wiped his forehead .  he was beginning to sweat .      how about if i just cut him up a bit           no .  this is civilization .      cohen nodded uncomfortably .  he threw back his shoulders and walked over to the stall  where the apple merchant  who had been eying the group suspiciously  nodded at him .   cohen   s eyes glazed and his lips moved silently  as if he were rehearsing a script .  then he said      ho  fat merchant  give me all your   one apple   and i will give you   this coin        he looked around .  mr .  saveloy had his thumb up .      you want an apple  is that it .     said the apple merchant .      yes .      the apple merchant selected one .  cohen   s sword had been hidden in the wheelchair again but the merchant  in response to some buried acknowledgement  made sure it was a good apple .  then he took the coin .  this proved a little difficult  since his customer seemed loath to let go of it .      come on  hand it over  venerable one     he said .   seven crowded seconds passed .   then  when they were safely around the corner  mr .  saveloy said     now  everyone  who can tell me what ghenghiz did wrong .         didn   t say please .         whut .         no .         didn   t say thank you .         whut .         no .         hit the man over the head with a melon and thumped him into the strawberries and kicked him in the nuts and set fire to his stall and stole all the money .         whut .         correct .     mr .  saveloy sighed .     ghenghiz  you were doing so well up to then .         he didn   t ort to have called me what he did .         but    venerable    means old and wise  ghenghiz .         oh .  does it .         yes .         we ell   i did leave him the money for the apple .         yes  but  you see  i do believe you took all his other money .         but i paid for the apple     said cohen  rather testily .   mr .  saveloy sighed .     ghenghiz  i do rather get the impression that several thousand years of the patient development of fiscal propriety have somewhat passed you by .         come again .         it is possible sometimes for money to legitimately belong to other people     said mr .  saveloy patiently .   the horde paused to wrap their minds around this  too .  it was  of course  something they knew to be true in theory .  merchants always had money .  but it seemed wrong to think of it as belonging to them  it belonged to whoever took it off them .  merchants didn   t actually own it  they were just looking after it until it was needed .      now  there is an elderly lady over there selling ducks     said mr .  saveloy .     i think the next stage   mr .  willie  i am not over there  i am sure whatever you are looking at is very interesting  but please pay attention   is to practice our grasp of social intercourse .         hur  hur  hur     said caleb the ripper .      i mean  mr .  ripper  that you should go and enquire how much it would be for a duck     said mr .  saveloy .      hur  hur  hur   what .         and you are not to rip all her clothes off .  that   s not civilized .      caleb scratched his head .  flakes fell out .      well  what else am i supposed to do .         er   engage her in conversation .         eh .  what   s there to talk about with a woman .      mr .  saveloy hesitated again .  to some extent this was unknown territory to him as well .  his experience with women at his last school had been limited to an occasional chat with the housekeeper  and on one occasion the matron had let him put his hand on her knee .  he had been forty before he found out that oral sex didn   t mean talking about it .  women had always been to him strange and distant and wonderful creatures rather than  as the horde to a man believed  something to do .  he was struggling a little .      the weather .     he hazarded .  his memory threw in vague recollections of the staple conversation of the maiden aunt who had brought him up .     her health .  the trouble with young people today .         and then i rip her clothes off .         possibly .  eventually .  if she wants you to .  i might draw your attention to the discussion we had the other day about taking regular baths      or even a bath  he added to himself      and attention to fingernails and hair and changing your clothes more often .         this is leather     said caleb .     you don   t have to change it  it don   t rot for years .      once again mr .  saveloy readjusted his sights .  he   d thought that civilization could be overlaid on the horde like a veneer .  he had been mistaken .   but the funny thing   he mused  as the horde watched caleb   s painful attempts at conversation with a representative of half the world   s humanity   was that although they were as far away as possible from the kind of people he normally mixed with in staffrooms  or possibly because they were as far away as possible from the kind of people he normally mixed with in staffrooms  he actually liked them .  every one of them saw a book as either a lavatorial accessory or a set of portable firefighters and thought that hygiene was a greeting .  yet they were honest  from their specialized point of view  and decent  from their specialized point of view  and saw the world as hugely simple .  they stole from rich merchants and temples and kings .  they didn   t steal from poor people  this was not because there was anything virtuous about poor people  it was simply because poor people had no money .   and although they didn   t set out to give the money away to the poor  that was nevertheless what they did  if you accepted that the poor consisted of innkeepers  ladies of negotiable virtue  pickpockets  gamblers  and general hangers on   because although they would go to great lengths to steal money they then had as much control over it as a man trying to herd cats .  it was there to be spent and lost .  so they kept the money in circulation  always a praiseworthy thing in any society .   they never worried about what other people thought .  mr .  saveloy  who   d spent his whole life worrying about what other people thought and had been passed over for promotion and generally treated as a piece of furniture as a result  found this strangely attractive .  and they never agonized about anything  or wondered if they were doing the right thing .  and they enjoyed themselves immensely .  they had a kind of honor .  he liked the horde .  they weren   t his kind of people .   caleb returned  looking unusually thoughtful .      congratulations  mr .  ripper .     said mr .  saveloy  a great believer in positive reinforcement .     she still appears to be fully clothed .         yeah  what   d she say .     said boy willie .      she smiled at me     said caleb .  he scratched his crusty beard uneasily .     a bit  anyway     he added .      good     said mr .  saveloy .      she  er   she said she   d   she wouldn   t mind seein    me   later           well done .         er   teach .  what   s a shave .      saveloy explained .   caleb listened carefully  grimacing occasionally .  he turned round occasionally to look at the duck seller  who gave him a little wave .      cor     he said .     er .  i dunno       he looked around again .     never seen a woman who wasn   t running away before .         oh  women are like deer     said cohen loftily .     you can   t just charge in  you gotta stalk    em           hur  hur  h   sorry     said caleb  catching mr .  saveloy   s stern eye .      i think perhaps we should end the lesson here     said mr .  saveloy .     we don   t want to get you too civilized  do we    .  i suggest we take a stroll around the forbidden city  yes .      they   d all seen it .  it dominated the center of hunghung .  its walls were forty feet high .      there   s a lot of soldiers guarding the gates     said cohen .      so they should .  a great treasure lies within     said mr .  saveloy .  he didn   t raise his eyes  though .  he seemed to be staring intently at the ground  as though searching for something he   d lost .      why don   t we just rush up and kill the guards .     caleb demanded .  he was still feeling a bit shaken .      whut .         don   t be daft     said cohen .     it   d take all day .  anyway     he added  feeling a little proud despite himself     teach here is goin    to get us in on an invisible duck  ain   t that so  teach .      mr .  saveloy stopped .      ah .  eureka     he said .      that   s ephebian  that is     cohen told the horde .     it means    give me a towel .            oh  yeah     said caleb  who had been surreptitiously trying to untangle the knots in his beard .     and when were you ever in ephebe .         went bounty hunting there once .         who for .         you  i think .         hah .  did you find me .         dunno .  nod your head and see if it falls off .         ah .  gentlemen   behold        mr .  saveloy   s orthopaedic sandal was prodding an ornamental metal square in the ground .      behold what .     said truckle .      whut .         we should look for more of these     said mr .  saveloy .     but i think we have it .  all we need to do now is wait until dark .         there was an argument going on .  all rincewind could make out were the voices  another sack had been tied over his head  while he himself was tied to a pillar .      does he even look like a great wizard .         that   s what it says on his hat in the language of ghosts           so you say .         what about the testimony of four big sandal  then .         he was overtaxed .  he could have imagined it .         i did not .  he came out of thin air  flying like a dragon .  he knocked over five soldiers .  and three maximum luck saw it also .  and the others .  and then he freed an ancient man and turned him into a mighty fighting warrior .         and he can speak our language  just as it says in the book .         all right .  supposing he is the great wizard .  then we should kill him now .      in the darkness of his sack  rincewind shook his head furiously .      why .         he will be on the side of the emperor .         but the legend says the great wizard led the red army .         yes  for emperor one sun mirror .  it crushed the people .         no  it crushed all the bandit chiefs .  then it built the empire .         so .  the empire is so great .  untimely demise to the forces of oppression .         but now the red army is on the side of the people .  maximum advancement with the great wizard .         the great wizard is the enemy of the people .         i saw him  i tell you .  a legion of soldiers collapsed with the wind of his passage .      the wind of his passage was beginning to worry rincewind as well .  it always tended to when he was frightened .      if he is such a great wizard  why is he still tied up .  why has he not made his bonds disappear in puffs of green smoke .         perhaps he is saving his magic for some even mightier deeds .  he wouldn   t do firecracker tricks for earthworms .         hah .         and he had the book .  he was looking for us .  it is his destiny to lead the red army .      shake  shake  shake .      we can lead ourselves .      nod  nod  nod .      we don   t need any suspicious great wizards from illusionary places .      nod  nod  nod .      so we should kill him now .      nod  no   shakeshakeshake .      hah .  he laughs at you with scorn .  he waits to make your head explode with snakes of fire .      shake  shake  shake .      you do know that while we   re arguing three yoked oxen is being tortured .         the people   s army is more than just individuals  lotus blossom .      in the fetid sack rincewind grimaced .  he was already beginning to take a dislike to the first speaker  as one naturally does with people urging that you be put to death without delay .  but when that sort of person started talking about things being more important than people  you knew you were in big trouble .      i   m sure the great wizard could rescue three yoked oxen     said a voice by his ear .  it was butterfly .      yes  he could easily rescue three yoked oxen .     said lotus blossom .      hah .  you say .  he could get into the forbidden city .  impossible .  it   s certain death .      nod  nod  nod .      not to the great wizard     said the voice of butterfly .      shut up .     hissed rincewind .      would you like to know how big the meat cleaver is that two fire herb is holding in his hand .     whispered butterfly .      no .         it   s very big .         he said that going into the forbidden city is certain death .         no .  it   s only probable death .  i assure you  if you run away from me again that is certain death .      the sack was pulled away .   the face immediately in front of him was that of lotus blossom  and a man could see a lot worse things with his daylight than her face  which made him think of cream and masses of butter and just the right amount of salt .    one of the things he might see  for example  was the face of two fire herb .  this was not a nice face .  it was podgy and had tiny little pupils in its eyes  and looked like a living example of the fact that although the people could be oppressed by kings and emperors and mandarins  the job could often be done just as well by the man next door .      great wizard .  hah .     two fire herb said now .      he can do it .     said lotus blossom  and cream cheese  thought rincewind  and maybe coleslaw on the side  .     he is the great wizard come back to us .  did he not guide the master through the lands of ghosts and blood sucking vampires .         oh  i wouldn   t say       rincewind began .      such a great wizard allowed you to bring him here in a sack .     said two fire herb  sneering .     let us see him do some conjuring           a truly great wizard would not stoop to doing party tricks .     said lotus blossom .      that   s right     said rincewind .     not stoop .         shame on herb to suggest such a thing .         shame     rincewind agreed .      besides  he will need all of his power to enter the forbidden city     said butterfly .  rincewind found himself hating the sound of her voice .      forbidden city     he murmured .      everyone knows there are terrible snares and traps and many  many guards .         snares  traps           why  if his magic should fail him because he did tricks for herb  he would find himself in the deepest dungeon  dying by inches .         inches   er   which particular inch           so much shame to two fire herb .      rincewind gave her a sickly grin .      actually     he said     i   m not that great .  i   m a bit great     he added quickly  as butterfly began to frown     but not very great           the writings of the master say that you defeated many powerful enchanters and resolutely succeeded in dangerous situations .      rincewind nodded glumly .  it was more or less true .  but most of the time he hadn   t intended to .  whereas the forbidden city had looked   well   forbidden .  it didn   t look inviting .  it didn   t look as though it sold postcards .  the only souvenir they were likely to give you would be  perhaps  your teeth .  in a bag .      er   i expect this oxen lad is in some deep dungeon  yes .         the deepest     said two fire herb .      and   you   ve never seen anyone again .  who   s been taken prisoner  i mean .         we have seen bits of them     said lotus blossom .      usually their heads     said two fire herb .     on spikes over the gates .         but not three yoked oxen     said lotus blossom firmly .     the great wizard has spoken .         actually  i   m not sure i actually said           you have spoken     said butterfly firmly .   as rincewind got accustomed to the gloom he realized that he was in some storeroom or cellar  the noise of the city came  rather muffled  from grilles near the ceiling .  it was half full of barrels and bundles  and every one of them was a perch for someone .  the room was crowded .   the people were watching him with expressions of rapt attention  but that wasn   t the only thing they had in common .   rincewind turned right around .      who are all these children .     he said .      this     said lotus blossom     is the hunghung cadre of the red army .      two fire herb snorted .      why did you tell him that .     he said .     now we may have to kill him .         but they   re all so young .         they may be underprivileged in years     said two fire herb     but they are ancient in courage and honor .         and experienced in fighting .     said rincewind hotly .     the guards i   ve seen do not look like nice people .  i mean  do you even have any weapons .         we will wrest the weapons we need from our enemies .     said two fire herb .  a cheer went up .      really .  how do you actually make them let go .     said rincewind .  he pointed to a very small girl  who leaned away from his digit as though it were loaded .  she looked about seven and was holding a toy rabbit .      what   s your name .         one favorite pearl  great wizard .         and what do you do in the red army .         i have earned a medal for putting up of wall posters  great wizard .         what   like    slightly bad things please happen to our enemies    .  that sort of thing .         er       said the girl  looking imploringly at butterfly .      rebellion is not easy for us     said the older girl .     we don   t have   experience .         well  i   m here to tell you that you don   t do it by singing songs and putting up posters and fighting bare handed     said rincewind .     not when you   re up against real people with real weapons .  you       his voice trailed away as he realized that a hundred pairs of eyes were watching him intently  and two hundred ears were carefully listening .   he played back his own words in the echo chamber of his head .  he   d said     i   m here to tell you        he spread out his hands and waved them frantically .         that is  it   s not up to me to tell you anything     he said .      that is correct     said two fire herb .     we will overcome because history is on our side .         we will overcome because the great wizard is on our side     said butterfly sharply .      i   ll tell you this .     shouted rincewind .     i   d rather trust me than history .  oh  shit  did i just say that .         so you will help three yoked oxen     said butterfly .      please .     said lotus blossom .   rincewind looked at her  and the tears in the corners of her eyes  and the bunch of awed teenagers who really thought that you could beat an army by singing rousing songs .   there was only one thing he could do  if he really thought about it .   he could play along for now and then get the hell out of it at the very first opportunity .  butterfly   s anger was bad  but a spike was a spike .  of course  he   d feel a bit of a heel for a while  but that was the point .  he   d feel a heel  but he wouldn   t feel a spike .   the world had too many heroes and didn   t need another one .  whereas the world had only one rincewind and he owed it to the world to keep this one alive for as long as possible .      there was an inn .  there was a courtyard .  there was a corral  for the luggages .   there were large traveling trunks  big enough to carry the needs of an entire household for a fortnight .  there were merchant   s sample cases  mere square boxes on crude legs .  there were sleek overnight bags .   they shuffled aimlessly in their pen .  occasionally there was the rattle of a handle or the creak of a hinge  and once or twice the snap of a lid and the bonk bonk bonk of boxes trying to get out of the way .   three of them were big and covered with studded leather .  they looked the kind of travelling accessories that hang around outside cheap hotels and make suggestive remarks to handbags .   the object of their attention was a rather smaller trunk with an inlaid lid and dainty feet .  it had already backed into a corner as far as it could go .   a large spiked lid creaked open a couple of times as the largest of the boxes edged closer .   the smaller box had retreated so far its back legs were trying to climb the corral fence .   there was the sound of running feet on the other side of the courtyard wall .  they got closer  and then stopped abruptly .   then there was a twang such as would be made by an object landing on the taut roof of a cart .   for a moment  against the rising moon  there was the shape of something somersaulting slowly through the evening air .   it landed heavily in front of the three big chests  bounced upright  and charged .   eventually various travelers spilled out into the night but by then items of clothing were strewn and trampled around the courtyard .  three black chests  battered and scarred  were discovered on the roof  each one scrabbling on the tiles and butting the others in an effort to be the highest .  others had panicked and broken down the wall and headed out across the country .   eventually  all but one of them were found .      the horde were feeling quite proud of themselves when they sat down for dinner .  they acted  mr .  saveloy thought  rather like boys who   d just got their first pair of long trousers .   which they had done .  each man had one baggy pair of same  plus a long grey robe .      we   ve been shopping     said caleb proudly .     paying for things with money .  we   re dressed up like civilized people .         yes indeed     said mr .  saveloy indulgently .  he was hoping that they could all get through this without the horde finding out what kind of civilized people they were dressed up as .  as it was  the beards were a problem .  the kind of people who wore these kind of clothes in the forbidden city didn   t usually have beards .  they were proverbial for not having them .  actually  they were more properly proverbial for not having other things but  as a sort of consequence of this lack  also for not having beards .   cohen shifted .     itchy     he said .     this is pants  is it .  never worn    em before .  same with shirts .  what good   s a shirt that   s not chain mail .         we did very well  though     said caleb .  he had even had a shave  obliging the barber  for the first time in his experience  to use a chisel .  he kept rubbing his naked  baby pink chin .      yeah  we   re really civilized     said vincent .      except for the bit where you set fire to that shopkeeper     said boy willie .      nah  i only set fire to him a bit .         whut .         teach .         yes  cohen .         why did you tell that firework merchant that everyone you knew had died suddenly .      mr .  saveloy   s foot tapped gently against the large parcel under the table  alongside a nice new cauldron .      so he wouldn   t get suspicious about what i was buying     he said .      five thousand firecrackers .         whut .         well     said mr .  saveloy .     did i ever tell you that after i taught geography in the assassins    guild and the plumbers    guild i did it for a few terms in the alchemists    guild .         alchemists .  loonies  the lot of them     said truckle .      but they   re keen on geography     said mr .  saveloy .     i suppose they need to know where they   ve landed .  eat up  gentlemen .  it may be a long night .         what is this stuff .     said truckle  spearing something with his chopstick .      er .  chow     said mr .  saveloy .      yes  but what is it .         chow .  a kind of   er   dog .      the horde looked at him .      there   s nothing wrong with it     he said hurriedly  with the sincerity of a man who had ordered bamboo shoots and bean curd for himself .      i   ve eaten everything else     said truckle     but i ain   t eating dog .  i had a dog once .  rover .         yeah     said cohen .     the one with the spiked collar .  the one who used to eat people .         say what you like  he was a friend to me     said truckle  pushing the meat to one side .      rabid death to everyone else .  i   ll eat yours .  order him some chicken  teach .         et a man once     mumbled mad hamish .     in a siege  it were .         you ate someone .     said mr .  saveloy  beckoning to the waiter .      just a leg .         that   s terrible .         not with mustard .      just when i think i know them  mr .  saveloy mused     he reached for his wine glass .  the horde reached for their glasses  too  while watching him carefully .      a toast  gentlemen     he said .     and remember what i said about not quaffing .  quaffing just gets your ears wet .  just sip .  to civilization .      the horde joined in with their own toasts .         pcharn   kov .                lie down on the floor and no one gets hurt .               may you live in interesting pants .               what   s the magic word .  gimme .               death to most tyrants .            whut .            the walls of the forbidden city are forty feet high     said butterfly .      and the gates are made of brass .  there are hundreds of guards .  but of course we have the great wizard .         who .         you .         sorry  i was forgetting .         yes     said butterfly  giving rincewind a long  appraising look .  rincewind remembered tutors giving him a look like that when he   d got high marks in some test by simply guessing at the answers .   he looked down hurriedly at the charcoal scrawls lotus blossom had made .   cohen   d know what to do  he thought .  he   d just slaughter his way through .  it   d never cross his mind to be afraid or worried .  he   s the kind of man you need at a time like this .      no doubt you have magic spells that can blow down the walls     said lotus blossom .   rincewind wondered what they would do to him when it turned out that he couldn   t .  not a lot  he thought  if i   m already running .  of course they could curse his memory and call him names  but he was used to that .  sticks and stones may break my bones  he thought .  he was vaguely aware that there was a second half to the saying  but he   d never bothered because the first half always occupied all his attention .   even the luggage had left him .  that was a minor bright spot  but he missed that patter of little feet        before we start     he said     i think you ought to sing a revolutionary song .      the cadre liked the idea .  under cover of their chanting he sidled over to butterfly  who gave him a knowing smile .      you know i can   t do it .         the master said you were very resourceful .         i can   t magic a hole in a wall .         i   m sure you   ll think of something .  and   great wizard .         yes  what .         favorite pearl  the child with the toy rabbit           yes .         the cadre is all she has .  the same goes for many of the others .  when the warlords fight  lots of people die .  parents .  do you understand .  i was one of the first to read what i did on my holidays  great wizard  and what i saw in there was a foolish man who for some reason is always lucky .  great wizard   i hope for everyone   s sake you have a great deal of luck .  especially for yours .         fountains tinkled in the courts of the sun emperor .  peacocks made their call  which sounds like a sound made by something that shouldn   t look as beautiful as that .  ornamental trees cast their shade as only they knew how   ornamentally .   the gardens occupied the heart of the city and it was possible to hear the noises from outside  although these were muted because of the straw spread daily on the nearest streets and also because any sound considered too loud would earn its originator a very brief stay in prison .   of the gardens  the most aesthetically pleasing was the one laid out by the first emperor  one sun mirror .  it consisted entirely of gravel and stones  but artfully raked and laid out as it might be by a mountain torrent with a refined artistic sense .  it was here that one sun mirror  in whose reign the empire had been unified and the great wall built  came to refresh his soul and dwell upon the essential unity of all things  while drinking wine out of the skull of some enemy or possibly a gardener who had been too clumsy with his rake .   at the moment the garden was occupied by two little wang  the master of protocol  who came there because he felt it was good for his nerves .   perhaps it was the number two  he   d always told himself .  it was an unlucky birth number .  being called little wang was merely a lack of courtesy detail  a sort of minor seagull dropping after the great heap of buffalo excrement that heaven had pasted into his very horoscope .  although he had to admit that he hadn   t made things any better by allowing himself to become master of protocol .   it had seemed such a good idea at the time .  he   d risen gently through the agatean civil service by mastering those arts essential to the practice of good government and administration  such as calligraphy  origami  flower arranging  and the five wonderful forms of poetry  .  he   d dutifully got on with the tasks assigned to him and noticed only vaguely that there didn   t seem to be quite as many high ranking members of the civil service as there used to be  and then one day a lot of senior mandarins   most of them a lot more senior than he was  it occurred to him later   had rushed up to him while he was trying to find a rhyme for    orange blossom    and congratulated him on being the new master .   that had been three months ago .   and of the things that had occurred to him in those intervening three months the most shameful was this  he had come to believe that the sun emperor was not  in fact  the lord of heaven  the pillar of the sky and the great river of blessings  but an evil minded madman whose death had been too long delayed .   it was an awful thought .  it was like hating motherhood and raw fish  or objecting to sunlight .  most people develop their social conscience when young  during that brief period between leaving school and deciding that injustice isn   t necessarily all bad  and it was something of a shock to suddenly find one at the age of sixty .   it wasn   t that he was against the golden rules .  it made sense that a man prone to thieving should have his hands cut off .  it prevented him from thieving again and thus tarnishing his soul .  a peasant who could not pay his taxes should be executed  in order to prevent him falling into the temptations of slothfulness and public disorder .  and since the empire was created by heaven as the only true world of human beings  all else outside being a land of ghosts  it was certainly in order to execute those who questioned this state of affairs .   but he felt that it wasn   t right to laugh happily while doing so .  it wasn   t pleasant that these things should happen  it was merely necessary .   from somewhere in the distance came the screams .  the emperor was playing chess again .  he preferred to use live pieces .   two little wang felt heavy with knowledge .  there had been better times .  he knew that now .  things hadn   t always been the way they were .  emperors didn   t use to be cruel clowns  around whom it was as safe as mudbanks in the crocodile season .  there hadn   t always been a civil war every time an emperor died .  warlords hadn   t run the country .  people had rights as well as duties .   and then one day the succession had been called into question and there was a war and since then it   d never seemed to go right .   soon  with any luck  the emperor would die .  no doubt a special hell was being made ready .  and there   d be the usual battle  and then there   d be a new emperor  and if he was very lucky two little wang would be beheaded  which was what tended to happen to people who had risen to high office under a previous incumbent .  but that was quite reasonable by modern standards  since it was possible these days to be beheaded for interrupting the emperor   s thoughts or standing in the wrong place .   at which point  two little wang heard ghosts .   they seemed to be right under his feet .   they were talking in a strange language  so to two little wang the speech was merely sounds  which went as follows      where the hell are we .         somewhere under the palace  i   m sure .  look for another manhole in the ceiling           whut .         i   m fed up with pushing this damn wheelchair .         it   s me for a hot footbath after this  i   m telling you .         you call this a way to enter a city .  you call this a way to enter a city .  waist deep in water .  we didn   t enter a   wretched   city like this when i rode with bruce the hoon .  you enter a   lovemaking   city by overrunning it with a thousand horsemen  that   s how you take a city    .         yeah  but there ain   t room for    em in this pipe .      the sounds had a hollow  booming quality to them .  with a kind of fascinated puzzlement two little wang followed them  walking across the manicured gravel in an unthinking way that would have earned him an immediate tongue extraction from its original lover of peace and tranquility .      can we please hurry .  i   d like us to be out of here when the cauldron goes off and i didn   t really have much time to experiment with the fuses .         i still don   t understand about the cauldron  teach .         i hope all those firecrackers will blow a hole in the wall .         right .  so why ain   t we there .  why are we in this pipe .         because all the guards will rush to see what the bang was .         right .  so we should be there .         no .  we should be here  cohen .  the word is decoy .  it   s   more civilized this way .      two little wang pressed his ear to the ground .      what   s the penalty for entering the forbidden city again  teach .         i believe it   s a punishment similar to hanging  drawing  and quartering .  so  you see  it would be a good idea if        there was a very faint splashing .      how   re you drawn  then .         i think your innards are cut out and shown to you .         what for .         i don   t really know .  to see if you recognize them  i suppose .         what   like     yep  that   s my kidneys  yep  that   s my breakfast    .         how   re you quartered .  is that  like  they give you somewhere to stay .         i think not  from context .      for a while there was no sound but the splash of six pairs of feet and the squeak squeak of what sounded like a wheel .      well  how   re you hung .         excuse me .         hur  hur  hur   sorry  sorry .      two little wang tripped over a two hundred year old bonsai tree and hit his head on a rock chosen for its fundamental serenity .  when he came round  a few seconds later  the voices had gone .  if there had ever been any .   ghosts .  there were a lot of ghosts around these days .  two little wang wished he had a few firecrackers to scatter around .   being master of protocol was even worse than trying to find a rhyme for    orange blossom .         flares lit the alleys of hunghung .  with the red army chattering behind him  rincewind wandered up to the wall of the forbidden city .   no one knew better than rincewind that he was totally incapable of proper magic .  he   d only ever done it by accident .   so he could be sure that if he waved a hand and said some magic words the wall would in all probability become just a little bit less full of holes than it was now .   it was a shame to disappoint lotus blossom  with her body that reminded rincewind of a plate of crinkle cut chips  but it was about time she learned that you couldn   t rely on wizards .   and then he could be out of here .  what could butterfly do to him if he tried and failed .  and  much to his surprise  he found himself hoping that  on the way out  he could poke herb in the eye .  he was amazed the others couldn   t spot him for what he was .   this area of wall was between gates .  the life of hunghung lapped against it like a muddy sea  there were stalls and booths everywhere .  rincewind had thought ankh morpork citizens lived out on the streets  but they were agoraphobes compared to the hunghungese .  funerals  with associated firecrackers  and wedding parties and religious ceremonies went on alongside  and intermingled with  the normal market activities such as free form livestock slaughter and world class arguing .   herb pointed to a clear area of wall stacked with timber .      just about there  great wizard     he sneered .     do not exert yourself unduly .  a small hole should be sufficient .         but there   s hundreds of people around .         is that a problem to such a great wizard .  perhaps you can   t do it with people watching .         i have no doubt that the great wizard will astonish us     said butterfly .      when the people see the power of the great wizard they will speak of it for ever .     said lotus blossom .      probably     muttered rincewind .   the cadre stopped talking  although it was only possible to notice this by watching their closed mouths .  the hole left by their silence was soon filled by the babble of the market .   rincewind rolled up his sleeves .   he wasn   t even certain about a spell for blowing things up     he waved a hand vaguely .      i should stand well back  everyone     said herb  grinning unpleasantly .      quanti canicula illa in fenestre .     said rincewind .     er        he stared desperately at the wall and  with that heightened perception that comes to those on the edge of terror  noticed a cauldron half hidden in the timber .  there seemed to be a little glowing string attached to it .      er     he said     there seems to be           having problems .     said herb  nastily .   rincewind squared his shoulders .             he said .   there was a sound like a marshmallow gently landing on a plate  and everything in front of him went white .   then the white turned red  streaked with black  and the terrible noise clapped its hands across his ears .   a crescent shaped piece of something glowing scythed the top off his hat and embedded itself in the nearest house  which caught fire .   there was a strong smell of burning eyebrows .   when the debris settled rincewind saw quite a large hole in the wall .  around its edge the brickwork  now a red hot ceramic  started to cool with a noise like glinka glinka .   he looked down at his soot blackened hands .      gosh     he said .   and then he said     all right .      and then he turned and began to say     how about that  then .     but his voice faded when it became apparent that everyone was lying flat on the ground .   a duck watched him suspiciously from its cage .  owing to the slight protection afforded by the bars  its feathers were patterned alternately natural and crispy .   he   d always wanted to do magic like that .  he   d always been able to visualize it perfectly .  he   d just never been able to do it     a number of guards appeared in the gap .  one  whose ferocity of helmet suggested that he was an officer  glared at the charred hole and then at rincewind .      did you do this .     he demanded .      stand back .     shouted rincewind  drunk with power .     i   m the great wizard  i am .  you see this finger .  don   t make me use it .      the officer nodded to a couple of his men .      get him .      rincewind took a step back .      i warn you .  anyone lays a hand on me  he   ll be eating flies and hopping for the rest of his life .      the guards advanced with the determination of those who were prepared to risk the uncertainty of magic against the definite prospect of punishment for disobeying orders .      stand back .  this could go off .  all right  then  since you force        he waved his hand .  he snapped his fingers a few times .      er        the guards  after checking that they were still the same shape  each grabbed an arm .      it may be delayed action     he ventured  as they gripped harder .      alternatively  would you be interested in hearing a famous quotation .     he said .  his feet were lifted off the ground .     or perhaps not .      rincewind  running absent mindedly in mid air  was brought in front of the officer .      on your knees  rebel .     said the officer .      i   d like to  but           i saw what you did to captain four white fox .         what .  who   s he .         take   him   to   the   emperor .      as he was dragged off rincewind saw  for one brief moment  the guards closing on the red army  swords flashing        a metal plate shuddered for a moment  and then dropped on the floor .      careful .         i ain   t used to being careful .  bruce the hoon wasn   t care           shut up about bruce the hoon .         well  dang you  too .         whut .         anyone out there .      cohen stuck his head out of the pipe .  the room was dark  damp and full of pipes and runnels .  water went off in every direction to feed fountains and cisterns .      no     he said  in a disappointed voice .      very well .  everyone out of the pipe .      there was some echoey swearing and the scrape of metal as hamish   s wheelchair was manoeuvred into the long  low cellar .   mr .  saveloy lit a match as the horde spread out and examined their surroundings .      congratulations  gentlemen     he said .     i believe we are in the palace .         yeah     said truckle .     we   ve conquered a f   a lovemaking pipe .  what good is that .         we could rape it     said caleb hopefully .      hey  this wheel thing turns           what   s a lovemaking pipe .         what does this lever do .         whut .         how about we find a door  rush out  and kill everyone .      mr .  saveloy closed his eyes .  there was something familiar about this situation  and now he realized what it was .  he   d once taken an entire class on a school trip to the city armory .  his right leg still hurt him on wet days .      no  no  no .     he said .     what good would that do .  boy willie  please don   t pull that lever .         well  i   d feel better  for one     said cohen .     ain   t killed anyone all day except a guard  and they hardly count .         remember that we   re here for theft  not murder     said mr .  saveloy .     now  please  out of all that wet leather and into your nice new clothes .         i don   t like this part     said cohen  pulling on a shirt .     i like people to know who i was .         yeah     said boy willie .     without our leather and mail people   ll just think we   re a load of old men .         exactly     said mr .  saveloy .     that is part of the subterfuge .         is that like tactics .     said cohen .      yes .         all right  but i don   t like it     said old vincent .     s   posing we win .  what kind of song will the minstrels sing about people who invaded through a pipe .         an echoey one     said boy willie .      they won   t sing anything like that     said cohen firmly .     you pay a minstrel enough  he   ll sing whatever you want .      a flight of damp steps led to a door .  mr .  saveloy was already at the top  listening .      that   s right     said caleb .     they say that whoever pays the piper calls the tune .         but  gentlemen     said mr .  saveloy  his eyes bright     whoever holds a knife to the piper   s throat writes the symphony .         the assassin moved slowly through lord hong   s chambers .   he was one of the best in hunghung   s small but very select guild  and he certainly was not a rebel .  he disliked rebels .  they were invariably poor people  and therefore unlikely to be customers .   his mode of movement was unusual and cautious .  it avoided the floor  lord hong was known to tune his floorboards .  it made considerable use of furniture and decorative screens  and occasionally of the ceiling as well .   and the assassin was very good at it .  when a messenger entered the room through a distant door he froze for an instant  and then moved in perfect rhythm towards his quarry  letting the newcomer   s clumsy footsteps mask his own .   lord hong was making another sword .  the folding of the metal and all the tedious yet essential bouts of heating and hammering were  he found  conducive to clear thinking .  too much pure cerebration was bad for the mind .  lord hong liked to use his hands sometimes .   he plunged the sword back into the furnace and pumped the bellows a few times .      yes .     he said .  the messenger looked up from his prone position near the floor .      good news  o lord .  we have captured the red army .         well  that is good news     said lord hong  watching the blade carefully for the change of color .     including the one they call the great wizard .         indeed .  but he is not that great  o lord .     said the messenger .   his cheerfulness faded when lord hong raised an eyebrow .      really .  on the contrary  i suspect him of being in possession of huge and dangerous powers .         yes  o lord .  i did not mean           see that they are all locked up .  and send a message to captain five hong man to undertake the orders i gave him today .         yes  o lord .         and now  stand up .      the messenger stood up  trembling .  lord hong pulled on a thick glove and reached for the sword handle .  the furnace roared .      chin up  man .         my lord .         now open your eyes wide .      there was no need for that order .  lord hong peered into the mask of terror  noted the flicker of movement  nodded  and then in one almost balletic movement pulled the spitting blade from the furnace  turned  thrust     there was a very brief scream  and a rather longer hiss .   lord hong let the assassin sag .  then he tugged the sword free and inspected the steaming blade .      hmm     he said .     interesting        he caught sight of the messenger .      are you still here .         no  my lord .         see to it .      lord hong turned the sword so that the light caught it  and examined the edge .      and  er  shall i send some servants to clear away the  er  body .         what .     said lord hong  lost in thought .      the body  lord hong .         what body .  oh .  yes .  see to it .         the walls were beautifully decorated .  even rincewind noticed this  though they went past in a blur .  some had marvellous birds painted on them  or mountain scenes  or sprays of foliage  every leaf and bud done in exquisite detail with just a couple of brush strokes .   ceramic lions reared on marble pedestals .  vases bigger than rincewind lined the corridors .   lacquered doors opened ahead of the guards .  rincewind was briefly aware of huge  ornate and empty rooms stretching away on either side .   finally they passed through yet another set of doors and he was flung down on a wooden floor .   in these circumstances  he always found  it was best not to look up .   eventually an officious voice said     what do you have to say for yourself  miserable louse .         well  i           silence .      ah .  so it was going to be that kind of interview .   a different voice  a cracked  breathless and elderly voice  said     where is the grand   vizier .         he has retired to his rooms  o great one .  he said he had a headache .         summon him at   once .         certainly  o great one .      rincewind  his nose pressed firmly to the floor  made some further assumptions .  grand vizier was always a bad sign  it generally meant that people were going to suggest wild horses and red hot chains .  and when people were called things like    o great one     it was pretty certain that there was no appeal .      this is a   rebel  is it .     the sentence was wheezed rather than spoken .      indeed  o great one .         i think i would like a clo   ser look .      there was a general murmur  suggesting that a number of people had been greatly surprised  and then the sound of furniture being moved .   rincewind thought he saw a blanket on the edge of his vision .  someone was wheeling a bed across the floor        make it   stand up .     the gurgle in the pause was like the last bathwater going down the plughole .  it sucked as wetly as an outgoing wave .   once again a foot kicked rincewind in the kidneys  making its usual explicit request in the esperanto of brutality .  he got up .   it was a bed  and quite the biggest rincewind had ever seen .  in it  swathed in brocades and almost lost in pillows  was an old man .  rincewind had never seen anyone look so ill .  the face was pale  with a greenish pallor  veins showed up under the skin of his hands like worms in a jar .   the emperor had all the qualifications for a corpse except  as it were  the most vital one .      so   this is the new great wizard of   whom we have read so much  is   it .     he said .   when he spoke  people waited expectantly for the final gurgle in mid sentence .      well  i       rincewind began .      silence .     screamed a chamberlain .   rincewind shrugged .   he hadn   t known what to expect of an emperor  but the mental picture had room for a big fat man with lots of rings .  talking to this one was a hair   s breadth from necromancy .      can you show us some more   magic  great wizard .      rincewind glanced at the chamberlain .      w           silence .      the emperor waved a hand vaguely  gurgled with the effort  and gave rincewind another enquiring look .  rincewind decided to chance things .      i   ve got a good one     he said .     it   s a vanishing trick .         can you   do it now .         only if everyone opens all the doors and turns their backs .      the emperor   s expression did not change .  the court fell silent .  then there was a sound like a number of small rabbits being choked to death .   the emperor was laughing .  once this was established  everyone else laughed too .  no one can get a laugh like a man who can have you put to death more easily than he goes to the lavatory .      what shall we do with   you .     he said .     where is the   grand   vizier .      the crowd parted .   rincewind risked a sideways squint .  once you were in the hands of a grand vizier  you were dead .  grand viziers were always scheming megalomaniacs .  it was probably in the job description     are you a devious  plotting  unreliable madman .  ah  good  then you can be my most trusted minister .         ah  lord   hong     said the emperor .      mercy .     suggested rincewind .      silence .     screamed the chamberlain .      tell me  lord   hong     said the ancient emperor .     what would be the punishment for a   foreigner   entering the forbidden city .         removal of all limbs  ears  and eyes  and then allowed to go free     said lord hong .   rincewind raised his hand .      first offense .     he said .      silence .         we find  generally  that there is no second offence     said lord hong .     what is this person .         i like him     said the emperor .     i think i shall   keep him .  he makes me   laugh .      rincewind opened his mouth .      silence .     screamed the chamberlain  perhaps unwisely in view of current thinking .      er   could you stop him shouting    silence .     every time i try to speak .     rincewind ventured .      certainly   great wizard     said the emperor .  he nodded at some guards .     take the chamberlain   away and cut his   lips off .         great one  i    .         and his ears   also .      the wretched man was dragged away .  a pair of lacquered doors slammed shut .  there was a round of applause from the courtiers .      would you   like to watch him eat   them .     said the emperor grinning happily .     it   s tre   mendous fun .         ahahaha     said rincewind .      a good decision  lord     said lord hong .  he turned his head towards rincewind .   to the wizard   s immense surprise  and some horror  too  he winked .      o great one       said a plump courtier  dropping to his knees  bouncing slightly  and then nervously approaching the emperor     i wonder if perhaps it is entirely wise to be so merciful to this foreign dev        the emperor looked down .  rincewind would have sworn that dust fell off him .   there was a gentle movement among the crowd .  without anyone apparently doing anything so gross as activating their feet  there was nevertheless a widening space around the kneeling man .   then the emperor smiled .      your concern is well   received     he said .  the courtier risked a relieved grin .  the emperor added     however  your presumption is not .  kill him slowly   over several   days .         aaargh .         yes in   deed .  lots of boiling   oil .         an excellent idea  o lord     said lord hong .   the emperor turned back to rincewind .      i am sure the   great wizard is my friend     he suctioned .      ahahaha     said rincewind .   he   d been in this approximate position before  gods knew .  but he   d always been facing someone   well  usually someone who looked like lord hong  not a near corpse who was clearly so far round the bend he couldn   t poke sanity with a long pole .      we shall have such   fun     said the emperor .     i read   all about you .         ahahaha     said rincewind .   the emperor waved a hand at the court again .      now i will retire     he said .  there was a general movement and much ostensible yawning .  clearly no one stayed up later than the emperor .      emperor     said lord hong wearily     what will you have us do with this great wizard of yours .      the old man gave rincewind the look a present gets around the time the batteries have run out .      put him in the special   dungeon     he said .     for   now .         yes  emperor     said lord hong .  he nodded at a couple of guards .   rincewind managed a quick look back as he was dragged from the room .  the emperor was lying back in his movable bed  quite oblivious to him .      is he mad or what .     he said .      silence .      rincewind looked up at the guard who   d said that .      a mouth like that could get a man into big trouble around here     he muttered .      lord hong always found himself depressed by the general state of humanity .  it often seemed to him to be flawed .  there was no concentration .  take the red army .  if he had been a rebel the emperor would have been assassinated months ago and the country would now be aflame  except for those bits too damp to burn .  but these .  despite his best efforts  their idea of revolutionary activity was a surreptitious wall poster saying something like    unpleasantness to oppressors when convenient .      they had tried to set fire to guardhouses .  that was good .  that was proper revolutionary activity  except for the bit where they tried to make an appointment first .  it had taken lord hong some considerable effort to see that the red army appeared to achieve any victories at all .   well  he   d given them the great wizard they so sincerely believed in .  they had no excuse now .  and by the look of him  the wretch was as craven and talentless as lord hong had hoped .  any army led by him would either flee or be slaughtered  leaving the way open for the counter revolution .   the counter revolution would not be inefficient .  lord hong would see to that .   but things had to be done one step at a time .  there were enemies everywhere .  suspicious enemies .  the path of the ambitious man was a nightingale floor .  one wrong step and it would sing out .  it was a shame the great wizard would turn out to be so good at locks .  lord tang   s men were guarding the prison block tonight .  of course  if the red army were to escape  no blame at all could possibly attach to lord tang     lord hong risked a little chuckle to himself as he strode back to his suite .  proof  that was the thing .  there must never be proof .  but that wouldn   t matter very long .  there was nothing like a fearsomely huge war to unite people  and the fact that the great wizard   that is  the leader of the terrible rebel army   was an evil foreign troublemaker was just the spark to light the firecracker .   and then   ankh morpork  urinating dog  .   hunghung was old .  the culture was based on custom  the alimentary tract of the common water buffalo  and base treachery .  lord hong was in favor of all three  but they did not add up to world domination  and lord hong was particularly in favor of that  provided it was achieved by lord hong .   if i was the traditional type of grand vizier  he thought as he sat down before his tea table  i   d cackle with laughter at this point .   he smiled to himself  instead .   time for the box again .  no .  some things were all the better for the anticipation .      mad hamish   s wheelchair caused a few heads to turn  but no actual comment .  undue curiosity was not a survival trait in hunghung .  they just got on with their work  which appeared to be the endless carrying of stacks of paper along the corridors .   cohen looked down at what was in his hand .  over the decades he   d fought with many weapons   swords  of course  and bows and spears and clubs and   well  now he came to think of it  just about anything .   except this        i still don   t like it     said truckle .     why   re we carrying pieces of paper .         because no one looks at you in a place like this if you   re carrying a piece of paper     said mr .  saveloy .      why .         whut .         it   s   a kind of magic .         i   d feel happier if it was a weapon .         as a matter of fact  it can be the greatest weapon there is .         i know  i   ve just cut myself on my bit     said boy willie  sucking his finger .      whut .         look at it like this  gentlemen     said mr .  saveloy .     here we are  actually inside the forbidden city  and no one is dead .         yes .  that   s what we   re   danging   complaining about     said truckle .   mr .  saveloy sighed .  there was something in the way truckle used words .  it didn   t matter what he actually said  what you heard was in some strange way the word he actually meant .  he could turn the air blue just by saying    socks .         the door slammed shut behind rincewind  and there was the sound of a bolt shooting into place .   the empire   s jails were pretty much like the ones at home .  when you want to incarcerate such an ingenious creature as the common human being  you tend to rely on the good old fashioned iron bar and large amounts of stone .  it looked as though this well tried pattern had been established here for a very long time .   well  he   d definitely scored a hit with the emperor .  for some reason this did not reassure him .  the man gave rincewind the distinct impression of being the kind of person who is at least as dangerous to his friends as to his enemies .   he remembered noodle jackson  back in the days when he was a very young student .  everyone wanted to be friends with noodle but somehow  if you were in his gang  you found yourself being trodden on or chased by the watch or being hit in fights you didn   t start  while noodle was somewhere on the edge of things  laughing .   besides  the emperor wasn   t simply at death   s door but well inside the hallway  admiring the carpet and commenting on the hatstand .  and you didn   t have to be a political genius to know that when someone like that died  scores were being settled before he   d even got cold .  anyone he   d publicly called a friend would have a life expectancy more normally associated with things that hover over trout streams at sunset .   rincewind moved aside a skull and sat down .  there was the possibility of rescue  he supposed  but the red army would be hard put to it to rescue a rubber duck from drowning .  anyway  that   d put him back in the clutches of butterfly  who terrified him almost as much as the emperor .   he had to believe that the gods didn   t intend for rincewind  after all his adventures  to rot in a dungeon .   no  he added bitterly  they probably had something much more inventive in mind .   what light reached the dungeon came from a very small grille and had a second hand look .  the rest of the furnishing was a pile of what had possibly once been straw .  there was        a gentle tapping at the wall .   once  twice  three times .   rincewind picked up the skull and returned the signal .   one tap came back .   he repeated it .   then there were two .   he tapped twice .   well  this was familiar .  communication without meaning   it was just like being back at unseen university .      fine     he said  his voice echoing in the cell .     fine .  tr  s prisoner .  but what are we saying .      there was a gentle scraping noise and one of the blocks in the wall very gently slid out of the wall  dropping on to rincewind   s foot .      aargh .         what big hippo .     said a muffled voice .      what .         sorry .         what .         you wanted to know about the tapping code .  it   s how we communicate between cells  you see .  one tap means           excuse me  but aren   t we communicating now .         yes  but not formally .  prisoners are not   allowed   to talk       the voice slowed down  as if the speaker had suddenly remembered something important .      ah  yes     said rincewind .     i was forgetting .  this is   hunghung .  everyone   obeys   the rules        rincewind   s voice died away too .   on either side of the wall there was a long  thoughtful silence .      rincewind .         twoflower .         what are you doing here .     said rincewind .      rotting in a dungeon .         me  too .         good grief .  how long has it been .     said the muffled voice of twoflower .      what .  how long has what been .         but you   why are           you wrote that damn book .         i just thought it would be interesting for people .         interesting .  interesting .         i thought people would find it an interesting account of a foreign culture .  i never meant it to cause trouble .      rincewind leaned against his side of the wall .  no  of course  twoflower never wanted to cause any trouble .  some people never did .  probably the last sound heard before the universe folded up like a paper hat would be someone saying     what happens if i do this .         it must have been fate that brought you here     said twoflower .      yes  it   s the sort of thing he likes to do     said rincewind .      you remember the good times we had .         did we .  i must have had my eyes shut .         the adventures .         oh  them .  you mean hanging from high places  that sort of thing    .         rincewind .         yes .  what .         i feel a lot happier about things now you   re here .         that   s amazing .      rincewind enjoyed the comfort of the wall .  it was just rock .  he felt he could rely on it .      everyone seems to have a copy of your book     he said .     it   s a revolutionary document .  and i do mean copy .  it looks as though they make their own copy and pass it on .         yes  it   s called samizdat .         what does that mean .         it means each one must be the same as the one before .  oh  dear .  i thought it would just be entertainment .  i didn   t think people would take it seriously .  i do hope it   s not causing too much bother .         well  your revolutionaries are still at the slogan and poster stage  but i shouldn   t think that   ll count for much if they   re caught .         oh  dear .         how come you   re still alive .         i don   t know .  i think they may have forgotten about me .  that tends to happen  you know .  it   s the paperwork .  someone makes the wrong stroke with the brush or forgets to copy a line .  i believe it happens a lot .         you mean that there   s people in prison and no one can remember why .         oh  yes .         then why don   t they set them free .         i suppose it is felt that they must have done something .  all in all  i   m afraid our government does leave something to be desired .         like a new government .         oh  dear .  you could get locked up for saying things like that .         people slept  but the forbidden city never slept .  torches flickered all night in the great bureaux as the ceaseless business of empire went on .   this largely involved  as mr .  saveloy had said  moving paper .   six beneficent winds was deputy district administrator for the langtang district  and good at a job which he rather enjoyed .  he was not a wicked man .   true  he had the same sense of humor as a chicken casserole .  true  he played the accordion for amusement  and disliked cats intensely  and had a habit of dabbing his upper lip with his napkin after his tea ceremony in a way that had made mrs .  beneficent winds commit murder in her mind on a regular basis over the years .  and he kept his money in a small leather shovel purse  and counted it out very thoroughly whenever he made a purchase  especially if there was a queue behind him .   but on the other hand  he was kind to animals and made small but regular contributions to charity .  he frequently gave moderate sums to beggars in the street  although he made a note of this in the little notebook he always carried to remind him to visit them in his official capacity later on .   and he never took away from people more money than they actually had .   he was also  unusually for men employed in the forbidden city after dark  not a eunuch .  guards were not eunuchs  of course  and people had got around this by classifying them officially as furniture .  and it had been found that tax officials also needed every faculty at their disposal to combat the wiles of the average peasant  who had this regrettable tendency to avoid paying taxes .   there were much nastier people in the building than six beneficent winds and it was therefore just his inauspicious luck that his paper and bamboo door slid aside to reveal seven strange looking old eunuchs  one of them in a wheeled contrivance .   they didn   t even bow  let alone fall on their knees .  and he not only had an official red hat but it had a white button on it .   his brush dropped from his hands when the men wandered into his office as if they owned it .  one of them started poking holes in the wall and speaking gibberish .      hey  the walls are just made of paper .  hey  look  if you lick your finger it goes right through .  see .         i will call for the guards and have you all flogged .     shouted six beneficent winds  his temper moderated slightly by the extreme age of the visitors .      what did he say .         he said he   d call for the guards .         ooo  yes .  please let him call for the guards .         no  we don   t want that yet .  act normally .         you mean cut his throat .         i meant a more normal kind of normally .         it   s what i call normal .      one of the old men faced the speechless official and gave him a big grin .      excuse us  your supreme   oh dear  what   s the word .    pushcart sail .    immense rock .    ah  yes   venerableness  but we seem to be a little lost .      a couple of the old men shuffled around behind six beneficent winds and started to read  or at least try to read  what he   d been working on .  a sheet of paper was snatched from his hand .      what   s this say  teach .         let me see      the first wind of autumn shakes the lotus flower .  seven lucky logs to pay one pig and three  looks like a four armed man waving a flag  of rice on pain of having his  rather a stylized thing here  can   t quite make it out  struck with many blows .  by order of six beneficent winds  collector of revenues  langtang .         there was a subtle change among the old men .  now they were all grinning  but not in a way that gave him any comfort .  one of them  with teeth like diamonds  leaned towards him and said  in bad agatean      you are a tax collector  mr .  knob on your hat .      six beneficent winds wondered if he   d be able to summon the guard .  there was something terrible about these old men .  they weren   t venerable at all .  they were horribly menacing and  although he couldn   t see any obvious weapons  he knew for a cold frozen fact that he wouldn   t be able to get out more than the first syllable before he   d be killed .  besides  his throat had gone dry and his pants had gone wet .      nothing wrong with being a tax collector       he croaked .      we never said that     said diamond teeth .     we always like to meet tax collectors .         some of our most favoritest people  tax collectors     said another old man .      saves a lot of trouble     said diamond teeth .      yeah     said a third old man .     like  it means you don   t have to go from house to house killin    everyone for their valuables  you just wait and kill the           gentlemen  can i have a word .      the speaker was the slightly goat faced one that didn   t seem quite so unpleasant as the others .  the terrible men clustered around him and six beneficent winds heard the strange syllables of a coarse foreign tongue      what .  but he   s a tax collector .  that   s what they   re for .         whut .         a firm tax base is the foundation of sound governance  gentlemen .  please trust me .         i understood all of that up to    a firm tax    .         nevertheless  no useful purpose will be served by killing this hardworking tax gatherer .         he   d be dead .  i call that useful .      there was some more of the same .  six beneficent winds jumped when the group broke up and the goat faced man gave him a smile .      my humble friends are overawed by your   variety of plum   small knife for cutting seaweed   presence  noble sir     he said  his every word slandered by truckle   s vigorous gesticulations behind his back .      how about if we just cut a bit off .         whut .         how did you get in here .     said six beneficent winds .     there are many strong guards .         i knew we missed something     said diamond teeth .      we would like you to show us around the forbidden city     said goat face .     my name is   mr .  stuffed tube  i think you would call it .  yes .  stuffed tube  i   m pretty sure        six beneficent winds glanced hopefully towards the door .         and we are here to learn more about your wonderful   mountain   variety of bamboo   sound of running water at evening   drat   civilization .      behind him  truckle was energetically demonstrating to the rest of the horde what he and bruce the hoon   s skeletal riders once did to a tax gatherer .  the sweeping arm movements in particular occupied six beneficent winds    attention .  he couldn   t understand the words but  somehow  you didn   t need to .      why are you talking to him like that .         ghenghiz  i   m lost .  there are no maps of the forbidden city .  we need a guide .      goat face turned back to the taxman .     perhaps you would like to come with us .     he said .   out  thought six beneficent winds .  yes .  there may be guards out there .      just a minute     said diamond teeth  as he nodded .     pick up your paintbrush and write down what i say .      a minute later  they   d gone .  all that remained in the taxman   s office was an amended piece of paper  which read as follows      roses are red  violets are blue .  seven lucky logs to be given one pig and all the rice he can carry  because he is now one lucky peasant .  by order of six beneficent winds  collector of revenues  langtang .  help .  help .  if anyone reads this i am being held prisoner by an evil eunuch .  help .          rincewind and twoflower lay in their separate cells and talked about the good old days .  at least  twoflower talked about the good old days .  rincewind worked at a crack in the stone with a piece of straw  it being all he had to hand .  it would take several thousand years to make any kind of impression  but that was no reason to give up .      do we get fed in here .     he said  interrupting the flow of reminiscence .      oh  sometimes .  but it   s not like the marvelous food in ankh morpork .         really     murmured rincewind  scratching away .  a tiny piece of mortar seemed ready to move .      i   ll always remember the taste of mr .  dibbler   s sausages .         people do .         a once in a lifetime experience .         frequently .      the straw broke .      damn and blast .     rincewind sat back .     what   s so important about the red army .     he said .     i mean  they   re just a bunch of kids .  just a nuisance .         yes  i   m afraid things got rather confused     said twoflower .     um .  have you ever heard of the theory that history goes in cycles .         i saw a drawing in one of leonard of quirm   s notebooks       rincewind began  trying again with another straw .      no  i mean   like a   wheel  spinning .  if you stand in the same place it all comes round again .         oh  that .  blast .         well  a lot of people believe it here .  they think history starts again every three thousand years .         could be     said rincewind  who was looking for another straw and wasn   t really listening .  then the words sank in .     three thousand years .  that   s a bit short  isn   t it .  the whole thing .  stars and oceans and intelligent life evolving from arts graduates  that sort of thing .         oh  no .  that   s just   stuff .  proper history started with the founding of the empire by one sun mirror .  the first emperor .  and his servant  the great wizard .  just a legend  really .  it   s the sort of thing peasants believe .  they look at something like the great wall and say  that   s such a marvelous thing it must have been built by magic   and the red army   what it probably was was just a well organized body of trained fighting men .  the first real army  you see .  all there was before was just undisciplined mobs .  that   s what it must have been .  not magical at all .  the great wizard couldn   t really have made   what the peasants believe is silly           why  what do they believe .         they say the great wizard made the earth come alive .  when all the armies on the continent faced one sun mirror the great wizard   flew a kite .         sounds sensible to me     said rincewind .     when there   s war around take the day off  that   s my motto .         no  you don   t understand .  this was a special kite .  it trapped the lightning in the sky and the great wizard stored it in bottles and then took the mud itself and   baked it with the lightning  and made it into an army .         never heard of any spells for that .         and they have funny ideas about reincarnation  too        rincewind conceded that they probably would .  it probably whiled away those long water buffaloid hours  hey  after i die i hope i come back as   a man holding a water buffalo  but facing a different way .      er   no     said twoflower .     they don   t think you come back at all .  er   i   m not using the right words  am i .    bit corroded on this language   i mean preincarnation .  it   s like reincarnation backwards .  they think you   re born before you die .         oh  really .     said rincewind  scratching at the stones .     amazing .  born before you die .  life before death .  people will get really excited when they hear about that .         that   s not exactly   er .  it   s all tied in with ancestors .  you should always venerate ancestors because you might be them one day  and   are you listening .      the little piece of mortar fell away .  not bad for ten minutes    work  thought rincewind .  come the next ice age  we   re out of here     it dawned on him that he was working on the wall that led to twoflower   s cell .  taking several thousand years to break into an adjoining cell could well be thought a waste of time .   he started on a different wall .  scratch   scratch     there was a terrible scream .   scratchscratchscratch        sounds like the emperor has woken up     said twoflower   s voice from the hole in the wall .      that   s kind of an early morning torture  is it .     said rincewind .  he started to hammer at the huge blocks with a piece of shattered stone .      it   s not really his fault .  he just doesn   t understand about people .         is that so .         you know how common kids go through a stage of pulling the wings off flies .         i never did     said rincewind .     you can   t trust flies .  they may look small but they can turn nasty .         kids generally  i mean .         yes .  well .         he is an emperor .  no one ever dared tell him it was wrong .  it   s just a matter of  you know  scaling up .  all the five families fight among themselves for the crown .  he killed his nephew to become emperor .  no one has ever told him that it   s not right to keep killing people for fun .  at least  no one who has ever managed to get to the end of the first sentence .  and the hongs and the fangs and the tangs and the sungs and the mcsweeneys have been killing one another for thousands of years .  it   s all part of the royal succession .         mcsweeneys .         very old established family .      rincewind nodded gloomily .  it was probably like breeding horses .  if you have a system where treacherous murderers tend to win  you end up breeding really treacherous murderers .  you end up with a situation where it   s dangerous to lean over a cradle     there was another scream .   rincewind started kicking at the stones .   a key turned in the lock .      oh     said twoflower .   but the door didn   t open .   finally rincewind walked over and tried the big iron ring .   the door swung outwards  but not too far because the recumbent body of a guard makes an unusual but efficient doorstop .   there was a whole ring of keys hanging from the one in the door     an inexperienced prisoner would simply have run for it .  but rincewind was a post graduate student in the art of staying alive  and knew that in circumstances like these much the best thing to do was let out every single prisoner  pat each one hurriedly on the back and say     quick .  they   re coming for you .     and then go and sit somewhere nice and quiet until the pursuit has disappeared in the distance .   he opened the door to twoflower   s cell first .   the little man was skinnier and grubbier than he remembered  and had a wispy beard  but in one very significant way he had the feature that rincewind remembered so well   the big  beaming  trusting smile that suggested that anything bad currently happening to him was just some sort of laughable mistake and would be bound to be sorted out by reasonable people .      rincewind .  it is you .  i certainly never thought i   d see you again .     he said .      yes  i thought something on those lines     said rincewind .   twoflower looked past rincewind at the fallen guard .      is he dead .     he said  speaking of a man with a sword half buried in his back .      extremely likely .         did you do that .         i was inside the cell .         amazing .  good trick .      despite several years of exposure to the facts of the matter  rincewind remembered  twoflower had never really wanted to grasp the fact that his companion had the magical abilities of the common house fly .  it was useless to try to dissuade him .  it just meant that modesty was added to the list of non existent virtues .   he tried some of the keys in other cell doors .  various raggedy people emerged  blinking in the slightly better light .  one of them  turning his body slightly in order to get it through the door  was three yoked oxen .  from the look of him he   d been beaten up  but this might just have been someone   s attempt to attract his attention .      this is rincewind     said twoflower proudly .     the great wizard .  did you know he killed the guard from inside the cell .      they politely inspected the corpse .      i didn   t  really     said rincewind .      and he   s modest  too .         long life to the people   s endeavor .     said three yoked oxen through rather swollen lips .         mine   s a pint .        said rincewind .     here   s bigfella keys belong door  you go lettee people outee chopchop .      one of the freed prisoners limped to the end of the passage .      there   s a dead guard here     he said .      it wasn   t me     said rincewind plaintively .     i mean  perhaps i wished they were dead  but        people edged away .  you didn   t want to be too close to anyone who could wish like that .   if this had been ankh morpork someone would have said     oh  yeah  sure  he magically stabbed them in the back .     but that was because people in ankh morpork knew rincewind  and they knew that if a wizard really wanted you dead you   d have no back left to stab .   three yoked oxen had been able to master the technical business of opening doors .  more swung open        lotus blossom .     said rincewind .   she clung to oxen   s arm and smiled at rincewind .  other members of the cadre trooped out behind her .   then  to rincewind   s amazement  she looked at twoflower  screamed  and threw her arms around his neck .      extended continuation to filial affection .     chanted three yoked oxen .         close cover before striking .        said rincewind .     er .  what exactly is happening .      a very small red soldier tugged at his robe .      he is her daddy     it said .      you never said you had children .         i   m sure i did .  often     said twoflower  disentangling himself .     anyway   it is allowed .         you   re married .         i was  yes .  i   m sure i must have said .         we were probably running away from something at the time .  so there   s a mrs .  twoflower  is there .         there was for a while     said twoflower  and for a moment an expression almost of anger distorted his preternaturally benign countenance .     not  alas  any more .      rincewind looked away  because that was better than looking at twoflower   s face .   butterfly had also emerged .  she stood just outside the cell door  with her hands clasped in front of her  looking down demurely at her feet .   twoflower rushed over to her .      butterfly .      rincewind looked down at the rabbit clutcher .      she another daughter  pearl .         yeth .      the little man came towards rincewind  dragging the girls .      have you met my daughters .     he said .     this is rincewind  who           we have had the pleasure     said butterfly  gravely .      how did you all get here .     said rincewind .      we fought as hard as we could     said butterfly .     but there were simply too many of them .         i hope you didn   t try to grab their weapons     said rincewind  as sarcastically as he dared .   butterfly glared at him .      sorry     said rincewind .      herb says it is the system that is to blame     said lotus blossom .      i bet he   s got a better system all worked out .     rincewind looked at the throng of prisoners .     they usually have .  where is he  by the way .      the girls looked around .      i don   t see him here     said lotus blossom .     but i think that when the guards attacked us he laid down his life for the cause .         why .         because that   s what he said we should do .  i am ashamed that i did not .  but they seemed to want to capture us  not kill us .         i did not see him     said butterfly .  she and rincewind exchanged a glance .     i think perhaps   he was not there .         you mean he had been caught already .     said lotus blossom .   butterfly looked at rincewind again .  it occurred to him that whereas lotus blossom had inherited a twoflower view of the world  butterfly must have taken after her mother .  she thought more like rincewind  i . e .   the worst of everyone .      perhaps     she said .      make considerable sacrifice for the common good     said three yoked oxen .         there   s one born every minute        said rincewind  absently .   butterfly seemed to get a grip on herself .      however     she said     we must make the most of this opportunity .      rincewind  who had been heading for the stairs  froze .      exactly what do you mean .     he said .      don   t you see .  we are at large in the forbidden city .         not me .     said rincewind .     i   ve never been at large .  i   ve always been at hunched .         the enemy brought us in here and now we are free           thanks to the great wizard     said lotus blossom .         and we must seize the day .      she picked up a sword from a stricken guard and waved it dramatically .      we must storm the palace  just as herb suggested .         there   s only thirty of you .     said rincewind .     you   re not a storm .  you   re a shower .         there are hardly any guards within the city itself     said butterfly .     if we can overcome those around the emperor   s apartments           you   ll be killed .     said rincewind .   she turned on him .     then at least we shall have died for something .         cleanse the state with the blood of martyrs     rumbled three yoked oxen .   rincewind spun around and waved a finger under three yoked oxen   s nose  which was as high as he could reach .      i   ll bloody well thump you if you trot out something like that one more time .     he shouted  and then grimaced at the realization that he had just threatened a man three times heavier than he was .      listen to me  will you .     he said  settling down a little .     i know about people who talk about suffering for the common good .  it   s never bloody them .  when you hear a man shouting    forward  brave comrades .     you   ll see he   s the one behind the bloody big rock and wearing the only really arrow proof helmet .  understand .      he stopped .  the cadre were looking at him as if he was mad .  he stared at their young  keen faces  and felt very  very old .      but there are causes worth dying for     said butterfly .      no  there aren   t .  because you   ve only got one life but you can pick up another five causes on any street corner .         good grief  how can you live with a philosophy like that .      rincewind took a deep breath .      continuously .          six beneficent winds had thought it was a pretty good plan .  the horrible old men were lost in the forbidden city .  although they had a wiry look  rather like natural bonsai trees that had managed to flourish on a wind swept cliff  they were nevertheless very old and not at all heavily armed .   so he led them in the direction of the gymnasium .   and when they were inside he screamed for help at the top of his voice .  to his amazement  they didn   t turn and run .      can we kill him now .     said truckle .   a couple of dozen muscular men had stopped pounding logs of wood and piles of bricks and were regarding them suspiciously .      got any ideas .     said cohen to mr .  saveloy .      oh  dear .  they   re so very tough looking  aren   t they .         you can   t think of anything civilized .         no .  it   s over to you  i   m afraid .         hah .  hah .  i bin waiting for this     said caleb  pushing forward .     bin practicing every day     n i .  with my big lump o    teak .         these are ninjas     said six beneficent winds proudly  as a couple of the men wandered towards the door and pulled it shut .     the finest fighters in the world .  yield now .         that   s interesting     said cohen .     here  you  in the black pyjamas   just got out of bed  have you .  who   s the best out of all of you .      one of the men stared fixedly at cohen and thrust out a hand at the nearest wall .  it left a dent .   then he nodded at the tax gatherer .     what are these old fools you   ve brought us .         i think they   re barbarian invaders     said the taxman .      how   d you   how   d he know that .     said boy willie .     we   re wearin    itchy trousers and eatin    with forks and everythin           the leading ninja sneered .     heroic eunuchs .     he said .     old men .         who   re you calling a eunuch .     cohen demanded .      can i just show him what i   ve been practicing with my lump o    teak .     said caleb  hopping arthritically from one foot to the other .   the ninja eyed the slab of timber .      you could not make a dent on that  old man     he said .      you watch     said caleb .  he held out the wood at arm   s length .  then he raised his other hand  grunting a little as it got past shoulder height .      you watching this hand .  you watching this hand .     he demanded .      i am watching     said the ninja  trying not to laugh .      good     said caleb .  he kicked the man squarely in the groin and then  as he doubled up  hit him over the head with the teak .        cos you should   ve been watchin    this foot .      and that would have been all there was to it if there had only been one ninja .  but there was a clatter of rice flails and an unsheathing of long  curved swords .   the horde drew closer together .  hamish pushed back his rug to reveal their armory  although the collection of notched blades looked positively homely compared with the shiny toys ranged against them .      teach  why don   t you take mr .  taxman over to the corner out of harm   s way .     said ghenghiz .      this is madness .     said six beneficent winds .     they   re the finest fighters in the world and you   re just old men .  give in now and i   ll see if i can get you a rebate .         calm down  calm down     said mr .  saveloy .     no one   s going to get hurt .  metaphorically  at least .      ghenghiz cohen waved his sword a few times .      okay  you lads     he said .     give us your best ninje .      six beneficent winds looked on in horror as the horde squared up .      but it will be terrible slaughter .     he said .      i   m afraid so     said mr .  saveloy .  he fished in his pockets for a bag of peppermints .      who are these mad old men .  what do they do .         barbarian heroing  generally     said mr .  saveloy .     rescuing princesses  robbing temples  fighting monsters  exploring ancient and terror filled ruins   that sort of thing .         but they look old enough to be dead .  why do they do it .      saveloy shrugged .     that   s all they   ve ever done .      a ninja somersaulted down the room  screaming  a sword in either hand  cohen waited in an attitude rather similar to that of a baseball batter .      i wonder     said mr .  saveloy     if you have ever heard of the term    evolution    .      the two met .  the air blurred .      or    survival of the fittest    .     said mr .  saveloy .   the scream continued  but rather more urgently .      i didn   t even see his sword move .     whispered six beneficent winds .      yes .  people often don   t     said mr .  saveloy .      but   they   re so old .         indeed     said the teacher  raising his voice above the screams     and of course this is true .  they are very old barbarian heroes .      the taxman stared .      would you like a peppermint .     said mr .  saveloy  as hamish   s wheelchair thundered past in pursuit of a man with a broken sword and a pressing desire to stay alive .     you may find it helps  if you are around the horde for any length of time .      the aroma from the proffered paper bag hit six beneficent winds like a flamethrower .      how can you smell anything after eating those .         you can   t     said mr .  saveloy happily .   the taxman continued to stare .  the fighting was a fast and furious affair but  somehow  only on one side .  the horde fought like you   d expect old men to fight   slowly  and with care .  all the activity was on the part of the ninjas  but no matter how well flung the throwing star or speedy the kick  the target was always  without any obvious effort  not there .      since we have this moment to chat     said mr .  saveloy  as something with a lot of blades hit the wall just above the taxman   s head     i wonder  could you tell me about the big hill just outside the city .  it is quite a remarkable feature .         what .     said six beneficent winds distractedly .      the big hill .         you want to know about that .  now .         geography is a little hobby of mine .      someone   s ear hit six beneficent winds on the ear .      er .  what .  we call it the big hill   hey  look at what he   s doing with his           it seems remarkably regular .  is it a natural feature .         what .  eh .  oh   i don   t know  they say it turned up thousands of years ago .  during a terrible storm .  when the first emperor died .  he   he   s going to be killed .  he   s going to be killed .  he   s going to be   how did he do that .      six beneficent winds suddenly remembered  as a child  playing shibo yangcong san with his grandfather .  the old man always won .  no matter how carefully he   d assembled his strategy  he   d find grandfather would place a tile quite innocently right in the crucial place just before he could make his big move .  the ancestor had spent his whole life playing shibo .  the fight was just like that .      oh  my     he said .      that   s right     said mr .  saveloy .     they   ve had a lifetime   s experience of not dying .  they   ve become very good at it .         but   why here .  why come here .         we   re going to undertake a robbery     said mr .  saveloy .   six beneficent winds nodded sagely .  the wealth of the forbidden city was legendary .  probably even blood sucking ghosts had heard of it .      the talking vase of emperor p   gi su .     he said .      no .         the jade head of sung ts   uit li .         no .  wrong track entirely  i   m afraid .         not the secret of how silk is made .         good grief .  silkworms    bottoms .  everyone knows that .  no .  something rather more precious than that .      despite himself  six beneficent winds was impressed .  apart from anything else  only seven ninjas were still standing and cohen was fencing with one of them while rolling a cigarette in the other hand .   and mr .  saveloy could see it dawning in the fat man   s eyes .   the same thing had happened to him .   cohen came into people   s lives like a rogue planet into a peaceful solar system  and you felt yourself being dragged along simply because nothing like that would ever happen to you again .   he himself had been peacefully hunting for fossils during the school holidays when he had  more or less  stumbled into the camp of those particular fossils called the horde .  they   d been quite friendly  because he had neither weapons nor money .  and they   d taken to him  because he knew things they didn   t .  and that had been it .   he   d decided there and then .  it must have been something in the air .  his past life had suddenly unrolled behind him and he couldn   t remember a single day of it that had been any fun .  and it had dawned on him that he could join the horde or go back to school and  pretty soon  a limp handshake  a round of applause and his pension .   it was something about cohen .  maybe it was what they called charisma .  it overpowered even his normal smell of a goat that had just eaten curried asparagus .  he did everything wrong .  he cursed people and used what mr .  saveloy considered very offensive language to foreigners .  he shouted terms that would have earned anyone else a free slit throat from a variety of interesting ethnic weapons   and he got away with it  partly because it was clear that there was no actual malice there but mainly because he was  well  cohen  a sort of basic natural force on legs .   it worked on everything .  when he wasn   t actually fighting them  he got on a lot better with trolls than did people who merely thought that trolls had rights just like everyone else .  even the horde  bloody minded individualists to a man  fell for it .   but mr .  saveloy had also seen the aimlessness in their lives and  one night  he   d brought the conversation round to the opportunities offered in the aurient     there was a light in six beneficent winds    expression .      have you got an accountant .     he said .      well  no  as a matter of fact .         will this theft be treated as income or capital .         i haven   t really thought like that .  the horde doesn   t pay taxes .         what .  not to anyone .         no .  it   s funny  but they never seem to keep their money for long .  it seems to disappear on drink and women and high living .  i suppose  from a heroing point of view  they may count as taxes .      there was a    pop    as six beneficent winds uncorked a small bottle of ink and licked his writing brush .      but those sort of things probably count as allowable expenses for a barbarian hero     he said .     they are part of the job specification .  and then of course there is wear and tear on weaponry  protective clothing   they could certainly claim for at least one new loincloth a year           i don   t think they   ve claimed for one per century .         and there   s pensions  of course .         ah .  don   t use that word .  they think it   s a dirty word .  but in a way that is what they   re here for .  this is their last adventure .         when they   ve stolen this very valuable thing that you won   t tell me about .         that   s right .  you   d be very welcome to join us .  you could perhaps be a barbarian   to push beans   a length of knotted string   ah   accountant .  have you ever killed anyone .         not outright .  but i   ve always thought you can do considerable damage with a well placed final demand .      mr .  saveloy beamed .     ah  yes     he said .     civilization .      the last ninja was upright  but only just  hamish had run his wheelchair over his foot .  mr .  saveloy patted the taxman   s arm .     excuse me     he said .     i find i often have to intervene at this stage .      he padded over to the surviving man  who was looking around wildly .  six swords had become interlaced around his neck as though he   d taken part in a rather energetic folk dance .      good morning     said mr .  saveloy .     i should just point out that ghenghiz here is  despite appearances  a remarkably honest man .  he finds it hard to understand empty bravura .  may i venture to suggest therefore that you refrain from phrases like    i would rather die than betray my emperor    or    go ahead and do your worst    unless you really  really mean them .  should you wish for mercy  a simple hand signal will suffice .  i strongly advise you not to attempt to nod .      the young man looked sideways at cohen  who gave him an encouraging smile .   then he waved a hand quickly .   the swords unwove .  truckle hit the ninja over the head with a club .      it   s all right  you don   t have to go on about it  i didn   t kill him     he said sulkily .      ow .     boy willie had been experimenting with a rice flail and had hit his own ear .     how   d they manage to fight with this rubbish .         whut .         these little hogswatch decoration thingies look the business  though     said vincent  picking up a throwing star .     aaargh .     he sucked his fingers .     useless foreign junk .         that bit where that lad sprang backwards right across the room with them axes in his hands was impressive  though .         yeah .         you didn   t ought to have stuck your sword out like that  i thought .         he   s learned an important lesson .         it won   t do him much good now where he   s gone .         whut .      six beneficent winds was half laughing  half shocked .      but   but   i   ve seen these guards fight before .     he said .     they   re invincible .         no one told us .         but you beat them all .         yep .         and you   re just eunuchs .      there was a scrape of steel .  six beneficent winds closed his eyes .  he could feel metal touching his neck in at least five places .      there   s that word again     said the voice of cohen the barbarian .      but   you   re   dressed   as   eunuchs       murmured six beneficent winds  trying not to swallow .   mr .  saveloy backed away  chuckling nervously .      you see     he said  speaking fast     you   re too old to be taken for guards and you don   t look like bureaucrats  so i thought it would be  er  a very good disguise to           eunuch .     roared truckle .     you mean people   ve been looking at me and thinking i mince around saying  helluo  saltat .      like many men whose testosterone had always sloshed out of their ears  the horde had never finetuned their approach to the more complex areas of sexuality .  a teacher to the core  mr .  saveloy couldn   t help correcting them  even at swordpoint .      that means     the glutton dances     not  as you seem to think     hello  sailor     which is heus nauta     he said .     and eunuchs don   t say it .  not as a matter of course .  look  it   s an honor to be a eunuch in the forbidden city .  many of them occupy very exalted positions in           then prepare yourself for high office  teacher .     truckle shouted .   cohen knocked the sword out of his hand .      all right  none of that .  i don   t like it either     he said     but it   s just a disguise .  shouldn   t mean anything to a man who once bit a bear   s head off  should it .         yeah  but   you know   it   s not   i mean  when we went past those young ladies back there they all giggled           maybe later you can find them and make them laugh     said cohen .     but you should   ve told us  teach .         sorry .         whut .  whatseesay .         he said you   re a eunuch .     boy willie bellowed in hamish   s ear .      yep .     said hamish happily .      what .         that   s me .  the one an    only .         no  he didn   t mean           whut .         oh  never mind .  it   s all pretty much the same to you  hamish .      mr .  saveloy surveyed the wrecked gym .     i wonder what time it is .     he said .      ah     gurgled six beneficent winds  happy to lighten things a little .     here  you know  we have an amazing demon powered device that tells you what the time is even when the sun isn   t           clocks     said mr .  saveloy .     we   ve got them in ankh morpork .  only demons evaporate eventually so now they work by       he paused .     interesting .  you don   t have a word for it .  er .  shaped metal that does work .  toothed wheels .      the taxman looked frightened .     wheels with teeth .         what do you call the things that grind corn .         peasants .         yes  but what do they grind corn with .         i don   t know .  why should i know .  only peasants need to know that .         yes  i suppose that says it all  really     said mr .  saveloy sadly .      it   s a long way off dawn     said truckle .     why don   t we go and kill everyone in their beds .         no  no  no .     said mr .  saveloy .     i keep telling you  we   ve got to do it properly .         i could show you the treasure house     said six beneficent winds helpfully .      never a good idea to give a monkey the key to a banana plantation     said mr .  saveloy .     can you think of anything else to keep them amused for an hour .         down in the basement  there was a man who was talking about the government .  at the top of his voice .      you can   t fight for a cause .  a cause is just a thing .         then we are fighting for the peasants     said butterfly .  she   d backed away .  rincewind   s anger was coming off him like steam .      oh .  have you ever met them .         i   have seen them .         oh  good .  and what is it you want to achieve .         a better life for the people     said butterfly coldly .      you think you having some uprising and hanging a few people will do it .  well  i come from ankh morpork and we   ve had more rebellions and civil wars than you   ve had   lukewarm ducks    feet  and you know what .  the rulers are still in charge .  they always are .      they smiled at him in polite and nervous incomprehension .      look     he said  rubbing his forehead .     all those people out in the fields  the water buffalo people   if you have a revolution it   ll all be better for them  will it .         of course     said butterfly .     they will no longer be subject to the cruel and capricious whims of the forbidden city .         oh  that   s good     said rincewind .     so they   ll sort of be in charge of themselves  will they .         indeed     said lotus blossom .      by means of the people   s committee     said butterfly .   rincewind pressed both hands to his head .      my word     he said .     i don   t know why  but i had this predictive flash .      they looked impressed .      i had this sudden feeling     he went on     that there won   t be all that many water buffalo string holders on the people   s committee .  in fact   i get this kind of   voice telling me that a lot of the people   s committee  correct me if i   m wrong  are standing in front of me right now .         initially  of course     said butterfly .     the peasants can   t even read and write .         i expect they don   t even know how to farm properly     said rincewind  gloomily .     not after doing it for only three or four thousand years .         we certainly believe that there are many improvements that could be made  yes     said butterfly .     if we act collectively .         i bet they   ll be really glad when you show them     said rincewind .   he stared glumly at the floor .  he quite liked the job of a water buffalo string holder .  it sounded nearly as good as the profession of castaway .  he longed for the kind of life where you could really concentrate on the squishiness of the mud underfoot  and make up pictures in the clouds  the kind of life where you could let your mind catch up with you and speculate for hours at a time about when your water buffalo was next going to enrich the loam .  but it was probably difficult enough as it was without people trying to improve it     he wanted to say  how can you be so nice and yet so dumb .  the best thing you can do with the peasants is leave them alone .  let them get on with it .  when people who can read and write start fighting on behalf of people who can   t  you just end up with another kind of stupidity .  if you want to help them  build a big library or something somewhere and leave the door open .   but this is hunghung .  you can   t think like that in hunghung .  this is where people have learned to do what they   re told .  the horde worked that one out .   the empire   s got something worse than whips all right .  it   s got obedience .  whips in the soul .  they obey anyone who tells them what to do .  freedom just means being told what to do by someone different .   you   ll all be killed .   i   m a coward .  and even i know more about fights than you do .  i   ve run away from some really good ones .      oh  let   s just get out of here     he said .  he gingerly took the sword from a dead guard and held it the right way round on the second attempt .  he weighed it for a second  then shook his head and threw it away .   the cadre looked a lot happier .      but i   m not leading you     said rincewind .     i   m just showing you the way .  and it   s the way out  do you understand .      they stood wearing rather bruised looks  as people do who   ve been subject to several minutes    ranting .  no one spoke  until twoflower whispered      he often goes on like this  you know .  and then he does something very brave .      rincewind snorted .   there was another dead guard at the top of the stairs .  sudden death seemed to be catching .   and  leaning against the wall  was a bundle of swords .  tied to it was a scroll .      the great wizard has shown us the way for only two minutes and already we have extra luck     said lotus blossom .      don   t touch the swords     said rincewind .      but supposing we see more guards .  should we not resist them with every drop of our life   s blood .     said butterfly .   rincewind looked blank .     no .  run away .         ah  yes     said twoflower .     and live to fight another day .  that is an ankh morpork saying .      rincewind had always assumed that the purpose of running away was to be able to run away another day .      however     he said     people don   t usually find themselves mysteriously let out of prison with a bunch of weapons handily close by and all the guards out of action .  ever thought of that .         and with a map .     said butterfly .   her eyes shone .  she flourished the scroll .      it   s a map of the way out .     said rincewind .      no .  to the emperor   s chambers .  look  it has been marked .  that   s what herb used to talk about sometimes .  he must be in the palace .  we should assassinate the emperor .         more luck .     said twoflower .     but look  you know  i   m sure if we talked to him           haven   t you been listening .  we are not going to see the emperor .     hissed rincewind .     does it occur to you that guards don   t stab themselves .  cells don   t suddenly become unlocked .  you don   t find swords lying around so conveniently and you don   t  you really don   t find maps saying    this way  folks    .  and anyway  you can   t talk to someone who   s a plate of prawn crackers short of a set meal a for two .         no     said butterfly .     we must make the most of this opportunity .         there will be lots of guards .         well  great wizard  you   ll have a lot of wishing to do .         you think i can snap my fingers like this  and all the guards would drop dead .  hah .  i wish they would .         these two out here have     lotus blossom reported  from the entrance to the dungeons .  she was already in awe of rincewind .  now she looked positively terrified .      coincidence .         let   s be serious     said butterfly .     we have a sympathizer in the palace .  perhaps it is someone risking their lives every moment .  we know some of the eunuchs are on our side .         they   ve got nothing left to lose  i suppose .         you have a better idea  great wizard .         yes .  back into the cells .         what .         this smells wrong .  would you really kill the emperor .  i mean  really .      butterfly hesitated .      we   ve often talked about it .  two fire herb said that if we could assassinate the emperor we would light the torch of freedom           yes .  it   d be you  burning .  look  get back in the cells .  it   s the safest place .  i   ll lock you in and   scout .         that   s a very brave suggestion     said twoflower .     and typical of the man     he added proudly .   butterfly gave rincewind a look he   d come to dread .      it is a good idea     she said .     and i will accompany you .         oh  but it   s bound to be   very dangerous     said rincewind quickly .      no harm can possibly come to me when i   m with the great wizard     said butterfly .      very true .  very true     said twoflower .     no harm ever came to me  i know that .         besides     his daughter went on     i have the map .  and it would be dreadful if you lost your way and accidentally strayed out of the forbidden city  wouldn   t it .      rincewind gave in .  it struck him that twoflower   s late wife must have been a remarkably intelligent woman .      oh  all right     he said .     but you   re not to get in the way .  and you   re to do what i tell you  okay .      butterfly bowed .      lead on  o great wizard     she said .         i knew it .     said truckle .     poison .         no  no .  you don   t eat it .  you rub it on your body     said mr .  saveloy .     watch .  and you get what we in civilization call clean .      most of the horde stood waist deep in the warm water  every man with his hands chastely wrapped around his body .  hamish had refused to relinquish his wheelchair  so only his head was above the surface .      it   s all prickly     said cohen .     and my skin   s peeling off and dissolving .         that   s not skin     said mr .  saveloy .     haven   t any of you seen a bath before .         oh  i seen one     said boy willie .     i killed the mad bishop of pseudopolis in one .  you get      he furrowed his brow      bubbles and stuff .  and fifteen naked maidens .         whut .         definitely .  fifteen .  remember it well .         that   s more like it     said caleb .      all we   ve got to rub is this soap stuff .         the emperor is ritually bathed by twenty two bath women     said six beneficent winds .     i could go and check with the harem eunuchs and wake them up  if you like .  it   s probably allowable under entertaining .      the taxman was warming to his new job .  he   d worked out that although the horde  as individuals  had acquired mountains of cash in their careers as barbarian heroes they   d lost almost all of it engaging in the other activities  he mentally catalogued these as public relations  necessary to the profession  and therefore were entitled to quite a considerable rebate .   the fact that they were registered with no revenue collecting authority anywhere  was entirely a secondary point .  it was the principle that counted .  and the interest  too  of course .      no  no young women  i insist     said mr .  saveloy .     you   re having a bath to get clean .  plenty of time for young women later .         gotta date when all this is over     said caleb  a little shyly  thinking wistfully of one of the few women he   d ever had a conversation with .     she   s got her own farm  she said .  i could be all right for a duck .         i bet teach don   t want you to say that     said boy willie .     i bet he   d say you gotta call it a waterfowl .         huh  huh  hur .         whut .      six beneficent winds sidled over to the teacher as the horde experimented with the bath oil  initially by drinking it .      i   ve worked out what it is you   re going to steal     he said .      oh  yes .     said mr .  saveloy politely .  he was watching caleb who  having had it brought home to him that he might have been adopting the wrong approach all his life  was trying to cut his nails with his sword .      it   s the legendary diamond coffin of schz yu .     said six beneficent winds .      no .  wrong again .         oh .         out of the baths  gentlemen     said the teacher .     i think   yes   you   ve mastered commerce  social intercourse              hur  hur  hur   sorry              and the principles of taxation     mr .  saveloy went on .      have we done that .  what are they  then .     said cohen .      you take away almost all the money that the merchants have got     said six beneficent winds  handing him a towel .      oh  is that it .  i   ve been doing that for years .         no  you   ve been taking away all the money     said mr .  saveloy .     that   s where you go wrong .  you kill too many of them  and the ones you don   t kill you leave too poor .         sounds frightfully good to me     said truckle  excavating the cretaceous contents of an ear .     poor merchants  rich us .         no  no  no .         no  no  no .         yes .  that   s not civilized .         it   s like with sheep     six beneficent winds explained .     you don   t tear their skin off all in one go  you just shear them every year .      the horde looked blank .      hunter gatherers     said mr .  saveloy  with a touch of hopelessness .     wrong metaphor .         it   s the marvelous singing sword of wong  isn   t it .     whispered six beneficent winds .     that   s what you   re going to steal .         no .  in fact     steal    is rather the wrong word .  well  anyway  gentlemen   you might not yet be civilized but at least you   re nice and clean  and many people think this is identical .  time  i think  for   action .      the horde straightened up .  this was back in the area they understood .      to the throne room .     said ghenghiz cohen .   six beneficent winds wasn   t that fast on the uptake  but at last he put two and two together .      it   s the emperor .     he said  and raised his hand to his mouth in horror tinged with evil delight .     you   re going to kidnap him .      diamonds glittered when cohen grinned .      there were two dead guards in the corridor leading to the private imperial apartments .      look  how come you were all taken alive .     whispered rincewind .     the guards i saw had big swords .  how come you   re not dead .         i suppose they planned to torture us     said butterfly .     we did injure ten of them .         oh .  pasted posters on them  did you .  sang revolutionary songs until they gave in .  listen  someone wanted you alive .      the floors sang in the darkness .  every footstep produced a chorus of squeaks and groans  just like the floorboards at the university .  but you didn   t expect that sort of thing in a nice shiny palace like this .      they   re called nightingale floors     said butterfly .     the carpenters put little metal collars around the nails so that no one can creep up unawares .      rincewind looked down at the corpses .  neither man had drawn his sword .  he leaned his weight on his left foot .  the floor squeaked .  then he leaned on his right foot .  the floor groaned .      this isn   t right  then     he whispered .     you can   t creep up on someone on a floor like this .  so someone they knew killed those guards .  let   s get out of here           we go on     said butterfly firmly .      it   s a trap .  someone   s using you to do their dirty work .      she shrugged .     turn left by the big jade statue .         it was four in the morning  an hour before dawn .  there were guards in the official staterooms  but not very many .  after all  this was well inside the forbidden city  with its high walls and small gates .  it wasn   t as though anything was going to happen .   it needed a special type of mind to stand guard over some empty rooms all night .  one big river had such a mind  orbiting gently within the otherwise blissful emptiness of his skull .   they   d happily called him one big river because he was the same size and moved at the same speed as the hung .  everyone had expected him to become a tsimo wrestler  but he   d failed the intelligence test because he hadn   t eaten the table .   it was impossible for him to get bored .  he just didn   t have the imagination .  but  since the visor of his huge helmet registered a permanent expression of metal rage  he   d in any case cultivated the art of going to sleep on his feet .   he was dozing happily now  aware only of an occasional squeaking  like that of a very cautious mouse .   the helmet   s visor swung up .  a voice said     would you rather die than betray your emperor .      a second voice said     this is not a trick question .      one big river blinked  and then turned his gaze downwards .  an apparition in a squeaky wheeled wheelchair had a very large sword pointing at exactly that inconvenient place where his upper armor didn   t quite meet his lower armor .   a third voice said     i should add that the last twenty nine people who answered wrong are   dried shredded fish   sorry  dead .      a fourth voice said     and we   re not eunuchs .      one big river rumbled with the effort of thought .      i tink i rather live     he said .   a man with diamonds where his teeth should have been gave him a comradely pat on the shoulder .     good man     he said .     join the horde .  we could use a man like you .  maybe as a siege weapon .         who you .     he said .      this is ghenghiz cohen     said mr .  saveloy .     doer of mighty deeds .  slayer of dragons .  ravager of cities .  he once bought an apple .      no one laughed .  mr .  saveloy had found that the horde had no concept whatsoever of sarcasm .  probably no one had ever tried it on them .   one big river had been raised to do what he was told .  everyone had told him what to do  all through his life .  he fell in behind the man with diamond teeth because he was the sort of man you followed when he said    follow .         but  you know  there are tens of thousands of men who would die rather than betray their emperor     whispered six beneficent winds  as they filed through the corridors .      i hope so .         some of them will be on guard around the forbidden city .  we   ve avoided them  but they   re still there .  we   ll have to deal with them eventually .         oh  good .     said cohen .      bad     said mr .  saveloy .     that business with the ninjas was just high spirits              high spirits       murmured six beneficent winds .         but you don   t want a big fight out in the open .  it   ll get messy .      cohen walked over to the nearest wall  which had a gorgeous pattern of peacocks  and took out his knife .      paper     he said .     bloody paper .  paper walls .     he poked his head through .  there was a shrill whimper .     oops  sorry  ma   am .  official wall inspection .     he extracted his head  grinning .      but you can   t go through walls .     said six beneficent winds .      why not .         they   re   well  they   re the walls .  what would happen if everyone walked through walls .  what do you think doors are for .         i think they   re for other people     said cohen .     which way   s that throne room .         whut .         this is lateral thinking     explained mr .  saveloy  as they followed him .     ghenghiz is quite good at a certain kind of lateral thinking .         what a lateral .         er .  it   s a kind of muscle  i believe .         thinking with your muscles   yes .  i see     said six beneficent winds .      rincewind sidled into a space between the wall and a statue of a rather jolly dog with its tongue hanging out .      what now .     said butterfly .      how big   s the red army .         we number many thousands     said butterfly  defiantly .      in hunghung .         oh  no .  there is a cadre in every city .         you know that  do you .  you   ve met them .         that would be dangerous .  only two fire herb knows how to contact them           fancy that .  well  do you know what i think .  i think someone wants a revolution .  and you   re all so damn respectful and polite he   s having his work cut out trying to organize one .  but once you   ve got rebels you can do anything .         that can   t be true           the rebels in other cities  they do great revolutionary deeds  do they .         we hear reports all the time .         from our friend herb .      butterfly frowned .      yes           you   re thinking  aren   t you .     said rincewind .     the old brain cells are finally banging together  yes .  good .  have i convinced you .         i   don   t know .         now let   s go back .         no .  now i   ve got to find out if what you   re suggesting is true .         dying to find out  eh .  good grief  you people make me so angry .  look  watch this        rincewind strode to the end of the corridor .  there was a pair of wide doors  flanked by a pair of jade dragons .   he flung them back .   the room inside was low ceilinged but large .  in the center  under a canopy  was a bed .  it was hard to make out the figure lying there  but it had that certain stillness that suggests the kind of sleep from which there is unlikely to be any kind of awakening .      you see .     he said .     he   s been   killed   already        a dozen soldiers were staring at rincewind in amazement .   behind him he heard the creaking of the floor and then some whooshing sounds followed by a noise like wet leather being hit against rock .   rincewind looked at the nearest soldier .  the man was holding a sword .   one drop of blood coursed down the blade and  with a brief pause for dramatic effect  fell on to the floor .   rincewind looked up and raised his hat .      i do beg your pardon     he said  brightly .     isn   t this room  b .      and ran for it .   the floors screamed under him  and behind him someone screamed rincewind   s nickname  which was     don   t let him get away .      let me get away  rincewind prayed  oh  please  let me get away .   he slipped as he turned the corner  skidded through a paper wall and landed in an ornamental fish pond .  but rincewind in full flight had catlike  even messianic abilities .  the water barely rippled under his feet as he bounced off the surface and headed away .   another wall erupted and he was in what was possibly the same corridor .   behind him  someone landed heavily on a valuable koi .   rincewind shot forward again .   from  that was the most important factor in any mindless escape .  you were always running from .  to could look after itself .   he cleared a long flight of shallow stone steps  rolled upright at the bottom and set off at random along another corridor .   his legs had sorted themselves out now .  first the mad  wild dash to get you out of immediate danger and then the good solid strides to put as much distance as possible between you and it .  that was the trick .   history told of a runner who   d run forty miles after a battle to report its successful outcome to those at home .  he was traditionally regarded as the greatest runner of all time  but if he   d been reporting news of an impending battle he   d have been overtaken by rincewind .   and yet   someone was gaining .      a knife poked through the wall of the throne room and cut a hole large enough to afford space for an upright man or one wheelchair .   there was muttering from the horde .      bruce the hoon never went in the back way .         shut up .         never one for back gates  bruce the hoon .         shut up .         when bruce the hoon attacked al khali  he did it right at the main guard tower  with a thousand screaming men on very small horses .         yeah  but   last i saw of bruce the hoon  his head was on a spike .         all right  i   ll grant you that .  but at least it was over the main gate .  i mean  at least he got in .         his head did .         oh  my        mr .  saveloy was gratified .  the room they   d stepped into was enough to silence the horde  if only briefly .  it was large  of course  but that hadn   t been its only purpose .  one sun mirror  as he welded the tribes and countries and little island nations together  had wanted a room built which said to chieftains and ambassadors  this is the biggest space you   ve ever been in  it is more splendid than anything you could ever imagine  and we   ve got a lot more rooms like this .   he had wanted it to be impressive .  he had very clearly wanted it to intimidate mere barbarians so much that they   d give in there and then .  let there be huge statues  he   d said .  and vast decorative hangings .  let there be pillars and carvings .  let the visitor be silenced by the sheer magnificence .  let it say to him     this is civilization  and you can join it or die .  now drop to your knees or be shortened some other way .      the horde gave it the benefit of their inspection .   finally truckle said     it   s all right  i suppose  but not a patch on our chieftain   s longhouse back in skund .  it hasn   t even got a fire in the middle of the floor  look .         gaudy  to my mind .         whut .         typically foreign .         i   d do away with most of this and get some decent straw on the floor  a few shields round the walls .         whut .         mind you  get in a few hundred tables and you could have a helluva carouse in here .      cohen walked across the huge expanse towards the throne  which was under a vast ornamental canopy .         s got    n umbrella over it  look .         probably the roof leaks .  you can   t trust tiles .  a good reed thatch   ll give you forty years bone dry .      the throne was lacquered wood  but with many precious gems set in it .  cohen sat down .      is this it .     he said .     we   ve done it  teach .         yes .  of course  now you have to get away with it     said mr .  saveloy .      i   m sorry     said six beneficent winds .     what   ve you done .         you know that thing we were here to steal .     said the teacher .      yes .         it   s the empire .      the taxman   s expression didn   t change for a few seconds  and then it flowed into a horrified grin .      i think some breakfast is called for before we go any further     said mr .  saveloy .     mr .  winds  perhaps you would be so good as to summon someone .      the taxman was still grinning fixedly .      but   but   you can   t conquer an empire like this .     he managed .     you   ve got to have an army  like the warlords .  just walking in like this   it   s against the rules .  and   and   there are thousands of guards .         yes  but they   re all out there     said mr .  saveloy .      guarding us     said cohen .      but they   re guarding the real emperor .         that   s me     said cohen .      oh  yeah .     said truckle .     who died and made you emperor .         no one has to die     said mr .  saveloy .     it   s called usurping .         that   s right     said cohen .     you just say  see here  gunga din  you   re out on your ear  okay .  piss off to some island somewhere or           ghenghiz     said mr .  saveloy gently     do you think you could refrain from referring to foreigners in that rather offensive fashion .  it   s not civilized .      cohen shrugged .      you   re still going to have big trouble with the guards and things     said six beneficent winds .      maybe not     said cohen .     tell    em  teach .         have you ever seen the  er  former emperor .     said mr .  saveloy .     mr .  winds .         of course not .  hardly anyone has seen        he stopped .      there you are  then     said mr .  saveloy .     very quick on the uptake  mr .  winds .  as befits the lord high chief tax gatherer .         but it won   t work because       six beneficent winds stopped again .  mr .  saveloy   s words reached his brain .      lord high chief .  me .  the black hat with the red ruby button .         yes .         and a feather in it  if you like     said cohen munificently .   the taxman looked in rapt consideration .      so   if there was  say  a mere district administrator who was incredibly cruel to his staff  particularly to a hard working deputy  and thoroughly deserving of a good sound thrashing           as the lord high chief tax gatherer  of course  that would be entirely your affair .      six beneficent winds    grin now threatened to remove the top of his head .      on the subject of new taxation     he said     i   ve often had this thought that fresh air is all too readily available at far below the cost of production           we will listen to your ideas with extreme interest     said mr .  saveloy .     in the meantime  please arrange breakfast .         and have summoned     said cohen     all those buggers who think they know what the emperor looks like .         the pursuer was closing .   rincewind skidded around a corner and there  blocking the passageway  were three guards .  these were not dead .  they were alive  and they had got swords .   someone cannoned into the back of him  pushed him to the ground  and leapt past .   he shut his eyes .   there were a couple of thumps  a groan  and then a very strange metallic noise .   it was a helmet  spinning round and round on the floor .   he was pulled to his feet .      are you going to lie around all day .     said butterfly .     come on .  they   re not far behind .      rincewind glanced at the recumbent guards  and then loped after the girl .      how many of them are there .     he managed .      seven now .  but two of them are limping and one   s having trouble breathing .  come on .         you hit them .         do you always waste breath like this .         never found anyone who could keep up with me before .      they turned a corner and almost ran into another guard .   butterfly didn   t even stop .  she took a ladylike step  whirled around on one foot  and kicked the man so hard on his ear that he spun on his own axis and landed on his head .   she paused  panted  and tucked a hair back into place .      we should split up     she said .      oh  no .     said rincewind .     i mean  i must protect you .         i   ll head back to the others .  you lead the guards away somewhere           can you all do that .         of course     said butterfly  testily .     i told you we fought the guards .  now  if we split up one of us is bound to escape .  the murderers .  we were supposed to take the blame for that .         didn   t i try to tell you .  i thought you wanted him dead .         yes  but we   re rebels .  they were palace guards .         er           no time .  see you in heaven .      she darted away .      oh .      rincewind looked around .  it had all gone quiet .   guards appeared at the end of the corridor  but cautiously  as befitted people who   d just met butterfly .      there .         is it her .         no  it   s him .         get him .      he accelerated again  rounded a corner  and found that he was in a cul de sac that would undoubtedly  given the sounds behind  become a dead end .  but there was a pair of doors .  he kicked them open  ran inside  and slowed     the room inside was dark  but the sound and air suggested a large space and a certain flatulent component indicated some kind of stable .   there was some light  though  from a fire .  rincewind trotted towards it and saw that it was under a huge cauldron  man sized  full of boiling rice .   and now that his eyes were accustomed to the gloom he realized that there were shapes lying on slabs along both walls of an enormous room .   they were snoring gently .   they were  in fact  people .  they might even have been humans  or at least had humans in their ancestry before someone  hundreds of years ago  had said     let   s see how big and fat we can breed people .  let   s try for really big bastards .      each giant frame was dressed in what looked like a nappy to rincewind   s eyes and was dozing happily alongside a bowl holding enough rice to explode twenty people  just in case it woke up in the night and felt like a light snack .   a couple of his pursuers appeared in the doorway  and stopped .  then they advanced  but very cautiously  carefully watching the gently moving mounds .      oi  oi  oi .     shouted rincewind .   the men stopped and stared at him .      wakey wakey .  let   s see the rising sons .     he grabbed a mighty ladle and banged it on the rice cauldron .      up you get .  hands off er whatever you can find and on with socks .      the sleepers stirred .      oooorrrrr .         ooooaaaoooooor .      the room shook as forty tree trunk legs swung off the slabs .  flesh rearranged itself so that  in the gloom  rincewind appeared to be being watched by twenty small pyramids .      haaaroooooohhhh .         those men     said rincewind  pointing desperately at his pursuers  who were slowly backing away     those men have a pork sandwich .         oorrryorrraaah .         oooorrrr .         with mustard .         oooorrrr .      twenty very small heads turned .  a total of eighty specialized neurons fired into life .   and the floor shook .  the wrestlers started to move hopefully towards the men  in a slow but deliberate run designed to be halted only by collision with another wrestler or a continent .      oooorrr .      rincewind dashed for the far door and burst through it .  a couple of men were sitting in a small room drinking tea and playing shibo  watched by a third .      the wrestlers are wrestless .     he shouted .     i think you   ve got a stampede going on .      a man threw down his shibo tiles .     blast .  and it   s been at least an hour since they were fed .      the men grabbed various nets and prods and items of protective clothing  leaving rincewind alone .   there was another door .  he sashayed through it .  he   d never essayed a sashay before  but he reckoned he was due a sashay for quick thinking .   there was another passage .  he ran down it  on the basis that absence of pursuit is no reason to stop running .      lord hong was folding paper .   he was an expert at it because when he did it he gave it his full attention .  lord hong had a mind like a knife  although possibly a knife with a curved blade .   the door slid aside .  a guard  red in the face from running  threw himself on to the floor .      o lord hong  who is exalted           yes  indeed     said lord hong distantly  essaying a taxing crease .     what has gone wrong this time .         my lord .         i asked you what has gone wrong .         uh   we killed the emperor as directed           by whom .         my lord .  you commanded it .         did i .     said lord hong  folding the paper lengthwise .   the guard shut his eyes .  he had a vision  a very short vision  of the future .  there was a spike in it .  he carried on .      but the   prisoners can   t be found anywhere  lord .  we heard someone approach and then   well  we saw two people  lord .  we   re chasing them .  but the others have vanished .         no slogans .  no revolutionary posters .  no culprits .         no  lord .         i see .  remain here .      lord hong   s hands continued with the folding as he looked at the room   s other occupant .      you have something to say  two fire herb .     he said pleasantly .   the revolutionary leader looked sheepish .      the red army has been quite expensive     said lord hong .     the printing costs alone   and you cannot say i have not helped you .  we unlocked the doors and killed the guards and gave your wretched people swords and a map  did we not .  and now i can hardly claim that they killed the emperor  may he stay dead for ten thousand years  when there is no sign of them .  people will ask too many questions .  i can hardly kill everyone .  and we appear to have some barbarians in the building  too .         something must have gone wrong  my lord .     herb was hypnotized by the moving hands as they caressed that paper .      what a pity .  i do not like it when things go wrong .  guard .  redeem your miserable self .  take him away .  i will have to try a different plan .         my lord .         yes  two fire herb .         when you   when we agreed   when it was agreed that the red army should be turned over to you  you did promise me indemnity .      lord hong smiled .      oh  yes .  i recall .  i said  did i not  that i would neither say nor write any order for your death .  and i must keep my word  otherwise what am i .      he folded the last crease and opened his hands  putting the little paper decoration on the lacquered table beside him .   herb and the guard stared at it .      guard   take him away     said lord hong .   it was a marvellously constructed paper figure of a man .   but there didn   t seem to have been enough paper for a head .      the immediate court turned out to be about eighty men  women  and eunuchs  in various states of sleeplessness .   they were astonished at what sat on the throne .   the horde were quite astonished at the court .      who   re all them vinegar faced old baggages at the front .     whispered cohen  who was idly tossing a throwing knife into the air and catching it again .     i wouldn   t even set fire to them .         they   re the wives of former emperors     hissed six beneficent winds .      we don   t have to marry them  do we .         i don   t think so .         why   re their feet so small .     said cohen .     i like to see big feet on a woman .      six beneficent winds told him .  cohen   s expression hardened .      i   m learning a lot about civilization  i am     he said .     long fingernails  crippled feet and servants running around without their family jewels .  huh .         what is going on here  pray .     said a middle aged man .     who are you .  who are these old eunuchs .         who   re you .     said cohen .  he drew his sword .     i need to know so   s it can be put on your gravestone           i wonder if i might effect some introductions at this point .     said mr .  saveloy .  he stepped forward .      this     he said     is ghenghiz cohen   put it away  ghenghiz   who is technically a barbarian  and this is his horde .  they have overrun your city .  and you are    .         barbarian invaders .     said the man haughtily  ignoring him .     barbarian invaders come in their thousands .  big screaming men on little horses .         i told you     said truckle .     but would anyone listen .            and there is fire  terror  rapine  looting  and blood in the streets .         we haven   t had breakfast yet     said cohen  tossing his knife into the air again .      hah .  i would rather die than submit to such as you .      cohen shrugged .     why didn   t you say earlier .         oops     said six beneficent winds .   it was a very accurate throw .      who was he  anyway .     said cohen  as the body folded up .     anyone know who he was .         ghenghiz     said mr .  saveloy     i   ve kept meaning to tell you  when people say they   d rather die  they don   t really mean they   d rather die .  not always .         why   d they say it  then .         it   s the done thing .         is this civilization again .         i   m afraid so .         let   s settle this once and for all  shall we .     said cohen .  he stood up .     hands up those who   d rather die than have me as emperor .         anyone .     said mr .  saveloy .      rincewind trotted along another passage .  was there no outside to this place .  several times he thought he   d found an exit  but it led only to a courtyard within the huge building  filled with tinkling fountains and willow trees .   and the place was waking up .  there were        running steps behind him .   a voice shouted     hey        he dived for the nearest door .   the room beyond was full of steam .  it roiled in great billowing clouds .  he could dimly make out a figure toiling at the huge wheel and the words    torture chamber    crossed his mind until the smell of soap replaced them with the word    laundry .     rather wan but incredibly clean figures looked up from their vats and watched him with barely a hint of interest .   they did not look like people in close touch with current events .   he half ran  half sauntered between the bubbling cauldrons .      keep it up .  good man .  that   s it  scrub  scrub  scrub .  let me see those wringers wringing .  well done .  is there another door out of here .  good bubbles there  very good bubbles .  ah        one of the laundry workers  who appeared to be in charge  gave him a suspicious glare and seemed to be about to say something .   rincewind dodged through a courtyard crisscrossed with washing lines and stopped  panting  with his back to a wall .   although it was against his general principles  it was perhaps time to stop and think .   people were chasing him .  that is to say  they were chasing a running figure in a faded red robe and a very charred pointy hat .   it took a great effort for rincewind to come to terms with the idea  but it was just possible that if he was wearing something else he might not be chased .   on the line in front of him  shirts and trousers flapped in the breeze .  their construction was to tailoring in the same way that woodchopping is to carpentry .  someone had mastered the art of the tube  and left it at that .  they looked just like the clothes nearly everyone wore in hunghung .   the palace was almost a city in its own right  said the voice of reason .  it must be full of people on all sorts of errands  it added .   it would mean   taking off our hat  it added .   rincewind hesitated .  it would be hard for a non wizard to grasp the enormity of the suggestion .  a wizard would sooner go without his robe and trousers than forgo his hat .  without his hat  people might think he was an ordinary person .   there was shouting in the distance .   the voice of reason could see that if it wasn   t careful it was going to end up as dead as the rest of rincewind and added sarcastically  all right  keep our wretched hat .  our damn hat is why we   re in this mess in the first place .  perhaps you think you   re going to have a head left to wear it on .   rincewind   s hands  also aware that times were going to be extremely interesting and very short unless they took matters into themselves  reached out slowly and removed a pair of pants and a shirt and rammed them inside his robe .   the door burst open .  there were still guards behind him  and a couple of the tsimo herders had joined in the chase .  one of them waved a prod in rincewind   s direction .   he plunged towards an archway and out into a garden .   it had a little pagoda .  it had willow trees  and a pretty lady on a bridge feeding the birds .   and a man painting a plate .      cohen rubbed his hands together .      no one .  good .  that   s all sorted  then .         ahem .      a small man at the front of the crowd made a great play of keeping his hands to himself  but said      excuse me  but   what would happen in the hypothetical situation of us calling the guards and denouncing you .         we   d kill you all before they were halfway through the door     said cohen  matter of factly .     any more questions .     he added  to a chorus of gasps .      er   the emperor   that is to say  the last emperor   had some very special guards        there was a tinkling sound .  something small and multi pointed rolled down the steps and spun round on the floor .  it was a throwing star .      met them     said boy willie .      fine  fine     said the little man .     that all seems in order .  ten thousand years to the emperor .      the shout was taken up  a little raggedly .      what   s your name  young man .     said mr .  saveloy .      four big horns  my lord .         very good .  very good .  i can see that you will go a long way .  what is your job .         i am grand assistant to the lord chamberlain  my lord .         which one of you is the lord chamberlain .      four big horns pointed to the man who had preferred to die .      there we are  you see .     said mr .  saveloy .     promotion comes fast to adaptable people  lord chamberlain .  and now  the emperor will breakfast .         and what is his pleasure .     said the new lord chamberlain  endeavoring to look bright and adaptable .      all sorts of things .  but right now  big lumps of meat and lots of beer .  you will find the emperor very easy to cater for .     mr .  saveloy smiled the knowing little smile he sometimes smiled when he knew he was the only one seeing the joke .     the emperor doesn   t favor what he calls    fiddly foreign muck full of eyeballs and suchlike    and much prefers simple  wholesome food like sausages  which are made of miscellaneous animal organs minced up in a length of intestine .  ahaha .  but if you want to please him  just keep up the big lumps of meat .  isn   t that so  my lord .      cohen had been gazing at the assembled courtiers .  when you   ve survived for ninety years all the attacks that can be thrown at you by men  women  trolls  dwarfs  giants  green things with lots of legs  and  on one occasion  an enraged lobster  you can learn a lot by looking at faces .      eh .     said cohen .     oh .  yep .  right enough .  big lumps .  here  mr .  taxman   what do these people do all day .         what would you like them to do .         i   d like them to bugger off .         sorry  my lord .          complicated pictogram      said mr .  saveloy .  the new lord chamberlain looked a little startled .      what  here .         it   s a figure of speech  lad .  he just means he wants everyone to go away quickly .      the court scurried out .  a sufficiently complicated pictogram is worth a thousand words .       after the stampede the artist three solid frogs got to his feet  retrieved his brush from his nostril  pulled his easel out of a tree  and tried to think placid thoughts .   the garden was not what it had been .   the willow tree was bent .  the pagoda had been demolished by an out of control wrestler  who had eaten the roof .  the doves had flown .  the little bridge had been broken .  his model  the concubine jade fan  had run off crying after she   d managed to scramble out of the ornamental pond .   and someone had stolen his straw hat .   three solid frogs adjusted what remained of his dress and endeavored to compose himself .   the plate with his sketch on had been smashed  of course .   he pulled another one out of his bag and reached for his palette .   there was a huge footprint in the middle of it     he wanted to cry .  he   d had such a good feeling about this picture .  he just knew it would be one that people would remember for a long time .  and the colors .  did anyone understand how much vermilion cost these days .   he pulled himself together .  so there was only blue left .  well  he   d show them     he tried to ignore the devastation in front of him and concentrated on the picture in his mind .      let me see  now     he thought .     jade fan being pursued over a bridge by man waving his arms and screaming     get out of the way .     followed by man with prod  three guards  five laundry men  and a wrestler unable to stop .      he had to simplify it a bit  of course .      the pursuers rounded a corner  except for the wrestler  who wasn   t built for such a difficult maneuver .      where   d he go .      they were in a courtyard .  there were pigsties on one side  and middens on the other .   and  in the middle of the courtyard  a pointy hat .   one of the guards reached out and grabbed a colleague   s arm before the man stepped forward .      steady now     he said .      it   s just a hat .         so where   s the rest of him .  he couldn   t have just   disappeared   into        they backed away .      you heard about him too .         they said he blew a hole in the wall just by waving his hands .         that   s nothing .  i heard he appeared on an invisible dragon up in the mountains .         what shall we tell lord hong .         i don   t want to be blown to pieces .         i don   t want to tell lord hong we lost him .  we   re in enough trouble already .  and i   ve only just paid for this helmet .         well   we could take the hat .  that   d be evidence .         right .  you pick it up .         me .  you pick it up .         it might be surrounded by terrible spells .         really .  so it   s all right for me to touch it .  thank you .  get one of them to pick it up .      the laundry men backed away  the hunghungese habit of obedience evaporating like morning dew .  the soldiers weren   t the only ones to have heard rumors .      not us .         got a rush order for socks .      the guard turned .  a peasant was stumbling out of one of the pigsties  carrying a sack  his face covered by his big straw hat .      hey  you .      the man dropped to his knees and banged his head on the ground .      don   t kill me .      the guards exchanged a glance .      we ain   t going to kill you     said one of them .     we just want you to try and pick up that hat over there .         what hat  o mighty warrior .         that hat there .  right now .      the man crawled crabwise across the cobbles .      this hat  o great lord .         yes .      the man   s fingers crept over the stones and prodded the hat   s ragged brim .   then he screamed .      your wife is a big hippo .  my face is melting .  my face is meltinnnnggg .      rincewind waited until the sound of fleeing sandals had quite faded  and then stood up  dusted off his hat  and put it in the sack .   that had gone a lot better than he   d expected .  so there was another valuable thing to know about the empire  no one looked at peasants .  it must be the clothes and the hat .  no one but the common people dressed like that  so anyone dressed like that must be a common person .  it was the advertising principle of a wizard   s hat  but in reverse .  you were careful and polite around people in a pointy hat  in case they took a very physical offense  whereas someone in a big straw hat was a suitable target for a    hey  you .     and a     it was at exactly this point that someone behind him shouted     hey  you .     and hit rincewind across the shoulders with a stick .   the irate face of a servant appeared in front of him .  the man waved a finger in front of rincewind   s nose .      you are late .  you are a bad man .  get inside right now .         i        the stick hit rincewind again .  the servant pointed at a distant doorway .      insolence .  shame .  go to work .      rincewind   s brain prepared the words  oh  so we think we   re clever san just because we   ve got a big stick  do we .  well  i happen to be a great wizard and you know what you can do with your big stick .   somewhere between the brain and his mouth they became      yessir .  right away .         the horde were left alone .      well  gentlemen  we did it     said mr .  saveloy eventually .     you have the world on a plate .         all the treasure we want     said truckle .      that   s right .         let   s not hang around  then     said truckle .     let   s get some sacks .         there   s no point     said mr .  saveloy .     you   d only be stealing from yourselves .  this is an empire .  you don   t just shove it in a bag and divvy it up at the next campfire .         how about the ravishing .      mr .  saveloy sighed .     there are  i understand  three hundred concubines in the imperial harem .  i   m sure they will be very pleased to see you  although matters will be improved if you take your boots off .      the old men wore the puzzled look such as might be worn by fish trying to understand the concept of the bicycle .      we ought to take just small stuff     said boy willie at last .     rubies and emeralds  for preference .         and chuck a match on the place as we go out     said vincent .     these paper walls and all this lacquered wood should go up a treat .         no  no  no .     said mr .  saveloy .     the vases in this room alone are priceless .         nah  too big to carry .  can   t get    em onna horse .         but i   ve shown you civilization .     said mr .  saveloy .      yeah .  it   s all right to visit .  ain   t that so  cohen .      cohen was hunched down in the throne  glaring at the far wall .      what   s that .         i   m saying we take everything we can carry and head off back home  right .         home   yeah           that was the plan  yeah .      cohen didn   t look at mr .  saveloy   s face .      yeah   the plan       he said .      it   s a good plan     said truckle .     great idea .  you move in as boss .  fine .  great scam .  saves trouble .  none of that fiddling with locks and things .  so we   ll all be off home  okay .  with all the treasure we can carry .         what for .     said cohen .      what for .  it   s treasure .      cohen seemed to reach a decision .      what did you spend your last haul on  truckle .  you said you got three sacks of gold and gems from that haunted castle .      truckle looked puzzled  as if cohen had asked what purple smelled like .      spend it on .  i dunno .  you know how it is .  what   s it matter what you spend it on .  it   s loot .  anyway   what do you spend yours on .      cohen sighed .   truckle gaped at him .      you   re not thinking of really staying here .     he glared at mr .  saveloy .     have you two been cooking up something .      cohen drummed his fingers on the arm of the throne .     you said go home     he said .     where to .         well   wherever           and hamish there           whut .  whut .         i mean   he   s a hundred and five  right .  time to settle down  maybe .         whut .         settle down .     said truckle .     you tried it once .  stole a farm and said you was goin    to raise pigs .  gave it up after   what was it .    three hours .         whutzeesayin    .  whutzeesayin    .         he said it   s time you settled down  hamish .         bugrthat .         the kitchens were in uproar .  half the court had ended up there  in most cases for the first time .  the place was as crowded as a street market  through which the servants tried to go about their business as best they could .   the fact that one of them seemed a little unclear as to what his business actually consisted of was quite unnoticed in the turmoil .      did you smell him .     said lady two streams .     the stink .         like a hot day in a pig yard .     said lady peach petal .      i   m pleased to say i have never experienced that     said lady two streams haughtily .   lady jade night  who was rather younger than the other two  and who had been rather attracted to cohen   s smell of unwashed lion  said nothing .   the head cook said     just that .  big lumps .  why doesn   t he just eat a cow while he   s about it .         you wait till you hear about this devil food called sausage     said the lord chamberlain .      big lumps .     the cook was almost in tears .     where   s the skill in big lumps of meat .  not even sauce .  i   d rather die than simply heat up big lumps of meat .         ah     said the new lord chamberlain     i should think very carefully about that .  the new emperor  may he have a bath for ten thousand years  tends to interpret that as a request        the babble of voices stopped .  the cause of the sudden silence was one small  sharp noise .  it was a cork  popping .   lord hong had a grand vizier   s talent for apparently turning up out of nowhere .  his gaze swept the kitchens .  it was certainly the only housework that he had ever done .   he stepped forward .  he   d taken a small black bottle from out of the sleeve of his robe .      bring me the meat     he said .     the sauce will take care of itself .      the assembled people watched with horrified interest .  poison was all part of the hunghungese court etiquette but people generally did it while hidden from sight somewhere  out of good manners .      is there anyone     said lord hong     who has anything they would like to say .      his gaze was like a scythe .  as it swung around the room people wavered  and hesitated  and fell .      very well     said lord hong .     i would rather die than see a   barbarian on the imperial throne .  let him have his   big lumps .  bring me the meat .      there was movement in the ground  and the sound of shouting and the thump of a stick .  a peasant scuttled forward  reluctantly wheeling a huge covered dish on a trolley .   at the sight of lord hong he pushed the trolley aside  flung himself forward and grovelled .      i avert my gaze from your   an orchard in a favorable position   damn    countenance  o lord .      lord hong prodded the prone figure with his foot .      it is good to see the arts of respect maintained     he observed .     remove the lid .      the man got up and  still bowing and ducking  lifted the cover .   lord hong upended the bottle and held it there until the last drop had hissed out .  his audience was transfixed .      and now let it be taken to the barbarians     he said .      certainly  your celestial   ink brush   willow frond   righteousness .         where are you from  peasant .         bes pelargic  o lord .         ah .  i thought so .         the big bamboo doors slid back .  the new lord chamberlain stepped in  followed by a caravan of trolleys .      breakfast  o lord of a thousand years     he said .     big lumps of pig  big lumps of goat  big lumps of ox  and seven fried rice .      one of the servants lifted the lid of a dish .     but take my tip and don   t go for this pork     he said .     it   s been poisoned .      the chamberlain spun around .      insolent pig .  you will die for this .         it   s rincewind  isn   t it .     said cohen .     looks like rincewind           got my hat here somewhere     said rincewind .     had to stuff it down my trousers           poison .     said cohen .     you sure .         well  okay  it was a black bottle and it had a skull and crossbones on it and when he tipped it out it smoked     said rincewind  as mr .  saveloy helped him up .     was it anchovy essence .  i don   t think so .         poison     said cohen .     i hate poisoners .  just about the worst sort  poisoners .  creeping around  putting muck in a man   s grub        he glared at the chamberlain .      was it you .     he looked at rincewind and jerked a thumb towards the cowering chamberlain .     was it him .  because if it was he   s going to get done to him what i did to the mad snake priests of start  and this time i   ll use both thumbs .         no     said rincewind .     it was someone they called lord hong .  but they all watched him do it .      a little scream erupted from the lord chamberlain .  he threw himself to the floor and was about to kiss cohen   s foot until he realized that this would have about the same effect as eating the pork .      mercy  o celestial being .  we are all pawns in the hands of lord hong .         what   s so special about lord hong  then .         he   s   a fine man .     the chamberlain gibbered .     i won   t say a word against lord hong .  i certainly don   t believe it   s true that he has spies everywhere .  long life to lord hong  that   s what i say .      he risked looking up and found the point of cohen   s sword just in front of his eyes .      yeah  but right now who   re you more frightened of .  me or this lord hong .         uh   lord hong .      cohen raised an eyebrow .     i   m impressed .  spies everywhere  eh .      he looked around the huge room and his gaze came to rest on a very large vase .  he sauntered over to it and raised the lid .      you okay in there .         er   yes .     said a voice from the depths of the vase .      got everythin    you want .  spare notebook .  potty .         er   yes .         would you like  oh  let   s say about sixty gallons of boiling water .         er   no .         would you rather die than betray lord hong .         er   can i have a moment to think about it  please .         no problem .  it takes a long time to heat the water in any case .  as you were  then .      he replaced the lid .      one big mother .     he said .      that   s one big river  ghenghiz     said mr .  saveloy .   the guard rumbled into life .      just you watch this vase and if it moves again you do to it what i once did to the green necromancer of the night  all right .         don   t know what that was you did  lord     said the soldier .   cohen told him .  one big river beamed .  from inside the jar came the noise of someone trying not to be sick .   cohen strolled back to the throne .      so tell me a bit more about lord hong  then     he said .      he   s the grand vizier     said the chamberlain .   cohen and rincewind looked at one another .      that   s right .  and everyone knows     said rincewind     that grand viziers are always              complete and utter bastards     said cohen .     dunno why .  give    em a turban with a point in the middle and their moral wossname just gets eaten away .  i always kill    em soon as i meet    em .  saves time later on .         i thought there was something fishy about him as soon as i saw him     said rincewind .     look  cohen           that   s emperor cohen to you     said truckle .     i   ve never trusted wizards  mister .  never trusted any man in a dress .         rincewind   s all right       said cohen .      thank you .     said rincewind .         but a bloody useless wizard .         i just happened to risk my neck to save you  thank you so very much     said rincewind .     look  some friends of mine are in the prison block .  could you   emperor .         sort of     said cohen .      temp   ry     said truckle .      technically     said mr .  saveloy .      does that mean you can get my friends somewhere safe .  i think lord hong has murdered the old emperor and wants them to take the blame .  i   m just hoping he won   t believe they   ll be hiding in the cells .         why in the cells .     said cohen .      because if i had the chance to get away from lord hong   s cells i would     said rincewind  fervently .     no one in their right minds   d go back inside if they thought they had a chance to get away .         okay     said cohen .     boy willie  one big mother  go and round up some of your mates and bring those people here .         here .     said rincewind .     i wanted them to be somewhere safe .         well  we   re here     said cohen .     we can protect    em .         who   s going to protect you .      cohen ignored this .     lord chamberlain     he said     i don   t    spect lord hong   ll be around but   in the court was a guy with a nose like a badger .  a fat bugger  he was  with a big pink hat .  and a skinny woman with a face like a hatful of pins .         that would be lord nine mountains and lady two streams     said the lord chamberlain .     er .  you are not angry with me  o lord .         gods bless you  no     said cohen .     in fact  mister  i   m so impressed i   m going to give you extra responsibilities .         lord .         food taster  for a start .  and now go and fetch them other two .  didn   t like the look of them at all .      nine mountains and two streams were ushered in a few moments later .  their merest glance from cohen to the untouched food would have passed entirely unnoticed by those who weren   t watching for it .   cohen nodded cheerfully at them .     eat it     he said .      my lord .  i had a large breakfast .  i am entirely full .     said nine mountains .      that   s a pity     said cohen .     one big mother  before you go off just see mr .  nine mountains over there and make some room in him so he can have another breakfast .  the same goes for the lady  too  if i don   t hear chomping in the next five seconds .  a good mouthful of everything  understand .  with lots of sauce .      one big river drew his sword .   the two nobles stared fixedly at the glistening mounds .      looks good to me     said cohen conversationally .     the way you   re looking at it  anyone   d think there was something wrong with it .      nine mountains gingerly put a piece of pork into his mouth .      extremely good     he said  indistinctly .      now swallow     said cohen .   the mandarin gulped .      marvelous     he said .     and now  if your excellency will excuse me  i           don   t rush off     said cohen .     we don   t want you accidentally sticking your fingers down your throat or anything like that  do we .      nine mountains hiccuped .   then he hiccupped again .   smoke appeared to be rising from the bottom of his robe .   the horde dived for cover just as the explosion removed an area of floorboards  a circular part of the ceiling and all of lord nine mountains .   a black hat with a ruby button on it spun around on the floor for a moment .      that   s just like me and pickled onions     said vincent .   lady two streams was standing with her eyes shut .      not hungry .     said cohen .   she nodded .   cohen leaned back .      one big mother .         it   s    river     cohen     said mr .  saveloy  as the guard lumbered forward .      take her with you and put her in one of the dungeons .  see that she has plenty to eat  if you know what i mean .         yes  excellency .         and mr .  chamberlain here can push off down to the kitchen again and tell the chef he   s going to share what we eat this time  and he   s gonna eat it first  all right .         yes indeed  excellency .         call this living .     caleb burst out  as the lord chamberlain scuttled away .     this is being emperor  is it .  can   t even trust the food .  we   ll probably be murdered in our beds .         can   t see you being murdered in your bed     said truckle .      yeah     cos you   re never in it     said cohen .   he walked over to the big jar and gave it a kick .      you getting all this .         yessir     said the jar .   there was some laughter .  but it had an edge of nervousness .  mr .  saveloy realized that the horde weren   t used to this .  if a true barbarian wanted to kill someone during a meal  he   d invite him in with all his henchmen  sit them down  get them drunk and sleepy and then summon his own men from hiding places to massacre them instantly in a straight forward  no nonsense and honorable manner .  it was completely fair .  the    get them drunk and butcher the lot of them    stratagem was the oldest trick in the book  or would have been if barbarians bothered with books .  anyone falling for it would be doing the world a favor by being slaughtered over the pudding .  but at least you could trust the food .  barbarians didn   t poison food .  you never knew when you might be short of a mouthful yourself .      excuse me  your excellency     said six beneficent winds  who had been hovering     i think lord truckle is right .  er .  i know a little history .  the correct method of succession is to wade to the throne through seas of blood .  that is what lord hong is planning to do .         you say .  seas of blood  right .         or over a mountain of skulls .  that   s an option  too .         but   but   i thought the imperial crown was handed down from father to son     said mr .  saveloy .      well  yes     said six beneficent winds .     i suppose that could happen in theory .         you said once we were at the top of the pyramid everyone   d do what we said     said cohen to mr .  saveloy .   truckle looked from one to the other .     you two planned this .     he said accusingly .     this is what it   s all been about  isn   t it .  all that learnin    to be civilized .  and right at the start you just said it was going to be a really big theft .  eh .  i thought we were just going to nick a load of stuff and push off .  loot and pillage  that   s the way           oh  loot and pillage  loot and pillage  i   ve had it up to here with loot and pillage .     said mr .  saveloy .     is that all you can think of  looting and pillaging .         well  there used to be ravishing  too     said vincent wistfully .      i hate to tell you  but they   ve got a point  teach     said cohen .     fightin    and lootin      that   s what we do .  i ain   t happy with all this bowing and scraping business .  i ain   t sure if i was cut out for civilization .      mr .  saveloy rolled his eyes .     even you  cohen .  you   re all so   dim witted .     he snapped .     i don   t know why i bother .  i mean  look at you .  you know what you are .  you   re legends .      the horde stepped back .  no one had ever seen teach lose his temper before .      from legendum  which means    something written down        said mr .  saveloy .     books  you know .  reading and writing .  which incidentally is as alien to you as the lost city of ee        truckle   s hand went up  a little nervously .      actually  i once discovered the lost city of           shut up .  i   m saying   what was i saying .    yes   you don   t read  do you .  you never learned to read .  then you   ve wasted half your life .  you could have been accumulating pearls of wisdom instead of rather shoddy gems .  it   s just as well people read about you and don   t meet you face to face because  gentlemen  you are a big disappointment .      rincewind watched  fascinated  waiting for mr .  saveloy to have his head cut off .  but this didn   t seem about to happen .  he was possibly too angry to be beheaded .      what have you actually done  gentlemen .  and don   t tell me about stolen jewels and demon lords .  what have you done that   s real .      truckle raised a hand again .      well  i once killed all four of the           yes  yes  yes     said mr .  saveloy .     you killed this and you stole that and you defeated the giant man eating avocados of somewhere else  but   it   s all   stuff .  it   s just wallpaper  gentlemen .  it never changes anything .  no one cares .  back in ankh morpork i   ve taught boys who think you are myths .  that   s what you   ve achieved .  they don   t believe you ever really existed .  they think someone made you up .  you   re stories  gentlemen .  when you die no one will know  because they think you   re already dead .      he paused for breath  and then continued more slowly .     but here   here you could be real .  you could stop playing at your lives .  you could take this ancient and somewhat rotten empire back into the world .  at least       he trailed off .     that   s what i   d hoped .  i really thought that  perhaps  we might actually achieve something        he sat down .   the horde stood staring at its various feet or wheels .      um .  can i say something .  the warlords will all be against you     said six beneficent winds .     they   re out there now  with their armies .  normally they   d fight amongst themselves  but they   ll all fight you .         they   d rather have some poisoner like this hong instead of me .     said cohen .     but he   s a bastard .         yes  but   he   s their bastard  you see .         we could hold out here .  this place has got thick walls     said vincent .     the ones not made of paper  that is .         don   t think about that     said truckle .     not a siege .  sieges are messy .  i hate eating boots and rats .         whut .         he said we don   t want a siege where we have to eat boots and rats  hamish .         run outa legs  have we .         how many soldiers have they got .     said cohen .      i think   six or seven hundred thousand     said the taxman .      excuse us     said cohen  getting off the throne .     i have to join my horde .      the horde went into a huddle .  there was an occasional    whut .     in the hoarse whispered interchanges .  then cohen turned round .      seas of blood  wasn   t it .     he said .      er .  yes     said the taxman .   the huddle resumed .   after some further exchanges truckle   s head poked up .      did you say mountain of skulls .     he said .      yes .  yes  i think that   s what i said     said the taxman .  he glanced nervously at rincewind and mr .  saveloy  who shrugged .   whisper  whisper  whut        excuse me .         yes .         about how big a mountain .  skulls don   t pile up that well .         i don   t know how big a mountain .  a lot of skulls .         just checking .      the horde seemed to reach a decision .  they turned to face the other men .      we   re going to fight     said cohen .      yes  you should have said all that about skulls and blood before     said truckle .      we   ll show ye whether we   m dead or not .     cackled hamish .   mr .  saveloy shook his head .      i think you must have misheard .  the odds are a hundred thousand to one .     he said .      i reckon that   ll show people we   re still alive     said caleb .      yes  but the whole point of my plan was to show you that you could get to the top of the pyramid without having to fight your way up     said mr .  saveloy .     it really is possible in such a stale society .  but if you try to fight hundreds of thousands of men you   ll die .      and then  to his surprise  he found himself adding     probably .      the horde grinned at him .      big odds don   t frighten us     said truckle .      we like big odds     said caleb .      y   see  teach  odds of a thousand to one ain   t a lot worse than ten to one     said cohen .     the reasons bein          he counted on his fingers .     one  your basic soldier who   s fightin    for pay rather than his life ain   t goin    to stick his neck out when there   s all these other blokes around who might as well do the business  and  two  not very many of    em are goin    to be able to get near us at one time and they   ll all be pushin    and shovin     and       he looked at his fingers with an expression of terminal calculation .         three       said mr .  saveloy  hypnotized by this logic .         three  right   half the time when they swings their swords they   ll hit one of their mates  savin    us a bit of effort .  see .         but even if that were true it   d only work for a little while     mr .  saveloy protested .     even if you killed as many as two hundred you   d be tired and there   d be fresh troops attacking you .         oh  they   d be tired  too     said cohen cheerfully .      why .         because by then  to get to us  they   d have to be running uphill .         that   s logic  that is     said truckle  approvingly .   cohen slapped the shaken teacher on the back .      don   t you worry about a thing     he said .     if we   ve got the empire by your kind of plan  we   ll keep it by our kind of plan .  you   ve shown us civilization  so we   ll shown you barbarism .      he walked a few steps and then turned  an evil glint in his eye .     barbarism .  hah .  when we kills people we do it there and then  lookin       em in the eye  and we   d be happy to buy    em a drink in the next world  no harm done .  i never knew a barbarian who cut up people slowly in little rooms  or tortured women to make    em look pretty  or put poison in people   s grub .  civilization .  if that   s civilization  you can shove it where the sun don   t shine .         whut .         he said shove it where the sun doesn   t shine  hamish .         ah .  bin there .         but there is more to civilization than that .     said mr .  saveloy .     there   s   music  and literature  and the concept of justice  and the ideals of        the bamboo doors slid aside .  as one man  joints creaking  the horde turned with weapons raised .   the men in the doorway were taller and much more richly dressed than the peasants  and they moved in the manner of people who are used to there being no one in the way .  ahead of them  though  was a trembling peasant holding a red flag on a stick .  he was prodded into the room at swordpoint .      red flag .     whispered cohen .      it means they want to parley     said six beneficent winds .      you know   it   s like our white flag of surrender     said mr .  saveloy .      never heard of it     said cohen .      it means you mustn   t kill anyone until they   re ready .      mr .  saveloy tried to shut out the whispers behind him .      why don   t we just invite them to dinner and massacre them all when they   re drunk .         you heard the man .  there   s seven hundred thousand of them .         ah .  so it   d have to be something simple with pasta  then .      a couple of the lords strode into the middle of the room .  cohen and mr .  saveloy went to meet them .      and you  too     said cohen  grabbing rincewind as he tried to back away .     you   re a weasely man with words in a tight spot  so come on .      lord hong regarded them with the expression of a man whose ancestry had bequeathed to him the ability to look down on everything .      my name is lord hong .  i am the emperor   s grand vizier .  i order you to quit these premises immediately and submit to judgment .      mr .  saveloy turned to cohen .      ain   t gonna     said cohen .   mr .  saveloy tried to think .      um  how shall i phrase this .  ghenghiz cohen  leader of the silver horde  presents his compliments to lord hong but           tell him he can stuff it     said cohen .      i think  lord hong  that perhaps you may have perceived the general flow of opinion here     said mr .  saveloy .      where are the rest of your barbarians  peasant .     he demanded .   rincewind watched mr .  saveloy .  the old teacher seemed at a loss for words this time .   the wizard wanted to run away .  but cohen had been right .  mad as it sounded  it was probably safer to be near him .  running away would put him closer  sooner or later  to lord hong .   who believed that there were a lot of other barbarians somewhere        i tell you this  and this only     said lord hong .     if you quit the forbidden city now  your deaths  at least  will be quick .  and then your heads and significant parts will be paraded through the cities of the empire so that people will know of the terrible punishment .         punishment .     said mr .  saveloy .      for killing the emperor .         we ain   t killed no emperor     said cohen .     i   ve got nothing against killing emperors  but we ain   t killed one .         he was killed in his bed an hour ago     said lord hong .      not by us     said mr .  saveloy .      by you     said rincewind .     only it   s against the rules to kill the emperor so you wanted it to look as though the red army did it .      lord hong looked at him as if seeing him for the first time and less than happy about doing so .      in the circumstances     said lord hong     i doubt that anyone will believe you .         what will happen if we yield now .     said mr .  saveloy .     i like to know these things .         then you will die very slowly in   interesting ways .         that   s the saga of my life     said cohen .     i   ve always been dying very slowly in interesting ways .  what   s it to be .  street fighting .  house to house .  free for all or what .         in the real world     said one of the other lords     we battle .  we do not scuffle like barbarians .  our armies will meet on the plain before the city .         before the city what .         he means in front of the city  cohen .         ah .  civilized talk again .  when .         dawn tomorrow .         okay     said cohen .     it   ll give us an appetite for our breakfast .  anything else we can do for you .         how big is your army  barbarian .         you would not believe how big     said cohen  which was probably true .     we have overrun countries .  we have wiped whole cities off the map .  where my army passes  nothing grows .         that   s true  at least     said mr .  saveloy .      we have not heard of you .     said the warlord .      yeah     said cohen .     that   s how good we are .         there is one other thing about his army  actually     said someone .   they all turned to rincewind  who   d been almost as surprised as they were to hear his voice .  but a train of thought had just reached the terminus        yes .         you may have been wondering why you have only seen the   generals     rincewind went on  slowly  as if working it out as he went along .     that is because  you see  the men themselves are   invisible .  er .  yes .  ghosts  in fact .  everyone knows this  don   t they .      cohen gaped at him in astonishment .      blood sucking ghosts  as a matter of fact     said rincewind .     after all  everyone knows that   s what you get beyond the wall  don   t they .      lord hong sneered .  but the warlords stared at rincewind with the expressions of people who strongly suspected that the people beyond the wall were flesh and blood but who also relied on millions of people not believing that this was so .      ridiculous .  you are not invisible blood sucking ghosts     said one of them .   cohen opened his mouth so that the diamond teeth glinted .         s right     he said .     fact is   we   re the visible sort .         hah .  a pathetic attempt .     said lord hong .     ghosts or no ghosts  we will beat you .         well  that went better than i expected     mr .  saveloy remarked as the warlords strode out .     was that an attempt at a little bit of psychological warfare there  mr .  rincewind .         is that what it was .  i know about that kind of stuff     said cohen .     it   s where you bang your shield all night before the fight so   s the enemy can   t get any sleep and you sing     we   re gonna cut yer tonkers off     and stuff like that .         similar     said mr .  saveloy  diplomatically .     but it failed to work  i   m afraid .  lord hong and his generals are rather too sophisticated .  it   s a great shame you couldn   t try it on the common soldiers .      there was a faint squeak of rabbit behind them .  they turned  and looked at the somewhat under age cadre of the red army that was being ushered in .  butterfly was with them .  she even gave rincewind a very faint smile .   rincewind had always relied on running away .  but sometimes  perhaps  you had to stand and fight  if only because there was nowhere left to run .   but he was no good at all with weapons .   at least  the normal sort .      um     he said     if we leave the palace now  we   ll be killed  right .         i doubt it     said mr .  saveloy .     it   s become a matter of the art of war now .  someone like hong would probably slit our throats  but now war is declared things have to be done according to custom .      rincewind took a deep breath .      it   s a million to one chance     he said     but it might just work           the four horsemen whose ride presages the end of the world are known to be death  war  famine  and pestilence .  but even less significant events have their own horsemen .  for example  the four horsemen of the common cold are sniffles  chesty  nostril  and lack of tissues  the four horsemen whose appearance foreshadows any public holiday are storm  gales  sleet  and contra flow .   among the armies encamped in the broad alluvial plain around hunghung  the invisible horsemen known as misinformation  rumor  and gossip saddled up     a large army encamped has all the tedious problems of a city without any of the advantages .  its watchfires and picket lines are  after a while  open to local civilians  especially if they have anything to sell and even more so if they are women whose virtue has a certain commercial element and even  sometimes  if they appear to be selling food which is a break from the monotonous army diet .  the food currently on sale was certainly such a break .      pork balls .  pork balls .  get them while they   re       there was a pause as the vendor mentally tried out ways of ending the sentence  and gave up .     pork balls .  onna stick .  how about you  shogun  you look like   here  aren   t you the    .         shutupshutupshutup .      rincewind pulled d .  m .  h .  dibhala into the shadows by a tent .   the trader looked at the anguished face framed between a eunuch outfit and a big straw hat .      it   s the wizard  isn   t it .  how are    .         you know how you seriously wanted to become very rich in international trade .     rincewind said .      yes .  can we start .         soon .  soon .  but there   s something you must do .  you know this rumor about the army of invisible vampire ghosts that   s heading this way .      d .  m .  h .  dibhala   s eyes swivelled nervously .  but it was part of his stock in trade never to appear to be ignorant of anything except  perhaps  how to give correct change .      yes .     he said .      the one about there being millions of them .     said rincewind .     and very hungry on account of not having eaten on the way .  and made specially fierce by the great wizard .         um   yes .         well  it   s not true .         it   s not .         you don   t believe me .  after all  i ought to know .         good point .         and we don   t want people to panic  do we .         very bad for business  panic     said d .  m .  h .   nodding uncomfortably .      so make sure you tell people there   s no truth in this rumor  will you .  set their minds at rest .         good idea .  er .  these invisible vampire ghosts   do they carry money of any sort .         no .  because they don   t exist .         ah  yes .  i forgot .         and there are not           of them     said rincewind .  he was rather proud of this little detail .      not           of them       said d .  m .  h .   a little glassy eyed .      absolutely not .  there are not           of them  no matter what anyone says .  nor has the great wizard made them twice as big as normal .  good man .  now i   d better be off        rincewind hurried away .   the trader stood in thought for a while .  it stole over him that he   d probably sold enough things for now  and he might as well go home and spend a quiet night in a barrel in the root cellar with a sack over his head .   his route led him through quite a large part of the camp .  he made sure that soldiers he met knew there was no truth in the rumor  even though this invariably meant that  first of all  he had to tell them what the rumor actually was .      a toy rabbit squeaked nervously .      and i   m afraid of the big invisible wampire ghosts .     sobbed favorite pearl .   the soldiers around this particular campfire tried to comfort her but  unfortunately  there was no one to comfort them .      an    i heard they alweady et some men .      one or two soldiers looked over their shoulders .  there was nothing to be seen in the darkness .  this wasn   t  however  a reassuring sign .   the red army moved obliquely from campfire to campfire .   rincewind had been very specific .  he   d spent all his adult life   at least  those parts of it where he wasn   t being chased by things with more legs than teeth   in unseen university  and he felt he knew what he was talking about here .  don   t tell people anything  he said .  don   t tell them .  you didn   t get to survive as a wizard in uu by believing what people told you .  you believed what you were not told .   don   t tell them .  ask them .  ask them if it   s true .  you can beg them to tell you it   s not true .  or you can even tell them you   ve been told to tell them it   s not true  and that is the best of all .   because rincewind knew very well that when the four rather small and nasty horsemen of panic ride out there is a good job done by misinformation  rumor  and gossip  but they are as nothing compared to the fourth horseman  whose name is denial .   after an hour rincewind felt quite unnecessary .   there were conversations breaking out everywhere  particularly in those areas on the edge of the camps  where the night stretched away so big and dark and  so very obviously  empty .      all right  so how come they   re saying there   s not           of them  eh .  if there   s none of them  then why   s there a number .         look  there   s no such thing as invisible vampire ghosts  all right .         oh  yeah .  how do you know .  have you ever seen any .         listen  i went and asked the captain and he says he   s certain there   s no invisible ghosts out there .         how can he be certain if he can   t see them .         he says there   s no such things as invisible vampire ghosts at all .         oh .  how come he   s saying that all of a sudden .  my grandfather told me there   s millions of them outside the           hold on   what   s that out there    .         what .         could   ve sworn i heard something           i can   t see anything .         oh  no .      things must have filtered through to high command because  getting on towards midnight  trumpets were sounded around the camps and a special proclamation was read out .   it confirmed the reality of vampire ghosts in general but denied their existence in any specific  here and now sense .  it was a masterpiece of its type  particularly since it brought the whole subject to the ears of soldiers the red army hadn   t been able to reach yet .   an hour later the situation had reached the point of criticality and rincewind was hearing things he personally hadn   t made up and  on the whole  would much rather not hear .   he   d chat with a couple of soldiers and say     i   m sure there   s no huge hungry army of vampire ghosts    and get told     no  there   s seven old men .         just seven old men .         i heard they   re very old     said a soldier .     like  too old to die .  i heard from someone at the palace that they can walk through walls and make themselves invisible .         oh  come on     said rincewind .     seven old men fighting this whole army .         makes you think  eh .  corporal toshi says the great wizard is helping them .  stands to reason .  i wouldn   t be fighting a whole army if i didn   t have a lot of magic on my side .         er .  anyone know what the great wizard looks like .     said rincewind .      they say he   s taller than a house and got three heads .      rincewind nodded encouragingly .      i heard     said a soldier     that the red army is going to fight on their side  too .         so what .  corporal toshi says they   re just a bunch of kids .         no  i heard   the real red army   you know           the red army ain   t gonna side with barbarian invaders .  anyway  there   s no such thing as the red army .  that   s just a myth .         like the invisible vampire ghosts     said rincewind  giving the clockwork of anxiety another little turn .      er   yeah .      he left them arguing .   no one was deserting .  running off into a night full of non specific terrors was worse than staying in camp .  but that was all to the good  he decided .  it meant that the really frightened people were staying put and seeking reassurance from their comrades .  and there was nothing like someone repeating    i   m sure there   s no vampire wizards    and going to the latrine four times an hour to put backbone into a platoon .   rincewind crept back towards the city  rounded a tent in the shadows  and collided with a horse  which trod heavily on his foot .      your wife is a big hippo .      sorry .   rincewind froze  both hands clutching his aching foot .  he knew only one person with a voice like a cemetery in midwinter .   he tried to hop backwards  and collided with another horse .   rincewind  isn   t it .  said death .  yes .  good evening .  i don   t believe you have met war .  rincewind  war .  war  rincewind .   war touched his helmet in salute .      pleasure   s all mine     he said .  he indicated the other three riders .     like to introduce you to m   sons  terror and panic .  and m   daughter  clancy .      the children chorused a    hello .     clancy was scowling  looked about seven years old and was wearing a hard hat and a pony club badge .   i wasn   t expecting to see you here  rincewind .      oh .  good .      death pulled an hourglass out of his robe  held it up to the moonlight  and sighed .  rincewind craned to see how much sand was left .   however  i could        don   t you make any special arrangement just on my account     said rincewind hurriedly .     i  er   i expect you   re all here for the battle .      yes .  it promises to be extremely   short .      who   s going to win .      now  you know i wouldn   t tell you that  even if i knew .      even if you knew .     said rincewind .     i thought you were supposed to know everything .      death held up a finger .  something fluttered down through the night .  rincewind thought it was a moth  although it looked less fluffy and had a strange speckled pattern on its wings .   it settled on the extended digit for a moment  and then flew up and away again .   on a night like this  said death  the only certain thing is uncertainty .  trite  i know  but true .   somewhere on the horizon  thunder rumbled .      i   ll  er  just be sort of going  then     said rincewind .   don   t be a stranger  said death  as the wizard hurried off .      odd person     said war .   with him here  even uncertainty is uncertain .  and i   m not sure even about that .   war pulled a large paper wrapped package out of his saddlebag .      we   ve got   let   s see now   egg and cress  chicken tikka  and mature cheese with crunchy pickle  i think .      they do such marvelous things with sandwiches these days .      oh   and bacon surprise .      really .  what is so surprising about bacon .      i don   t know .  i suppose it comes as something of a shock to the pig .         ridcully had been having a long wrestle with himself  and had won .      we   re going to bring him back     he said .     it   s been four days .  and then we can send them back their bloody tube thing .  it gives me the willies .      the senior wizards looked at one another .  no one was very keen on a university with a rincewind component  but the metal dog did give them the willies .  no one had wanted to go near it .  they   d piled some tables around it and tried to pretend it wasn   t there .      all right     said the dean .     but stibbons kept going on about things weighing the same  right .  if we send that back  won   t it mean rincewind arrives here going very fast .         mr .  stibbons says he   s working on the spell     said ridcully .     or we could pile some mattresses up at one end of the hall or something .      the bursar raised a hand .      yes  bursar .     said ridcully encouragingly .      ho  landlord  a pint of your finest ale .     said the bursar .      good     said ridcully .     that   s settled  then .  i   ve already told mr .  stibbons to start looking           on that demonic device .         yes .         then nothing can possibly go wrong     said the dean sourly .      a trumpet of lobsters  if you would be so good .         and the bursar agrees .         the warlords had gathered in lord hong   s chambers .  they carefully kept a distance from one another  as befitted enemies who were in the most shaky of alliances .  once the barbarians were dealt with  the battle might still continue .  but they wanted assurance on one particular point .      no .     said lord hong .     let me make this absolutely clear .  there is no invisible army of blood sucking ghosts  do you understand .  the people beyond the wall are just like us   except vastly inferior in every respect  of course .  but totally visible .      one or two of the lords did not look convinced .      and all this talk about the red army .     said one of them .      the red army  lord tang  is an undisciplined rabble that shall be put down with resolute force .         you know what red army the peasants are talking about     said lord tang .     they say that thousands of years ago it           they say that thousands of years ago a wizard who did not exist took mud and lightning and made soldiers that couldn   t die     said lord hong .     yes .  it   s a story  lord tang .  a story made up by peasants who did not understand what really happened .  one sun mirror   s army just had      lord hong waved a hand vaguely      better armor  better discipline .  i am not frightened of ghosts and i am certainly not afraid of a legend that probably never existed .         yes  but           soothsayer .     snapped lord hong .  the soothsayer  who hadn   t been expecting it  gave a start .      yes  my lord .         how   re those entrails coming along .         er   they   re about ready  my lord     said the soothsayer .   the soothsayer was rather worried .  this must have been the wrong kind of bird  he told himself .  about the only thing the entrails were telling him was that if he got out of this alive he  the soothsayer  might be lucky enough to enjoy a nice chicken dinner .  but lord hong sounded like a man with the most dangerous kind of impatience .      and what do they tell you .         er   the future is   the future is        chicken entrails had never looked like this .  for a moment he thought they were moving .      er   it is uncertain     he hazarded .      be certain     said lord hong .     who will win in the morning .      shadows flickered across the table .   something was fluttering around the light .   it looked like an undistinguished yellow moth  with black patterns on its wings .   the soothsayer   s precognitive abilities  which were considerably more powerful than he believed  told him  this is not a good time to be a clairvoyant .   on the other hand  there was never a good time to be horribly executed  so        without a shadow of doubt     he said     the enemy will be most emphatically beaten .         how can you be so certain .     said lord mcsweeney .   the soothsayer bridled .      you see this wobbly bit near the kidneys .  you want to argue with this green trickly thing .  you know all about liver suddenly .  all right .         so there you are     said lord hong .     fate smiles upon us .         even so       lord tang began .     the men are very           you can tell the men       lord hong began .  he stopped .  he smiled .      you can tell the men     he said     that there is a huge army of invisible vampire ghosts .         what .         yes .     lord hong began to stride up and down  snapping his fingers .     yes  there is a terrible army of foreign ghosts .  and this has so enraged our own ghosts   yes  a thousand generations of our ancestors are riding on the wind to repel this barbaric invasion .  the ghosts of the empire are arising .  millions and millions of them .  even our demons are furious at this intrusion .  they will descend like a mist of claws and teeth to   yes  lord sung .      the warlords were looking at one another nervously .      are you sure  lord hong .      lord hong   s eyes gleamed behind his tiny spectacles .      make the necessary proclamations     he said .      but only a few hours ago we told the men there were no           tell them differently .         but will they believe that there           they will believe what they are told .     shouted lord hong .     if the enemy thinks his strength lies in deceit  then we will use their deceit against them .  tell the men that behind them will be a billion ghosts of the empire .      the other warlords tried to avoid his gaze .  no one was actually going to suggest that your average soldier would not be totally happy with ghosts front and rear  especially given the capriciousness of ghosts .      good     said lord hong .  he looked down .      are you still here .     he said .      just clearing up my giblets  my lord .     squealed the soothsayer .   he picked up the remains of his stricken chicken and ran for it .   after all  he told himself as he pelted back home  it   s not as though i said whose enemy .   lord hong was left alone .   he realized he was shaking .  it was probably fury .  but perhaps   perhaps things could be turned to his advantage  even so .  barbarians came from outside  and to most people everywhere outside was the same .  yes .  the barbarians were a minute detail  easily disposed of  but carefully managed  perhaps  might figure in his overall strategy .   he was breathing heavily  too .   he walked into his private study and shut the door .   he pulled out the key .   he opened the box .   there was a few minutes    silence  except for the rustle of cloth .   then lord hong looked at himself in the mirror .   he   d gone to great lengths to achieve this .  he had used several agents  none of whom knew the whole plan .  but the ankh morpork tailor had been good at his work and the measurements had been followed exactly .  from pointy boots to hose to doublet  cloak  and hat with a feather in it  lord hong knew he was a perfect ankh morpork gentleman .  the cloak was lined with silk .   the clothes felt uncomfortable and touched him in unfamiliar ways  but those were minor details .  this was how a man looked in a society that breathed  that moved  that could really go somewhere     he   d walk through the city on that first great day and the people would be silent when they saw their natural leader .   it never crossed his mind that anyone would say        ere  wot a toff .     eave    arf a brick at    im .         the ants scurried .  the thing that went    parp    went parp .   the wizards stood back .  there wasn   t much else to do when hex was working at full speed  except watch the fish and oil the wheels from time to time .  there were occasional flashes of octarine from the tubes .   hex was spelling several hundred times a minute .  it was as simple as that .  it would take a human more than an hour to do an ordinary finding spell .  but hex could do them faster .  over and over again .  it was netting the whole occult sea in the search for one slippery fish .   it achieved  after ninety three minutes  what would otherwise have taken the faculty several months .      you see .     said ponder  his voice shaking a little as he took the line of blocks out of the hopper .     i said he could do it .         who   s he .     said ridcully .      hex .         oh  you mean it .         that   s what i said  sir   er   yes .         another thing about the horde  mr .  saveloy had noticed  was their ability to relax .  the old men had the catlike ability to do nothing when there was nothing to do .   they   d sharpened their swords .  they   d had a meal   big lumps of meat for most of them  and some kind of gruel for mad hamish  who   d dribbled most of it down his beard   and assured its whole someness by dragging the cook in  nailing him to the floor by his apron  and suspending a large axe on a rope that crossed a beam in the roof and was held at the other end by cohen  while he ate .   then they   d sharpened their swords again  out of habit  and   stopped .   occasionally one of them would whistle a snatch of a tune  through what remained of his teeth  or search a bodily crevice for a particularly fretful louse .  mainly  though  they just sat and stared at nothing .   after a long while  caleb said     y   know  i   ve never been to xxxx .  been everywhere else .  often wondered what it   s like .         got shipwrecked there once     said vincent .     weird place .  lousy with magic .  there   s beavers with beaks and giant rats with long tails that hops around the place and boxes with one another .  black fellas wanderin    around all over the place .  they say they   re in a dream .  bright  though .  show    em a bit of desert with one dead tree in it  next minute they   ve found a three course meal with fruits and nuts to follow .  beer   s good  too .         sounds like it .      there was another long pause .   then      i suppose they   ve got minstrels here .  be a bit of a bloody waste  wouldn   t it  if we all got killed and no one made up any songs about it .         bound to have loads of minstrels  a city like this .         no problem there  then .         no .         no .      there was another lengthy pause .      not that we   re going to get killed .         right .  i don   t intend to start getting killed at my time of life  haha .      another pause .      cohen .         yep .         you a religious man at all .         well  i   ve robbed loads of temples and killed a few mad priests in my time .  don   t know if that counts .         what do your tribe believe happens to you when you die in battle .         oh  these big fat women in horned helmets take you off to the halls of io where there is fighting and carousing and quaffing for ever .      another pause .      you mean  like  really for ever .         s   pose so .            cos generally you get fed up even with turkey by about day four .         all right  what do your lot believe .         i think we go off to hell in a boat made of toenail clippings .  something like that  anyway .      another pause .      but it   s not worth talking about    cos we   re not going to get killed today .         you said it .         hah  it   s not worth dying if all you   ve got to look forward to is leftover meat and floating around in a boat smelling of your socks  is it  eh .         haha .      another pause .      down in klatch they believe if you lead a good life you   re rewarded by being sent to a paradise with lots of young women .         that   s your reward  is it .         dunno .  maybe it   s their punishment .  but i do remember you eat sherbet all day .         hah .  when i was a lad we had proper sherbet  in little tube things and a liquorice straw to suck it up with .  you don   t get that sort of thing today .  people   re too busy rushin    about .         sounds a lot better than quaffing toenails  though .      another pause .      did you ever believe that business about every enemy you killed becoming your servant in the next world .         dunno .         how many you killed .         what .  oh .  maybe two  three thousand .  not counting dwarfs and trolls  o    course .         definitely not going to be short of a hairbrush or someone to open doors for you after you   re dead  then .      a pause .      we   re definitely not going to die  right .         right .         i mean  odds of         to one   hah .  the difference is just a lot of zeroes  right .         right .         i mean  stout comrades at our side  a strong right arm   what more could we want .      pause .      a volcano   d be favorite .      pause .      we   re going to die  aren   t we .         yep .      the horde looked at one another .      still  to look on the bright side  i recall i still owe fafa the dwarf fifty dollars for this sword     said boy willie .     looks as though i could end up ahead of the game .      mr .  saveloy put his head in his hands .      i   m really sorry     he said .      don   t worry about it     said cohen .   the grey light of dawn was just visible in the high windows .      look     said mr .  saveloy     you don   t have to die .  we could   well  we could sneak out .  back along the pipe  maybe .  perhaps we could carry hamish .  people are coming and going all the time .  i   m sure we could get out of   the city   without   any        his voice faded away .  no voice could keep going under the pressure of those stares .  even hamish  whose gaze was generally focused on some point about eighty years away  was glaring at him .      ain   t gonna run     said hamish .      it   s not running away     he managed .     it   s a sensible withdrawal .  tactics .  good grief  it   s common sense .         ain   t gonna run .         look  even barbarians can count .  and you   ve admitted you   re going to die .         ain   t gonna run .      cohen leaned forward and patted mr .  saveloy on the hand .      it   s the heroing  see     he said .     who   s ever heard of a hero running away .  all them kids you was telling us about   you know  the ones who think we   re stories   you reckon they   d believe we ran away .  well  then .  no  it   s not part of the whole deal  running away .  let someone else do the running .         besides     said truckle     where   d we get another chance like this .  six against five armies .  that   s bl   that   s fantastic .  we   re not talking legends here  i reckon we   ve got a good crack at some mythology as well .         but   you   ll   die .         oh  that   s part of it  i   ll grant you  that   s part of it .  but what a way to go  eh .      mr .  saveloy looked at them and realized that they were speaking another language in another world .  it was one he had no key to  no map for .  you could teach them to wear interesting pants and handle money but something in their soul stayed exactly the same .      do teachers go anywhere special when they die .     said cohen .      i don   t think so     said mr .  saveloy gloomily .  he wondered for a moment whether there really was a great free period in the sky .  it didn   t sound very likely .  probably there would be some marking to do .      well  whatever happens  when you   re dead  if you ever feel like a good quaff  you   re welcome to drop in at any time     said cohen .     it   s been fun .  that   s the important thing .  and it   s been an education  hasn   t it  boys .      there was a general murmur of assent .      amazing  all those long words .         and learnin    to buy things .         and social intercourse  hur  hur   sorry .         whut .         shame it didn   t work out  but i   ve never been one for plans     said cohen .   mr .  saveloy stood up .      i   m going to join you     he said grimly .      what  to fight .         yes .         do you know how to handle a sword .     said truckle .      er .  no .         then you   ve wasted all your life .      mr .  saveloy looked offended at this .      i expect i   ll get the hang of it as we go along     he said .      get the hang of it .  it   s a sword .         yes  but   when you   re a teacher  you have to pick things up fast .     mr .  saveloy smiled nervously .     i once taught practical alchemy for a whole term when mr .  schism was off sick after blowing himself up  and up until then i   d never seen a crucible .         here .     boy willie handed the teacher a spare sword .  he hefted it .      er .  i expect there   s a manual  or something .         manual .  no .  you hold the blunt end and poke the other end at people .         ah .  really .  well  that seems quite straightforward .  i thought there was rather more to it than that .         you sure you want to come with us .     said cohen .   mr .  saveloy looked firm .     absolutely .  i very much doubt if i   ll survive if you lose and   well  it seems that you heroes get a better class of heaven .  i must say i rather suspect you get a better class of life  too .  and i really don   t know where teachers go when they   re dead  but i   ve got a horrible suspicion it   ll be full of sports masters .         it   s just that i don   t know if you could really go properly berserk     said cohen .     have you ever had the red mist come down and woke up to find you   d bitten twenty people to death .         i used to be reckoned a pretty ratty man if people made too much noise in class     said mr .  saveloy .     and something of a dead shot with a piece of chalk  too .         how about you  taxman .      six beneficent winds backed away hurriedly .      i   i think i   m probably more cut out for undermining the system from within     he said .      fair enough .     cohen looked at the others .     i   ve never done this official sort of warring before     he said .     how   s it supposed to go .         i think you just line up in front of one another and then charge     said mr .  saveloy .      seems straightforward enough .  all right  let   s go .      they strode  or in one case wheeled and in another case moved at mr .  saveloy   s gentle trot  down the hall .  the taxman trailed after them .      mr .  saveloy .     he shouted .     you know what   s going to happen .  have you lost your senses .         yes     said the teacher     but i may have found some better ones .      he grinned to himself .  the whole of his life  so far  had been complicated .  there had been timetables and lists and a whole basket of things he must do and things he shouldn   t do  and the life of mr .  saveloy had been this little wriggly thing trying to survive in the middle of it all .  but now it had suddenly all become very simple .  you held one end and you poked the other into people .  a man could live his whole life by a maxim like that .  and  afterwards  get a very interesting afterlife        here  you   ll need this  too     said caleb  poking something round at him as they stepped into the grey light .     it   s a shield .         ah .  it   s to protect myself  yes .         if you really need to  bite the edge .         oh  i know about that     said mr .  saveloy .     that   s when you go berserk  right .         could be  could be     said caleb .     that   s why a lot of fighters do it .  but personally i do it    cos it   s made of chocolate .         chocolate .         you can never get a proper meal in these battles .      and this is me  thought mr .  saveloy  marching down the street with heroes .  they are the great fi        and when in doubt  take all your clothes off     said caleb .      what for .         sign of a good berserk  taking all your clothes off .  frightens the hell out of the enemy .  if anyone starts laughing  stab    em one .      there was a movement among the blankets in the wheelchair .      whut .         i said  stab    em one  hamish .      hamish waved an arm that looked like bone with skin on it  and apparently far too thin to hold the axe it was in fact holding .      that   s right .  right in the nadgers .      mr .  saveloy nudged caleb .      i ought to be writing this down     he said .     where exactly are the nadgers .         small range of mountains near the hub .         fascinating .         the citizens of hunghung were ranged along the city walls .  it was not every day you saw a fight like this .   rincewind elbowed and kicked his way through the people until he reached the cadre  who   d managed to occupy a prime position over the main gate .      what   re you hanging around here for .     he said .     you could be miles away .         we want to see what happens  of course     said twoflower  his spectacles gleaming .      i know what happens .  the horde will be instantly slaughtered .     said rincewind .     what did you expect to happen .         ah  but you   re forgetting the invisible vampire ghosts     said twoflower .   rincewind looked at him .      what .         their secret army .  i heard that we   ve got some  too .  should be interesting to watch .         twoflower  there are no invisible vampire ghosts .         ah  yes  everyone   s going round denying it     said lotus blossom .     so there must be some truth in it .         but i made it up .         ah  you may think you made it up     said twoflower .     but perhaps you are a pawn of fate .         listen  there   s no           same old rincewind     said twoflower  in a jolly way .     you always were so pessimistic about everything  but it always worked out all right in the end .         there are no ghosts  there are no magic armies     said rincewind .     there   s just           when seven men go out to fight an army         times bigger there   s only one way it can end     said twoflower .      right .  i   m glad you see sense .         they   ll win     said twoflower .     they   ve got to .  otherwise the world   s just not working properly .         you look educated     said rincewind to butterfly .     explain to him why he   s wrong .  it   s because of a little thing we have in our country .  i don   t know if you   ve ever heard of it   it   s called mathematics .      the girl smiled at him .      you don   t believe me  do you .     said rincewind flatly .     you   re just like him .  what d   you think this is  homeopathic warfare .  the smaller your side the more likely you are to win .  well  it   s not like that .  i wish it was like that  but it isn   t .  nothing is .  there are no amazing strokes of luck  no magic solutions  and the good people don   t win because they   re small and plucky .     he waved his hand irritably at something .      you always survived     said twoflower .     we had amazing adventures and you always survived .         that was just coincidence .         you kept on surviving .         and you got us safely out of prison     said lotus blossom .      there were just a lot of coinci   will you go away .      a butterfly skittered away from his flailing hand .      damn things     he mumbled .  and added     well  that   s it .  i   m off .  i can   t watch .  i   ve got things to do .  besides  afterwards i think nasty people are going to be looking for me .      and then he realized there were tears in lotus blossom   s eyes .      we   we thought you would do something     she said .      me .  i can   t do anything .  especially not magic .  i   m famous for it .  don   t go around believing that great wizards solve all your problems  because there aren   t any and they don   t and i should know because i   m not one .      he backed away .     this is always happening to me .  i   m just minding my own business and everything goes wrong and suddenly everyone   s relying on me and saying     oh  rincewind  what are you going to do about it .     well  what mrs .  rincewind   s little boy  if she was a mrs .  rincewind of course  what he   s going to do about it is nothing  right .  you have to sort it all out yourselves .  no mysterious magical armies are going to   will you stop looking at me like that .  i don   t see why it   s my fault .  i   ve got other things to do .  it   s not my business .      and then he turned and ran .   the crowds didn   t take much notice of him .   the streets were deserted by hunghung standards  which meant you could quite often see the cobbles .  rincewind pushed and shoved his way along the alleys nearest the wall  looking for another gateway with guards too busy to ask questions .   there were footsteps behind him .      look     he said  spinning round     i told you  you can all        it was the luggage .  it contrived to look a little ashamed of itself .      oh  turned up at last  have we .     said rincewind savagely .     what happened to the following master everywhere thing .      the luggage shuffled its feet .  from out of an alleyway came a slightly larger and far more ornate version of itself .  its lid was inset with decorative wood and  it seemed to rincewind  its feet were rather more dainty than the horny nailed  calloused ones of the luggage .  besides  the toenails had been painted .      oh     he said .     well .  good grief .  fair enough  i suppose .  really .  i mean   yes .  well .  come on  then .      he reached the end of the alley and turned round .  the luggage was gently bumping the larger chest  urging it to follow him .   rincewind   s own sexual experiences were not excessive although he had seen diagrams .  he hadn   t the faintest idea about how it applied to travel accessories .  did they say things like    what a chest .     or    get a load of the hinges on that one .     .   if it came to that  he had no real reason for considering that the luggage was male .  admittedly it had a homicidal nature  but so had a lot of the women that rincewind had met  and they had often become a little more homicidal as a result of meeting him .  capacity for violence  rincewind had heard  was unisexual .  he wasn   t certain what unisex was  but expected that it was what he normally experienced .   there was a small gate ahead .  it seemed to be unguarded .   despite his fear he walked through it  and refrained from running .  authority always noticed a running man .  the time to start running was around about the    e    in    hey  you .      no one paid him any attention .  the attention of the people along the wall was all on the armies .      look at them     he said bitterly  to the generality of the universe .     stupid .  if it was seven against seventy  everyone   d know who   d lose .  just because it   s seven against          everyone   s not sure .  as though suddenly numbers don   t mean anything any more .  huh .  why should i do anything .  it   s not as if i even know the guy all that well .  admittedly he saved my life a couple of times  but that   s no reason to die horribly just because he can   t count .  so you can stop looking at me like that .      the luggage backed away a little .  the other luggage        rincewind supposed it just looked female .  women had bigger luggage than men  didn   t they .  because of the   he moved into unknown territory   extra frills and stuff .  it was just one of those things  like the fact that they had smaller handkerchiefs than men even though their noses were generally the same size .  the luggage had always been the luggage .  rincewind wasn   t mentally prepared for there to be more than one .  there was the luggage and   the other luggage .      come on  both of you     he said .     we   re getting out of here .  i   ve done what i can .  i just don   t care any more .  it   s nothing to do with me .  i don   t see why everyone depends on me .  i   m not dependable .  even i don   t depend on me  and i   m me .         cohen looked at the horizon .  gray blue clouds were piling up .      there   s a storm coming     he said .      it   s a mercy that we won   t be alive to get wet  then     said boy willie  cheerfully .      funny thing  though .  it looks like it   s coming from every direction at once .         filthy foreign weather .  you can   t trust it .      cohen turned his attention to the armies of the five warlords .   there seemed to have been some agreement .   they   d arranged themselves around the position that cohen had taken up .  the tactic seemed quite clear .  it was simply to advance .  the horde could see the commanders riding up and down in front of their legions .      how   s it supposed to start .     said cohen  the rising wind whipping at what remained of his hair .     does someone blow a whistle or something .  or do we just scream and charge .         commencement is generally by agreement     said mr .  saveloy .      oh .      cohen looked at the forest of lances and pennants .  hundreds of thousands of men looked like quite a lot of men when you saw them close to .      i suppose     he said  slowly     that none of you has got some amazing plan you   ve been keeping quiet about .         we thought you had one     said truckle .   several riders had now left each army and approached the horde in a group .  they stopped a little more than a spear   s throw away  and sat and watched .      all right  then     said cohen .     i hate to say this  but perhaps we should talk about surrender .         no .     said mr .  saveloy  and then stopped in embarrassment at the loudness of his own voice .     no     he repeated  a little more quietly .     you won   t live if you surrender .  you just won   t die immediately .      cohen scratched his nose .     what   s that flag   you know   when you want to talk to them without them killing you .         it   s got to be red     said mr .  saveloy .     but look  it   s no good you           i don   t know  red for surrender  white for funerals       muttered cohen .     all right .  anyone got something red .         i   ve got a handkerchief     said mr .  saveloy     but it   s white and anyway           give it here .      the barbarian teacher very reluctantly handed it over .   cohen pulled a small  worn knife from his belt .      i don   t believe this .     said mr .  saveloy .  he was nearly in tears .     cohen the barbarian talking surrender with people like that .         influence of civilization     said cohen .        s probably made me go soft in the head .      he pulled the knife over his arm  and then clamped the handkerchief over the cut .      there we are     he said .     soon have a nice red flag .      the horde nodded approvingly .  it was an amazingly symbolic  dramatic and above all stupid gesture  in the finest traditions of barbarian heroing .  it didn   t seem to be lost on some of the nearer soldiers  either .      now     cohen went on     i reckon you  teach  and you  truckle   you two come with me and we   ll go and talk to these people .         they   ll drag you off to their dungeons .     said mr .  saveloy .     they   ve got torturers that can keep you alive for years .         whut .  whutzeesay .         he said they can keep you alive for years in their dungeons  hamish .         good .  fine by me .         oh  dear     said mr .  saveloy .   he trailed after the other two towards the warlords .   lord hong raised his visor and stared down his nose at them as they approached .      red flag  look     said cohen  waving the rather damp object on the end of his sword .      yes     said lord hong .     we saw that little show .  it may impress the common soldiers but it does not impress me  barbarian .         please yourself     said cohen .     we   ve come to talk about surrender .      mr .  saveloy noticed some of the lesser lords relax a little .  then he thought  a real soldier probably doesn   t like this sort of thing .  you don   t want to go to soldier heaven or wherever you go and say  i once led an army against seven old men .  it wasn   t medal winning material .      ah .  of course .  so much for bravado     said lord hong .     then lay down your arms and you will be escorted back to the palace .      cohen and truckle looked at one another .      sorry .     said cohen .      lay down your arms .     lord hong snorted .     that means put down your weapons .      cohen gave him a puzzled look .     why should we put down our weapons .         are we not talking about your surrender .         our surrender .      mr .  saveloy   s mouth opened in a mad  slow grin .   lord hong stared at cohen .      hah .  you can hardly expect me to believe that you have come to ask us        he leaned from the saddle and glared at them .      you do  don   t you .     he said .     you mindless little barbarians .  is it true that you can only count up to five .         we just thought that it might save people getting hurt     said cohen .      you thought it would save you getting hurt     said the warlord .      i daresay a few of yours might get hurt  too .         they   re peasants     said the warlord .      oh  yes .  i was forgetting that     said cohen .     and you   re their chief  right .  it   s like your game of chess  right .         i am their lord     said lord hong .     they will die at my bidding  if necessary .      cohen gave him a big  dangerous grin .      when do we start .     he said .      return to your   band     said lord hong .     and then i think we shall start   shortly .      he glared at truckle  who was unfolding his bit of paper .  the barbarian   s lips moved awkwardly and he ran a horny finger across the page .      misbegotten   wretch  so you are     he said .      my word     said mr .  saveloy  who   d created the look up table .   as the three returned to the horde mr .  saveloy was aware of a grinding sound .  cohen was wearing several carats off his teeth .         die at my bidding        he said .     the bugger doesn   t even know what a chief is meant to be  the bastard .  him and his horse .      mr .  saveloy looked around .  there seemed to be some arguing among the warlords .      you know     he said     they probably will try to take us alive .  i used to have a headmaster like him .  he liked to make people   s lives a misery .         you mean they   ll be trying not to kill us .     said truckle .      yes .         does that mean we have to try not to kill them .         no  i don   t think so .         sounds okay to me .         what do we do now .     said mr .  saveloy .     do we do a battle chant or something .         we just wait     said cohen .      there   s a lot of waiting in warfare     said boy willie .      ah  yes     said mr .  saveloy .     i   ve heard people say that .  they say there   s long periods of boredom followed by short periods of excitement .         not really     said cohen .     it   s more like short periods of waiting followed by long periods of being dead .            blast .      the fields were crisscrossed with drainage ditches .  there seemed to be no straight path anywhere .  and the ditches were too wide to jump  they looked shallow enough to wade  but only because eighteen inches of water overlay a suffocating depth of rich thick mud .  mr .  saveloy said that the empire owed its prosperity to the mud of the plains  and right now rincewind was feeling extremely rich .   he was also quite close to the big hill that dominated the city .  it really was rounded  with a precision apparently far too accurate for mere natural causes  saveloy had said that hills like that were drumlins  great piles of topsoil left behind by glaciers .  trees covered the lower slopes of this one  and there was a small building on the top .   cover .  now  that was a good word .  it was a big plain and the armies weren   t too far away .  the hill looked curiously peaceful  as if it belonged to a different world .  it was strange that the agateans  who otherwise seemed to farm absolutely everywhere a water buffalo could stand  had left it alone .   someone was watching him .   it was a water buffalo .   it would be wrong to say it watched him with interest .  it just watched him  because its eyes were open and had to be facing in some direction  and it had randomly chosen one which included rincewind .   its face held the completely serene expression of a creature that had long ago realized that it was  fundamentally  a tube on legs and had been installed in the universe to  broadly speaking  achieve throughput .   at the other end of the string was a man  ankle deep in the mud of the field .  he had a broad straw hat  like every other buffalo holder .  he had the basic pyjama suit of the agatean man in the field .  and he had an expression not of idiocy  but of preoccupation .  he was looking at rincewind .  as with the buffalo  this was only because his eyes had to be doing something .   despite the pressing dangers  rincewind found himself overcome by a sudden curiosity .      er .  good morning     he said .   the man gave him a nod .  the water buffalo made the sound of regurgitating cud .      er .  sorry if this is a personal question     said rincewind     but   i can   t help wondering   why do you stand out in the fields all day with the water buffalo .      the man thought about it .      good for soil     he said eventually .      but doesn   t it waste a lot of time .     said rincewind .   the man gave this due appraisal also .      what   s time to a cow .     he said .   rincewind reversed back on to the highway of reality .      you see those armies over there .     he said .   the buffalo holder concentrated his gaze .      yes     he decided .      they   re fighting for you .      the man did not appear moved by this .  the water buffalo burped gently .      some want to see you enslaved and some want you to run the country  or at least to let them run the country while telling you it   s you doing it really     said rincewind .     there   s going to be a terrible battle .  i can   t help wondering   what do you want .      the buffalo holder absorbed this one for consideration  too .  and it seemed to rincewind that the slowness of the thought process wasn   t due to native stupidity  but more to do with the sheer size of the question .  he could feel it spreading out so that it incorporated the soil and the grass and the sun and headed on out into the universe .   finally the man said      a longer piece of string would be nice .         ah .  really .  well  well .  there   s a thing     said rincewind .     talking to you has been an education .  goodbye .      the man watched him go .  beside him  the buffalo relaxed some muscles and contracted others and lifted its tail and made the world  in a very small way  a better place .      rincewind headed on towards the hill .  random as the animal tracks and occasional plank bridges were  they seemed to head right for it .  if rincewind had been thinking clearly  an activity he last remembered doing around the age of twelve  he might have wondered about that .   the trees of the lower slopes were sapient pears  and he didn   t even think about that .  their leaves turned to watch him as he scrambled past .  what he needed now was a cave or a handy     he paused .      oh  no     he said .     no  no  no .  you don   t catch me like that .  i   ll go into a handy cave and there   ll be a little door or some wise old man or something and i   ll be dragged back into events .  right .  stay out in the open  that   s the style .      he half climbed  half walked to the rounded top of the hill  which rose above the trees like a dome .  now he was closer he could see that it wasn   t as smooth as it looked from below .  weather had worn gullies and channels in the soil  and bushes had colonized every sheltered slope .   the building on the top was  to rincewind   s surprise  rusty .  it had been made of iron   pointed iron roof  iron walls  iron doorway .  there were a few old nests and some debris on the floor  but it was otherwise empty .  and not a good place to hide .  it   d be the first place anyone would look .   there was a cloud wall around the world now .  lightning crackled in its heart  and there was the sound of thunder   not the gentle rumble of summer thunder but the crackackack of splitting sky .   and yet the heat wrapped the plain like a blanket .  the air felt thick .  in a minute it was going to rain cats and food .      find somewhere where i won   t be noticed     he muttered .     keep head down .  only way .  why should i care .  other people   s problem .      panting in the oppressive heat  he wandered on .      lord hong was enraged .  those who knew him could tell  by the way he spoke more slowly and smiled continuously .      and how do the men know the lightning dragons are angry .     he said .     it may be mere high spirits .         not with a sky that color     said lord tang .     that is not an auspicious color for a sky .  it looks like a bruise .  a sky like that is portentous .         and what  pray  do you think it portends .         it   s just generally portentous .         i know what   s behind this     lord hong snarled .     you   re too frightened to fight seven old men  is that it .         the men say they   re the legendary seven indestructible sages     said lord fang .  he tried to smile .     you know how superstitious they are           what seven sages .     said lord hong .     i am extremely familiar with the history of the world and there are no legendary seven indestructible sages .         er   not yet     said lord fang .     uh .  but   a day like this   perhaps legends have to start somewhere           they   re barbarians .  oh  gods .  seven men .  can i believe we   re afraid of seven men .         it feels wrong     said lord mcsweeney .  he added  quickly     that   s what the men say .         you have made the proclamation about our celestial army of ghosts .  all of you .      the warlords tried to avoid his gaze .      er   yes     said lord fang .      that must have improved morale .         uh .  not   entirely           what do you mean  man .         uh .  many men have deserted .  uh .  they   ve been saying that foreign ghosts were bad enough  but           but what .         they are soldiers  lord hong     said lord tang sharply .     they all have people they do not want to meet .  don   t you .      just for a second  there was the suggestion of a twitch on lord hong   s cheek .  it was only for a second  but those who saw it took note .  lord hong   s renowned glaze had shown a crack .      what would you do  lord tang .  let these insolent barbarians go .         of course not .  but   you don   t need an army against seven men .  seven ancient old men .  the peasants say   they say        lord hong   s voice was slightly higher .      come on  man who talks to peasants .  i   m sure you   re going to tell us what they say about these foolish and foolhardy old men .         well  that   s it  you see .  they say  if they   re so foolish and foolhardy   how did they manage to become so old .         luck .      it was the wrong word .  even lord hong realized it .  he   d never believed in luck .  he   d always taken pains  usually those of other people  to fill life with certainties .  but he knew that others believed in luck .  it was a foible he   d always been happy to make use of .  and now it was turning and stinging him on the hand .      there is nothing in the art of war to tell us how five armies attack seven old men     said lord tang .     ghosts or no ghosts .  and this  lord hong  is because no one ever thought such a thing would be done .         if you feel so frightened i   ll ride out against them with my mere         men     he said .      i am not frightened     said lord tang .     i am ashamed .         each man armed with two swords     lord hong went on  ignoring him .     and i shall see how lucky these   sages   are .  because  my lords  i will only have to be lucky once .  they will have to be lucky a quarter of a million times .      he lowered his visor .      how lucky do you feel  my lords .      the other four warlords avoided one another   s gaze .   lord hong noticed their resigned silence .      very well  then     he said .     let the gongs be sounded and the firecrackers lit   to ensure good luck  of course .         there were a large number of ranks in the armies of the empire  and many of them were untranslatable .  three pink pig and five white fang were  loosely speaking  privates  and not just because they were pale  vulnerable  and inclined to curl up and hide when danger threatened .   in fact they were so private as to be downright secretive .  even the army   s mules ranked higher than them  because good mules were hard to come by whereas men like pink pig and white fang are found in every army  somewhere where a latrine is in need of cleaning .   they were so insignificant that they had  privately  decided that it would be a waste of an invisible foreign blood sucking ghost   s valuable time to attack them .  they felt it only fair  after it had come all this way  to give it the chance of fiendishly killing someone superior .   they had therefore hospitably decamped just before dawn and were now hiding out .  of course  if victory threatened they could always recamp .  it was unlikely that they   d be missed in all the excitement  and both men were somewhat expert at turning up on battlefields in time to join in the victory celebrations .  they lay in the long grass  watching the armies maneuver .   from this height  it looked like an impressive war .  the army on one side was so small as to be invisible .  of course  if you accepted the very strong denials of last night  it was so invisible as to be invisible .   it was also their elevation which meant that they were the first to notice the ring around the sky .   it was just above the thunderous wall on the horizon .  where stray shafts of sunlight hit it  it glowed golden .  elsewhere it was merely yellow .  but it was continuous  and thin as a thread .      funny looking cloud     said white fang .      yeah     said pink pig .     so what .      it was while they were thus engaged  and sharing a small bottle of rice wine liberated by pink pig from an unsuspecting comrade the previous evening  that they heard a groan .      oooooohhhhhh        their drinks froze in their throats .      did you hear that .     said pink pig .      you mean the           ooooohhhh           that   s it .      they turned  very slowly .   something had pulled itself out of a gully behind them .  it was humanoid  more or less .  red mud dripped from it .  strange noises issued from its mouth .      oooooohhhhshit .      pink pig grabbed white fang   s arm .      it   s an invisible blood sucking ghost .         but i can see it .      pink pig squinted .      it   s the red army .  they   ve come up outa the earth like everybody says .      white fang  who had several brain cells more than pink pig  and more importantly was only on his second cup of wine  took a closer look .      it could be just one ordinary man with mud all over him     he suggested .  he raised his voice .     hey  you .      the figure turned and tried to run .   pink pig nudged his friend .      is he one of ours .         looking like that .         let   s get him .         why .            cos he   s running away .         let him run .         maybe he   s got money .  anyway  what   s he running away for .         rincewind slid down into another gully .  of all the luck .  soldiers should be where they were expected to be .  what had happened to duty and honor and stuff like that .   the gully had dead grass and moss in the bottom .   he stood still and listened to the voices of the two men .   the air was stifling .  it was as if the oncoming storm was pushing all the hot air in front of it  turning the plain into a pressure cooker .   and then the ground creaked  and sagged suddenly .   the faces of the absentee soldiers appeared over the edge of the gully .   there was another creak and the ground sank another inch or two .  rincewind didn   t dare breathe in  in case the extra weight of air made him too heavy .  and it was very clear that the least activity  such as jumping  was going to make things worse     very carefully  he looked down .   the dead moss had given way .  he seemed to be standing on a baulk of timber buried in the ground  but dirt pouring around it suggested that there was a hole beneath .   it was going to give way any second n     rincewind threw himself forward .  the ground fell away underneath so that  instead of standing on a slowly breaking piece of timber  he was hanging with his arms over what felt like another concealed log and  by the feel of it  one which was as riddled with rot as the first one .   this one  possibly out of a desire to conform  began to sag .   and then jolted to a stop .   the faces of the soldiers vanished backwards as the sides of the gully began to slide .  dry earth and small stones slid past rincewind .  he could feel them rattle on his boots and drop away .   he felt  as an expert in these things  that he was over a depth .  from his point of view  it was also a height .   the log began to shift again .   this left rincewind with  as he saw it  two options .  he could let go and plunge to an uncertain fate in the darkness  or he could hang on until the timber gave way  and then plunge to an uncertain fate in the darkness .   and then  to his delight  there was a third option .  the toe of his boot touched something  a root  a protruding rock .  it didn   t matter .  it took some of his weight .  it took at least enough to put him in precarious equilibrium   not exactly safe  not exactly falling .  of course  it was only a temporary measure  but rincewind had always considered that life was no more than a series of temporary measures strung together .   a pale yellow butterfly with interesting patterns on its wings fluttered along the gully and settled on the only bit of color available  which turned out to be rincewind   s hat .   the wood sagged slightly .      push off .     said rincewind  trying not to use heavy language .     go away .      the butterfly flattened its wings and sunned itself .   rincewind pursed his lips and tried to blow up his own nostrils .   startled  the creature skittered into the air        hah .     said rincewind .      and  in response to its instincts in the face of a threat  moved its wings like this and this .   the bushes shivered .  and around the sky  the towering clouds curved into unusual patterns .   another cloud formed .  it was about the size of an angry gray balloon .  and it started to rain .  not rain generally  but specifically .  specifically on about a square foot of ground which contained rincewind  specifically  on his hat .   a very small bolt of lightning stung rincewind on the nose .      ah .  so we have      pink pig  appearing around the curve of the gully  hesitated a bit before continuing slightly more thoughtfully      a head in a hole   with a very small thunderstorm above it .      and then it dawned on him that  storm or no storm  nothing was preventing him from cutting off significant parts .  the only significant part available was a head  but that was fine by him .   at which point  rincewind   s hat having absorbed enough moisture  the ancient wood gave way under the strain and plunged him to an uncertain fate in the darkness .      it was utterly dark .   there had been a painful confusion of tunnels and sliding dirt .  rincewind assumed   or the small part of him that was not sobbing with fear assumed   that the earth had caved in after him .  cave .  that was a significant word .  he was in a cave .  reaching out carefully  in case he felt something  he felt for something to feel .   there was a straight edge .  it led to three more straight edges  going off at right angles .  so   this meant slab .   the darkness was still a choking velvet shroud .   slab meant that there was some other entrance  some proper entrance .  even now guards were probably hurrying towards him .   perhaps the luggage was hurrying towards them .  it had been acting very funny lately  that was for certain .  he was probably better off without it .  probably .   he patted his pockets  saying the mantra that even non wizards invoke in order to find matches  that is  he said     matches  matches  matches     madly to himself  under his breath .   he found some  and scratched one desperately with his thumbnail .      ow .      the smoky yellow flame lit nothing except rincewind   s hand and part of his sleeve .   he ventured a few steps before it burned his fingers  and when it died it left a blue afterglow in the darkness of his vision .   there were no sounds of vengeful feet .  there were no sounds at all .  in theory there should be the drip of water  but the air felt quite dry .   he tried another match  and this time raised it as high as he could and peered ahead .   a seven foot warrior smiled at him .      cohen looked up again .      it   s going to piss down in a minute     he said .     will you look at that sky .      there were hints of purple and red in the mass  and the occasional momentary glow of lightning somewhere inside the clouds .      teach .         yes .         you know everything .  why   s that cloud looking like that .      mr .  saveloy looked where cohen was pointing .  there was a yellowish cloud low on the horizon .  right around the horizon   one thin streak  as though the sun was trying to find a way through .      could be the lining .     said boy willie .      what lining .         every cloud   s supposed to have a silver one .         yeah  but that   s more like gold .         well  gold   s cheaper here .         is it me     said mr .  saveloy     or is it getting wider .      caleb was staring at the enemy lines .      there   s been a lot of blokes galloping about on their little horses     he said .     i hope they get a move on .  we don   t want to be here all day .         i vote we rushes    em while they   re not expectin    it     said hamish .      hold on   hold on       said truckle .  there was the sound of many gongs being beaten  and the crackling of fireworks .     looks like the bas   the lovechilds are moving .         thank goodness for that     said cohen .  he stood up and stubbed out his cigarette .   mr .  saveloy trembled with excitement .      do we sing a song for the gods before we go into battle .     he said .      you can if you like     said cohen .      well  do we say any heathen chants or prayers .         shouldn   t think so     said cohen .  he glanced up at the horizon girdling band .  it was unsettling him far more than the approaching enemy .  it was wider now  but slightly paler .  for just a moment he found himself wishing that there was one god or goddess somewhere whose temple he hadn   t violated  robbed  or burned down .      don   t we bang our swords on our shields and utter defiance .     said the teacher hopefully .      too late for that  really     said cohen .   mr .  saveloy looked so crestfallen at the lack of pagan splendor that the ancient barbarian was  to his own surprise  moved to add     but feel free  if that   s what you want .      the horde drew their various swords .  in hamish   s case  another axe was produced from under his rug .      see you in heaven .     said mr .  saveloy excitedly .      yeah  right     said caleb  eyeing the line of approaching soldiers .      where there   s feasting and young ladies and so forth .         yeah  yeah     said boy willie  testing the blade of his sword .      and carousing and quaffing  i believe .         could be     said vincent  trying to ease the tendonitis in his arm .      and we   ll do that thing  you know  where you throw the axes and cut ladies    plaits off .         yeah  if you like .         but           whut .         the actual feasting   do they do anything vegetarian .      and the advancing army screamed and charged .   they rushed at the horde  almost as fast as the clouds boiling in from every direction .      rincewind   s brain unfroze slowly  in the darkness and silence of the hill .   it   s a statue  he told himself .  that   s all it is .  no problem there .  not even a particularly good one .  just a big statue of a man in armor .  look  there   s a couple more  you can just see them at the edge of the light        ow .      he dropped the match and sucked his fingers .   what he needed now was a wall .  walls had exits .  true  they could also be entrances  but now there did not seem much danger of any guards hurrying in here .  the air had an ancient smell  with a hint of fox and a slight trace of thunderstorms  but above all it tasted unused .   he crept forward  testing each step with his foot .   then there was light .  a small blue spark jumped off rincewind   s finger .      cohen grabbed at his beard .  it was straining away from his face .   mr .  saveloy   s fringe of hair stood out from his head and sparked at the ends .      static discharges .     he shouted  above the crackle .   ahead of them the spears of the enemy glowed at the tips .  the charge faltered .  there was the occasional shriek as sparks leaped from man to man .   cohen looked up .      oh  my     he said .     will you look at that .         tiny sparks flickered around rincewind as he eased himself over the unseen floor .   the word tomb had presented itself for his consideration  and one thing rincewind knew about large tombs was that their builders were often jolly inventive in the traps and spikes department .  they also put in things like paintings and statues  possibly so that the dead had something to look at if they became bored .   rincewind   s hand touched stone  and he moved carefully sideways .  now and again his feet touched something yielding and soft .  he very much hoped it was mud .   and then  right at hand height  was a lever .  it stuck out fully two feet .   now   it could be a trap .  but traps were generally  well  traps .  the first you knew about them was when your head was rolling along the corridor several yards away .  and trap builders tended to be straightforwardly homicidal and seldom required victims to actively participate in their own destruction .   rincewind pulled it .      the yellow cloud sailed overhead in its millions  moving much faster on the wind they   d created than the slow beating of their wings would suggest .  behind them came the storm .   mr .  saveloy blinked .      butterflies .      both sides stopped as the creatures sleeted past .  it was even possible to hear the rustle of their wings .      all right  teach     said cohen .     explain this one .         it  it  it could be a natural phenomenon     said mr .  saveloy .     er   monarch butterflies  for example  have been known to   er   to tell you the truth  i don   t know        the cloud swarmed on towards the hill .      not some kind of sign .     said cohen .     there must have been some temple i didn   t rob .         the trouble with signs and portents     said boy willie     is you never know who they   re for .  this   n could be a nice one for hong and his pals .         then i   m nicking it     said cohen .      you can   t steal a message from the gods .     said mr .  saveloy .      can you see it nailed down anywhere .  no .  sure .  right .  so it   s mine .      he raised his sword as the stragglers fluttered past overhead .      the gods smile on us .     he bellowed .     hahaha .         hahaha .     whispered mr .  saveloy .      just to worry    em     said cohen .   he glanced at the other members of the horde .  each man nodded  very slightly .      all right  lads     he said quietly .     this is it .         er   what do i do .     said mr .  saveloy .      think of something to make yourself good and angry .  that gets the ole blood boiling .  imagine the enemy is everything you hate .         head teachers     said mr .  saveloy .      good .         sports masters .     shouted mr .  saveloy .      yep .         boys who chew gum .     screamed mr .  saveloy .      look at him  steam coming out of his ears already     said cohen .     first one to the afterlife gets    em in .  charge .         the yellow cloud thronged up the slopes of the hill and then  carried on the uprising wind  rose .   above it the storm rose  too  piling up and up and spreading into a shape something like a hammer     it struck .   lightning hit the iron pagoda so hard that it exploded into white hot fragments .      it is confusing for an entire army to be attacked by seven old men .  no book of tactics is up to the task of offering advice .  there is a tendency towards bafflement .   the soldiers backed away in the face of the rush and then  driven by currents in the great mass of men  closed in behind .   a solid circle of shields surrounded the horde .  it buckled and swayed under the press of men  and also under the blows rained on it by mr .  saveloy   s sword .      come on  fight .     he shouted .     smoke pipes at me  would you .  you .  that boy there .  answer me back  eh .  take that .      cohen looked at caleb  who shrugged .  he   d seen berserk rages in his time  but nothing quite so incandescent as mr .  saveloy .   the circle broke as a couple of men tried to dart backwards and cannoned into the rank behind and then rebounded on to the swords of the horde .  one of hamish   s wheels caught a soldier a vicious blow on the knee and  as he bent over  one of hamish   s axes met him coming the other way .   it wasn   t speed .  the horde couldn   t move very fast .  but it was economy .  mr .  saveloy had remarked on it .  they were simply always where they wanted to be  which was never where someone   s sword was .  they let everyone else do the running around .  a soldier would risk a slash in the direction of truckle and find cohen rising in front of him  grinning and swinging  or boy willie giving him a nod of acknowledgement and a stab .  occasionally one of the horde took time to parry a blow aimed at mr .  saveloy  who was far too excited to defend himself .      pull back  you bloody fools .      lord hong appeared behind the throng  his horse rearing  his helmet visor flung back .   the soldiers tried to obey .  finally  the press eased a little  and then opened .  the horde were left in a widening ring of shields .  there was something like silence  broken only by the endless thunder and the crackle of lightning on the hill .   and then  pushing their way angrily through the soldiers  came an altogether different breed of warrior .  they were taller  and heavier armored  with splendid helmets and moustaches that looked like a declaration of war in themselves .   one of them glared at cohen .      orrrrr .  itiyorshu .  yutimishu .         wassat .     said cohen .      he   s a samurai     said mr .  saveloy  wiping his forehead .     the warrior caste .  i think that   s their formal challenge .  er .  would you like me to fight him .      one samurai glared at cohen .  he pulled a scrap of silk out of his armor and tossed it into the air .  his other hand grabbed the hilt of his long  thin sword     there was hardly even a hiss  but three shreds of silk tumbled gently to the ground .      get back  teach     said cohen slowly .     i reckon this one   s mine .  got another hanky .  thanks .      the samurai looked at cohen   s sword .  it was long  heavy and had so many notches it could have been used as a saw .      you   ll never do it     he said .     with that sword .  never .      cohen blew his nose noisily .      you say .     he said .     watch this .      the handkerchief soared into the air .  cohen gripped his sword     he   d beheaded three upward staring samurai before the handkerchief started to tumble .  other members of the horde  who tended to think in much the same way as their leader  had accounted for half a dozen more .      got the idea from caleb     said cohen .     and the message is  either fight or muck about  it   s up to you .         have you no honor .     screamed lord hong .     are you just a ruffian .         i   m a barbarian     shouted cohen .     and the honor i got  see  is mine .  i didn   t steal it off   f someone else .         i had wanted to take you alive     said lord hong .     however  i see no reason to stick to this policy .      he drew his sword .      back  you scum .     he screamed .     right back .  let the bombardiers come forward .     he looked back at cohen .  his face was flushed .  his spectacles were askew .   lord hong had lost his temper .  and  as is always the case when a dam bursts  it engulfs whole countries .   the soldiers pulled back .   the horde were  once again  in a widening circle .      what   s a bombardier .     said boy willie .      er  i believe it must mean people who fire some sort of projectile     said mr .  saveloy .     the word derives from           oh  archers     said boy willie  and spat .      whut .         he said they   re going to use archers  hamish .         heheh  we never let archers stop us at the battle of koom valley .     cackled the antique barbarian .   boy willie sighed .      that was between dwarfs and trolls  hamish     he said .     and you ain   t either .  so whose side were you on .         whut .         i said whose side were you on .         i were on the side of being paid money to fight     said hamish .      best side there is .         rincewind lay on the floor with his hands over his ears .   the sound of thunder filled the underground chamber .  blue and purple light shone so brightly that he could see it through his eyelids .   finally the cacophony subsided .  there were still the sounds of the storm outside  but the light had faded to a blue white glow  and the sound into a steady humming .   rincewind risked rolling over and opening his eyes .   hanging from rusted chains in the roof were big glass globes .  each one was the size of a man  and lightning crackled and sizzled inside  stabbing at the glass  seeking a way out .   at one time there must have been many more .  but dozens of the big globes had fallen down over the years  and lay in pieces on the floor .  there were still scores up there  swaying gently on their chains as the imprisoned thunderstorms fought for their freedom .   the air felt greasy .  sparks crawled over the floor and crackled on each angle .   rincewind stood up .  his beard streamed out as a mass of individual hairs .   the lightning globes shone down on a round lake of  to judge from the ripples  pure quicksilver .  in the center was a low  five sided island .  as rincewind stared  a boat came drifting gently around to his side of the pool  making little slupslup noises as it moved through the mercury .   it was not a lot larger than a rowing boat and  lying on its tiny deck  was a figure in armor .  or possibly just the armor .  if it was just empty armor  then it was lying in the arms folded position of a suit of armor that has passed away .   rincewind sidled around the silver lake until he reached a slab of what looked very much like gold  set in the floor in front of a statue .   he knew you got inscriptions in tombs  although he was never sure who it was who was supposed to read them .  the gods  possibly  although surely they knew everything already .  he   d never considered that they   d cluster round and say things like     gosh     dearly beloved    was he .  i never knew that .      this one simply said  in pictograms  one sun mirror .   there wasn   t anything about mighty conquests .  there was no list of his tremendous achievements .  there was nothing down there about wisdom or being the father of his people .  there was no explanation .  whoever knows this name  it seemed to say  knows everything .  and there was no admitting the possibility that anyone getting this far would not have heard the name of one sun mirror .   the statue looked like porcelain .  it had been painted quite realistically .  one sun mirror seemed an ordinary sort of man .  you would not have pointed him out in a crowd as emperor material .  but this man  with his little round hat and little round shield and little round men on little round ponies  had glued together a thousand warring factions into one great empire  often using their own blood to do it .   rincewind looked closer .  of course  it was just an impression  but around the set of the mouth and the look of the eyes there was an expression he   d last seen on the face of ghenghiz cohen .   it was the expression of someone who was absolutely and totally unafraid of anything .   the little boat headed towards the far side of the lake .   one of the globes flickered a little and then faded to red .  it winked out .  another followed it .   he had to get out .   there was something else  though .  at the foot of the statue  lying as if they   d just been dropped there  were a helmet  a pair of gauntlets  and two heavy looking boots .   rincewind picked up the helmet .  it didn   t look very strong  but it did look quite light .  normally he didn   t bother with protective clothing  reasoning that the best defense against threatening danger was to be on another continent  but right now the idea of armor had its attractions .   he removed his hat  put the helmet on  pulled down the visor  and then wedged the hat on top of the helmet .   there was a flicker in front of his eyes and rincewind was staring at the back of his own head .  it was a grainy picture  and it was in shades of green rather than proper colors  but it was definitely the back of his own head he was looking at .  people had told him what it looked like .   he raised the visor and blinked .   the pool was still in front of him .   he lowered the visor .   there he was  about fifty feet away  with this helmet on his head .   he waved a hand up and down .   the figure in the visor waved a hand up and down .   he turned around and faced himself .  yep .  that was him .   okay  he thought .  a magic helmet .  it lets you see yourself a long way away .  great .  you can have fun watching yourself fall into holes you can   t see because they   re right up close .   he turned around again  raised the visor and inspected the gloves .  they seemed as light as the helmet but quite clumsy .  you could hold a sword  but not much else .   he tried one on .  immediately  with a faint sizzling noise  a row of little pictures lit up on the wide cuff .  they showed soldiers .  soldiers digging  soldiers fighting  soldiers climbing     ah .  so   magic armor .  perfectly normal magic armor .  it had never been very popular in ankh morpork .  of course  it was light .  you could make it as thin as cloth .  but it tended to lose its magic without warning .  many an ancient lord   s last words had been     you can   t kill me because i   ve got magic aaargh .      rincewind looked at the boots  with suspicious recollection of the trouble there had been with the university   s prototype seven league boots .  footwear which tried to make you take steps twenty one miles long imposed unfortunate groinal strains  they   d got the things off the student just in time  but he   d still had to wear a special device for several months  and ate standing up .   all right  but even old magic armor would be useful now .  it wasn   t as if it weighed much  and the mud of hunghung hadn   t improved what was left of his own boots .  he put his feet into them .   he thought  well  so what is supposed to happen now .   he straightened up .   and behind him  with the sound of seven thousand flower pots smashing together  the lightning still crackling over them  the red army came to attention .      hex had grown a bit during the night .  adrian turnipseed  who had been on duty to feed the mice and rewind the clockwork and clean out the dead ants  had sworn that he   d done nothing else and that no one had come in .   but now  where there had been the big clumsy arrangement of blocks so that the results could be read  was a quill pen in the middle of a network of pulleys and levers .      watch     said adrian  nervously tapping out a very simple problem .     it   s come up with this after doing all those spells at suppertime        the ants scuttled .  the clockwork spun .  the springs and levers jerked so sharply that ponder took a step back .   the quill pen wobbled over to an inkwell  dipped  returned to the sheet of paper adrian had put under the levers  and began to write .      it blots a bit     he said  in a helpless tone of voice .     what   s happening .      ponder had been thinking further about this .  the latest conclusions hadn   t been comforting .      well   we know that books containing magic become a little bit   sapient       he began .     and we   ve made a machine for           you mean it   s alive .         come on  let   s not get all occult about this     said ponder  trying to sound jovial .     we   re wizards  after all .         listen  you know that long problem in thaumic fields you wanted me to put in .         yes .  well .         it gave me the answer at midnight     said adrian  his face pale .      good .         yes  good  except that i didn   t actually give it the problem until half past one  ponder .         you   re telling me you got the answer before you asked the question .         yes .         why did you ask the question  then .         i thought about it  and i thought maybe i had to .  i mean  it couldn   t have known what the answer was going to be if i didn   t give it the problem  yes .         good point .  er .  you waited ninety minutes  though .      adrian looked at his pointy boots .      i   was hiding in the privy .  well  redo from start could           all right  all right .  go and have something to eat .         are we meddling with things we don   t understand  ponder .      ponder looked up at the gnomic bulk of the machine .  it didn   t seem threatening  merely   other .   he thought  meddle first  understand later .  you had to meddle a bit before you had anything to try to understand .  and the thing was never  ever  to go back and hide in the lavatory of unreason .  you have to try to get your mind around the universe before you can give it a twist .   perhaps we shouldn   t have given you a name .  we didn   t think about that .  it was a joke .  but we should have remembered that names are important .  a thing with a name is a bit more than a thing .      off you go  adrian     he said firmly .   he sat down and carefully typed   hello .   things whirred .   the quill wrote        .  .  .  .  .  .      hello     redo from start      far above  a butterfly   its wings an undistinguished yellow  with black markings   fluttered through an open window .   ponder began the calculations for the transfer between hunghung and ankh morpork .   the butterfly alighted for a moment on the maze of glass pipes .  when it rose again  it left behind a very small blob of nectar .   ponder typed carefully  far below .   a small but significant ant  one of the scurrying thousands  emerged from a break in the tube and spent a few seconds sucking at the sweet liquid before going back to work .   after a while  hex gave an answer .  apart from one small but significant point  it was entirely correct .      rincewind turned around .   with an echoing chorus of creaks and groans  the red army turned around  too .   and it was red .  it was the same color  rincewind realized  as the soil .   he   d bumped into a few statues in the darkness .  he hadn   t realized that there were this many .  they stretched  rank on rank  into the distant shadows .   experimentally  he turned around .  behind him  there was another chorus of stampings .   after a few false starts he found that the only way to end up facing them was to take off the boots  turn  and put the boots on again .   he lowered the visor for a moment  and saw himself lowering the visor for a moment .   he stuck up an arm .  they stuck out their arms .  he jumped up and down .  they jumped up and down  with a crash that made the globes swing .  lightning sizzled from their boots .   he felt a sudden hysterical urge to laugh .   he touched his nose .  they touched their noses .  he made  with terrible glee  the traditional gesture for the dismissal of demons .  seven thousand terracotta middle fingers stabbed towards the ceiling .   he tried to calm down .   the word his mind had been groping for finally surfaced  and it was golem .   there were one or two of them  even in ankh morpork .  you were bound to get them in any area where you had wizards or priests of an experimental turn of mind .  they were usually just figures made out of clay and animated with some suitable spell or prayer .  they pottered about doing simple odd jobs  but they were not very fashionable these days .  the problem was not putting them to work but stopping them from working  if you set a golem to digging the garden and then forgot about it  you   d come back to find it   d planted a row of beans      miles long .   rincewind looked down at one of the gloves .   he cautiously touched the little picture of a fighting soldier .   the sound of seven thousand swords being simultaneously unsheathed was like the tearing of a thick sheet of steel .  seven thousand points were pointed right at rincewind .   he took a step back .  so did the army .   he was in a place with thousands of artificial soldiers wearing swords .  the fact that he appeared to have control of them was no great comfort .  he   d theoretically had control of rincewind for the whole of his life  and look what had happened to him .   he looked at the little pictures again .  one of them showed a soldier with two heads .  when he touched it  the army turned about smartly .  ah .   now to get out of here        the horde watched the bustle among lord hong   s men .  objects were being dragged to the front line .      they don   t look like archers to me     said boy willie .      those things are barking dogs     said cohen .     i should know .  seen    em before .  they   re like a barrel full of fireworks  and when the fireworks are lit a big stone comes rushing out of the other end .         why .         well  would you hang around if someone had just lit a firework by your arse .         here  teach  he said    arse        complained truckle .     look  on my bit of paper here it says you mustn   t say           we   ve got shields  haven   t we .     said mr .  saveloy .     i   m sure if we keep close together and put the shields over our heads we   ll be as right as rain .         the stone   s about a foot across and going very fast and it   s red hot .         not shields  then .         no     said cohen .     truckle  you push hamish           we won   t get fifty yards  ghenghiz     said caleb .      better fifty yards now than six feet in a minute  yes .     said cohen .      bravo .     said mr .  saveloy .      whut .      lord hong watched them .  he saw the horde hang their shields around the wheelchair to form a crude traveling wall  and saw the wheels begin to turn .   he raised his sword .      fire .         still tamping the charges  o lord .         i said fire .         got to prime the dogs  o lord .      the bombardiers worked feverishly  spurred on less by terror of lord hong than by the onrushing horde .   mr .  saveloy   s hair streamed in the wind .  he bounded through the dust  waving his sword and screaming .   he   d never been so happy in all his life .   so this was the secret at the heart of it all  to look death right in the face and charge   it made everything so utterly simple .   lord hong threw down his helmet .     fire  you wretched peasants .  you scum of the earth .  why must i ask twice .  give me that torch .      he pushed a bombardier aside  crouched down beside a dog  heaved on it so that the barrel was pointing at the oncoming cohen  lifted the torch     the earth heaved .  the dog reared and rolled sideways .   a round red head  smiling faintly  rose out of the ground .   there were screams in the ranks as the soldiers looked down at the moving dirt under their boots  tried to run on a surface that was just shifting soil  and disappeared in the rising cloud of dust .   the ground caved in .   then it caved out again as stricken soldiers climbed up one another to escape because  rising gently through the turmoil  was the soil in human shape .   the horde skidded to a halt .      what   re they .  trolls .     said cohen .  ten of the figures were visible now  industriously digging at the air .   then they stopped .  one of them turned its gently smiling head this way and that .   a sergeant must have screamed a handful of archers into line  because a few arrows shattered on the terracotta armor  with absolutely no effect .   other red warriors were climbing up behind the former diggers .  they collided with them  with a sound of crockery .  then  as one man   or troll  or demon   they drew their swords  turned around  and headed towards lord hong   s army .   a few soldiers tried to fight them simply because there was too great a crowd behind them to run away .  they died .   it wasn   t that the red guards were good fighters .  they were very mechanical  each one performing the same thrust  parry  slash  regardless of what their opponent was doing .  but they were simply unstoppable .  if their opponent escaped one of the blows but didn   t get out of the way then he was just trodden on   and by the looks of things  the warriors were extremely heavy .   and it was the way the things smiled all the time that added to the terror .      well  now  there   s a thing     cohen said  feeling for his tobacco pouch .      never seen trolls fight like that     said truckle .  rank after rank was walking up out of the hole  stabbing happily at the air .   the front row were moving in a cloud of dust and screams .  it is hard for a big army to do anything quickly  and divisions trying to move forward to see what the trouble was were getting in the way of fleeing individuals seeking a hole to hide in and permanent civilian status .  gongs were banging and men were trying to shout orders  but no one knew what the gongs were meant to mean or how the orders should be obeyed  because there didn   t seem to be enough time .   cohen finished rolling his cigarette  and struck a match on his chin .      right     he said  to the world in general .     let   s get that bloody hong .      the clouds overhead were less fearsome now .  there was less lightning .  but there were still a lot of them  greeny black  heavy with rain .      but this is amazing .     said mr .  saveloy .   a few drops hit the ground  leaving wide craters in the dirt .      yeah  right     said cohen .      a most strange phenomenon .  warriors rising out of the ground .      the craters joined up .  it felt as though the drops were joining up as well .  the rain began to pour down .      dunno     said cohen  watching a ragged platoon flee past .     never been here before .  p   raps this happens a lot .         i mean  it   s just like that myth about the man who sowed dragons    teeth and terrible fighting skeletons came up .         i don   t believe that     said caleb  as they jogged after cohen .      why not .         if you sow dragons    teeth  you should get dragons .  not fighting skeletons .  what did it say on the packet .         i don   t know .  the myth never said anything about them coming in a packet .         should   ve said    comes up dragons    on the packet .         you can   t believe myths     said cohen .     i should know .  right   there he is       he added  pointing to a distant horseman .   the whole plain was in turmoil now .  the red warriors were only the start .  the alliance of the five warlords was glass fragile in any case  and panicky flight was instantly interpreted as sneak attack .  no one paid any attention to the horde .  they didn   t have any colored pennants or gongs .  they weren   t traditional enemies .  and  besides  the soil was now mud  and the mud flew  and everyone from the waist down was the same color and this was rising .      what   re we doing  ghenghiz .     said mr .  saveloy .      we   re heading back for the palace .         why .            cos that   s where hong   s gone .         but there   s this astonishing           look  teach  i   ve seen walking trees and spider gods and big green things with teeth     said cohen .     it   s no good goin    around saying    astonishing    all the time  ain   t that so  truckle .         right .  d   you know  when i went after that five headed vampire goat over in skund they said i shouldn   t on account of it being an endangered species .  i said  yes  that was down to me .  were they grateful .         huh     said caleb .     should   ve thanked you  giving them all those endangered species to worry about .  turn around and go home right now  soldier boy .      a group of soldiers  fighting to get away from the red warriors  skidded in the mud  stared in terror at the horde  and headed off in a new direction .   truckle stopped for breath  rain streaming off his beard .      i can   t be having with this running  though     he said .     not and push hamish   s wheelchair in all this mud .  let   s have a breather .         whut .         stopping for a breather .     said cohen .     my gods .  i never thought i   d see the day .  a hero having a rest .  did voltan the indestructible have a bit of a rest .         he   s having one now .  he   s dead  ghenghiz     said caleb .   cohen hesitated .      what  old voltan .         didn   t you know .  and the immortal jenkins .         jenkins isn   t dead  i saw him only last year .         but he   s dead now .  all the heroes are dead     cept us .  and i ain   t too sure about me  too .      cohen splashed forward and snatched caleb upright by his shirt .      what about hrun .  he can   t be dead .  he   s half our age .         last i heard he got a job .  sergeant of the guard somewhere .         sergeant of the guard .     said cohen .     what  for pay .         yep .         but   what  like  for pay .         he told me he might make captain next year .  he said   he said it   s a job with a pension .      cohen released his grip .      there   s not many of us now  cohen     said truckle .   cohen spun around .      all right  but there   s never been many of us .  and i ain   t dyin    .  not if it means the world   s taken over by bastards like hong  who don   t know what a chieftain is .  scum .  that   s what he called his soldiers .  scum .  it   s like that bloody civilized game you showed us  teach .         chess .         right .  the prawns are just there to be slaughtered by the other side .  while the king just hangs around at the back .         yeah  but the other side   s you  cohen .         right .  right   well  yes  that   s fine when i   m the enemy .  but i don   t shove men in front of me to get killed instead of me .  and i never use bows and them dog things .  when i kill someone it   s up close and personal .  armies .  bloody tactics .  there   s only one way to fight  and that   s everyone charging all at once  waving their swords and shouting .  now on your feet and let   s get after him .         it   s been a long morning  ghenghiz     said boy willie .      don   t give me that .         i could do with the lavatory .  it   s all this rain .         let   s get hong first .         if he   s hiding in the privy that   s fine by me .      they reached the city gates .  they had been shut .  hundreds of people  citizens as well as guards  watched them from the walls .   cohen waved a finger at them .      now i ain   t gonna say this twice     he said .     i   m coming in  okay .  it can be the easy way  or it can be the hard way .      impassive faces looked down at the skinny old man  and up at the plain  where the armies of the warlords fought one another and  in terror  the terracotta warriors .  down .  up .  down .  up .      right     said cohen .     don   t say afterwards i didn   t warn youse .      he raised his sword and prepared to charge .      wait     said mr .  saveloy .     listen        there was shouting behind the walls  and some confused orders  and then more shouting .  and then a couple of screams .   the gates swung open  pulled by dozens of citizens .   cohen lowered his sword .      ah     he said     they   ve seen reason  have they .      wheezing a little  the horde limped through the gates .  the crowd watched them in silence .  several guards lay dead .  rather more had removed their helmets and decided to opt for a bright new future in civvy street  where you were less likely to get beaten to death by an angry mob .   every face watched cohen  turning to follow him as flowers follow the sun .   he ignored them .      crowdie the strong .     he said to caleb .      dead .         can   t be .  he was a picture of health when i saw him a coupla months ago .  going on a new quest and everything .         dead .         what happened .         you know the terrible man eating sloth of clup .         the one they say guards the giant ruby of the mad snake god .         the very same .  well   it was .      the crowd parted to let the horde through .  one or two people tried a cheer  but were shushed into silence .  it was a silence that mr .  saveloy had only heard before in the most devout of temples .    there was a whispering  though  growing out of that watchful silence like bubbles in a pot of water on a hot fire .   it went like this .   the red army .  the red army .      how about organdy sloggo .  still going strong down in howondaland  last i heard .         dead .  metal poisoning .         how .         three swords through the stomach .      the red army .      slasher mungo .         presumed dead in skund .         presumed .         well  they only found his head .      the red army .   the horde approached the inner gates of the forbidden city .  the crowd followed them at a distance .   these gates were shut  too .  a couple of heavyset guards were standing in front of them .  they wore the expressions of men who   d been told to guard the gates and were going to guard the gates come what may .  the military depends on people who will guard gates or bridges or passes come what may and there are often heroic poems written in their honor  invariably posthumously .      gosbar the wake .         died in bed  i heard .         not old gosbar .         everyone   s got to sleep some time .         that   s not the only thing they   ve got to do  mister     said boy willie .     i really need the wossname .         well  there   s the wall .         not with everyone watching .  that ain   t   civilized .      cohen strode up to the guards .      i   m not mucking about     he said .     okay .  would you rather die than betray your emperor .      the guards stared ahead .      right  fair enough .     cohen drew his sword .  a thought seemed to strike him .      nurker .     he said .     big nurker .  tough as old boots  him .         fishbone     said caleb .      nurker .  he once killed six trolls with a           choked on a fishbone in his gruel .  i thought you knew .  sorry .      cohen stared at him .  and then at his sword .  and then at the guards .  for a moment there was silence  broken only by the sound of the rain .      y   know  lads     he said  in a voice so suddenly full of weariness that mr .  saveloy felt a pit opening up  here  at the moment of triumph     i was goin    to chop your heads off .  but   what   s the point  eh .  i mean  when you get right down to it  why bother .  what sort of difference does it make .      the guards still stared straight ahead .  but their eyes were widening .   mr .  saveloy turned .      you   ll end up dead anyway  sooner or later     cohen went on .     well  that   s about it .  you live your life best way you can and then it don   t actually matter     cos you   re dead           er .  cohen .     said mr .  saveloy .      i mean  look at me .  been chopping heads off my whole life and what   ve i got to show for it .         cohen        the guards weren   t just staring now .  their faces were dragging themselves into very creditable grimaces of fear .      cohen .         yeah  what .         i think you should look round  cohen .      cohen turned .   half a dozen red warriors were advancing up the street .  the crowd had pulled right back and were watching in silent terror .   then a voice shouted     extended duration to the red army .      cries rose up here and there in the crowd .  a young woman raised her hand in a clenched fist .      advance necessarily with the people while retaining due regard for traditions .      others joined her .      deserved correction to enemies .         i   ve lost mr .  bunny .      the red giants clonked to a halt .      look at them .     said mr .  saveloy .     they   re not trolls .  they move like some kind of engine .  doesn   t that interest you .         no     said cohen  vacantly .     abstract thinking is not a major aspect of the barbarian mental process .  now then  where was i .     he sighed .     oh  yes .  you two   you   d rather die than betray your emperor  would you .      the two men were rigid with fear now .   cohen raised his sword .   mr .  saveloy took a deep breath  grabbed cohen   s sword arm and shouted      then open the gates and let him through .      there was a moment of utter silence .   mr .  saveloy nudged cohen .      go on     he hissed .     act like an emperor .         what   you mean giggle  have people tortured  that sort of thing .  blow that .         no .  act like an emperor ought to act .      cohen glared at saveloy .  then he turned to the guards .      well done     he said .     your loyalty does you   wossname   credit .  keep on like this and i can see it   s promotion for both of you .  now let us all go inside or i will have my flowerpot men chop off your feet so you   ll have to kneel in the gutter while you   re looking for your head .      the men looked at one another  threw down their swords and tried to kowtow .      and you can bloody well get up  too     said cohen  in a slightly nicer tone of voice .     mr .  saveloy .         yes .         i   m emperor now  am i .         the   earth soldiers seem to be on our side .  the people think you   ve won .  we   re all alive .  i   d say we   ve won  yes .         if i   m emperor  i can tell everyone what to do  right .         oh  indeed .         properly .  you know .  scrolls and stuff .  buggers in uniform blowing trumpets and saying     this is what he wants you to do .            ah .  you want to make a proclamation .         yeah .  no more of this bloody kowtowing .  it makes me squirm .  no kowtowing by anyone to anyone  all right .  if anyone sees me they can salute  or maybe give me some money .  but none of this banging your head on the ground stuff .  it gives me the willies .  now  dress that up in proper writing .         right away .  and           hang on  haven   t finished yet .     cohen bit his lip in unaccustomed cogitation  as the red warriors lurched to a stop .     yeah .  you can add that i   m letting all prisoners go free  unless they   ve done something really bad .  like attempted poisoning  for a start .  you can work out the details .  all torturers to have their heads cut off .  and every peasant can have a free pig  something like that .  i   ll leave you to put in all the proper curly bits about    by order    and stuff .      cohen looked down at the guards .      get up  i said .  i swear  the next bastard that kisses the ground in front of me is gonna get kicked in the antique chicken coops .  okay .  now open the gates .      the crowd cheered .  as the horde stepped inside the forbidden city they followed  in a sort of cross between a revolutionary charge and a respectful walk .   the red warriors stood outside .  one of them raised a terracotta foot  which groaned a little  and walked towards the wall until it bumped into it .   the warrior staggered drunkenly for a while and then managed to get within a yard or two of the wall without colliding with it .   it raised a finger and wrote  shakily  in red dust that turned to a kind of paint on the wet plaster      help help its me im out here on thee plain help i cant get this blody armer off .      the crowd surged along behind cohen  shouting and singing .  if he   d had a surfboard  he could have ridden on it .  the rain drummed heavily on the roof and poured into the courtyards .      why   re they all so excited .     he said .      they think you   re going to sack the palace     said mr .  saveloy .     they   ve heard about barbarians  you see .  they want some of it .  anyway  they like the idea about the pig .         hey  you .     shouted cohen to a boy struggling past under the weight of a huge vase .     get your thieving paws off my stuff .  that   s valuable  that is .  it   s a   a           it   s s   ang dynasty     said mr .  saveloy .      that   s right     said the vase .      that   s a s   ang dynasty  that is .  put it back .  and you lot back there       he turned and waved his sword .     get those shoes off .  you   re scratching the floor .  look at the state of it already .         you never bothered about the floor yesterday     truckle grumbled .         tweren   t my floor then .         yes  it was     said mr .  saveloy .      not properly     said cohen .     rite of conquest  that   s the thing .  blood .  people understand blood .  you just walk in and take over and no one takes it seriously .  but seas of blood   everyone understands that .         mountains of skulls     said truckle approvingly .      look at history     said cohen .     whenever you   hey  you  the man with the hat  that   s my           inlaid mahogany shibo yangcong san table     murmured mr .  saveloy .         so put it back  d   you hear .  yes  whenever you comes across a king where everyone says     oo  he was a good king all right     you can bet your sandals he was a great big bearded bastard who broke heads a lot and laughed about it .  hey .  but some king who just passed decent little laws and read books and tried to look intelligent      oh     they say     oh  he was all right  a bit wet  not what i   d call a proper king .     that   s people for you .      mr .  saveloy sighed .   cohen grinned at him and slapped him on the back so hard he stumbled into two women trying to carry off a bronze statue of ly tin wheedle .      can   t quite face it  teach  can you .  can   t get your mind round it .  don   t worry about it .  basically  you ain   t a barbarian .  put the damn statue back  missus  or you   ll feel the flat of my sword  so you will .         but i thought we could do it without anyone getting hurt .  by using our brains .         can   t .  history don   t work like that .  blood first  then brains .         mountains of skulls     said truckle .      there   s got to be a better way than fighting     said mr .  saveloy .      yep .  lots of    em .  only none of    em work .  caleb  take those   those              fine bhong jade miniatures       muttered mr .  saveloy .         take them off that feller .  he   s got one under his hat .      another set of carved doors was swung open .  this room was already crowded  but the people shuffled backwards as the doors parted and tried to look keen while avoiding catching cohen   s eye .   as they pulled away they left six beneficent winds standing all alone .  the court had become very good at this maneuver .      mountains of skulls     said truckle  not a man to let go in a hurry .      er .  we saw the red army rise out of the ground  er  just as the legend foretold .  er .  truly you are the preincarnation of one sun mirror .      the little taxman had the decency to look embarrassed .  as speeches went it was on a dramatic level with the one that traditionally began     as you know  your father   the king       besides  he   d never believed in legends up to now   not even the one about the peasant who every year filed a scrupulously honest tax return .      yeah  right     said cohen .   he strode to the throne and stuck his sword in the floor  where it vibrated .      some of you are going to get your heads cut off for your own good     he said .     but i haven   t decided who yet .  and someone show boy willie where the privy is .         no need     said boy willie .     not after them big red statues turned up behind me so sudden .         mountains of       truckle began .      dunno about mountains     said cohen .      and where     said six beneficent winds tremulously     is the great wizard .         great wizard     said cohen .      yes  the great wizard who summoned the red army from the earth     said the taxman .      don   t know anything about him     said cohen .   the crowd staggered forward as more people piled into the room .      they   re coming .      a terracotta warrior clomped its way into the room  its face still wearing a very faint smile .   it stopped  rocking a little  while water dripped off it .   people had crouched back in terror .  except the horde  mr .  saveloy noticed .  faced with unknown yet terrible dangers  the horde were either angry or puzzled .   then he cheered up .  they weren   t better  just different .  they   re all right facing huge terrible creatures  he told himself  but ask them to go down the street and buy a bag of rice and they go all to pieces        what   s my move now  teach .     cohen whispered .      well  you   re emperor     said mr .  saveloy .     i think you talk to it .         okay .      cohen stood up and nodded cheerfully at the terracotta giant .         morning     he said .     nice bit of work out there .  you and the rest of your lads can have the day off to plant geraniums in yourselves or whatever you do .  er .  you got a number one giant i ought to speak to .      the terracotta warrior creaked as it raised one finger .   then it pressed two fingers against one forearm  then raised a finger again .   everyone in the crowd started talking at once .   the giant tugged one vestigial ear with two fingers .      what can this mean .     said six beneficent winds .      i find this a little hard to credit     said mr .  saveloy     but it is an ancient method of communication used in the land of blood sucking vampire ghosts .         you can understand it .         oh  yes .  i think so .  you have to try to guess the word or phrase .  it   s trying to tell us   er   one word  two syllables .  first syllable sounds like        the giant cupped one hand and made circular  handle turning motions with the other alongside it .      turning     said mr .  saveloy .     winding .  reeling .  revolve .  grind .  grind .  chop .  mince        the giant tapped its nose hurriedly and did a very heavy  noisy dance  bits of terracotta armor clanking .      sounds like mince     said mr .  saveloy .     first syllable sounds like mince .         er        a ragged figure pushed its way through the crowd .  it wore glasses  one lens of which was cracked .      er     it said     i   ve got an idea about that           lord fang and some of his more trusted warriors had clustered on the side of the hill .  a good general always knows when to leave the battlefield  and as far as lord fang was concerned  it was when he saw the enemy coming towards him .   the men were shaken .  they hadn   t tried to face the red army .  those who had were dead .      we   regroup     panted lord fang .     and then we   ll wait until nightfall and   what   s that .      there was a rhythmic noise coming from the bushes further up the slope  where sliding earth had left another bush filled ravine .      sounds like a carpenter  m   lord     said one of the soldiers .      up here .  in the middle of a war .  go and see what it is .      the man scrambled away .  after a while there was a pause in the sawing noise .  then it started again .   lord fang had been trying to work out a fresh battle plan according to the nine useful principles .  he threw down his map .      why is that still going on .  where is captain nong .         hasn   t come back  m   lord .         then go and see what has happened to him .      lord fang tried to remember if the great military sage had ever had anything to say about fighting giant invulnerable statues .  he     the sawing paused .  then it was replaced by the sound of hammering .   lord fang looked around .      can i have an order obeyed around here .     he bellowed .   he picked up his sword and scrambled up the muddy slope .  the bushes parted ahead of him .  there was a clearing .  there was a rushing shape  on hundreds of little le     there was a snap .      the rain was coming down so fast that the drops were having to queue .   the red earth was hundreds of feet deep in places .  it produced two or three crops a year .  it was rich .  it was fecund .  it was  when wet  extremely sticky .   the surviving armies had squelched from the field of battle  as red from head to toe as the terracotta men .  not counting those merely trodden on  the red army had not in fact killed very many people .  terror had done most of their work .  rather more soldiers had been killed in the brief inter army battles and  in the scramble to escape  by their own sides .    the terracotta army had the field to itself .  it was celebrating victory in various ways .  many guards were walking around in circles  wading through the clinging mud as if it was so much dirty air .  a number were digging a trench  the sides of which were washing in on them in the thundering rain .  a few were trying to climb walls that weren   t there .  several  possibly as a result of the exertion following centuries of zero maintenance  had spontaneously exploded in a shower of blue sparks  the red hot clay shrapnel being a major factor in the opposition   s death count .   and all the time the rain fell  a solid curtain of water .  it didn   t look natural .  it was as though the sea had decided to reclaim the land by air drop .   rincewind shut his eyes .  mud covered the armor .  he couldn   t make out the pictures any more  and that was something of a relief because he was pretty certain he was messing things up .  you could see what any warrior was seeing   at least  presumably you could  if you knew what some of the odder pictures actually did and how to press them in the right order .  rincewind didn   t  and in any case whoever had made the magic armor hadn   t assumed it would be used in knee deep mud during a vertical river .  every now and again it sizzled .  one of the boots was getting hot .   it had started out so well .  but there had been what he was coming to think of as the rincewind factor .  probably some other wizard would have marched the army out and wouldn   t have been rained on and even now would be parading through the streets of hunghung while people threw flowers and said     my word  there   s a great wizard and no mistake .      some other wizard wouldn   t have pressed the wrong picture and started the things digging .   he realized he was wallowing in self pity .  rather more pertinently  he was also wallowing in mud .  and he was sinking .  trying to pull a foot out was no use   it didn   t work  and the other foot only went deeper  and got hotter .   lightning struck the ground nearby .  he heard it sizzle  saw the steam  felt the tingle of electricity and tasted the taste of burning tin .   another bolt hit a warrior .  its torso exploded  raining a sticky black tar .  the legs kept going for a few steps  and then stopped .   water poured past him  thick and red now that the river hung was overflowing .  and the mud continued to suck on his feet like a hollow tooth .   something swirled past on the muddy water .  it looked like a scrap of paper .   rincewind hesitated  then reached out awkwardly with a gloved hand and scooped it up .   it was  as he   d expected  a butterfly .      thank you very much     he said  bitterly .   the water drained through his fingers .   he half closed his hand and then sighed and  as gently as he could  maneuvered the creature on to a finger .  its wings hung damply .   he shielded it with his other hand and blew on the wings a few times .      go on  push off .      the butterfly turned .  its multi faceted eyes glinted green for a moment and then it flapped its wings experimentally .   it stopped raining .   it started to snow  but only where rincewind was .      oh  yes     said rincewind .     yes indeed .  oh  thank you so very much .      life was  he had heard  like a bird which flies out of the darkness and across a crowded hall and then through another window into the endless night again .  in rincewind   s case it had managed to do something incontinent in his dinner .   the snow stopped .  the clouds pulled back from the dome of the sky with astonishing speed  letting in hot sunlight which almost immediately made the mud steam .      there you are .  we   ve been looking everywhere .      rincewind tried to turn  but the mud made that impossible .  there was a wooden thump  as of a plank being laid down on wet ooze .      snow on his head .  in bright sunshine .  i said to myself  that   s him all right .      there was the thump of another plank .   a small avalanche slid off the helmet and slid down rincewind   s neck .   another thump  and a plank squelched into the mud beside him .      it   s me  twoflower .  are you all right  old friend .         i think my foot is being cooked  but apart from that i   m as happy as anything .         i knew it would be you doing the charades     said twoflower  sticking his hands under the wizard   s shoulders and hauling .      you got the    wind    syllable .     said rincewind .     that was very hard to do  by remote control .         oh  none of us got that     said twoflower     but when it did    ohshitohshitohshit i   m going to die    everyone got that first go .  very inventive .  er .  you seem to be stuck .         i think it   s the magic boots .         can   t you wiggle them off .  this mud dries like   well  like terracotta in the sun .  someone can come along and dig them out afterwards .      rincewind tried to move his feet .  there was some sub mud bubblings and he felt his feet come free  with a muffled slurping noise .   finally  with considerable effort  he was sitting on the plank .      sorry about the warriors     he said .     it looked so simple when i started out  and then i got confused with all the pictures and it was impossible to stop some of them doing things           but it was a famous victory .     said twoflower .      was it .         mr .  cohen   s been made emperor .         he has .         well  not made  no one made him  he just came along and took it .  and everyone says he   s the preincarnation of the first emperor and he says if you want to be the great wizard that   s fine by him .         sorry .  you lost me there           you led the red army  didn   t you .  you made them rise up in the empire   s hour of need .         well  i wouldn   t exactly say that i           so the emperor wants to reward you .  isn   t that nice .         how do you mean  reward .     said rincewind  with deep suspicion .      not sure  really .  actually  what he said was       twoflower   s eyes glazed as he tried to recall .     he said     you go and find rincewind and say he might be a bit of a pillock but at least he   s straight so he can be chief wizard of the empire or whatever he wants to call it     cos i don   t trust you foreign          twoflower squinted upwards as he tried to remember cohen   s precise words          house of auspicious aspect   scent of pine trees   buggers .         the words trickled into rincewind   s ear  slid up into his brain  and started to bang on the walls .      chief wizard .     he said .      that   s what he said .  well   actually what he said was he wanted you to be a blob of swallow   s vomit  but that was because he used the low sad tone rather than the high questioning one .  he definitely meant wizard .         of the whole empire .      rincewind stood up .      something very bad is about to happen     he said flatly .   the sky was quite blue now .  a few citizens had ventured on to the battlefield to tend the wounded and retrieve the dead .  terracotta warriors stood at various angles  motionless as rocks .      any minute now     said rincewind .      shouldn   t we get back .         probably a meteorite strike     said rincewind .   twoflower looked up at the peaceful sky .      you know me     said rincewind .     just when i   m getting a grip on something fate comes along and jumps on my fingers .         i don   t see any meteorites     said twoflower .     how long do we wait .         it   ll be something else  then     said rincewind .     someone will come leaping out  or there   ll be an earthquake  or something .         if you insist     said twoflower  politely .     um .  do you want to wait for something horrible here or would you like to go back to the palace and have a bath and change your clothes and then see what happens .      rincewind conceded that he might as well await a dreadful fate in comfort .      there   s going to be a feast     said twoflower .     the emperor says he   s going to teach everyone how to quaff .      they made their way  plank by plank  back towards the city .      you know  i swear you never told me that you were married .         i   m sure i did .         i was  er  i was sorry to hear that your wife  er           things happen in war .  i have two dutiful daughters .      rincewind opened his mouth to say something but twoflower   s bright  brittle smile froze the words in his throat .   they worked without speaking  picking up the planks behind them and extending the walkway in front .      looking on the bright side     said twoflower  breaking the silence     the emperor said you could start your own university  if you wanted .         no .  no .  someone hit me with an iron bar  please .         he said he   s well in favor of education provided no one makes him have one .  he   s been making proclamations like mad .  the eunuchs have threatened to go on strike .      rincewind   s plank dropped on to the mud .      what is it that eunuchs do     he said     that they stop doing when they go on strike .         serve food  make the beds  things like that .         oh .         they run the forbidden city  really .  but the emperor talked them round to his point of view .         really .         he said if they didn   t get cracking right now he   d cut off everything else .  um  i think the ground   s firm enough now .      his own university .  that   d make him   archchancellor .  rincewind the archchancellor pictured himself visiting unseen university .  he could have a hat with a really big point .  he   d be able to be rude to everyone .  he   d     he tried to stop himself from thinking like that .  it   d all go wrong .      of course     said twoflower     it might be that the bad things have already happened to you .  have you considered that .  perhaps you   re due something nice .         don   t give me any of that karma stuff     said rincewind .     the wheel of fortune has lost a few spokes where i   m concerned .         it   s worth considering  though     said twoflower .      what  that the rest of my life will be peaceful and enjoyable .  sorry .  no .  you wait .  when my back   s turned and   bang .      twoflower looked around with some interest .      i don   t know why you think your life has been so bad     he said .     we had a lot of fun when we were younger .  hey  do you remember the time when we went over the edge of the world .         often     said rincewind .     usually around   a . m .         and that time we were on a dragon and it disappeared in midair .         you know     said rincewind     sometimes a whole hour will go by when i don   t remember that .         and that time we were attacked by those people who wanted to kill us .         which of those one hundred and forty nine occasions are you referring to .         character building  that sort of thing     said twoflower  happily .     made me what i am today .         oh  yes     said rincewind .  it was no effort  talking to twoflower .  the little man   s trusting nature had no concept of sarcasm and a keen ability not to hear things that might upset him .     yes  i can definitely say it was that sort of thing that made me what i am today  too .      they stepped inside the city .  the streets were practically empty .  most people had flocked to the huge square in front of the palace .  new emperors tended towards displays of generosity .  besides  the news had got around that this one was different and was giving away free pigs .      i heard him talking about sending envoys to ankh morpork     said twoflower  as they dripped up the street .     i expect there   s going to be a bit of a fuss about that .         was that man disembowel meself honorably present at the time .     said rincewind .      yes  as a matter of fact .         when you visited ankh morpork  did you ever meet a man called dibbler .         oh  yes .         if those two ever shake hands i think there might be some sort of explosion .         but you could go back  i   m sure     said twoflower .     i mean  your new university will need all sorts of things and  well  i seem to recall that people in ankh morpork were very keen on gold .      rincewind gritted his teeth .  the image wouldn   t go away   of archchancellor rincewind buying the tower of art and getting them to number all the stones and send it back to hunghung  of archchancellor rincewind hiring all the faculty as college porters  of archchancellor rincewi        no .         pardon .         don   t encourage me to think like that .  the moment i think that it   s all going to be worthwhile something dreadful will happen .      there was a movement behind him  and a knife suddenly pressed against his throat .      the great blob of swallow   s vomit .     said a voice by his ear .      there     said rincewind .     you see .  run away .  don   t stand there  you bloody idiot .  run .      twoflower stared for a moment and then turned and scampered away .      let him go     said the voice .     he doesn   t matter .      hands pulled him into the alley .  he had a vague impression of armor  and mud  his captors were skilled in the way of dragging a prisoner so that he had no chance to get a foothold anywhere .   then he was flung on to the cobbles .      he does not look so great to me     said an imperious voice .     look up  great wizard .      there was some nervous laughter from the soldiers .      you fools .     raged lord hong .     he is just a man .  look at him .  does he look so powerful .  he is just a man who has found some old trickery .  and we will find out how great he is without his arms and legs .         oh     said rincewind .   lord hong leaned down .  there was mud on his face and a wild glint in his eyes .     we shall see what your barbarian emperor can do then  won   t we .     he indicated the sullen group of mud encrusted soldiers .     you know  they half believe you really are a great wizard .  that   s superstition  i   m afraid .  very useful most of the time  damn inconvenient on occasion .  but when we march you into the square and show them how great you really are  i think your barbarian will not have so very long left .  what are these .      he snatched the gloves off rincewind   s hands .      toys     he said .     made things .  the red army are just machines  like mills and pumps .  there   s no magic there .      he tossed them aside and nodded at one of the guards .      and now     said lord hong     let us go to the imperial square .            how   d you like to be governor of bhangbhangduc and all these islands around here .     said cohen  as the horde pored over a map of the empire .     you like the seaside  hamish .         whut .      the doors of the throne room were flung open .  twoflower scuttled in  trailed by one big river .      lord hong   s got rincewind .  he   s going to kill him .      cohen looked up .      he can wizard himself out of it  can   t he .         no .  he hasn   t got the red army anymore .  he   s going to kill him .  you   ve got to do something .         ach  well  you know how it is with wizards     said truckle .     there   s too many of    em as it is           no .     cohen picked up his sword and sighed .      come on     he said .      but  cohen           i said come on .  we ain   t like hong .  rincewind   s a weasel  but he   s our weasel .  so are you coming or what .         lord hong and his group of soldiers had almost reached the bottom of the wide steps to the palace when the horde emerged .  the crowd surrounded them  held back by the soldiers .   lord hong held rincewind tightly  a knife at his throat .      ah  emperor     he said  in ankh morporkian .     we meet again .  check  i think .         what   s he mean .     cohen whispered .      he thinks he has you cornered     said mr .  saveloy .      how   s he know i won   t just let the wizard die .         psychology of the individual  i   m afraid .         it doesn   t make any sense .     cohen shouted .     if you kill him  you   ll be dead yourself in seconds .  i shall see to it pers   nally .         indeed  no     said lord hong .     when your   great wizard   is dead  when people see how easily he dies   how long will you be emperor .  you won by trickery .         what are your terms .     said mr .  saveloy .      there are none .  you can give me nothing i cannot take myself .     lord hong grabbed rincewind   s hat from one of the guards and rammed it on to rincewind   s head .      this is yours     he hissed .        wizzard    hah .  you can   t even spell .  well  wizzard .  aren   t you going to say something .         oh  no .      lord hong smiled .     ah  that   s better     he said .      oh  noooooo .         very good .         aarrgh .      lord hong blinked .  for a moment the figure in front of him appeared to stretch to twice its height and then have its feet snap up under its chin .   and then it disappeared  with a small thunderclap .   there was silence in the square  except for the sound of several thousand people being astonished .   lord hong waved his hand vaguely in the air .      lord hong .      he turned .  there was a short man behind him  covered in grime and mud .  he wore a pair of spectacles  one lens of which was cracked .   lord hong hardly glanced at him .  he prodded the air again  unwilling to believe his own senses .      excuse me  lord hong     said the apparition     but do you by any chance remember bes pelargic .  about six years ago .  i think you were quarreling with lord tang .  there was something of a skirmish .  a few streets destroyed .  nothing very major .      lord hong blinked .      how dare you address me .     he managed .      it doesn   t really matter     said twoflower .     but it   s just that i   d have liked you to have remembered .  i got   quite angry about it .  er .  i want to fight you .         you want to fight me .  do you know who you are talking to .  have you any idea .         er .  yes .  oh  yes     said twoflower .   lord hong   s attention finally focused .  it had not been a good day .      you foolish  stupid little man .  you don   t even have a sword .         oi .  four eyes .      they both turned .  cohen threw his sword .  twoflower caught it clumsily and was almost knocked over by the weight .      why did you do that .     said mr .  saveloy .      man wants to be a hero .  that   s fine by me     said cohen .      he   ll be slaughtered .         might do .  might do .  might do .  he might do that  certainly     cohen conceded .     that   s not up to me .         father .      lotus blossom grabbed twoflower   s arm .      he will kill you .  come away .         no .      butterfly took her father   s other arm .      no good purpose will be served     she said .     come on .  we can find a better time           he killed your mother     said twoflower flatly .      his soldiers did .         that makes it worse .  he didn   t even know .  please get back  both of you .         look  father           if you don   t both do what you   re told i shall get angry .      lord hong drew his long sword .  the blade gleamed .      do you know anything about fighting  clerk .         no  not really     said twoflower .     but the important thing is that someone should stand up to you .  whatever happens to them afterwards .      the horde were watching with considerable interest .  hardened as they were  they had a soft spot for pointless bravery .      yes     said lord hong  looking around at the silent crowd .     let everyone see what happens .      he raised his sword .   the air crackled .   the barking dog dropped on to the flagstones in front of him .   it was very hot .  its string was alight .   there was a brief sizzle .   then the world went white .   after some time  twoflower picked himself up .  he seemed to be the first one upright  those people who hadn   t flung themselves to the ground had fled .   all that remained of lord hong was one shoe  which was smouldering .  but there was a smoking trail all the way up the steps behind it .   staggering a little  twoflower followed the trail .   a wheelchair was on its side  one wheel spinning .   he peered over it .      you all right  mr .  hamish .         whut .         good .      the rest of the horde were crouched in a circle at the top of the steps .  smoke billowed around them .  in its continuing passage  the ball had set fire to part of the palace .      can you hear me  teach .     cohen was saying .         course he can   t hear you .  how can he hear you  looking like that .     said truckle .      he could still be alive     said cohen defiantly .      he is dead  cohen .  really  really dead .  alive people have more body .         but you   re all alive .     said twoflower .     i saw it bark straight at you .         we got out of the way     said boy willie .     we   re good at getting out of the way .         poor ole teach didn   t have our experience of not dyin        said caleb .   cohen stood up .      where   s hong .     he said grimly .     i   m going to           he   s dead  too  mr .  cohen     said twoflower .   cohen nodded  as if this was all perfectly normal .      we owe it to ole teach     he said .      he was a good sort     truckle conceded .     funny ideas about swearing  mind you .         he had brains .  he cared about stuff .  and he might not have lived like a barbarian  but he   s bloody well going to be buried like one  all right .         in a longship  set on fire     suggested boy willie .      my word     said mr .  saveloy .      in a big pit  on top of the bodies of his enemies     suggested caleb .      good heavens  all of  b .     said mr .  saveloy .      in a burial mound     suggested vincent .      really  i wouldn   t put you to the trouble     said mr .  saveloy .      in a longship set on fire  on top of a heap of the bodies of his enemies  under a burial mound     said cohen flatly .     nothing   s too good for ole teach .         but i assure you  i feel fine     said mr .  saveloy .     really  i   er   oh        ronald saveloy .   mr .  saveloy turned .      ah     he said .     yes .  i see .      if you would care to step this way .   the palace and the horde froze and faded gently  like a dream .      it   s funny     said mr .  saveloy  as he followed death .     i didn   t expect it to be this way .      few people ever expect it to be any way .   gritty black sand crunched under what mr .  saveloy supposed he should still call his feet .      where is this .      the desert .   it was brilliantly lit  and yet the sky was midnight black .  he stared at the horizon .      how big is it .      for some  very big .  for lord hong  for instance  it contains a lot of impatient ghosts .      i thought lord hong didn   t believe in ghosts .      he may do so now .  a lot of ghosts believe in lord hong .      oh .  er .  what happens now .         come on  come on  haven   t got all day .  step lively  man .      mr .  saveloy turned around and looked up at the woman on the horse .  it was a big horse but  then  it was a big woman .  she had plaits  a hat with horns on it  and a breastplate that must have been a week   s work for an experienced panelbeater .  she gave him a look that was not unkind but had impatience in every line .      i   m sorry .     he said .      says here ronald saveloy     she said .     the what .         the what .         everyone i pick up     said the woman  leaning down     is called    someone the something .     what the are you .         i   m sorry  i           i   ll put you down as ronald the apologetic  then .  come on  hop up  there   s a war on  got to be going .         where to .         says here quaffing  carousing  throwing axes at young women   s hair .         ah  er  i think perhaps there   s been a bit of a           look  old chap  are you coming or what .      mr .  saveloy looked around at the black desert .  he was totally alone .  death had gone about his essential business .   he let her pull him up behind her .      have they got a library  perhaps .     he asked hopefully  as the horse rose into the dark sky .      don   t know .  no one   s ever asked .         evening classes  perhaps .  i could start evening classes .         what in .         um .  anything  really .  table manners  perhaps .  is that allowed .         i suppose so .  i don   t think anyone   s ever asked that  either .     the valkyrie turned in the saddle .      you sure you   re coming to the right afterlife .      mr .  saveloy considered the possibilities .      on the whole     he said     i think it   s worth a try .         the crowd in the square were getting to their feet .   they looked at all that remained of lord hong  and at the horde .   butterfly and lotus blossom joined their father .  butterfly ran her hand over the cannon  looking for the trick .      you see     said twoflower  a little indistinctly because he couldn   t quite hear the sound of his own voice yet     i told you he was the great wizard .      butterfly tapped him on the shoulder .      what about those .     she said .   a small procession was picking its way through the square .  in front  twoflower recognized  was something he   d once owned .      it was a very cheap one     he said  to no one in particular .     i always thought there was something a little warped about it  to tell you the truth .      it was followed by a slightly larger luggage .  and then  in descending order of size  four little chests  the smallest being about the size of a lady   s handbag .  as it passed a prone hunghungese who   d been too stunned to flee  it paused to kick him in the ear before hurrying after the others .   twoflower looked at his daughters .      can they do that .     he said .     make new ones .  i thought it needed carpenters .         i suppose it learned many things in ankh more pork     said butterfly .   the luggages clustered together in front of the steps .  then the luggage turned around and  after one or two sad backward glances  or what might have been glances if it had eyes  cantered away .  by the time it reached the far side of the square it was a blur .      hey  you .  four eyes .      twoflower turned .  cohen was advancing down the steps .      i remember you     he said .     d   you know anything about grand viziering .         not a thing  mr .  emperor cohen .         good .  the job   s yours .  get cracking .  first thing  i want a cup of tea .  thick enough to float a horseshoe .  three sugars .  in five minutes .  right .         a cup of tea in five minutes .     said twoflower .     but that   s not long enough for even a short ceremony .      cohen put a companionable arm around the little man   s shoulders .      there   s a new ceremony     he said .     it goes     tea up  luv .  milk .  sugar .  doughnut .  want another one .     and you could tell the eunuchs     he added     that the emperor is a lit   ral minded man and used the phrase    heads will roll    .      twoflower   s eyes gleamed behind his cracked glasses .  somehow  he liked the sound of that .   it looked as though he was living in interesting times     the luggages sat quietly  and waited .      fate sat back .   the gods relaxed .      a draw     he announced .     oh  yes .  you have appeared to win in hunghung but you have had to lose your most valuable piece  is that not so .         i   m sorry .     said the lady .     i don   t quite follow you .         insofar as i understand this   physics       said fate     i cannot believe that anything could be materialized in the university without dying almost instantly .  it is one thing to hit a snowdrift  but quite another to hit a wall .         i never sacrifice a pawn     said the lady .      how can you hope to win without sacrificing the occasional pawn .         oh  i never play to win .     she smiled .     but i do play not to lose .  watch           the council of wizards gathered in front of the wall at the far end of the great hall and stared up at the thing which now covered half of it .      interesting effect     said ridcully  eventually .     how fast do you think it was going .         about five hundred miles an hour     said ponder .     i think perhaps we were a little enthusiastic .  hex says           from a standing start to five hundred miles an hour .     said the lecturer in recent runes .     that must have come as a shock .         yes     said ridcully     but i suppose it   s a mercy for the poor creature that it was such a brief one .         and  of course  we must all be thankful that it wasn   t rincewind .      a couple of the wizards coughed .   the dean stood back .      but what is it .     he said .      was     said ponder stibbons .      we could have a look in the bestiaries     said ridcully .     shouldn   t be hard to find .  gray .  long hind feet like a clown   s boots .  rabbit ears .  tail long and pointy .  and  of course  not many creatures are twenty feet across  one inch thick and deep fried  so that narrows it down a bit .         i don   t want to cast a shadow on things     said the dean     but if this isn   t rincewind  then where is he .         i   m sure mr .  stibbons can give us an explanation as to why his calculations went wrong     said ridcully .   ponder   s mouth dropped open .   then he said  as sourly as he dared     i probably forgot to take into account that there   s three right angles in a triangle  didn   t i .  er .  i   ll have to try and work everything back  but i think that somehow a lateral component was introduced into what should have been a bidirectional sortilegic transfer .  it   s probably that this was most pronounced at the effective median point  causing an extra node to appear in the transfers at a point equidistant to the other two as prediction in flume   s third equation  and turffe   s law would see to it that the distortion would stabilize in such a way as to create three separate points  each moving a roughly equal mass one jump around the triangle .  i   m not sure why the third mass arrived here at such speed  but i think the increased velocity might have been caused by the sudden creation of the node .  of course  it might have been going quite fast anyway .  but i shouldn   t think it is cooked in its natural state .         do you know     said ridcully     i think i actually understood some of that .  certainly some of the shorter words .         oh  it   s perfectly simple     said the bursar brightly .     we sent the   dog thing to hunghung .  rincewind was sent to some other place .  and this creature was sent here .  just like pass the parcel .         you see .     said ridcully to stibbons .     you   re using language the bursar can understand .  and he   s been chasing the dried frog all morning .      the librarian staggered into the hall under the weight of a large atlas .      oook .         at least you can show us where you think our man is     said ridcully .   ponder took a ruler and a pair of compasses out of his hat .      well  if we assume rincewind was in the middle of the counterweight continent     he said     then all we need do is draw           oook .         i assure you  i was only going to use pencil           eeek .         all we have to do is imagine  all right  a third point equidistant from the other two   er   that looks like somewhere in the rim ocean to me  or probably over the edge .         can   t see that thing in the sea     said ridcully  glancing up at the recently laminated corpse .      in that case  it must have been in the other direction        the wizards crowded round .   there was something there .         s not even properly drawn in     said the dean .      that   s because no one   s sure it really exists     said the senior wrangler .   it floated in the middle of the sea  a tiny continent by discworld standards .         xxxx        ponder read .      they only put that on the map because no one knows what it   s really called     said ridcully .      and we   ve sent him there     said ponder .     a place that we   re not even certain exists .         oh  we know it exists now     said ridcully .     must do .  must do .  must be a pretty rich land  too  if the rats grow that big .         i   ll go and see if we can bring       ponder began .      oh  no     said ridcully firmly .     no  thank you very much .  next time it might be an elephant whizzing over our heads  and those things make a splash .  no .  give the poor chap a rest .  we   ll have to think of something else        he rubbed his hands together .     time for dinner  i feel     he said .      um     said the senior wrangler .     do you think we were wise to light that string when we sent the thing back .         certainly     said ridcully  as they strolled away .     no one could say we didn   t return it in exactly the same state as it arrived           hex dreamed gently in its room .   the wizards were right .  hex couldn   t think .   there weren   t words  yet  for what it could do .   even hex didn   t know what it could do .   but it was going to find out .   the quill pen scritched and blotted its way over a fresh sheet of paper and drew  for no good reason  a calendar for the year surmounted by a rather angular picture of a beagle  standing on its hind legs .      the ground was red  just like at hunghung .  but whereas that was a kind of clay so rich that leaving a chair on the lawn meant that you had four small trees by nightfall  this ground was sand that looked as if it had got red by being baked in a million year summer .   there were occasional clumps of yellowed grass and low stands of gray green trees .  but what there was everywhere was heat .   this was especially noticeable in the pond under the ghost gums .  it was steaming .   a figure emerged from the clouds  absentmindedly picking the burnt bits off his beard .   rincewind waited until his own personal world had stopped spinning and concentrated on the four men who were watching him .   they were black with lines and whorls painted on their faces and had  between them  about two square feet of clothing .   there were three reasons why rincewind was no racist .  he   d ended up in too many places too suddenly to develop that kind of mind .  besides  if he   d thought about it much  most of the really dreadful things that had happened to him had been done by quite pale people with big wardrobes .  those were two of the reasons .   the third was that these men  who were just rising from a half crouching position  were all holding spears pointing at rincewind and there is something about the sight of four spears aimed at your throat that causes no end of respect and the word    sir    to arise spontaneously in the mind .   one of the men shrugged  and lowered his spear .      g   day  bloke     he said .   this meant only three spears  which was an improvement .      er .  this isn   t unseen university  is it  sir .     said rincewind .   the other spears stopped pointing at him .  the men grinned .  they had very white teeth .      klatch .  howondaland .  it looks like howondaland     said rincewind hopefully .      don   t know them blokes  bloke     said one of the men .   the other three clustered around him .      what   ll we call him .         he   s kangaroo bloke .  no worries there .  one minute a kangaroo  next minute a bloke .  the old blokes say that sort of thing used to happen all the time  back in the dream .         i reckoned he   d look better than that .         yeah .         one way to tell .      the man who was apparently the leader of the group advanced on rincewind with the kind of grin reserved for imbeciles and people holding guns  and held out a stick .   it was flat  and had a bend in the middle .  someone had spent a long time making rather nice designs on it in little colored dots .  somehow  rincewind wasn   t at all surprised to see a butterfly among them .   the hunters watched him expectantly .      er  yes     he said .     very good .  very good workmanship  yes .  interesting pointillistic effect .  shame you couldn   t find a straighter bit of wood .      one of the men laid down his spear  and squatted down and picked up a long wooden tube  covered with the same designs .  he blew into it .  the effect was not unpleasant .  it sounded like bees would sound if they   d invented full orchestration .      um     said rincewind .     yes .      it was a test  obviously .  they   d given him this bent piece of wood .  he had to do something with it .  it was clearly very important .  he   d     oh  no .  he   d say something or do something  wouldn   t he  and then they   d say  yes  you are the great bloke or something  and they   d drag him off and it   d be the start of another adventure  i . e .   a period of horror and unpleasantness .  life was full of tricks like that .   well  this time rincewind wasn   t going to fall for it .      i want to go home     he said .     i want to go back home to the library where it was nice and quiet .  and i don   t know where i am .  and i don   t care what you do to me  right .  i   m not going to have any kind of adventure or start saving the world again and you can   t trick me into it with mysterious bits of wood .      he gripped the stick and flung it away from him with all the force he could still muster .   they stared at him as he folded his arms .      i   m not playing     he said .     i   m stopping right here .      they were still staring .  and now they were grinning  too  at something behind him .   he felt himself getting quite annoyed .      do you understand .  are you listening .     he said .     that   s the last time the universe is going to trick rincewi            about the author

harpercollinsebooks . com       people are always a little confused about this  as they are in the case of miracles .  when someone is saved from certain death by a strange concatenation of circumstances  they say that   s a miracle .  but of course if someone is killed by a freak chain of events   the oil spilled just there  the safety fence broken just there   that must also be a miracle .  just because it   s not nice doesn   t mean it   s not miraculous .      usually about six inches across .      people wonder how this works  since a terrestrial elephant would be unlikely to bear a revolving load for any length of time without some serious friction burns .  but you may as well ask why the axle of a planet doesn   t squeak  or where love goes  or what sound yellow makes .      which is like fuzzy logic  only less so .        all virtual lectures took place in room  b  a room not locatable on any floor plan of the university and also  it was considered  infinite in size .       a policy adopted by almost all managers and several notable gods .      such as    ouch .         aargh .         give me back my money  you scoundrel .      and    you call these chestnuts .  i call them little balls of charcoal  that   s what i call them .         and often the phrase    a bastard you don   t want to cross  and i didn   t say that .         the uu college porters .  renowned among the entire faculty for the hardness of their skulls  their obtuseness in the face of reasonable explanation  and their deeply held conviction that the whole place would collapse without them .      except during extreme flood conditions it is extremely difficult to make much progress on the ankh  and the university rowing teams compete by running over the surface of the river .  this is generally quite safe provided they don   t stand in one place for very long and  of course  it eats the soles off their boots .      this at least was true .  rincewind could scream    for mercy in nineteen languages  and just scream in another forty four .        this is important .  inexperienced travelers might think that    aargh .     is universal  but in betrobi it means    highly enjoyable    and in howondaland it means  variously     i would like to eat your foot        your wife is a big hippo     and    hello  thinks mr .  purple cat .     one particular tribe has a fearsome reputation for cruelty merely because prisoners appear  to them  to be shouting    quick .  extra boiling oil .         named after the wizard sangrit heisenberg and not after the more famous heisenberg who is renowned for inventing what is possibly the finest lager in the world .      there was still a certain amount of confusion on this point .      kids .  only very silly wizards with bad sinus trouble do this .  sensible people go off to a roped off enclosure where they can watch a heavily protected man  in the middle distance  light  with the aid of a very long pole  something that goes    fsst .     and then they can shout    hooray .         the ankh morpork name for the counterweight continent and its nearby islands .  it means    place where the gold comes from .         in fact  he   d be about the seventy third to admit it .      such as dish of glistening brown stuff  dish of glistening crunchy orange stuff  and dish of soft white lumps .      according to the history books .  however  in common with every other young student  rincewind had hopefully looked up    figgin    in the dictionary and found it was    a small bun with currants in it .     this meant that either the language had changed a little over the years  or that there really was some horrifying aspect to suspending a man alongside a teacake .      a dismal prospect  especially when the horses keep sinking .      when you   re on a desert island  your appetites can become a bit confused .      much later  rincewind had to have therapy for this .  it involved a pretty woman  a huge plate of potatoes  and a big stick with a nail in it .         your feet shall be cut off and be buried several yards from your body so your ghost won   t walk .         except on posters with legends like    wanted   dedd .         the only sound the horde had ever heard in temples was people shouting    infidel .  he has stolen the jeweled eye of   your wife is a big hippo .            friendly stab     as it is formally known .
