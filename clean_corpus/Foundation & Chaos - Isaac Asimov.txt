universes and characters alive for a very long time indeed .       the centuries recede  and the legend of hari seldon grows  the brilliant man  wise man  sad man who charted the course of the human future in the old empire .  but revisionist views prosper  and cannot always be easily dismissed .  to understand seldon  we are sometimes tempted to refer to apocrypha  myths  even fairy tales from those distant times .  we are frustrated by the contradictions of incomplete documents and what amount to hagiographies .   this we know without reference to the revisionists  that seldon was brilliant  seldon was key .  but seldon was neither saint nor divinely inspired prophet  and of course  he did not act alone .  the most pervasive myths involve .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica      th edition       f . e .       .     hari seldon stood in slippered feet and a thick green scholar   s robe on the enclosed parapet of an upperside maintenance tower  looking from an altitude of two hundred meters over the dark aluminum and steel surface of trantor .  the sky was quite clear over this sector tonight  only a few vague clouds scudding before nacreous billows and sheets of stars like ghostly fire .   beneath this spectacle  and beyond the ranks of gently curving domes  obscured and softened by night  lay a naked ocean  its floating aluminum covers pulled aside across hundreds of thousands of hectares .  the revealed sea glowed faintly  as if in response to the sky .  he could not remember the name of this sea  peace  or dream  or sleep .  all the hidden oceans of trantor had such ancient names  nursery names to soothe .  the heart of the empire needed soothing as much as hari  soothing  not sooth .   warm sweet air swirled around his head and shoulders from a vent in the wall behind him .  hari had discovered that the air here was the purest of any in streeling  perhaps because it was drawn directly from outside .  the temperature beyond the plastic window registered at two degrees  a chill he would well remember from his one misadventure upperside  decades before .   he had spent so much of his life enclosed  insulated from the chill as well as the freshness  the newness  much as the numbers and equations of psychohistory insulated him from the harsh reality of individual lives .  how can the surgeon work efficiently and still feel the pain of the carved flesh  .   in a real sense  the patient was already dead .  trantor  the political center of the galaxy  had died decades  perhaps centuries before  and was only now obviously falling to rot .  while hari   s brief personal flame of self would flicker out long before the empire   s embers powdered to ash  through the equations of the project he could see clearly the rigor of morbidity  the stiffening face of the empire   s corpse .   this awful vision had made him perversely famous  and his theories known throughout trantor  and in many parts of the galaxy .  he was called    raven    seldon  harbinger of nightmare doom .   the rot would last five more centuries  a simple and rapid deflation on the time scales of hari   s broadest equations .  .  . social skin collapsing  then melting away over the steel bones of trantor   s sectors and municipalities .  .  .   how many human tales would fill that collapse .  an empire  unlike a corpse  continues to feel pain after death .  on the scale of the most minute and least reliable equations  sparkling within the displays of his powerful prime radiant  hari could almost imagine a million billion faces blurred together in an immense calculus to fill the area beneath the empire   s declining curve .     acceleration of decay marked by the loci of every human story  almost as many as the points on a plane .  .  . beyond understanding  without psychohistory .   it was his hope to foster a rebirth of something better and more durable than the empire  and he was close to success .  .  . according to the equations .   yet still his most frequent emotion these days was cold regret .  to live in a bright and youthful period  the empire at its most glorious  stable and prosperous  that would be worth all his eminence and accomplishment .   to have returned to him the company of his adopted son raych  and dors  mysterious and lovely dors venabili  who harbored within tailored flesh and secret steel the passion and devotion of any ten heroes .  .  . for their return alone he would multiply geometrically the signs of his own decay  aching limbs and balky bowels and blurred eyesight .   this night  however  hari was close to peace .  his bones did not ache much .  he did not feel the worms of grief so sharply .  he could actually relax and look forward to an end to this labor .   the pressures pushing him were coming to a hard center .  his trial would begin within a month .  he knew its outcome with reasonable certainty .  this was the cusp time .  all that he had lived and worked for would be realized soon  his plans moving on to their next step  and to his exit .  conclusions within growth  stops within the flow .   he had an appointment soon to meet with young gaal dornick  a significant figure in his plans .  mathematically  dornick was far from being a stranger  yet they had not met before .   and hari believed he had seen daneel once again  though he was not sure .  daneel would not have wanted him to be sure  but perhaps daneel wanted him to suspect .   so much of what passed for history on trantor now reeked of misery .  in statecraft  after all  confusion was misery  and sometimes misery was a necessity .  hari knew that daneel still had much work to do  in secret  but hari would never  could never  tell any other human .  daneel had made sure of that .  and for that reason hari could never speak the complete truth about dors  the true tale of the odd and virtually perfect relationship he had had with a woman who was not a woman  not even human  yet friend and lover .   hari  in his weariness  resisted but could not suppress a sentimental sadness .  age was tainted and the old were haunted by the loss of lovers and friends .  how grand it would be if he could visit with daneel again .  easy to see  in his mind   s eye  how that visit would go  after the joy of reunion  hari would vent some of his anger at the restrictions and demands daneel had placed upon him .  the best of friends  the most compelling of taskmasters .   hari blinked and focused on the view beyond the window .  he was far too prone these days to drift off into reverie .   the ocean   s beautiful glow was itself decay  a riot of bioluminescent algae run rampant for almost four years now  killing off the crops of the oxygen farms  making the air slightly stale even in the chill of upperside .  no threat of suffocation yet  but for how much longer .   the emperor   s adjutants and protectors and spokesmen had announced imminent victory over the beautiful plague of algae only a few days before  seeding the ocean with tailored phages to control the bloom .  the ocean did seem darker tonight  but perhaps the uncharacteristically clear sky dimmed it by comparison .   death can be both harsh and lovely  hari thought .  sleep  dream  peace .     halfway across the galaxy  lodovik trema traveled in the depths of an imperial astrophysical survey vessel  the ship   s only passenger .  he sat alone in the comfort of the officers    lounge  watching a lightly plotted entertainment with apparent enjoyment .  the ship   s crew  carefully selected from the citizen class  had stocked up on such entertainments by the thousands before launching on their missions  which might take them away from civilized ports for months .  their officers and captain  more often than not from the baronial aristocratic families  chose from a variety of less populist bookfilms .   lodovik trema in appearance was forty or forty five  stout but not corpulent  with a pleasantly ugly face and great strong sausage fingered hands .  one eye seemed fixed skyward  and his large lips turned down as if he were perpetually inclined toward pessimism or at best bland neutrality .  where he had hair  he wore it in a short  even cut  his forehead was high and innocent of wrinkles  which gave his face a younger aspect belied by the lines around his mouth and eyes .   though lodovik represented the highest imperial authority  he had come to be well liked by the captain and crew  his dry statements of purpose or fact seemed to conceal a gentle and observant wit  and he never said too much  though sometimes he could be accused of saying too little .   outside the ship   s hull  the geometric fistula of hyperspace through which the ship navigated during its jumps was beyond complete visualization  even for the ship   s computers .  both humans and machines  slaves of status space time  simply bided their personal times until the pre set emergence .   lodovik had always preferred the quicker  though sometimes no less harrowing  networks of wormholes  but those connections had been neglected dangerously  and in the past few decades many had collapsed like unshored subway tunnels  in some cases sucking in transit stations and waiting passengers .  .  . they were seldom used now .   captain kartas tolk entered the lounge and stood for a moment behind lodovik   s seat .  the rest of the crew busily tended the machines that watched the machines that kept the ship whole during the jumps .   tolk was tall  his head capped by woolly white blond hair  with ashy brown skin and a patrician air not uncommon for native born sarossans .  lodovik glanced over his shoulder and nodded a greeting .     two more hours  after our last jump     captain tolk said .     we should be on schedule .         good     said lodovik .     i   m eager to get to work .  where will we land .         at sarossa major  the capital .  that   s where the records you seek are stored .  then  as ordered  we remove as many favored families on the emperor   s list as we can .  the ship will be very crowded .         i can imagine .         we have perhaps seven days before the shock front hits the outskirts of the system .  then  only eight hours before it engulfs sarossa .         too close for comfort .         the close shave of imperial incompetence and misdirection     tolk said  with no attempt to conceal his bitterness .     imperial scientists knew that the kale   s star was coring two years ago .         the information provided by sarossan scientists was far from accurate     lodovik said .   tolk shrugged  no sense denying it .  blame enough for all to share .  kale   s star had gone supernova last year  its explosion had been observed by telepresence nine months later  and in the time since .  .  . much politicking  reallocation of scant resources  then  this pitifully inadequate mission .   the captain had the misfortune of being sent to watch his planet die  saving little but imperial records and a few privileged families .      in the best days     tolk said     the imperial navy could have constructed shields to save at least a third of the planet   s population .  we could have marshaled fleets of immigration ships to evacuate millions  even billions .  .  . sufficient to rebuild  to keep a world   s character intact .  a glorious world  if i may say so  even now .         so i   ve heard     lodovik said softly .     we will do our best  dear captain  though that can be only a dry and hollow satisfaction .      tolk   s lips twisted .     i do not blame you  personally     he said .     you have been sympathetic and honest and  above all  efficient .  quite different from the usual in the commission offices .  the crew regards you as a friend among scoundrels .      lodovik shook his head in warning .     even simple complaints against the empire can be dangerous     he said .     best not to trust me too much .      the ship shuddered slightly and a small bell rang in the room .  tolk closed his eyes and gripped the back of the chair automatically .  lodovik simply faced forward .      the last jump     the captain said .  he looked at lodovik .     i trust you well enough  councilor  but i trust my skills more .  neither the emperor nor linge chen can afford to lose men of my qualifications .  i still know how to repair parts of our drives should they fail .  few captains on any ship can boast of that now .      lodovik nodded  simple truth  but not very good armor .     the craft of best using and not abusing essential human resources may also be a lost art  captain .  fair warning .      tolk made a wry face .     point taken .     he turned to leave  then heard something unusual .  he glanced over his shoulder at lodovik .     did you feel something .      the ship suddenly vibrated again  this time with a high pitched tensile grind that set their teeth on edge .  lodovik frowned .     i felt that .  what was it .      the captain cocked his head  listening to a remote voice buzzing in his ear .     some instability  an irregularity in the last jump     he said .     not unknown as we draw close to a stellar mass .  perhaps you should return to your cabin .      lodovik shut down the lounge projectors and rose .  he smiled at captain tolk and clapped him on the shoulder .     of any in the emperor   s service  i would be most willing to entrust you to steer us through the shoals .  i need to study our options now anyway .  triage  captain tolk .  maximization of what we can take with us  compared to what can be stored in underground vaults .      tolk   s face darkened  and he lowered his eyes .     my own family library  at alos quad  is       the ship   s alarms blared like huge animals in pain .  tolk raised his arms in instinctive self protection  covering his face  lodovik dropped to the floor and doubled himself up with amazing dexterity  the ship spun like a top in a fractional dimension it was never meant to navigate  and with a sickening blur of distressed momenta and a sound like a dying behemoth  it made an unscheduled and asymmetric jump .   the ship reappeared in the empty vastness of status geometry normal  unstretched space .  ship   s gravity failed simultaneously .   tolk floated a few centimeters above the floor .  lodovik uncurled and grabbed for an arm of the couch he had occupied just a few moments before .     we   re out of hyperspace     he said .      no question     tolk said .     but in the name of procreation  where .      lodovik knew in an instant what the captain could not .  they were being flooded with an interstellar tidal wave of neutrinos .  he had never  in his centuries of existence  experienced such an onslaught .  to the intricate and super sensitive pathways of his positronic brain  the neutrinos felt like a thin cloud of buzzing insects  yet they passed through the ship and its human crew like so many bits of nothing .  a single neutrino  the most elusive of particles  could slip through a light year of solid lead without being blocked .  very rarely indeed did they react with matter .  within the heart of the kale   s supernova  however  immense quantities of matter had been compressed into neutronium  producing a neutrino for every proton  more than enough to blow away the outer shells just a year before .      we   re in the shock front     lodovik said .      how do you know .     tolk asked .      neutrino flux .         how      the captain   s skin grayed  its ashen sheen growing even more prominent .     you   re assuming  of course .  it   s a logical assumption .      lodovik nodded  though he assumed nothing .  the captain and crew would be dead within an hour .   even this far from kale   s star  the expanding sphere of neutrinos would be strong enough to transmute a few thousandths of a percent of the atoms within the ship and their bodies .  neutrons would be converted to protons in sufficient numbers to subtly alter organic chemistries  causing poisons to build  nervous signals to meet untimely dead ends .   there were no effective shields against neutrino flux .      captain  this is no time for deception     lodovik said .     i   m not hazarding a guess .  i   m not human  i can feel the effects directly .      the captain stared at him  uncomprehending .      i am a robot  captain .  i will survive for a time  but that is no blessing .  i am deeply programmed to try to protect humans from harm  but there is nothing i can do to assist you .  every human on this ship is going to die .      tolk grimaced and shook his head  as if he could not believe his ears .     we   re going crazy  all of us     he said .      not yet     lodovik said .     captain  please accompany me to the bridge .  we may yet be able to save something .          .     linge chen might have been the most powerful man in the galaxy  in appearance as well as fact  if he had merely willed it .  instead  he settled for something a mere shade less  and wore a far more comfortable rank and uniform  that of the chief commissioner of the commission of public safety .   the ancient and aristocratic chens had survived through thousands of years to produce linge by exercising caution  diplomacy  and by being useful to many emperors .  chen had no wish to supplant the present emperor or any of his myriad ministers  councilors  and    advisors     or to be any more of a target for young hotheads than he needed to be .  his present visibility was already too high for his taste  but at least he was a target more of derision than of hatred .   he had spent the last of these early morning hours looking over reports from the governors of seven troubled star systems .  three had declared war on their neighbors  ignoring threats of imperial intervention  and chen had used the emperor   s seal to move a dozen vessels into those systems as safeguard .  fully a thousand other systems were showing severe unrest  yet with recent breakdowns and degradations  the imperial communications systems could only handle about a tenth of the information sent from the twenty five million worlds supposedly under their authority .   the total flux of information  sent in real time and unprocessed by experts on trantor   s companion worlds and space stations  would have increased trantor   s temperature by tens of degrees .  it was because of their considerable skill and intuition borne of thousands of years of experience that the palace  that is  chen and his fellow commissioners  could keep a kind of balance with just the minimal  boiled down stock from the vast galactic stew .   he now allowed himself a few minutes of personal exploration  essential to his sanity .  but even that was far from frivolous amusement .  it was with an expression of curious intrigue that he sat before his informer and asked about    raven    seldon .  the informer  a hollow  elongated ovoid arranged horizontally on his desk  gleamed its natural eggshell white for an instant  then brought up all the various murmurings and documents from around trantor and key outlying worlds .  a few small film book articles appeared in the center of the display  a piece from an offworld mathematical journal  an interview with the student newspaper at seldon   s sacrosanct streeling university  bulletins from the imperial library .  .  . mentioning nothing about psychohistory .  the infamous seldon was remarkably quiet this week  perhaps in anticipation of his trial .  none of his colleagues in the project had had much to say  either .  just as well .   chen closed that search and leaned back in the chair  contemplating which crisis to respond to next .  he had thousands of problems to deal with daily  most of which he fed to his selected councilors and their assistants  but he was taking a personal interest in the response to a supernova explosion near four relatively loyal imperial worlds  including beautiful and productive sarossa .   he had sent his most reliable and ingenious councilor to oversee what little rescuing could be done at sarossa .  his brows furrowed at the thought of the inadequacy of this response .  .  . and what political dangers the commission  and trantor  might face if nothing at all could be accomplished .  empire after all was a matter of quid pro quo  if there was no quo then there might as well be no quid .   public safety was more than just a political catchphrase  in this endless painful age of decay  an aristocratic official such as chen still had an important function .  the public image of the commissioners seemed to be one of irresponsible luxury  but chen took his duties very seriously .  he harked back to a better time  when the empire could and did look after its many children  the citizens of its far reaches  with established peacemaking  policing  financial and technical aid  and rescue .   chen felt a presence at his elbow and his hair stood on end .  he turned with a sudden flash of irritation  or was it fear .   to see his chief personal secretary  small and mild kreen .  kreen   s usually pleasant face was almost bloodless and he did not seem to want to convey his message .      sorry     chen said .     you startled me .  i was enjoying a relatively peaceful moment on this infernal device .  what is it  kreen .         my apologies .  .  . for the grief we must all feel .  .  . i did not want this news to come to you through your machine .     kreen was naturally suspicious of the informer  which could do so many of his own functions so quickly and anonymously .      yes  damn it  what is it .         the imperial survey ship spear of glory  your honor .  .  .     kreen swallowed .  his people  from the small southern hemisphere lavrenti sector  had worked as servants to the imperial courts for thousands of years .  it was in his blood to feel his master   s pain .  sometimes kreen seemed less a human being than a shadow .  .  . though a very useful shadow .      yes .  what is it  blown to smithereens .      kreen   s face crinkled with anticipated distress .     no .  your honor .  .  . that is  we do not know .  it is a day overdue  and there are no communications  not even an emergency beacon .      chen listened with a sinking heart and a twist in his stomach .  lodovik trema .  .  .   and of course a fine captain and crew .   chen opened and closed his mouth .  he needed more information desperately  but of course kreen would have given him all that there was  so there was no more .      and sarossa .         the shock front is less than five days from sarossa  your honor .         i know that .  have any other ships been dispatched .         yes  sire .  four much smaller ships have been deflected from the missions to save kisk  puma  and transdal .         sky  no .     chen stood and fumed .     i wasn   t consulted .  they must not reduce those rescue forces .  .  . they   re at minimum already .         commissioner  the representative from sarossa was received by the emperor just two hours ago .  .  . without our knowledge .  he convinced the emperor and farad sinter that          sinter is a fool .  three worlds neglected for one  an imperial favorite .  he   ll get his emperor killed someday .     but then chen calmed himself  closing his eyes  focusing inward  drawing on six decades of special training to set his mind calmly and quickly to finding the best path through this morass .   to lose lodovik  ugly  faithful  and supremely resourceful lodovik .  .  .   let the opposing force pull you down  gather its energy for the spring back .      can you get me a summary or an actual recording of these meetings  kreen .         yes  sire .  they will not yet be subject to review and interdiction by the court historians .  there is commonly a backlog of two days on these rewritings  sire .         good .  when an inquiry is held  and questions asked  we will leak sinter   s words to the public .  .  . i think the lowest and most popular journals will serve us best .  perhaps the all world tongue  or the big ear .      kreen smiled .     i myself am fond of the emperor   s eyes .         even better .  no authentication required .  .  . just more rumors among an uneducated and unhappy population .     he shook his head sadly .     even if we bring down sinter  it will be small recompense for losing lodovik .  what chance he might survive .      kreen shrugged  that was well outside his limited expertise .   so few in the imperial sector understood the vagaries of hyperdrive and jump science .  there was one  however .  an old ship   s captain turned trader and occasional smuggler  who specialized in sending goods and passengers along the quickest and quietest routes .  .  . a bright and unscrupulous rogue  some said  but a man who had been of service to chen in the past .      get me an immediate audience with mors planch .         yes  your honor .      kreen bustled out of the room .   linge chen took a deep breath .  his time at the display was over .  he had to return to his office and meet in person with sector generals and planetary representatives from trantor   s food allies for the rest of the day .   he would have much preferred focusing all his thoughts on the loss of lodovik and how to convert sinter   s foolishness to his own best interests  but not even such a tragedy  or such an opportunity  could interfere with his present duties .   ah  the glamour of power .       .     privy councilor farad sinter had overstepped his bounds so many times in the past three years that the boy emperor klayus referred to him as    my pillar of prying ambition     a typically ill worded phrase that today  at least  carried no overtone of admiration or affection .   sinter stood before the emperor  hands clasped in unconvincing submission .  klayus i  barely seventeen years of age  regarded him with something less than anger and more than irritation .  in his all too recent childhood  he had been called down too many times in private by his tutors  all selected and controlled by commissioner chen  he had become a sometimes sly  underhanded young man  more intelligent than most gave him credit for  though still subject to the occasional extreme outburst .  early on  he had learned one of the major rules of leadership and statecraft in a competitive and hypocritical government  he never let anyone know what he was really thinking .      sinter  why are you looking for young men and women in the dahl sector .     the emperor asked .   sinter had taken pains for this effort to be concealed .  somebody was playing political games  and that somebody would pay .      sire  i have heard of this search .  i believe they are being sought as part of the genetic reconciliation project .         yes  sinter  a project you began five years ago .  you think i   m too young to remember .         no  your highness .         i do have some influence in this palace  sinter .  my word is not completely ignored .         of course not  your highness .         spare me the obsequious titles .  why are you hunting down children younger than i am  and disrupting loyal families and neighborhoods .         it is essential to understand the limits of human evolution on trantor  your highness .      klayus lifted his hand .     my tutors tell me evolution is a long  slow process of genetic accretions  sinter .  what do you expect to learn from a few invasions of privacy and attempted kidnappings .         pardon my even hoping to act as one of your tutors  your highness  but          i hate being lectured to     klayus said in a low growl that broke halfway through .      but  if i may continue  with your permission  sire  humans have lived on trantor for twelve thousand years .  we have already seen the development of populations with particular physical and even mental characteristics  the stocky  dark people of dahl  sire  or the menials of lavrenti .  there is evidence  sire  that certain extraordinary traits have occurred in certain individuals in the last century .  .  . scientific evidence  as well as hearsay  of          psychic powers  sinter .     klayus tittered behind spread fingers and lifted his eyes to the ceiling .  a few projected birds flew down and circled them  making as if to peck at sinter .  the emperor had rigged nearly all of his chambers to reveal his moods with such projections  and sinter did not like them in the least .      of a kind  your highness .         extraordinary persuasion .  so i   ve heard .  perhaps the tumbling of dice in games of chance  or the ability to render women susceptible to our charms .  i   d like that very much  sinter .  my assigned women are growing tired of my attentions .     his expression grew peevish .     i can tell .      i hardly blame them  sinter thought .  an oversexed partner of few charms and little wit .  .  .      it is a matter of some curiosity and perhaps importance  highness .         meanwhile  you cause unrest in sectors that are already unhappy .  sinter  it   s a foolish liberty  or rather  a foolish breach of liberty .  i am supposed to guarantee my subjects    freedom from being strapped to the horrid little hobbyhorses of my ministers and advisors  or even my own .  well  my hobbyhorses are relatively comfortable mounts .  .  . but this  but you  sinter .      for a moment  sinter thought the emperor was actually going to show a spine  some imperial fortitude  and forbid this activity  and he felt a momentary chill .  it was because sinter was so good at finding attractive women for young klayus  and replacing them when he or they grew bored  that klayus put up with so many of his peccadilloes .   but the emperor   s eyes grew heavy lidded  and his energy and irritation appeared to dissipate .  sinter hid his relief .  klayus the young was  after all  relenting once more .      please don   t be so obvious  my good man     klayus said .     slow down .  what you need to know will come to you in good time  don   t you think .  i   m sure you have all of our interests at heart .  now  about this woman tyreshia .  .  .      farad sinter listened to klayus   s request with apparent interest  but in fact had switched on his recorder and would pay attention in more detail later .  he could hardly believe his fortune .  the emperor had not forbidden these actions .  he could indeed redirect and slow the less fruitful investigations  and he could also continue .   in fact  it was not humans  exceptional or otherwise  that he was after .  sinter sought evidence for the most extraordinary and long lived conspiracy in human history .  .  .   a conspiracy he had traced back to the time of cleon i  and probably long before that .   a myth  a legend  a real entity  coming and going like a wraith in trantor   s history .  the mycogenians had called him danee .  he was one of the mysterious eternals  and sinter was determined to find out more  however he might risk his reputation .   talk of the eternals was regarded with as little respect  less  actually  as talk of ghosts .  many on trantor  an ancient world filled to overflowing with extinct lives  believed in ghosts .  only a select few paid attention to stories of the eternals .   the emperor talked on about the woman he was interested in  and sinter appeared to listen attentively  but his thoughts were far away .  .  . years away .   sinter imagined himself being credited with saving the empire .  he savored energizing visions of sitting on an imperial throne  or even better  of replacing linge chen on the commission of public safety .      farad .     the emperor   s voice was sharp .   sinter   s recorder instantly fed him the last five seconds of conversation .      yes  your highness .  tyreshia is indeed a beautiful woman  reputedly very high spirited  and ambitious .         ambitious women like me  don   t they  farad .     the boy   s tone softened .  klayus   s mother had been ambitious  and successful  until she had fallen into linge chen   s bad graces .  she had tried to work her wiles on the chief commissioner in the presence of one of his wives .  chen was extremely loyal to his wives .   strange that a weak boy like klayus would enjoy strong women  invariably they grew bored with him .  after a time  not even the most ambitious could hide their boredom .  once they learned who was really in power  ultimately .  .  .   neither sinter nor linge chen cared much for sex .  power was so much more rewarding .       .     the greatest engineering feat in the history of trantor had failed ten years before  and the echoes of that failure still plagued the important and crowded and troublesome dahl sector .  four million dahlite engineers and heatsink workers  supplemented by an additional ten million laborers and even a smuggled force of the banned tiktoks  had worked for twenty years to drive the deepest heatsink yet attempted  over two hundred kilometers  into the crust of trantor .  the difference fu temperature at the proposed depth and the surface would have generated sufficient energy to power one fifth of trantor   s needs for the next fifty years .  .  .   but while ambitions were high  ability was not .  the engineers had shown themselves to be less than inspired  the project management had been plagued by corruption and scandal at all levels  the dahlite workers had revolted and for two years the project had been delayed .  finally  when completed  it had simply .  .  . failed .   the collapse of the shaft and it   s associated sodium and water towers had killed a hundred thousand dahlites  seven thousand of them civilians living immediately above the shaft  beneath the oldest of dahl   s domes .  the closest subsidiary sinks had also been threatened  and only by heroic intervention had further disaster been avoided  personal courage stepping in where leadership and design skill had collapsed miserably .   ever since  dahl had been under a political cloud  a scapegoat sector on a world that was still capable of placing some trust in its leaders .  in truth  linge chen had investigated and prosecuted all the corrupt officials and incompetent designers and conniving contractors .  he had seen to it that tens of thousands were tried and sent to the rikerian prison  or put to hard labor in the worst depths of the heatsinks themselves .   but the economic effects had not been mitigated .  dahl could no longer meet its quota of imperially mandated power  other sectors tried to take up the slack  and what favor dahl had ever had in the palace declined to a wretched minimum .  near starvation had followed .   it was in this world that klia asgar had been born and raised  in the miserable shanty quarters once reserved for workers .  her father had lost his job a year before her birth  and spent the years of her childhood alternately dreaming of a return to prosperity .  .  . and drinking himself silly with yeasty  foul smelling dahlite liquor .  her mother had died when klia was four  she had raised herself from that time on  and did remarkably well  considering that so many cards had been stacked against her from before her birth .   klia was of moderate height for a dahlite female  slender and wiry  with thin strong fingers on long hands .  her hair was short and black  and she possessed the family trait of finely furred cheeks that gave her a somewhat softer aspect than her hard  chiseled features would have otherwise conveyed .   she was quick to learn  quick in motion  and  surprisingly  she was also quick to smile and quick to express sentiment .  in her private moments she dreamed of vague and indefinite improvements that might be possible in another world .  another life  but they were just dreams .  all too often  she dreamed of a strong alliance with some resourceful and handsome  bushy mustached male  no more than five years her senior .  .  .   no such male entered her life .  she was no great beauty  and the esteem and affection of others was the one area where she refused to exercise her surprising abilities to charm and persuade .  if the male entered without prodding  well and good  but she would not apply any major push to get him .  she believed she naturally deserved better .   in another age  another time  long forgotten  klia asgar would have been called a romantic  an idealist .  in dahl  in the year g . e .         she was simply regarded as a stubborn but naive girl of sixteen .  her father told her so whenever he was sober enough to express himself at all .   klia was thankful for small favors .  her father was neither brutal nor demanding .  when sober  he took care of his own few needs  leaving her free to do whatever she wanted  work in the black market  smuggle from the outside luxuries to the less savory  and imperially oppressed  elements of the unemployed .  .  . whatever she could do to survive .  they rarely even saw each other  and they had not lived in the same apartment for two years .  not since that argument and the thing she had done in anger .   this day  she stood on a promenade overlooking the distributor   s market  the most ragged and disreputable retail district in dahl  waiting for an unnamed man in dusty green to pick up a package .  the pieced squares of sky in the overarching dome showed great flickering gaps that cast shadows on the crowds  now thinning as the evening and home hours approached for the first shift of workers .  men and women shopped for their night   s sparse supper  bartering more often than using credits .  dahl was developing its own economy  in fifty years  klia thought  it might go independent  pushing out a weak and vacillating palace mandated economy for something more fundamental and native .  but that  too  was little more than a dream .  .  .   imperial trade monitors stood on the outskirts of the market  men and women with eyes and cameras constantly watching  recording the crowds .  where money and political oversight were concerned  creativity seemed to flourish  in every other endeavor  klia thought  trantor was intellectually bankrupt .   she saw a man who met the description standing between two of the omnipresent trade monitors .  he wore a baggy  dusty green suit and cloak .  the monitors seemed prepared to ignore him  much as they ignored klia when she ventured into the market .  she watched this with narrowed eyes  wondering whether he had bribed them  or whether he had other  less common ways of not attracting attention .   if he could do what she did  he would be a person to reckon with  perhaps partner with  in business  unless his skills were stronger than her own .  in which case  she would have to avoid him like a fatal rash .  but klia had never met anyone stronger than she .   she lifted one arm  as she had been instructed .  he quickly spotted her and walked with a light  almost mincing step in her direction .   they met on the stairs leading from the promenade to the market and the taxi square .  close up  the man in dusty green had a plain and unremarkable face not improved much by a thin and unconvincing mustache .  klia was conventional enough to enjoy a good mustache on a man  this one did not impress her in the least .   then he looked squarely at her and smiled .  the comers of the mustache lifted and his teeth shone brilliant white behind smooth  babylike lips .      you have what i need     he told her .  no question  declaration .      i hope so .  it   s what i was told to bring .         that     the man said  pointing to her small parcel     is of no consequence .     still  he extended a handful of credits and took the package with a thin smile .     you are what i seek .  let   s find a quiet place to talk .      klia drew back cautiously .  she did not doubt she could take care of herself  she always had .  still  she never walked into any situation unprepared .     how quiet .     she asked .      just where we don   t have to listen to the street noises     the man said .  he lifted stiff fingered hands .   there were few such places around the market .  they walked several streets away and found a small coco ice stall .  the man bought her a red coco ice  which she accepted despite her distaste for the popular dahlite delicacy .  he bought himself a small dark stimulk  which he licked with quiet dignity as they sat at a tiny triangular table .   a square of sky above them darkened so severely that she could barely see his face .  his lips seemed to glow around the stimulk .      i   m looking for young men and women eager to see other parts of trantor     the man said .   klia grimaced .     i   ve heard enough recruiters to last me a lifetime .     she started to rise .   the man reached out and took her arm .  without words  she tried to compel him to move it .     for your own good     he said  and did not react .  she tried harder .      let me go     she ordered .   as if stung  the hand withdrew .  it seemed to take a few seconds for the man to compose himself .     of course .  but this is a good time to listen .      klia watched the man curiously .  she hadn   t compelled him  he had obeyed more like a servant reacting to his mistress than to a young girl he was trying to collar in a public place .  klia focused with more intensity on the man .  his surface was not particularly attractive  but she encountered unexpected reserves  a central stillness  a peculiar metallic sweetness .  his emotions did not taste the same as others .      i only listen to people who are interesting     klia said .  she was starting to sound a little too arrogant .  she fancied herself a more dignified sort of woman  not a street braggart .      i see     the man said .  he finished his stimulk and deftly tossed the stick into a receptacle .  the proprietress walked to the receptacle  removed five sticks  a meager show for the day  and took them back to the rear of the stall to clean .     well  is survival interesting .      she nodded .     as a general topic .         then listen closely .     he leaned forward earnestly .     i know what you are and what you can do .         what am i .     klia asked .   he looked skyward  just as the square immediately above flickered back to full brightness .  his skin was unusually sallow  as if he wore makeup against some skin condition  though she could not detect the pockmarks of brain fever .  klia   s cheeks themselves showed deep pocks  beneath the fur .     you had a bout of fever as a child  didn   t you .     he asked .      most do .  it   s typical on trantor .         not just here  young friend .  on all human worlds .  brain fever is the ever present companion of intelligent youth  too common to be noticed  too innocuous to be cured .  but in you  it was no easy childhood illness .  it nearly killed you .      klia   s mother had nursed her through the rough time  then had died just months later  in an accident in the sinks .  she hardly remembered her mother  but her father had told her all about the illness .     what about it .      his eyes were pale  and she suddenly realized they were not looking directly at her face  but at some irrelevant point to the right of her forehead .     i can   t see well now .  i make my way around by feeling the people  where they are  how they move and sound  in a place without people i am in some distress .  i prefer crowds for that reason .  you .  .  . do not .  crowds irritate you .  trantor is a crowded world .  it confines you .      klia blinked  uncertain whether it was polite to keep staring at his dead eyes .  not that she cared overmuch for politeness in a situation such as this .      i   m just a runner and sometimes a swapper     she said .     no one pays much attention to me .         i can feel you working on me  klia .  you want me to leave you alone .  i disturb you  mostly because what i am saying has a certain truthful resonance  am i right .      klia   s eyes narrowed .  she did not want to be special or even memorable to this blind man in dusty green .   she closed her eyes and concentrated  forget me .  the man cocked his head to one side  as if experiencing a muscle cramp .  his mind had such an odd flavor .  she had never experienced a mind like it .   and she would have sworn he was lying about being blind .  .  . but none of that was important in the face of her failure to persuade him .      you   ve done well for yourself  for a child     he said in a low voice .     too well .  people are looking for those who succeed where they should fail .  palace specials  secret police  not at all friendly .      the man stood and arranged his coat and brushed crumbs from the seat of his pants .     these chairs are filthy     he murmured .     your effort to make me forget was exceptionally powerful  perhaps the most powerful i   ve experienced  but you lack certain skills .  .  . i will remember  because i must remember .  there are a surprising number of those with your skills on trantor now  perhaps one or two thousand .  i   ve been told  no matter by whom  that most of you are marked by a particularly strong reaction to brain fever .  those who hunt for you are mistaken .  they believe it passed you by      the man smiled in her general direction .     i   m boring you     he said .     i find it painful to be where i   m not wanted .  i   ll go .     he turned  seemed to feel for somebody to guide him  and took a step away from the table .      no     klia said  her voice catching .     stay for a minute .  i want to ask you something .      he stopped with a small tremor .  suddenly  he seemed very vulnerable .  he thinks i can hurt him .  and maybe i can .  she wanted to understand his strange flavor  clean and strangely compelling  as if within this man  behind flimsy masks of deception  lurked a basic honesty and decency she had never encountered before .      i   m not bored     she said .     not yet .      the man in dusty green sat down again and put his hand on the table .  he took a deep breath .  he doesn   t need to breathe  klia thought  but put away the absurdity quickly    a man and a woman have been searching for your kind for a number of years  and many have joined their group .  i hope they live well where the man and woman will send them  i  for one  am unwilling to take the risk .         who are they .         they say one is wanda seldon palver  the granddaughter of hari seldon .      klia did not know the name .  she shrugged .     you can go to them  if you want      the man continued  but she made a sour face and interrupted .      they sound connected     she said  using the word in its derogatory meaning of close to the palace and the commissioners and other government officials .      oh  yes  seldon was once a first minister  and they say his granddaughter has gotten him out of a number of tough scrapes  legal and otherwise .         he   s an outlaw .         no  a visionary .      klia pursed her lips and frowned again .  in dahl  visionaries were a dime a dozen street corner crazies  out of work  out of the grind  most driven insane by their work in the heatsinks .   the man in dusty green observed her reaction closely .     not for you .  now  however  another man is searching for your type          what type .     klia asked nervously .  she needed more time to think  to understand .     i   m still confused .     she felt out his defenses lightly  hoping not to intrude in a way he would notice .   the man flinched as if poked .     i am a friend  not an enemy to be lightly manipulated .  i know there   s risk even talking to you .  i know what you could do to me if you put your mind to it .  somebody else in a position of power thinks your kind is monstrous .  but he doesn   t understand at all .  he seems to think you are all robots .      klia laughed .     like tiktoks .     she asked .  the worker machines had fallen out of favor long before her birth  banned because of frequent and unexplained mechanical revolts  and the public distaste for them still lingered .      no .  like robots out of history and legend .  eternals .     he pointed west  in the general direction of the imperial sector  the palace .     it   s madness  but it   s imperial madness  not easy to overcome .  best if you leave  and i know the best place to go .  .  . on trantor .  not far from here .  i can help you make arrangements .         no thank you     she said .  there was too much uncertainty here for klia to put herself in the hands of this stranger  however compelling parts of his story might seem .  his words and what she sensed did not add up .      then take this .     the man thrust a small display card into her hand and stood once more .     you will call .  this is not in question .  it is only a matter of time .      he stared at her directly  his eyes bright  fully capable .      we all have our secrets     he said  and turned to leave .       .     lodovik stood alone on the bridge of the spear of glory  peering through the broad forward facing port at what might have been a scene of exceptional beauty  had he been human .  beauty was not an easy concept for a robot to grasp  however  he could see what lay outside the ship  and understand that a human would think it interesting  but for him  the closest analog to beauty was successful service  perfect performance of duty .  he would in some sense enjoy notifying a human that a beautiful view was available through this port  but his foremost duty would be to inform the human that this view was in fact caused by forces that were very dangerous .  .  .   and in this duty he had no chance of succeeding  for the humans on spear of glory were already dead .  captain tolk had died last  his mind gone  his body a wreck .  in the last few hours of rational thought left to him  tolk had instructed lodovik on the actions that might be taken to bring the ship to its final destination  repair of the hyperdrive units  reprogramming of the ship   s navigational system  preserving ship   s power for maximum survival time .   tolk   s last coherent words to lodovik had been a question .     how long can you live .  .  . i mean  function .      lodovik had told him     a century  without refueling .      tolk had then succumbed to the painful  murmurous half sleep that preceded his death .   two hundred human deaths weighed on lodovik   s positronic brain like a drain on his power supplies  it slowed him somewhat .  that effect would pass .  he was not responsible for the deaths .  he simply could not prevent them .  but this in itself was sufficient to make him feel weary .   as for the view    sarossa itself was a dim star  still a hundred billion kilometers distant  but the shock front revealed its extended spoor like a vast  ghostly fireworks display .   the streams of high energy particles had met the solar wind from the sarossan system  creating huge  dim auroras like waving banners .  he could make out faint traces red and green in the murky luminosity  switching his eyes to the ultraviolet  he could see even more colors as the diffuse clouds of the explosion   s outer shells advanced through the outlying regions of the system   s cometary dust and ice and gas .   there was so little time to act  nothing he could do .  .  .   and worse still  lodovik could feel his brain changing .  the neutrinos and other radiation had overwhelmed the ship   s armor of energy fields  and had done more than just kill the humans  they had somehow  he believed  interfered with his own positronic circuitry .  he had not yet finished his autodiagnosis sequence  that might take days more  but he feared the worst .   if his primary functions were affected  he would have to destroy himself .  in ages past  he would have merely gone into a dormant mode until a human or another robot repaired him  but he could not afford to have his robotic nature discovered .   whatever happened to him  there seemed little chance of discovery .  spear of glory was hopelessly lost  less than a microbe in an ocean .  he had never managed to trace the malfunction or make repairs  despite the captain   s instructions .  being jerked rapidly into and out of hyperspace had burned out all the circuitry for faster than light communication .  the ship had automatically broadcast a distress signal  but surrounded by the shock front   s extreme radiation  there was little chance the signal would ever be heard .   lodovik   s secret was secure enough .  but his usefulness to daneel  and to humanity  was over .   for a robot  duty was everything  self nothing  yet in his present circumstance  he could look through the port at the effects of the shock front and speculate for no particular reason about physical processes .  while not completely stopping his constant processing of problems associated with his long term mission  he could drift in the middle of the bridge  his immediate needs and work reduced to nothing .   for humans  this could be called a time of introspection .  introspection without the target of duty was more than novel  it was disturbing .  lodovik would have avoided the opportunity and this sensation if he could have .   a robot  above all else  was uncomfortable with internal change .  ages past  during the robotic renaissance  on the almost forgotten worlds of aurora and solaria  robots had been built with inhibitions that went beyond the three laws .  robots  with a few exceptions  were not allowed to design and build other robots .  while they could manage minor repairs to themselves  only a select few specialty units could repair robots that had been severely damaged .   lodovik could not repair this malfunction in his own brain  if it was a malfunction  the evidence was not yet clear .  but a robot   s brain  its essential programming  was even more off limits to meddling than its body .   there was one place remaining in the galaxy where a robot could be repaired  and where occasionally a robot could be manufactured .  that was eos  established by r .  daneel olivaw ten thousand years ago  far from the boundaries of the expanding empire .  lodovik had not been there for ninety years .   still  a robot had a strong urge to self preservation  that was implicit in the third law .  with time to contemplate his condition  lodovik wondered if he might in fact be found  then sent to eos for repair .  .  .   none of these possibilities seemed likely .  he resigned himself to the most probable fate  ten more years in this crippled ship  until his minifusion power reserves ran down  with nothing important to do  a robinson crusoe of robots  lacking even an island to explore and transform .   lodovik could not feel a sense of horror at this fate .  but he could imagine what a human would feel  and that in itself induced an echo of robotic unease .   to cap it all  he was hearing voices  or rather  a voice .  it sounded human  but communicated only at odd intervals  in fragments .  it even had a name  something like volda    .  and it gave an impression of riding vast but tenuous webs of force  sailing through the deep vacuum between the stars  seeking out the plasma halos of living stars  reveling in the neutrino miasma of dead and dying stars  neutrinos intoxicating as hashish smoke .  fleeing from trantor   s boredom  i grow bored again  and i find  between the stars  a robot in dire straits .  one of those the eternal brought from outside to replace the many destroyed  look  my friends  my boring friends who have no flesh and know no flesh  and tolerate no fleshly ideals  one of your hated purgers .   the voice faded .  added to his distress over the death of the captain and crew of the spear of glory and his odd feedback of selfless unease  this mysterious voice  a clear sign of delusion and major malfunction  brought him as close as a robot could come to complete misery .       .     from his vantage in the tiny balcony apartment overlooking streeling university  r .  daneel olivaw could not feel human grief  lacking the human mental structures necessary for that bitter reassessment and reshaping of neuronal pathways  but  like lodovik  he could feel a sharp and persistent unease  somewhere between guilt at failure and the warning signals of impending loss of function .  the news that one of his most valued cohorts was missing distressed him at the very least in that way .  he had lost so many to the tiktoks  guided by the alien meme entities  it seemed so recently  decades  however  and his discomfort  and loneliness .   still burned .   he had seen the newsfilm in a store window the day before  of the loss of the spear of glory and the probable end to any hope of rescue for the citizens of several worlds .   in his present guise  he looked very much as he had twenty millennia before  in the time of his first and perhaps most influential relationship with a human  elijah bailey .  of medium height  slender  with brown hair  he appeared about thirty five human years of age .  he had made some small accessions to the changes in human physiology in that time  the fingernails on his pinkie fingers were now gone  and he was some six centimeters taller .  still  bailey might have recognized him .   it was doubtful that daneel would have recognized his ancient human friend  however  all but the most general of those memories had long since been stored in separate caches  and were not immediately accessible to the robot .   daneel had undergone many transformations since that time  the most famous of them being demerzel  first minister to the emperor cleon i  hari seldon himself had succeeded him in that post .  now the time was approaching when daneel would have to intensify his direct participation in trantor   s politics  a prospect he found distasteful .  the loss of lodovik would make his work all the more difficult .   he had never enjoyed public displays .  he was far more content to operate in the background and let his thousands of cohorts act out public roles .  he preferred  in any case  that his robots assert themselves in small ways here and there over time  at key locations  to effect changes that would in turn effect other changes  producing a cascade with  he hoped  the desired results .   in the centuries of his work he had seen a few failures and many successes  but with lodovik he had hoped to insure his most important goal  the perfection of the plan  hari seldon   s psychohistory project  and the settlement of a first foundation world .   seldon   s psychohistory had already given daneel the tools necessary to see the empire   s future in bleak detail .  collapse  disintegration  wholesale destruction  chaos .  there was nothing he could do to prevent that collapse .  perhaps had he acted ten thousand years ago  with then impossible foresight  using the crude and piecemeal psychohistory then at his disposal  he might have put off this catastrophe .  but daneel could not allow the empire   s decline and fall to proceed without intervention  for too many humans would suffer and die  over thirty eight billion on trantor alone  and the first law dictated that no human should be harmed or allowed to come to harm .   his duty for all of those twenty thousands of years had been to mitigate human failures and redirect human energies for the greater human good .   to do that  he had mired himself in history  and some of the changes he had effected had resulted in pain  harm  even death .  it was the zeroth law  first formulated by the remarkable robot giskard reventlov  that allowed him to continue functioning under these circumstances .   the zeroth law was not a simple concept  though it could be stated simply enough  some humans could be harmed  if by so doing one could prevent harm for the greater number .   the ends justify the means .   this dreadful implication had powered so much agony in human history  but it was no time to engage in that ancient internal debate .   what could he learn from the loss of lodovik trema .  nothing  it seemed  the universe sometimes decided things beyond the control of rational action .  there was nothing so frustrating and difficult to encompass  for a robot  as a universe indifferent to humans .   daneel could move anonymously from sector to sector  along with the migrating unemployed now pandemic on trantor .  he could maintain contact with his cohorts through a personal communicator or his portable informer  as well as through illegal hookups to the planet   s many networks .  sometimes he dressed as a pitiful street beggar  he spent much of his time in a cramped  dirty apartment in the trans imperial sector  barely seventy kilometers from the palace .  nobody wished to look at a figure so old  bent  filthy  and pitiful  in a way  daneel had become a symbol of the misery he hoped to overcome .   no humans remembered a fictional character who had so enjoyed going out in disguise among the common people  the lower classes  a man of pure and impossibly discerning intellect  a detective much like daneel   s old friend elijah bailey .  with daneel   s frequent memory dumps and adjustments  all that he remembered was a single name and an overall impression  sherlock .   daneel was one of the many robots who had become disguised sherlocks among the masses  tens of thousands throughout the galaxy  trying not just to solve a mystery  but to prevent further and greater crimes .   the leader of these dedicated servants  the first eternal  brushed as much of the street   s filth from his rags as he could manage  and left the cramped and empty general habitation project hovel in search of finer clothes .       .        they   ve searched the entire apartment     sonden asgar moaned  rubbing his elbows and looking smaller and more frail than she had ever seen him before .  klia   s respect for her father had not been high in the last few years  but she still felt a pang for his misery  and an abiding sense of guilt that strengthened a sense of responsibility .     they went through our records  imagine that .  private records .  some imperial authority .  .  .         why your records  father .     klia asked .  the apartment was a shambles .  she could imagine the investigators pulling up cabinets and throwing out the boxes and few dishes within  tugging up the worn carpets .  .  . she was glad she hadn   t been here  and for more than one reason .      not my records .     sonden shouted .     they were looking for you .  school papers  bookfilms  and they took our family album .  with all your mother   s pictures .  why .  what have you done now .      klia shook her head and upturned a stool to sit .     if they   re looking for me  i can   t stay     she said .      why  daughter .  what could          if i   ve done anything illegal  father  it   s not worth the attention of imperial specials .  it must be something else .  .  .     she thought of the conversation with the man in dusty green  and frowned .   sonden asgar stood in the middle of the main room  three meters square  hardly a room at all  more of a closet  and shivered like a frightened animal .     they were not kind     he said .     they grabbed me and shook me hard .  .  . they acted like thugs .  i might as well have gotten mugged in billibotton .         what did they say .     klia asked softly .      they asked where you were  how you had done in school  how you made your living .  they asked whether you knew a kindril nashak .  who is that .         a man     she said  hiding her surprise .  kindril nashak .  he had been the kingpin in her greatest success so far  a deal that had put four hundred new credits in her accounts with the banker in billibotton .  but even that had been trivial  surely nothing worth their attention .  imperial special police were supposed to seek out the lords of the underground  not clever girls with purely personal ambitions .      a man .     her father said sharply .     someone who   s willing to take you off my hands  i hope .         i haven   t been a burden to you for years     klia said sourly .     i only dropped by to see how you were doing .    and to discover why any thought of you made my head itch .      i told them you   re never here .     sonden cried .     i said we hadn   t seen each other in months .  none of it makes sense .  it will take days to clean this mess .  the food .  they spilled the entire cookery .         i   ll help you pick up     klia said .     shouldn   t take more than an hour .      she certainly hoped not .  other faces were making her head itch now  friends  colleagues  anyone associated with nashak .  one thing she was sure of  she had suddenly become important  and not because she was a clever member of the black market community .   an hour later  with the mess largely taken care of and sonden at least beginning to recover his calm .  she kissed him on the top of the head and said good bye  and she meant it .   she could not look at her father without her scalp seeming to burn .  nothing to do with the guilt  she told herself .  something new .   hereafter  any contact with him would be extremely dangerous .       .     major perl namm of special investigations  imperial security  assigned to the dahl sector  had been waiting for two hours in the private palace office of imperial councilor farad sinter .  he adjusted his collar nervously .  the desk of farad sinter was smooth and elegant  crafted from karon wood from the imperial gardens  a gift from klayus i .  the top of the desk held only an inactive imperial class informer .  a sun and spaceship plaque hovered to one side of the desk .  the office   s high ceiling was supported by beams of trantorian basalt  with intricate floral patterns spun carved by tuned blaster beams .  the major looked up at these beams  and when he looked down again  farad sinter stood behind the desk  wearing an irritated frown .      yes .      major namm  very blond and compact  was not used to private audiences at this social level  and in the palace  as well .     second report on the search for klia asgar  daughter of sonden and bethel asgar .  survey of the father   s apartment .         what else did you learn .         her early intelligence tests were normal  not exceptional .  after the age of ten  however  those tests showed extraordinary jumps  then  by the age of twelve  they revealed that she was an idiot .         standard imperial aptitude tests  i assume .         yes  sir  adjusted for dahlite .  .  . ah .  .  . needs .      sinter walked across the room and poured himself a drink .  he did not offer any to the major  who wouldn   t have known what to do with fine wine anyway .  no doubt his tastes were limited to the cruder forms of stimulk  or even the more direct stims favored in the military and police services .     there are no records of childhood illness  i presume     sinter said .      two possible explanations for that  sir     the blond major said .      yes .         hospitals in dahl typically record only exceptional illnesses .  and in those cases  if the exceptions might reflect badly on the hospital  they report nothing at all .         so perhaps she never had brain fever at all .  .  . as a child  when almost everyone of any intelligence contracts brain fever .         it   s possible  sir  though unlikely .  only one out of a hundred normal children escape brain fever .  only idiots escape completely  sir .  she may have avoided it for that reason .      sinter smiled .  the officer was stepping outside his expertise  the number was actually closer to one in thirty million normals  though many claimed they had never had it .  and that claim in itself was evocative  as if escaping conferred some added status .      major  are you at all curious about the sectors you do not patrol .         no  sir .  why should i be .         do you know the tallest structure on trantor  above sea level  i mean .         no  sir .         the most populated sector .         no  sir .         the largest planet in the known galaxy .         no .     the major frowned as if he were being mocked .      most people are ignorant of these things .  they don   t care to know  tell them and they forget .  the larger vision is lost in the day to day minutiae  which they know well enough to get along .  what about the basic principles of hyperdrive travel .         sky  no .  .  . pardon me .  no sir .         i   m ignorant of that myself .  no curiosity at all about such things .     he smiled pleasantly .     have you ever wondered why trantor seems so run down nowadays .         sometimes  sir .  it is a nuisance .         have you thought to complain to your neighborhood council .         not my place .  there   s so much to complain about  where to begin .         of course .  yet you   re known as a competent and perhaps even an exceptional officer .         thank you  sir .      sinter looked down at the polished copperstone floor .     are you curious why i am so interested in this woman  this girl .         no  sir .     but the major thought it worth a small  conspiratorial wink .   sinter   s eyes widened .     you believe i   m interested in her sexually .      the major straightened abruptly .     no sir  not my place to think anything of the sort .         i would be frightened even to be in her presence for long  major namm .         yes  sir .         she never had brain fever .         we don   t know that  sir .  no records .      sinter dismissed that with a shake of his head .     i know that she never had brain fever  or any other childhood disease .  and not because she was an idiot .  she was more than merely immune  major .         yes  sir .         and her powers can be extraordinary .  and do you know how i know that .  because of vara liso .  she first detected this girl in a dahlite market a week ago .  a prime candidate  she thought .  i should send vara liso with you on your rounds now  just to refine the hunt .      the major said nothing  merely stood at parade rest  eyes fixed on the opposite wall .  his adam   s apple bobbed .  sinter could read the man well enough without seeing into his mind  the major did not much believe all this  and knew little or nothing of vara liso .      can you find her for me  without vara liso   s aid .         with sufficient numbers of officers  we can find her in two or three days .  my small crew  by itself  would probably take two or three weeks .  dahl is not in a cooperative mood right now  sir .         no  i suppose not .  well  find her  but do not attempt to arrest her or attract her attention in any way .  you would fail  as her kind has made so many others fail .  .  .         yes  sir .         tell me what she does  whom she sees .  when i give you the order  you will shoot her with a large bore kinetic energy gun  from a distance  in the head .  understood .         yes  sir .         as you have so faithfully done before .         yes  sir .         then you will bring her body to me .  not to the criminalists  but to me  my private chambers .  enough  major .         sir .     major namm departed .   sinter did not much trust the competence of any police  in any sector .  they could be bribed easily enough  yet sinter   s extended police patrols had not yet managed to bring down one robot  all of their targeted individuals had been humans  after all .  the robots had deceived them very cleverly .   but klia asgar .  .  . a young girl  in form at least .  how did a robot manage to appear to grow .  there were so many mysteries sinter looked forward to solving .   brain fever   s effect on curiosity  and on civilization in general  was not the most interesting of those mysteries  not at all .  no mystery at all .  sinter strongly suspected that robots had created the disease  perhaps millennia before  after their banishment from the worlds of humans  their goal to subtly reduce intellectual capacity  creating an empire that so seldom rebelled against the center .  .  .   his mind whirled at the implications .  so many suspicions  so many theories .   with a small  intent smile  sinter lost himself in speculation for several minutes  then went to the desktop informer to look up the name of the largest world in the galaxy .   sinter had never had brain fever  himself  had somehow escaped it  despite having an above normal intelligence .  he was eternally curious .   and completely human .  farad sinter had x ray images taken at least twice a year to prove that fact to himself .   the largest inhabited world in the galaxy was nak  a gas giant circling a star in the hallidon province .  it was four million kilometers wide .   now he had other matters to consider .  he stood before his desk  he never sat while working  and scrolled through the briefs supplied to him by the informer .  there was a stink rising over reassignment of ships to sarossa  following the probable loss of the spear of glory .  he could almost smell linge chen behind the growing public indignation .  yet that had actually been klayus   s doing  almost entirely .  sinter had gone along to allow the boy some sense of purpose .   chen was a very intelligent man .   sinter wondered if chen had ever had brain fever .  .  .   lost in thought  he sat for five minutes as the briefs filed past  ignoring them .  he had more than enough time to deal with commissioner chen .       .     mors planch  in his fifty years of service to the empire  and to his own ends   had watched things go from bad to worse with grim calm .  not much upset him  on the surface  he was quiet and soft spoken and used to carrying out extraordinary missions  but he never thought he would be called upon  by linge chen  no less  to do something so mundane as go looking for a lost starship .  and a survey vessel  at that .   he stood on the steel balcony suspended above the central trantor spaceport docks  looking down the long rows of bullet shaped bronze and ivory imperial ships  all gleaming and brightly polished on the surface  and all run by crews who performed their duties more and more by ritual and rote  not even beginning to understand the mechanics and electronics  much less the physics  behind their miraculous jumps from one end of the galaxy to the other .   spit and polish and a shadow of ignorance  like an eclipse at noon .  .  .   he smelled the perfumery on his lapel to put him in a better mood .  the pleasant aromas of a thousand worlds had been programmed into the tiny button  an extraordinary antique given to him by linge chen seven years ago .  chen was a remarkable man  able to understand the emotions and needs of others  while having none of his own  other than the lust for power .   planch knew his master well enough  and knew what he was capable of  but he did not have to like him .  still  chen paid very well  and if the empire was going to rank growth and bad seed  planch had no qualms about avoiding the worst of the discomforts and misfortunes .   a tall  spidery woman with corn yellow hair seemed to appear by his elbow  towering over him by a good ten centimeters .  he looked up and met her onyx eyes .      mors planch .         yes .     he turned and extended his hand .  the woman stepped back and shook her head  on her world  huylen  physical contact was considered rude in simple greetings .     and you   re tritch  i presume .         presumptuous of you     she said     but accurate .  i have three ships we can use  and i   ve chosen the best .  private  and fully licensed for travel anywhere the empire might care to trade .         you   ll be carrying only me  and i   ll need to inspect your hyperdrive  do some modifications .         oh .     tritch   s humor faded fast .     i don   t even like experts doing such work .  if it ain   t broke  don   t fix it .         i   m more than an expert     planch said .     and with what you   re being paid  you could replace your whole ship three times over .      tritch moved her head from side to side in a gesture planch could not read .  so many social customs and physical nuances .  a quadrillion human beings could be remarkably difficult to encompass  especially at the center  where so many of them crossed paths .   they walked toward the gate to the dock aisle where tritch   s ships were berthed .     you told me we were going on a search     she said .     you said it would be dangerous .  for that amount of money  i accept great risks  but          we   re going into a supernova shock front     planch said  keeping his eyes straight ahead .      oh .     this news gave her pause  but only for a second .     sarossa .      he nodded .  they took a pedway to the berth itself  sliding past three kilometers of other vessels  most of them imperial  a few belonging to the palace upper crust  the rest to licensed traders like tritch .      i turned down four requests from local folks to go there and rescue their families .         as well you should have     planch said .     i   m your job today  not them .         how high up does this go .     tritch asked with a sniff .     or perhaps i should ask  how much influence do you have .         no influence at all .  i do what i   m told  and don   t talk much about my orders .      tritch undulated in polite dubiousness  walked ahead to the gangway  and ordered the ship   s loading doors to open .  the ship was a clean looking craft  about two hundred years old  with self repairing drives  but who knew if the self repair units were in good working order .  people trusted their machines too much these days  because by and large they had to .   planch noted the ship   s name  flower of evil .     when do we leave .         now     planch said .      you know     tritch said     your name sounds familiar .  .  . are you from huylens .         me .     he shook his head and laughed as they walked into the cavernous  almost empty hold .     i   m far too short for your kind  tritch .  but my people provided the seed colony that settled your world  a thousand years ago .         that explains it .     tritch said  and gave another sort of wriggle  signifying  he presumed  pleasure at their possible historical connection .  huylenians were a clannish bunch who loved depth history and genealogy .     i   m honored to have you aboard .  what   s your poison  planch .     she indicated boxes filled with exotic liquors  constrained by a security field in one comer of the hold .      for now  nothing     planch said  but he looked over the labels appreciatively .  then he stopped  seeing a label on ten cases that made his pulse race .     tight little spaces     he swore     is that trillian water of life .         two hundred bottles     she said .     after we get our work done  you can have two bottles  on the house .         you   re generous  tritch .         more than you know  planch .     she winked .  planch inclined his head gallantly .  he had forgotten how open and childlike huylenians could be  just as he had forgotten many of their gestures .  at the same time  they were among the toughest traders in the galaxy .   the lock door closed  and tritch led planch into the engine room  to examine and tinker with her ship   s most private parts .        .     as evening fell beneath the domes and the light outside his office windows dimmed  chen sat in his favorite chair and called up the imperial library   s news service  the finest and most comprehensive in the galaxy .  words and pictures flitted around him  all relating to the sarossan disaster and the loss of the spear of glory  . there was no sign of the ship  and not likely to be  the best experts said it was very likely swallowed by a discontinuity within its final jump  a hazard associated with supernova explosions but rarely seen  for the simple reason that supernovas were rare on human time scales .  in all the galaxy  less than one or two occurred each year  more often than not in uninhabited regions .   already the popular journals were calling on the emperor  respectfully  of course  and on councilor sinter  more acerbically  to rethink the transfer of rescue ships .  chen smiled grimly  let sinter chew on that for a while .   of course  if he heard nothing from mors planch  he would need to replace lodovik  and soon  he had four candidates  none of them as qualified as lodovik  but all worthy of service in the commission of public safety .  he would choose one as his assistant  and put the other three in apprenticeship programs  saying that the commission should never again be caught with no immediate backups for the loss of important personnel .   there were three commissioners who owed chen for a few choice and private favors  and chen could use this as a pretense for putting loyal men and women into their offices .   he shut off the news service report with a flick of his hand and stood  smoothing his robes .  then he went out on the balcony to enjoy the sunset .  there was no real sun visible here  of course  but he had mandated the repair of the imperial sector dome displays on a regular basis  and the sunsets were as reliable here as they had been everywhere in trantor in his youth .  he watched the highly artistic interpretation with some satisfaction  then put away all these masks of pleasure and considered the future .   chen rarely slept more than an hour a day  usually at noon  which gave him the entire evening to do his research and make preparations for the work of the next morning .  during his hour of sleep  he usually dreamed for about thirty minutes  and this afternoon  he had dreamed of his childhood  for the first time in years .  dreams  in his experience  seldom directly reflected the day to day affairs of life  but they could point to personal problems and weaknesses .  chen had great respect for those mental processes below conscious awareness .  he knew that was where much of his most important work was done .   he imagined himself the captain of his own personal starship  with many excellent crewmembers  representing subconscious thought processes .  it was his task to keep them alert and on duty  and for that reason  chen performed special mental exercises for at least twenty minutes each day .   he had a machine for that very purpose  designed for him by the greatest psychologist on trantor  perhaps in the galaxy .  the psychologist had disappeared five years ago  after an imperial court scandal orchestrated by farad sinter .   so many interconnections  interweavings .  chen regarded his enemies as his most intimate associates  and sometimes even felt a kind of sorrowful affection for them  as they fell by the wayside  one by one  victims of their own peculiar limitations and blindness .   or  in sinter   s case  of aggressive idiocy and madness .        .     hari lived in simple quarters on the university grounds  in his third apartment since the death of dors venabili .  he could not seem to find a place that felt like home  after a few months  or in this case ten years  he would grow dissatisfied with the feel of a place  no matter how bland and characterless the decor was  and move to another .  often he spent his nights in a room in the library  explaining that he needed to get to work very early the next morning  which he did  but that was not his main reason for staying .   wherever he was  hari felt so very alone .   he was not above using his rank in the university  and his standing in the imperial library  to get new housing assignments .  he allowed himself a few eccentricities  as one might allow an old engine extra maintenance  hoping that he could finish his task without breaking down .  coming to the end was difficult  he had so many memories of the beginnings  and they were far more exciting  far more satisfying  then anything reality at this point in his life could generate .  .  .   for that reason  he was almost looking forward to the trial  to a chance to confront linge chen directly and force the empire   s hand  his last and grandest finesse .  then he would know .  it would be finished .   when he had been first minister to cleon i  he had also taken advantage of his position  on rare occasions  to gather the information he most needed .  one of the crucial problems of psychohistory then had been the notion of unexpected cultural and genetic variability  that is  how to factor in the possibility of extraordinary individuals .   at the time  he had not seriously considered the psychic powers of individuals such as his granddaughter  or her father  raych  he had not known about such things  other than in the abstract  and he had not considered too rigorously the powers of daneel in that regard .   all of them  of course  had peculiar talents for persuasion  and he had in the past few years made sure that psychohistory took into account these particular talents  on the level exercised by wanda .   in the time of his first ministry  however  he had been concerned with the more familiar historical and political problem of ruthless ambition  whether or not aided by personal charisma .  there had been plenty of examples around the empire to study  and he had examined these political episodes as best he could from afar .  .  .   but that had not been enough .  with the blind and unshakable determination hari could bring to bear when confronted with a psychohistorical problem  and against dors    wishes  hari had appealed to cleon to bring to trantor five individuals of just that political breed  the ruthless  charismatic tyrant .  they had been removed from their worlds after either rebelling against or subverting imperial authority  which happened on about one in a thousand worlds  every standard year .  most often they were secretly executed  sometimes they were exiled to lonely rocks to live out lives empty of further victims .   hari had asked cleon to allow him to interview the five tyrants  and perform certain reasonably non intrusive psychological and medical procedures .   hari could remember the day quite clearly  when cleon had called him into his ornate private rooms and shaken the paper on which his request was written in hari   s face .      you   re asking me to bring these vermin to trantor .  to subvert legal procedures and even forestall executions  just so you can scratch a bump of curiosity .         it   s a very important problem  highness .  i cannot predict anything if i do not have a complete understanding of such extraordinary individuals  and when and how they appear in human cultures .         huh .  why not study me  first minister seldon .      hari had smiled .     you do not fit the profile  highness .         i   m not a raving psychopath  am i .  well  at least you think i might be redeemable .  but to bring some of these obscene monsters to my world .  .  . what would you do if they escaped  hari .         rely on your security forces to find them again  highness .      the emperor had sniffed .     you have a confidence in imperial security   s abilities that i don   t  i   m afraid .  such monsters as these are like cancers  their talent is for bringing together tumorous organizations and subverting all to their own ends .  truthfully  hari  what do you hope to accomplish .         it   s far more than simply being curious  my emperor .  these people can change the flow of human events just as earthquakes can change the beds of rivers .         not on trantor  they can   t .         actually  sire  just the other day          i know about that  and we   re having it fixed .  but these men and women are aberrations  hari           common enough in human history          and well enough understood that we can profile them and eliminate them from all imperial positions .  most of the time .         yes  sire  but not always .  i need to fill in those gaps .         purely for psychohistory  hari .         i will see if i can improve your profiles  highness  and perhaps make tyrants even more rare among your worlds .      cleon had considered for a few seconds  finger on chin  then had lifted his finger away from his face  twirled it in a small circle  and said     all right  first minister .  we have our political excuse  if we need it .  five .         all i could study in the time allowed  sire .         the very worst .         you are familiar with the names i   ve requested .         i never met with any of them  nor did i personally give them their imperial imprimaturs  hari .         i know  sire .         i won   t be blamed for them in your psychohistorical textbooks  will i .         of course not .      and so  hari had had his way .  the five tyrants had been brought to trantor and installed in the highest security prison in the imperial sector  the rikerian .   the first meetings had occurred in    hari was deep in this reverie when the apartment announced that his granddaughter was outside the front door and wished to see him .  hari was always glad to see his granddaughter  especially in the limited time they had left together  but now .  when he was on the track of something important .   even so  he had not seen wanda in weeks .  she and her husband  stettin palver  had been assembling a core group of mentalics from trantor   s eight hundred sectors  and there had been no time for socializing .  in weeks  as soon after the trial as possible  the mentalics would leave for star   s end  to begin the work of the proposed secret second foundation .   hari got up and let his legs gather strength before he put on his robe and told the door to open .  wanda entered  bringing with her a draft of cold air and the smells of the halls outside  cooking yeast  and not delicacies from mycogen  either .    ozone  something like fresh paint .      grandfather  have you heard .  the emperor is hunting us down .         whom  wanda .  hunting whom .         mentalics .  they   ve subverted one of our party and she   s confessed to all sorts of incredible stories  lies  to save her own skin .  how could that boy do this .  it   s totally illegal to hunt citizens and assassinate them .      hari held up his hands and implored her to slow down .     tell me about it  from the beginning     he said .      the beginning is a woman named liso  vara liso .  she was one of the people we   d picked out for the second foundation .  i thought she was unstable to start with  stettin agreed with me  but she was very skillful  very persuasive and sensitive .  we thought we could use her to speed up our hunt for other mentalics  if we didn   t trust her to go with us .  .  . on the flight .         yes  i met her at the last meeting     hari said .     a small woman  nervous looking .         like a little mouse  i thought     wanda confirmed .     she went to the palace last month  without our knowing          whom did she talk to .         farad sinter .     wanda fairly spat out the name .      and what did she tell him .         we don   t know  but whatever it was  sinter has secret police hunting for certain mentalics  and if he finds them  they die .  .  . of a bullet in the head .         ours .  the ones chosen for the project .         no  amazingly enough .  there   s no one to one correlation .  but he has killed candidates we haven   t yet approached .         without even taking them in for questioning .         no such amenities .  murder  pure and simple .  grandfather  we   re never going to fill our quotas at this rate .  our type of person is not common .         i   ve never met sinter personally     hari mused     though some of his people interviewed me last year .  wanted to know about mycogenian legends  as i recall .         they   re tearing up dahl now  looking for a young woman .  we don   t even know her name yet  but some of our people in dahl have felt her .  .  . almost found her .  .  . an extraordinarily powerful talent .  we   re sure she must be the one they   re looking for .  i hope she can survive long enough for us to find her first .      hari gestured for wanda to sit at his small table and offered her a cup of tea .     sinter seems to have no interest in me or in the project  and i   m certain none of them know about our interest in mentalics .  i wonder what he   s up to .         it   s madness .     wanda said .     the emperor won   t rein him in  and linge chen does nothing .         madness is its own end  and its own reward     hari said softly .  he had followed the popular discontent with sinter   s handling of the sarossan problem .     chen may know what he   s doing  and in the meantime  we have to survive and keep the project on track .          even the seriousness of wanda   s news did not stop hari from being irritated by the intrusion .  if anything  it made the intrusion worse .  he wanted very badly simply to be left alone to think about the tyrants and his interviews .  something important lurked in those memories  though he could not pin it down .  .  . however  he asked wanda to stay for dinner with him  to calm her and see if she knew anything more .   and in the course of their dinner  hari suddenly put the memories and equations together  and had the link he sought .  the link was his vague sensation that he had encountered daneel .  when .  where .  then came the suggestion  and he had little doubt the meeting had occurred  and that daneel had told him something ridiculous and potentially damaging .  .  . about farad sinter .      i   m going to request an audience     hari said to wanda  as they brought out dessert together .  she set the cups of cold pudding on the table and added a coco ice for herself  a taste she had acquired from her father  raych .      with who .     she asked .     sinter .         not him  not yet     hari said .     with the emperor .         he   s a monster  a terrible infant .  grandfather  i won   t allow it .      hari laughed sharply .     dear wanda  i   ve been wandering into the jaws of lions since long before you were born .     he looked at her seriously for a moment  then asked  quietly     why  do you sense something going wrong .      wanda looked away  then turned back to him .     you know why we   ve continued looking for mentalics  grandfather .         yes .  you and stettin have discovered that your abilities wax and wane  for unknown reasons .  you   re looking for a more stable core group whose opposed strengths and weaknesses will cancel each other out and produce a steady influence .         i can   t hear anybody very clearly the past few weeks  grandfather .  i don   t know what could happen to you .  i see nothing .  .  . a blank .           .     vara liso had not slept through the night in years  for fear of what she might hear while asleep or on the edge of sleep .  it was at these times that she could feel her net spread out over her neighborhood like a cloud  and when it came back  reeling itself in as it were  stuck to it were the emotional colors and desires and worries of her fellow humans for kilometers around  like fish she could not help but consume .   when young  this unwanted talent for night fishing had come only once or twice a month  and she had never been sure whether she was simply mad or really could learn what she seemed to learn  from parents and brother  from neighbors  from lovers  the few she had attracted  for there was something spooky about her manner and appearance even then .   now  the net swept wide every single night  and she could no longer absorb what it brought back  nor could she discard the bits and pieces of other people   s lives .  she felt like a strip of insect gathering paper left to hang in a garbage dump .   it was when she had been approached by other mentalics  that was what they called themselves  though she had never given her talent a name  that she realized what she could do might be valuable to some .  and it was when she spent one night in training at streeling university  with other mentalics  that she caught a bit of dream that shook her to her core .   it was a dream of mechanical men .  not tiktoks  those funny little worker machines that had so worried the workers of trantor and other worlds in their heyday  now gone  not tiktoks  but robots who looked like men  who could move unnoticed among men .   and there were even mechanical women  so this dream showed  capable of amazing feats  capable even of murder and of provoking love .   vara liso thought about this dream for weeks before requesting an audience with the emperor .  this half mad request  how could she hope to have an audience with such a lofty personage .   had been answered  and she had met not with the emperor  but with another  his self anointed voice of imperial conscience  imperial councilor farad sinter .   sinter had received her with politeness  a little cool at first  but as she had expanded upon her evidence  he had begun to burrow down with his questions  digging underneath her confusion to find the gems of evidence she herself had missed .  farad sinter had taken a dream fetched raw and alive from anonymous night and given it political authority  a logical weight and structure she herself could not have pieced together in a million years .   in her way  vara liso had come first to respect sinter  then to admire him  and finally to love him .  he was so like her in many ways  sensitive and nervous  tuned to frequencies of thought no others could see .  .  . or so he convinced her .   she wanted to become his lover  but farad sinter convinced her that such physical pursuits were beneath them .  they had loftier intimacies to satisfy them .   so she went this morning to his complex of private rooms in the palace  escorted as always by a frosty pair of female security guards  convinced she was going to deliver to him that which he most sought .  yet vara liso kept something to herself  something that did not fit somehow .      good morning  vara .     sinter greeted .  he sat at a small breakfast table on wheels  still wearing an ornately quilted golden robe  and his small  piercing eyes crinkled with something like amused welcome .     what do you have for me today .         nothing more  farad .     she slumped into a couch in front of him  tired and discouraged .     it   s all so jumbled .  i swear i get so cluttered .      sinter tsk tsked and shook his finger at her .     don   t disparage your particular talent  lovely vara .      her eyes widened with hungry need  which sinter pretended he had not seen .     have you learned who started you on this .  with his dream of mechanical men .         i don   t know whether it was a man or a woman  and no  i still don   t know .  i remember faces of those in the dream  but recognize none of them .  have you caught her .      sinter shook his head .     not yet .  i haven   t given up  though .  any other clues  other candidates .      vara liso blushed slightly and shook her head .  soon enough she would have to reveal how this had all begun  that she had once worked to become part of a group of low level mentalics  much weaker than she  and weaker by far than the young woman she had sensed just two weeks before  whose mind had blazed in the night .  but they had treated her well  and she had kept this back from sinter for two reasons  because quite clearly these people were not robots  and because she had at least some sense of honor and loyalty .  she tried to guide his vision this much  that he would not go off searching for every little petty mental persuader  she was sure he was wrong there  though of course she would not tell him so .   she suspected sinter would not react well to being told he was wrong  even in some small detail .   sinter had sent her to dahl because of an unexplained hunch that there were more candidates there than elsewhere on trantor  and that was where vara liso had tossed and turned one night in a dingy hotel room  gathering in her web  and bringing back the biggest catch ever .   she had hated dahl  with its miasma of resentment and neglect and anger .  she hoped never to return .      i think you   ll have to return and help the specials personally     farad sinter said lightly .     they   re not having much luck .      she stared at him  and tears welled up in her eyes .      oh  vara  so sensitive .  it   s not as bad as all that .  we need you there  to help us find this particular needle in the straw .  if she   s as talented as you say  well .  .  .         i will go if you wish me to     she murmured .     i had hoped you would have enough to go on .         well  we don   t .  i don   t .  i doubt i   ll be given much more time to come up with hard evidence .      she forced herself to brighten  and asked the first question that came into her head .     what will these robots do if they know we know .      sinter   s face stiffened .     that is our greatest danger     he said darkly .  he lowered his gaze for a few seconds .     sometimes i think they will replace us with replicas of ourselves  and we will go on doing everything we have ever done  just as we used to do it .  but without spirit  nothing inside .     he dug for the ancient word that sounded so mysterious and alien when spoken .     no soul .         i don   t understand what that means     vara said .   sinter shook his head briskly .     nor do i  but it would be terrible to lose it .      for a moment  they enjoyed this grisly prospect together  savoring the sense of shared and secret danger .        .        your request to see me is a little odd     the emperor said     considering that linge chen   s commission is putting you on trial for treason next month .     klayus waggled his head from side to side and raised his eyebrows .     don   t you think it   s unseemly for me to agree to a meeting .         very     hari said  hands folded  head bowed .     it bespeaks your independence  highness .         yes  well i   m far more independent than anyone gives me credit for .  in truth  i find the commission convenient  because it does a lot of the uninteresting work of managing little details i care nothing for .  linge chen is wise enough to let me handle my own affairs and projects without interference .  so  why should i be interested in you .  other than your professorial eminence .         i thought you might be interested in the future  highness     hari said .   klayus snorted faintly .     ah  yes  your eternal promise .      hari followed the emperor through a central circular chamber at least twelve meters in diameter and perhaps thirty meters high .  above  all the inhabited star systems of the galaxy rotated across the dome  blinking in order of settlement  tens of millions of them .  hari glanced up and squinted at the immensity of humanity   s reach .  klayus i ignored the display .  his pinched lips and wide  yet somehow vacuous eyes disturbed hari .   klayus pushed open a huge door to his entertainment room .  silently  the door  more like the entrance to a vault  swung on its immense hinges  and insects  green and gold  crawled over the frame .  hari assumed they were projected  but would not have been surprised to discover they were real .      i have very little interest in your future  raven     the emperor said lightly .     i do manage to keep informed .  i won   t stop the trial  and i won   t second guess chen on this .         i refer to your own immediate future  sire     hari said .  i hope daneel   s message was not just a dream  a fancy .  this could turn deadly  if so .   the emperor turned  smiling at this dramatic turn of phrase .     you   re on record as saying the empire is doomed .  that sounds treasonous enough to me .  on this  chen and i agree .         i say trantor will be in ruins within five hundred years .  but i   ve never predicted your future  sire .      the entertainment room was filled with hulking sculptures of giant creatures from around the galaxy  all savagely carnivorous  all caught in poses of attack .  hari regarded them with little appreciation for the artistry .  art had never interested him much  and certainly not the more popular forms  except where he could abstract entertainment trends as indicators for social health .      i   ve had my palm read     klayus said  still smiling     by a number of beautiful women .  they all found it most attractive  and assured me my future was bright .  no assassinations  raven .         you will not be assassinated  sire .         deposed .  exiled to smyrmo .  that   s where they sent my heroic quintuple great grandfather .  smyrmo  hot and dry  where you can   t go outside without protective clothing  where the rooms smell of sulfur and there are only cramped tunnels through the rock fit for vermin .  his memoirs are quite good entertainment  raven .         no  sire .  you will be ridiculed until you lose all stature  then you will be ignored  and linge chen will never even have to defer to you .  he will soon enough declare a people   s democracy and leave you only as a symbol  with declining revenues  until you can no longer even keep up appearances .      the emperor stopped between two gareth lions  the largest carnivores on any mid gravity world  life size  about twenty meters from clawed feet to razor barbed  prehensile snouts .  he leaned on the canted ankle of one .     psychohistory tells you this .         no  sire .  experience and logical deduction  without benefit of psychohistory .  have you ever heard of joranum .      the emperor shrugged .     i don   t think so .  person or place  or perhaps beast .         a man  who wanted to become emperor  and who betrayed his hidden origins by subscribing to an ancient myth .  .  . about robots .         robots .  yes  i believe in them .      hari was taken aback .     not tiktoks  sire  but intelligent machines made in human form .         of course .  i believe they existed once  and that we outgrew them .  put them aside like toys .  the tiktok experiment was simply an anachronism .  we don   t need mechanical workers  much less mechanical intelligences .      hari blinked slowly  and wondered if he had underestimated this young man .     joranum believed      was led to believe  by raych .  he reminded himself      that a robot had infiltrated the palace .  he claimed first minister demerzel was a robot .         ah  yes  i seem to remember something about that .  .  . not that long ago  was it .  though before i was born .         demerzel laughed at him  sire  and joranum   s political movement collapsed under the weight of ridicule .         yes  yes  i remember now .  demerzel resigned and cleon the first filled his shoes with another   s feet .  with your feet .  correct  raven .         yes  sire .         that   s where you acquired the political skills you so ably exercise  isn   t it .         my political skills are minimal  your highness .         i don   t think so  raven .  you   re alive  and yet cleon the first was assassinated by .  .  . a gardener .  .  . who had strong connections to you  correct .         in a way  sire .         still alive  raven .  very savvy indeed  perhaps with your own secret and embarrassing files to reveal at key moments to key players .  do you have a secret file on linge chen  raven .      hari  despite himself  let out a chuckle .  klayus seemed amused by this reaction  rather than affronted .     no  your highness .  chen is politically very well armored .  his personal behavior is above reproach .         isn   t it  now .  who  then .  who will disgrace me and bring me down .         you have an assistant  a member of your privy council  who believes in robots .     this is what daneel wanted me to know .  for a moment  hari felt a chill .  what if daneel no longer existed  or had left trantor  and he was imagining all this .  the strain of the last few months  his constant gnawing grief .  .  .      so .         robots currently existing on trantor .  he is hunting them down and shooting them .  with kinetic weapons .      wanda   s information had nested so well with daneel   s  the link  the gnawing suspicion  had come together .  but hari wanted  desperately needed  to think over his interviews with the tyrants .  something was still missing .      really .     the emperor   s eyes gleamed .     he   s found real robots .         no  sire .  humans .  your subjects .  citizens of trantor  even one offworlder  from helicon  oddly enough  my home world .         how interesting .  i did not know he was hunting for robots .  shall i bring him here and question him  in front of you  raven .         that is of no matter to me  your highness .         i assume you refer to farad sinter .         yes  sire .         shooting and killing subjects .  i did not know that .  well  i doubt that  raven  but if it   s true  i shall stop that part .  .  . but as for hunting down robots  surely that gives him something harmless to do .         linge chen will let out enough wire for sinter to entangle himself thoroughly  then he will turn on the power .  .  . and there will be many sparks  my emperor  as sinter fries .  you might get burned .         ah  i see  chen will remind everybody of the forgotten joranum  and of the disgrace of my allowing such a person to run around killing citizens .     klayus buried his chin in one hand and frowned .     an emperor  killing citizens .  .  . or ignoring their unjust deaths .  very volatile .  highly inflammable .  i see it clearly enough  and it   s not an unlikely outcome .  yes .     the emperor   s expression darkened and his eyes narrowed .     i had plans for tonight  raven .  you   ve spoiled them  i   m afraid .  i doubt this is something i can dispose of in a meeting of a few minutes or less .           no  your highness .         and sinter is in mycogen today  not returning until after dinner .  so you will stay with me  and perhaps give me some advice  then  after  hari  may i call you hari .         i would be honored  your highness .         after  we will celebrate  and i will reward you for your services .      hari showed nothing on his face  but this of all things was the last he wanted to do .  the emperor   s amusements were known to a few  and linge chen kept that number small by careful bribing and not so subtle pressure .  hari did not want to be one of the number chen had to pressure  especially now .  .  .   he had to survive long enough for the trial  and beyond .  to see the foundations established .  .  . one by edict  the other in secret .   but he could not just allow sinter   s odd madness to imperil wanda and stet tin   s future  and the future of all those who might yet go to star   s end .  who had to go .  the equations demanded it .        .     lodovik  after five days alone  had lapsed into the robot equivalent of a coma .  with nothing to do  no way to return to a position of usefulness  and no one to serve  he had no choice but to enter a time of stillness  or face serious damage to his circuits .  in this robotic coma  his thoughts moved very slowly  and he conserved the few remaining mental explorations left to him  in this way he avoided shutting down completely .  complete shutdown could only be reversed by a human or a maintenance robot .   in the slowness of his thoughts  lodovik tried to assess how he had changed .  that he had changed was certain  he could sense the change in key patterns  in diagnostics .  part of the basic character of his positronic brain had been altered by the flux of radiation in the supernova shock front .  and there was something else as well .   the hypership drifted light days away from sarossa  far from any communications that would pass through status geometry  unable to receive hyperwave radio  and yet lodovik was certain that someone  something  had examined him  tinkered with his programs and processes .   from daneel he had heard of the meme entities  beings who encoded their thoughts not in matter  but in the fields and plasmas of the galaxy itself  those intelligences who had occupied the data processors and networks of trantor  who had taken revenge upon some of daneel   s robots before lodovik   s arrival on the capital world of the empire .  they had fled trantor over thirty years ago .  lodovik knew little more about them  daneel had seemed reluctant to spell out details .   perhaps one or more of the meme entities had come to inspect the supernova  or to energize themselves in its violent brilliance .  perhaps they had come across the lost hypership and found only him  and had touched him .   altered him .   lodovik could no longer be certain he was functioning properly .   he slowed his thoughts even further  preparing for a long  cold century until extinction .     tritch and her first mate  trin  regarded mors planch   s activities with some concern .  he had buried himself with several mobile diagnostic machines deep in the hyperdrive  far enough from the active coils of solid helium and the anti queried  posi tunneled meter cubed crystals of sodium chloride  common table salt  to avoid injury  but still    tritch had never allowed any work on a hyperdrive while her ship was actually in transit .  what planch was doing fascinated and frightened her .   tritch and trin watched from the engine gallery  a small weighted balcony that looked down the fifteen meter length of the drive core .  the end of the core was darkness  planch had suspended a light over the place he worked  surrounding him in a pale golden glow .      you should tell us what you   re doing     tritch said nervously .      right now .     planch asked  irritated .      yes  right now .  it would ease my mind .         what do you know about hyperphysics .         only that you pull up the deep roots of all atoms within a ship  twist them widdershins  and plant them in a direction we don   t normally go .      planch laughed .     very impressionistic  dear tritch .  i like it .  but it doesn   t butter any parsnips .         what are parsnips .     trin asked tritch .  she shook her head .      every traveling hypership leaves a permanent track in an obscure realm called mire space  named after konner mire .  he was my teacher  forty years ago .  it   s not studied much anymore  because most hyperships get where they   re going  and the empire   s actuaries believe it   s more trouble than it   s worth to track lost ships  since they   re so few .         one in a hundred million voyages     trin said  as if to reassure herself .   planch poked up from between two long pipes and pushed a mobile diagnostic machine away from the engine  allowing it to float free .     every engine has an extension into mire space while a ship is in transit  which helps the ship avoid becoming random particles .  old techniques which i won   t go into allow me to hook up a monitor to the engine and look at recent trails .  with some luck  we can pick up a trail with a frayed end  like a sawed off rope  and that will be our lost ship .  or rather  the track of its last jump .         frayed end .     tritch asked     an abrupt exit from hyperdrive status leaves a lot of ragged discontinuities  like a frayed end .  a planned exit solves all those discontinuities  smoothes them over .         if it   s so simple  why doesn   t everybody do this .     tritch asked .      because it   s a lost art  i said  remember .      she huffed in disbelief .      you asked     planch said  his voice muffled and hollow in the engine bay .     there   s a one in five chance of screwing it up and throwing us out of hyperspace  scattered over about a third of a light year .         you didn   t mention that     tritch said tightly .      now you know why .      trin swore under her breath and glared accusingly at her captain .   he worked for several more minutes  then poked up again .  trin had left the balcony  but tritch still stood there .      still good for a couple of bottles of trillian  .     he asked her .      if you don   t get us killed     she answered grimly .   he floated away from the cylinders and pushed the diagnostic machines toward the hatchway .     good .  because i think i   ve found her .           .     hari   s legs hurt from standing so long .  klayus had finally stopped describing his beast statues and gone off  and hari had found a divan and sat gingerly  blowing out his breath .   here was his chance to see just how far things had gone to ruin  and how much further the empire had to decay .  he didn   t relish the opportunity  but he had long since learned that the best way to get along in life was to find multiple uses for unpleasant experiences .  he longed to get back to his prime radiant and lose himself in the equations .  people .  so many tiny and yet possibly disastrous disruptions  like being chewed by hungry insects .  .  .   hari turned toward the still open hatchway and tried to see the crawling insects  but the projectors had turned off at klayus   s exit .  when he turned back  a small lavrentian servant  a young male  stood beside him .      the emperor says i shall make you comfortable before your business engagement     the servant said  smiling pleasantly  his round  smooth face like a small lamp in the gloom of the statue room .     are you hungry .  there   s to be an elaborate dinner later this evening  but you should probably eat something now  something light and delicious .  .  . shall i prepare something for you .         yes  please     hari said .  he had eaten palace food often enough not to turn down a chance to have more  and to eat in semiprivacy was a luxury he had not hoped for .     my muscles ache  too .  could i have a masseur sent in .         certainly .     the lavrentian smiled broadly .     my name is koas .  i am assigned to you for your stay .  you   ve been here before  haven   t you .         yes  the last time in the reign of agis xiv     hari said .      i was here then .     koas said .     perhaps i or my parents served you .         perhaps     hari said .     i remember being very well treated  and i   m afraid parts of this evening are not going to be pleasant .  i   m sure you   ll relax me and prepare me for the work to be done .         our pleasure     koas said  and bowed fluidly .     what shall i prepare for you  or do you require a menu .  we will  of course  use only the finest offworld and mycogenian ingredients .         farad sinter is a connoisseur of mycogenian delicacies  is he not .     hari asked .      oh  no  sir     koas said  lips turned down .     he is fond of much simpler fare .     koas did not seem to approve of this .   then he   s in mycogen to force a little information out of them  hari thought .  their myths about robots .  the man may very well be obsessed .   koas did not specialize in bodyworks  so two female servants entered with a suspension couch .  hari lay on the couch and gave in to their skilled ministrations with a grateful sigh  and for a few minutes  at least  was almost glad he had come to the palace and requested his audience with klayus .   the masseuses began work on his legs  smoothing out the corded muscles and somehow removing a pain in his left knee that had been bothering him for weeks .  they then worked on his arms  pushing and prodding with a surprising force  causing a delicious sort of pain that quickly melted into a liquid lassitude .   as they worked  hari thought of the special privileges accorded to leaders and their associates  their families .  there was  of course  the velvet trap of power  sufficient luxuries to attract reasonably competent and competitive individuals to an ungratefully demanding job  in hari   s opinion  of course  cleon i had been remarkably sanguine about being an emperor at times  and even agis had tried to act the part  which had led to his downfall under linge chen   s commission  .   for klayus  there was luxury without much responsibility  that meant endless opportunities for distortions of the personality  which hari had seen so often in history  among figurehead rulers of various systems .  .  .   as the masseuses caressed and pummeled and prodded  he lapsed back into his memories of the meetings with the tyrants .  they had taken place more than a kilometer beneath the hall of justice and the imperial courts  in the rikerian prison  at the center of a labyrinth of precisely controlled security systems .  during his decades on trantor  hari had come to love interior spaces  even small ones  but the rikerian prison had been designed to punish  to flatten the spirit .   he had had nightmares about those tiny confined spaces  on and off  for years after .   in a cell barely tall enough to stand in  with slick hard black walls and two holes in the floor  one for waste and one for food and water  and no chairs  he had interviewed nikolo pas of sterrad  the butcher of fifty billion human beings .   cleon had his bizarre sense of humor  forcing the interview to take place there and not in some neutral meeting area .  perhaps he had wanted hari to understand the man   s current plight  to put things in perspective  perhaps to pity him  at least feel something  and not reduce everything to equations and numbers  as cleon felt was hari   s wont .      i   m sorry i have nothing to offer in the way of hospitality     nikolo had said as they faced each other in the tiny  dim space .  hari had responded with some dismissive pleasantry .   the man before him was more than six centimeters shorter than hari  with pale blond  almost white hair  large dark eyes  a small pug nose  broad lips  and a short chin .  he wore a thin gray shirt and shorts and sandals .     you   ve come to study the monster     nikolo continued .     the guards say you   re the first minister .  surely you   re not here to pick up some political tips .         no     hari said .      to observe cleon   s triumph and the restoration of dignity and order .         no .         i never rebelled against cleon .  i never usurped the emperor   s authority .         i understand .  how do you explain what you did .     hari asked  deciding to jump in with no further preliminaries .     what was your reasoning  your goal .         they tell everybody i butchered billions on four worlds within my system  the system i was chosen to preserve and protect .         that   s what the records tell .  what happened  in your opinion .  and i warn you  i have the accounts from thousands of witnesses and other records at my disposal .         why should i even bother talking with you  then .     nikolo said .      because it   s possible what you say can prevent more butchery  in the future .  an explanation  an understanding  could help us all avoid similar situations .         by killing a monster such as myself at birth .      hari did not answer .      no  i see you   re more subtle than that     nikolo murmured .     by preventing the rise to power of one like myself .         perhaps     hari said .      what do i get out of it .         nothing     hari said .      nothing for nikolo pas .  .  . how about the right to kill myself .         cleon would never allow that     hari said .      just the right to inform cleon   s first minister  to give him more understanding  and therefore more power .  .  .         i suppose you could look at it that way .         not in this hole     nikolo had said .     i   ll talk  but someplace clean and comfortable .  that   s my price .  you wouldn   t put vermin in a hole like this .  and i have ever so much to tell you .  .  . about humans as well as machines  or about machines that seem human .  .  . past as well as future .      hari had listened  trying to keep his face impassive .     i   m not sure i can get clean to          then you   ll learn nothing  hari seldon .  and i see by the look in your eyes .  .  . i   ve touched something that provokes a deep curiosity  haven   t i .        hari twitched on the suspension couch and the masseuse working on his neck softly ordered him to lie still .  why haven   t i remembered this conversation before now .  hari asked himself .  what else has been suppressed .  and why .   then  tension spoiling all the masseuses    work  another question  daneel  what have you done to me .        .     the bodies had been arranged in neat floating rows in the crew lounge  the largest space in the ship  and also the closest space to the emergency hatch amidships .   mors planch backed away from the entrance  wondering for a moment if he had come upon a scene of torture and piracy .  all the bodies were connected by ropes to keep them in place .  tended to  taken care of even in death .  the air in the weightless chamber smelled from the decay of several days .  yet he had to make a count  to see if there was any value in searching elsewhere in the ship .   tritch kept well back from the hatchway .  her red rimmed eyes stood out above the white handkerchief she held over her nose and mouth .     who put them in there .     she asked  voice muffled .      i don   t know     mors said grimly .  he put on a breather mask and entered to make his count .  several minutes later he emerged  his face wan .     nobody alive  but not everybody is in there .     he pushed past her and expertly caromed down the corridor  toward the bridge .  reluctantly  tritch followed  stopping briefly to pass an instruction to trin .      they all died within minutes of each other  i   m guessing     planch told tritch as she caught up with him .     radiation poisoning from the shock front .         the ship is heavily shielded     tritch said .      not against neutrinos .         neutrinos can   t hurt us .  .  . they   re like ghosts .      planch peered into the darkened officer   s lounge  switched on his torch  played it around the furniture and walls  saw nobody .     neutrinos in sufficient numbers are what blew away the outer shells of the supernova     he said tightly .     under such conditions  in such hordes  they can play strange and deadly tricks with matter  particularly with people   s bodies .  smell the ship .         i smell the dead  back there     tritch said .      no .  smell the ship here .  what do you smell .      she took the handkerchief away from her nose and sniffed .     something burnt .  not flesh .         right     planch said .     it   s not a common smell  and i   ve only experienced it once before .  .  . in a ship caught in a neutrino surge  but not from a supernova .  from a planet being broken up and swallowed by a wormhole .  one of the transit station disasters  thirty years ago .  the ship was caught in the emerging jet of converted mass .  i investigated  part of a salvage crew .  everybody aboard was dead .  the ship smelled scorched  like this .  .  . burnt metal .         pleasant work     tritch said  putting the cloth back to her nose .   the hatch to the bridge was open .  planch held out his arm to keep tritch back .  she did not argue .  the bridge was illuminated only by starlight from the open direct view ports .  he turned his torch on and shined it on the panels  the captain   s chair  the displays .  the displays were all blank .  the ship was dead .      we won   t have much air soon     he told tritch .     keep your crew back .         i already have     tritch said .     i don   t want to stay here any longer than i have to .  we can   t salvage anything if the ship can   t be revived .         no     planch said .  the bridge seemed empty  and cold enough to make his breath cloudy .  he pushed in farther  flailing briefly against the cold stale air with one hand until he caught a stanchion and rotated .  from that vantage  he aimed his beam into the opposite corner .  there  he saw a form curled into a fetal ball .   he pulled himself along until he floated a meter from the form .  what he had been told was true  this one was alive .  the head turned  and he recognized the features of councilor lodovik trema .  but it was not chief commissioner chen who had told him trema would be alive .   when they had first sighted the hulk in deep space  drifting helplessly  he had communicated first with chen  then with another  who had paid him even more handsomely than chen  the tall man who had many faces and many names  and who had hired him so often before .   that man was never wrong  and he had not been wrong this time .  where all others might be dead  one might still be alive .  .  . and he must not be returned to chen .  he must be reported dead .   lodovik trema blinked slowly  calmly  at planch .  planch held his fingers to his lips  and whispered     you   re still dead  sir .  don   t move or make a sound .     then he spoke a coded phrase incorporating both numbers and words that the man of many faces had told him to use .   tritch watched them from across the bridge .     what did you find .     she asked .      the man i   m looking for     planch said .     he lived a little longer .  he must have arranged the others  then come here to die .      as he brought out lodovik  tritch tried to back away  but could not find a grip fast enough .  the body  curled and lifeless  floated ahead of planch  under tritch   s nose  and she nearly gagged with some reflex expectation .      don   t worry     planch said .     this one doesn   t smell much .  it   s colder on the bridge .        tritch could not believe they had come all this way just to retrieve a single body .  back aboard the flower of evil  with lodovik safely stowed in a box in the hold  she passed planch a bottle of trillian water of life  and he poured himself a glass and lifted it in cheerless toast .      the chief commissioner wanted to make sure .  and now that we know he   s dead  and all the others with him  i   m to take him back to his home world and see him decently buried  with full imperial honors .         and leave all the others .  that seems a little bizarre .      planch shrugged .     i don   t question my orders .         which world is he from .         madder loss     planch replied .   tritch shook her head in disbelief .     a man in such high authority  from a planet of disgraced parasites .      planch inspected his glass and lifted one finger before finishing its contents .  then he poked glass and finger at tritch .     i remind you of our contract     he said .     the death of this man could have political repercussions .         i don   t even know his name .         people could guess from what little you do know  if you spread it around in the wrong places .  and if you do  i   ll find out .         i keep my contracts  and i keep my mouth shut .         and your crew .         you must have known we were trustworthy when you hired us     tritch said softly  dangerously .      yes  well it   s even more important now .      tritch stood and lifted the bottle from the table between them .  she corked it firmly .     you   ve insulted me  mors planch .         an excess of caution  no insult intended .         nevertheless  an insult .  and you ask me to go to a world that no self respecting citizen willingly visits .         they   re citizens on madder loss  too .      she closed her eyes and shook her head .     how long do we stay .         not long .  you drop me there and leave at your own pleasure .      tritch was finding this harder and harder to believe .     i will ask no more questions     she said  and tucked the bottle under her arm .  apparently planch was no longer so attractive to her  and henceforth their relationship would be strictly professional .   planch regretted this  but only slightly .   when he delivered lodovik trema to madder loss  he would be a very wealthy man  and he would never have to work for anyone again .  he imagined buying his own luxury vessel  one that he could keep in tip top condition  which was more than could be said for most imperial ships .   as for the strange and tightly disciplined man in the hold  a man who could stay enclosed in a coffin for days without complaint or need .  .  .   the less he thought about that  the better .     lodovik lay in the darkness  fully alert but quiescent  having heard the coded phrase that alerted him to daneel   s participation in his rescue .  he was to cooperate fully with mors planch  eventually  he would be brought back to trantor .   what would happen to him there  lodovik did not know .  having performed three self checks in the coffin shaped box  he was reasonably certain that his positronic brain had been altered in subtle ways .  the results of his self checks were contradictory  however .   to keep himself from deteriorating through disuse  he activated his human emotional overlay and ran diagnostics on that  as well .  it seemed intact  he could operate as a human in human society  and that provided some relief .  however  the contact with mors planch on the bridge of the spear of glory had been too brief for him to try out these functions .  best to be kept isolated until a more thorough test could be performed .   above all  he must not reveal himself to be a robot .  for all the robots in daneel   s cadres  this was of paramount importance .  it was essential that humans never learn the extent to which robots had infiltrated their societies .   lodovik put his human overlay into the background and began a complete memory check .  to do so  he had to shut down his control of external motion for twenty seconds .  he could still see and hear  however .   it was at this moment that something bumped against the box .  he heard fumbling outside  then the sound of metal scraping against metal .  the seconds ticked by .  .  . five  seven  ten .  .  .   the lid of the box was pried open with a metallic groan .  with his head turned to one side  half facing the wall of the box  he could only gather a blurry glimpse of one face peering in  and a fleeting impression of one other .  eighteen seconds .  .  . the memory check was almost complete .      he certainly looks dead .     a woman   s voice .   the memory check ended  but he decided to remain still .      his eyes are open .     a male voice  not that of mors planch .      turn him over and look for identification     the woman said .      sky  no .  you do it .  it   s your bounty .      the woman hesitated .     his skin is pink .         radiation burns .         no  he looks healthy .         he   s dead     the man said .     he   s been in this box for a day and a half .  no air .         he just doesn   t look like a corpse .     she reached in and pinched the tissue of his exposed hand .     cool  but not cold .      lodovik blanched his skin slowly  and dropped his external temperature to match the ambient .  he felt inefficient and incompetent for not having done that earlier .      he looks pale enough to me     the man remarked .  another hand touched his skin .     he   s cold as ice .  you   re imagining things .         dead or whatever he may be  he   s worth a fortune     the woman said .      i know mors planch by reputation  trin     the man said .     he won   t just hand his prize over to you .      lodovik  on his conveyance into the rescue ship  had heard the name    trin    applied to a woman he gathered was second in command to the captain  tritch .  this could be a very serious situation .      take his picture     trin said .     i   ll get a message out this sleep and we   ll learn if he   s the one they want .      a camera was lifted over the box and silently recorded his image .  lodovik tried to model all the possible causes for this behavior  all the scenarios and their potential outcomes .      besides  tritch has given her word to planch     the man continued .     she   s known to be honorable .         if we succeed  we   ll make ten times what planch is paying tritch     trin said tightly .     we could buy our own ship and become free traders on the periphery .  never have to deal with imperial taxes or inspections again .  maybe even go to work in a free system .         pretty rough territories  i hear     the man said .     freedom is always dangerous     trin said .     all right .  we   re here .  we   ve broken the seals on the box .  we   re committed .  make an incision in his scalp and let   s get what we came for .      the man withdrew what sounded like a scalpel from his pocket .  lodovik activated his eyes and watched them in the dim light of the hold .  the man swore under his breath and brought the scalpel down .   lodovik could not allow himself to be cut .  he would bleed from any superficial wound  but even an untrained eye would see that he was not human if the scalpel cut deep .  lodovik quickly calculated all the pluses and minuses of any particular action he might take  and arrived at the optimal  based on what he knew .   his arm shot up from the box .  his hand wrapped around the wrist of the man with the scalpel .     hello     lodovik said  and rose to a sitting position .   the man seemed to have a fit .  he jerked and shrieked and tried to pull his hand away  then shrieked again .  his eyes rolled up to show nothing but white and foam appeared on his lips .  for several seconds he twitched in lodovik   s grasp  as lodovik appraised the situation from his new perspective .   trin backed toward the hatchway .  she looked terrified  but not as terrified as the man in his grip .  lodovik judged the man   s condition and carefully removed the scalpel from his fingers  then released him .  the man clutched his shoulder and gasped  his face turning a medically questionable pale green .      trin     the man groaned  twisting toward her .  then he collapsed .  lodovik climbed from the box and bent to examine him .  the woman near the hatch seemed transfixed .      your friend is suffering a heart attack     lodovik said  glancing at her .     do you have a doctor or medical appliances on this ship .      the first mate gave a small  birdlike cry and fled .        .     klia asgar approached her contact in fleshplay  a tough though popular family and labor resort on the outskirts of dahl  near the entertainment sector of little kalgan .  here  acts and rides from little kalgan itself were tried on very tough customers before they were exported around trantor .   fleshplay was full of brilliantly illuminated signs climbing up the walls of buildings almost to the ceil of the dome  announcing new shows and performance teams  old favorites revived in the stardust theater  popular beverages  stimulk  even outlaw stims from offworld .  klia glanced at the pouring cascades of projected beverages with a dry and thirsty appreciation .   she had been standing in a store alcove for twenty minutes waiting for her contact  not daring to abandon her position even for the time it might take to get a drink at a nearby street vendor stall .   klia watched the crowds with more than just her eyes  and saw them in more than just surface detail .  on the surface  all seemed well enough .  men  women  and children at this evening hour strolled by in what passed for leisure time dress in dahl  white blouses and black culottes with red stripes around the waist for the women  pink jumpsuits for prepubescent children  a more rakish cut of black worksuit for the men .  a more than cursory examination showed the strain  however .   these were the higher citizen classes in dahl  the more fortunate day shift and managerial workers  functionally the equivalent of the omnipresent gray clad bureaucrats in other sectors  yet there was a grimness in their faces when they weren   t actively responding to banter or forcing smiles .  their eyes seemed tired  a little glazed  from months of disappointment and extensive layoffs .  klia could read the colors of their internal moods as well  caught in brief flashes  since she was otherwise occupied  angry purples and bilious green murmurings hidden within the deep holes of their minds  not auras  but pits into which she could glimpse only from certain mental perspectives .   nothing extraordinary in all this  klia knew what the mood of dahl was  and tried to ignore it as often as possible .  full immersion would not just distract her  but could even infect .  she had to remain isolated from the general herd to keep her edge .   she recognized the boy as soon as he walked into view across the street .  he was perhaps a year older than she  shorter and squat  with a pinched face marked by several small scars on his cheek and chin  gang marks from billibotton   s tougher streets .  she had delivered goods and information to him several times in the last year  when better courier jobs were not to be had .  now  she realized she might be seeing even more of him  and she did not like it one bit .  he was tough to convince .  .  .   good jobs had become almost impossible to find in the past few days .  klia was known to be marked  few trusted her .  her income had plummeted almost to nothing  and worse still  she had narrowly escaped being captured by a gang of thugs whose leader she had never seen before .  there were new folks in town  with new allegiances  providing new dangers .   klia still had confidence in her ability to worm her way out of any tight situation  but the effort was exhausting her .  she longed for a quiet place with friends  but she had few friends  none willing to take her in the way things were .   it was enough to make her rethink her whole philosophy of life .   the pinch faced boy caught sight of klia when she wanted to be seen  then went through a deliberate masquerade of casually ignoring her .  she did the same  but edged closer  looking around as if waiting for somebody else .   when they were within earshot  the boy said     we   re not interested in what you   re carrying today .  why don   t you just slink out of dahl and plague someone else .      brusqueness and even rudeness meant little  she was so used to them .     we have a contract     klia said casually .     i deliver  you pay .  my day boss won   t take it well if you          word here is your day boss is in the sinks     the boy said  staring at her boldly .     and so   s every other day or night boss who used you .  even kindril nashak .  word is he   s been threatened with rikerian  held with no charges .  a free warning  girlie .  no more .      the noose was closing .     what do i do with this .     klia asked  lifting the thin box under her arm .      i take nothing and pay nothing  that   s the word .  now slink .      klia glanced at him for less than a second .  the boy shook his head as if touched by a buzzing insect  then looked right through her .  he would not report having seen her .   if everybody wanted her to vanish  and there was no longer any work or reason to stay  it really was time to vanish .  the thought scared her  she had never been outside dab .  for more than a few hours .  she had less than two weeks    living in credits  a lot of those black market exchanges good only for local merchants  who might shun her business now anyway .   klia walked up the street to a less prosperous neighborhood  known euphemistically as softer fleshplay  and ducked through a fractured plastic front into an abandoned food stall .  there  among scattered old wrappers and broken sticks of furniture  she cut the security seal on her package and opened it  to see if it contained anything valuable outside dahl .   papers and a bookfilm .  she leafed through them and examined the seal on the bookfilm  personal stuff  in code  nothing she could decipher or sell anywhere .  she had known that before she opened the package .  she was handling only cut rate deliveries anyway  often enough backup deliveries  information too tricky to risk being sent where security eyes could intercept it  yet not so tricky anyone wanted to pay large sums for better couriers .  .  .   and once she had been the very best of couriers  one of the highest paid in dahl  inheritor of a tradition thousands of years old  as convoluted and ornate with language and ritual as any religious commerce off trantor .  sometimes  even official and public papers were handed to the dahlite couriers by legitimate day bosses  just to ensure faster delivery now that other communications systems were so often stalled or subject to surveillance by the commission .   for her  it had all come to nothing  in just a few days .   with a jerk  she realized she was crying  silently  but nevertheless crying .   she wiped her face and blew her nose on a reasonably clean if dusty wrapper  dropped the package in the litter  and took to the street again .   once outside  she crossed the street and waited for a few minutes .  soon enough klia saw her tail  the one she expected would be after her if the delivery failed .  it was a small  thin girl only a few years younger than she  pretending to play in the streets  dressed in a scaled down version of a black heatsink work jumper .  klia was too far away to exert any persuasion  or learn anything  but she did not need to .   the girl darted into the abandoned stall and emerged a few seconds later with the shredded wrappings and contents of the package .   klia had tailed couriers at the very beginning  sometimes cleaning up after failed deliveries .  now  it was being done to her .  this was the last slap in the face  the final insult .   the street traffic was increasing .  with the darkening ceil  the lights on the marquees above the streets would become brighter and more frantic  the crowds would jam shoulder to shoulder  looking for a moment   s relief from dreary lives .  for a hunted person  such a crush could be fatal .  anything could happen in a crowd  and she would be hard pressed to persuade  hide  make the masses forget  or even just get away quickly  she might be found and killed .   she thought of the man in dusty green .  the memory of him did not make her scalp itch  but she would have to fall much lower before she gave up her independence and actually joined a movement  even if they claimed to be like her .  .  .   perhaps especially if they were like her .  the thought of being among people who could do what she did  suddenly  everyone around her made her scalp itch .  with a moan  she pushed through the roiling crowds  looking for the entrance to a plunger  the large  ancient elevators that worked the levels in dahl and most of the other sectors of trantor .     vara liso  exhausted and haggard  begged the stolid young major by her side to let her rest .     i   ve been here for hours     she groaned .  her head ached  her clothes were drenched in sweat  her vision blurred .   major namm plucked at his imperial insignia absently  chewing on his lower lip .  vara focused on him with a hatred she had seldom felt before  but she dared not hurt him .      nobody .     he asked in a gruff tone .      i   ve found nobody for the last three days     she said .     you   ve scared them all away .      he stepped back from the edge of the balcony overlooking the crowded trans dahl thoroughfare through fleshplay .  throngs on foot passed below the balcony  while trains and robos on elevated rails and narrow slaveways rumbled a few meters above them  rattling the empty apartment .  vara had been surveying the crowds from that location for seven hours  dark was falling quickly and the bright street signs across the thoroughfare were beginning to give her a headache .  she simply wanted to sleep .      councilor sinter would appreciate some results     the young man said .      farad must have some concern for my health .     vara shot back .     if i become ill or burn myself out  what will he do then .  i   m all the ammunition he has in this little war of his .     her tone surprised her .  she was close to the limits of her endurance .  but rather than keep the focus on farad   s need for her  she pushed the onus onto the major .     if you   re responsible for my effectiveness being reduced .  .  . what will councilor sinter say then .      the young man considered this possibility with little apparent emotion .     you   re the one who has to answer to him .  i   m just here to watch over you .      vara liso held back a sharp bolt of anger .  how close they come .  they don   t even know .      well  take me to a place where i can rest     she demanded sharply .     she   s not here .  i don   t know where she is .  i haven   t sensed her for three days .         councilor sinter is especially concerned that you should find her .  you told us she was the strongest          other than me .     vara shouted .     but i haven   t felt her .      the blond major seemed to get it through his head that she wasn   t going to work anymore today .      the councilor will be disappointed     he said  then bit his lower lip again .   is everybody here an idiot .  vara raged inwardly  but realized anger  letting her exhaustion control her  would get her nowhere  and could even harm her chances of getting what she wanted from sinter .     i need to be alone for a while  rest  not talk     she said hoarsely .     we can try again tomorrow  in another sector .  i need a smaller area to work in  a few blocks at most .  we need more agents and better reports .         of course     the major said  matching her tone with a more reasonable approach of his own .     our intelligence has been a little weak .  we   ll try it again tomorrow .         thank you     she said softly .  the major walked through the empty apartment and stood by the door  holding it open for her .  she was almost through the door when a sharp spike of what she could only call envy shot through her  the sudden awareness she was close to a fellow human with talents like her own .  her face went white  and she stammered     n n not yet .  she   s here .         where .     the major demanded  pushing her back to the window .      yes  yes  yes     vara muttered as he propelled her .  they treat me like a despicable runt .  but the excitement of the chase was strong .  she pointed a trembling finger and wiped her lips with the back of her other hand .     down there .  she   s close .      the agent peered down into the crowd  following the line of the small woman   s finger .  he saw a female figure  swift and almost colorless  dart through the crowds toward the entrance of a plunger .   immediately  he used his comm to alert other agents on the street below .      you   re sure .     he demanded of vara  but she could only point and rub her lips  the sensation was so great .  she had to work hard to keep from trembling .  she hated this sensation  had come to know it whenever she was around the others in wanda and stet tin   s group  but never as strongly as this .  envy like an ache in her chest  as if this girl could steal everything in life from her and leave only empty expectations and endless disappointment .      her .     she said .     get her  please .        something made klia   s scalp feel as if it were on fire  and she cried out as she darted into the plunger cab .  two older men with heavy black and gray mustaches looked at her with mild concern .   klia could not see over their shoulders .  she jumped and caught a glimpse of two square featured men running as fast as they could toward the open plunger doors .  the doors started to close  the agents shouted for it to stop  and even flashed code blinkers to take control of the mechanism .   klia dug into her pocket and produced a maintenance key  illegal but standard issue for couriers .  the elevator doors hesitated  then stopped .  she plunged her key into the control panel and shouted     emergency .  down now .      the doors resumed closing .  the two men could not make it and pounded on the outside  shouting for her to stop .   the older males gave her a wide berth .     where would you like to get off .     she asked breathlessly  smiling .      the next level  please     one of them said .     fine .     she gave the plunger its instructions  then made the older males forget they had seen her or experienced anything out of the ordinary .   they stepped out onto the next level  and she quickly ordered the doors to close again .  with a sigh  she leaned against the dirt smeared wall .  a scratchy mechanical voice said     emergency instructions .  which maintenance level .      she reached out with all her strength and found spots of trouble for many levels above and below .  her scalp still hurt .  she had to get out of range of the teams sent to find her .  there was only one likely direction  down .      bottom     she answered .     zero .      four kilometers beneath all the occupied levels    the suburban rivers .        .     tritch met mors planch in neutral territory  far from the hold but aft of the crew quarters  in a weightless service hallway .  if she had hoped to have him at a disadvantage in weightless conditions  she had hoped in vain  planch was as much at home weightless as in standard gravitation .      your corpse has some remarkable talents     she said as planch pushed into view around the curve of the bulkhead .      your crew suffers some remarkable ethical lapses     planch replied .   tritch shrugged .     ambition is a constant curse these days .  i found gela andanch outside the hold  in very bad condition .  he   s stable now in the infirmary .      planch nodded  lodovik had not heard the man   s name  and had just happened to run into planch while carrying the limp body forward .  planch had taken andanch and told lodovik to return to the hold .  presumably  he was still there .      what were they looking for .         someone paid them off     tritch said lightly .     i presume it was someone opposed to the party or parties paying you .  if they delivered lodovik trema  they   d each get fifty times what i pay them in a standard year .  that   s a lot of money  even for imperial corruption .         what are you going to do with them .     planch asked .      i presume they would have taken the ship and put us out of action  maybe killed us .  trin is in my cabin now  drinking heavily  and not trillian  either .  when she   s drunk enough  i might just toss her out of the hold over trantor  and hope she burns up over the palace .     tritch   s eyelids fluttered slightly  and her lips grew tight .     she was a good first mate .  my problem now is  what should i do with you .         i haven   t betrayed you     planch said .      and you haven   t told me the truth .  whatever lodovik trema is  he isn   t human .  trin is babbling about simulacra  robots .  whoever paid her off told her she   d be looking for mechanical men .  what do you know about robots .         he   s not a robot     planch said with a shake of his head and a smile .     nobody makes robots anymore .         in our nightmares     tritch said .     class b filmbooks .  tiktoks with mutated brains bent on mindless revenge .  but lodovik trema .  .  . first councilor to the chief commissioner of public safety .         it   s nonsense     planch said shortly  as if this entire conversation was beneath his dignity .      i looked it up  mors .     tritch   s face suddenly became sad  assuming a kind of limpness away from the draw of gravitation .     you were right .  neutrinos in sufficient numbers are deadly .  and there   s no shielding against neutrino flux .         he   s dying     planch lied .     his condition in any case has to be kept secret .      tritch shook her head .     i don   t believe you .  but i   m going to keep my word and drop you on madder loss .     she mused for a moment .     maybe i   ll drop trin and andanch there with you  let you all work things out .  now go confer with your dead minister .      she turned and headed forward .      what about getting back into my cabin .     planch said .      i   ll send food and a cot back to the hold .  if i let someone who consorts with a living corpse go forward  i   d have a mutiny on my hands .  we   ll be at madder loss in a day and a half .      planch shuddered as she passed out of sight .  he  too  didn   t like associating with lodovik trema .  tritch was perfectly correct .   nobody aboard the arrow of destiny could have survived .  nobody human .     lodovik stood in the hold beside his box  hands folded  waiting for planch to return .  by his actions  lodovik had apparently brought severe harm to a human being  and yet the expected difficulties of such a situation  decrease in mental frequency  critical reexamination  and under extreme circumstances  even complete shut down  did not affect him much  if at all .  even allowing for the extended nature of his long term mission for daneel  and under the provisions of the zeroth law  there should have been deeply uncomfortable repercussions .   yet there were none to speak of .  lodovik felt calm and fully functional .  he did not feel contented  he had caused damage and was aware of that  quite clearly  but he experienced nothing like the near paralyzing realization of having broken one of the calvinian three laws .   clearly  something within him had changed .  he was trying to track down what that might be when planch returned .      we   re stuck back here for the duration     planch said matter of factly .     i had a very nice cabin  too .  and the captain and i were .  .  .     he shook his head sadly  then his features sharpened .     never mind .  something is very wrong with this whole scenario .         what might that be .     lodovik asked .  he stretched and smiled .  the human persona slid smoothly over all his other functions .     the box was cramped  but i   ve spent time in worse conditions .  i emerged at the wrong moment  i suppose .         no supposing about it .  the man suffered a heart attack .         i   m very sorry .  but they were up to no good  i   m afraid .         someone else wants you  alive or dead     planch said .     i thought the chief commissioner of public safety was pretty much unassailable .  invincible .         nobody is invincible in this forsaken time     lodovik said .     i apologize for causing you difficulties .      planch stared hard at lodovik .     up until now i   ve ignored all my misapprehensions about this mission  about you .  in imperial politics  anything can happen  individuals can be worth entire solar systems .  that   s how centralized politics works .         surely you   re not a diffusionist  mors planch .         no .  there   s no money and not much life in being a traitor to linge chen .         you mean  to the emperor .      planch did not correct himself .     my curiosity has been piqued to dangerous levels  however .  curiosity is like neutrino flux  it can penetrate anything  and in sufficient quantity  it can kill .  i   m aware of that .  .  . but my curiosity about you .  .  .     he clamped his jaw shut and looked away .      i   m a middle aged man with extraordinary good fortune  let   s leave it at that     lodovik said  making a wry face .     there are things neither you nor i can be told .  .  . and we would be best served by keeping our curiosities in check .  yes  i should be dead .  i know that better than anybody .  the reason i am not dead  however  has nothing to do with extraordinary superstitions about .  .  . what was it .  .  . robots .  you can rest assured on that point .  mors planch .         this isn   t the first i   ve heard about robots  you know     planch said .     murmurs about artificial humans sweep the worlds from time to time  like a dusty breeze .  thirty five years ago  there was a massacre in a seventh octant system .  four planets were involved  quite prosperous worlds  united by a proud common culture  shaping up to be a real force in imperial economics .         i remember     lodovik said .     the ruler claimed he had positive proof that robots had infiltrated to the highest levels  and were fomenting rebellion .  very sad .         billions died     mors planch said .   lodovik said     i presume you will be paid well for your heroic rescue .      planch   s face went slack .     that   s the trouble with this whole situation     he said .     the captain and crew don   t like us .  honor is a sometimes thing with these people  and i should know .  .  . it   s the same with my people  ancestral traits as it were .  they   ll take us where we want to go  but there   s always a chance they   ll talk out of turn in a spaceport somewhere .  .  . and there   s nothing i can do about that .  but it   s all incredible enough  i suppose nobody will believe .  i wouldn   t myself .      i   ve told linge chen you   re dead .  the rescue failed .      lodovik drew his head back  pressing his chin into double folds of flesh .     and we go to madder loss .      planch nodded .  a look of sadness crossed his face  but he said no more .        .     linge chen was preparing for the informal dinner party at the emperor   s private quarters when kreen brought him the sealed message from planch .  in the green oceanic depths of his meditation and personal room  he put aside the straight razor and soap he was using to shave  took a deep breath as kreen departed  and placed his thumb on the small gray parcel .  the first seal  applied by the receiver and decoder  came open at this touch  confirming his unique identity through microanalysis of his skin chemistry  as well as the pattern of his thumbprint .  the second seal  within the disk   s message itself  he opened through a few words spoken in his voice  known only to himself .  the message flowered before him .   mors planch stood within a ship  the background in soft focus for the moment  and said in low tones     my lord chief commissioner chen  i am within the spear of glory  . the ship i have hired is the only one to have found the vessel so far  and i anticipate with some personal concern your deep disappointment at the news i bring .  your councilor is dead  along with the rest of the crew .  .  .      linge chen   s lips worked as he played back the rest of the message .  planch showed the grim details  the rows of bodies arranged within one chamber  the discovery of the body of lodovik trema on the bridge  curled and still .  planch confirmed trema   s identity by placing the commissioner   s own identifier on trema   s bracelet .   linge chen shut off the message before it could reveal the unnecessary details of what planch would do next .  the body would not be retrieved  the vessel   s discovery would be forgotten .  linge chen did not wish to be accused of favoritism or extravagance  not at this time  when he was hoping to bring down farad sinter on the same charge .   for a moment  he felt like a small boy .  he had been so convinced that lodovik trema moved on a different and superior plane to the rest of humanity .  he could never admit it to himself  much less any other  but he had trusted as well as admired trema .  his personal instincts  which had proved almost infallible  had told him that trema would never betray him  never do anything not in linge chen   s best interests .  he had even invited trema to join his family on special occasions  the only councilor  or commissioner  for that matter  he had ever invited to do so .   lodovik trema had been a steady and pleasant presence on those occasions  playing solemnly and with his own kind of innocence with linge chen   s children  extravagantly complimenting their mothers on their cooking  which was adequate at best .  and lodovik   s advice .  .  .   lodovik trema had never given chen bad advice .  they had risen together to this supreme pinnacle of responsibility over twenty five years of  at first  inglorious and often painful service .  they had weathered the end of agis   s reign and the first years of the junta  and lodovik had proven invaluable in designing the commission of public safety to moderate and eventually replace the junta   s military rulers .   ten minutes passed .  kreen knocked gently on the door to the chamber .     yes     chen said .     i   m almost done .      he picked up the razor and finished shaving his fine beard  leaving smooth  pallid skin behind .  then  as a measure of his emotion  he cut two small slices in his skin just in front of his left ear .  blood welled over the hairs and he patted it with a white towel  then dropped the towel into an incinerator  offering his own blood to the powers that be  unspecified .   in his youth in the imperial education municipality of runim  he had learned such rituals as part of the path to adulthood  following the rules of tua chen .  tua chen had been the most successful product of the secret plan among orthodox ruellians to develop a select breed of imperial administrators and bureaucrats  four thousand years before  known as the shining lights .  in his late maturity  tua chen had devised two books of rules  based on ruellian principles  one for the training of aristocratic administrators  and occasionally an emperor   the other for the training of the empire   s hundreds of billions of bureaucrats  the greys .   linge chen was reputedly a direct descendant of tua chen .   the shining light school in its modern form was rife with superstition and almost useless  but in its heyday it had trained administrators that were sent to the far corners of the empire .  and in return  from allover the empire  each year  millions of candidate greys came to trantor to receive the tua chen training .  the best assumed positions in the planet   s infinitely layered bureaucracy  competing with the entrenched and resentful trantor greys  the rest  having completed their pilgrimage  returned to their homes  or took positions on frontier worlds .   linge chen was the most successful of all the students to come out of the school  and he had not succeeded by being overly observant of those damnably persuasive secret rituals .  but for lodovik trema .  .  .   it was the very least he could do .      sire .  .  .     kreen said .  with some concern  he observed his master   s small wounds  but he knew enough to say nothing .      i   m done .  bring me my robe for imperial presence  and also the sash of black .         what shall i place on the sash  sire .         the name of lodovik .      kreen   s face fell in anguish .     no hope  sire .      linge chen shook his head abruptly and pushed past his small servant  into the wardrobe .  kreen stood very still in the lavatory for a few seconds  his grief genuine .  lodovik had always given kreen the impression that the small lavrentian was the equal of anybody within their acquaintance .  kreen treasured that evaluation  even though it had never been spoken .   then  with a jerk  he roused himself and followed his master .        .     the private dining room was crowded with palace staff  making last minute arrangements .  hari looked up at the huge chandelier with its ten thousand gleaming round glass ornaments modeled after the emperor   s chosen worlds of the galactic year  then around the hundred meter long hall  with its solid prime opal matrix columns and the famous deep green copperstone staircase  imported from the only system yet settled in the greater magellanic cloud  a failed colony  abandoned forty years ago  leaving only this gift as a reminder .  his lips twitched at the sight of the staircase .  as first minister  he had cut off imperial support for that vigorous world  lest it grow independent and too powerful .  .  .   so many things done to preserve the center  so many necessary sins of power .  he had made sure that no more far flung colonies were established  and none had been .   the table was set with thirty plates along its midriff  and thirty high backed ebon chairs  none yet occupied  for the guests had not yet arrived and  of course  the emperor himself had not yet been seated .   klayus i escorted hari around the hall as if he were an honored guest rather than a last minute annoyance .        raven     i   ve been calling you that  haven   t i .  do you mind .     raven    seldon  such an evocative title .  harbinger of doom .         call me what you wish  highness .         a tough moniker to lift properly     klayus said with a smile .  hari  never one to miss feminine beauty  caught sight of three dazzling women in the corner of his eye and automatically turned to face them .  the women brushed past him as if he were a statue and approached the emperor  seeming to work as a team .  as they surrounded him and two leaned to whisper in his ears  klayus   s face reddened and he practically giggled with glee .     my extraordinary trio .     he greeted them  after listening for a few seconds .     hari  you would not believe how accomplished these women are  or what they can do .  they   ve entertained at my dinners before .      the women looked at hari as one now  with mild interest  but they read the emperor   s attitude toward this old man with quick  deadly accuracy .  hari was not a powerful figure to be attracted to  merely a toy  less even than themselves .  hari thought that if they had suddenly grown fangs and spouted hair on their noses  they could not have become less attractive so quickly .  with wisdom born more out of his long life and from many conversations on human nature with dors than any equation  he quickly imagined their expert blandishments  warm skin  dulcet voices  masking primordial ammonia ice .  dors had frequently made wry observations of that human sex after which she was modeled  and she had seldom been wrong .   klayus dismissed the women with a few soft words .  as they departed  they strolled around the hall  and he bent over to confide to hari     they don   t impress you  do they .  their kind make up a large portion of the women here .  beautiful as frozen moons .  my privy councilor manages to search out others of higher quality  but .  .  .  .     he sighed .     fine stones are easier to procure than gems among females  for a man in my position .         it was so with cleon  as well  highness     hari said .     he made arrangements with three princess consorts throughout his youth  then  in his middle years  foreswore women entirely .  he died without an heir  as you know .         i   ve studied clean  of course     the emperor said thoughtfully .     a solid man  not intelligent  but very capable .  he liked you  didn   t he .         i doubt any emperor has ever liked a man such as myself  highness .         oh  don   t be so modest .  you have great charms  really .  you were married to that remarkable woman          dors venabili     said a reedy voice behind them .   the emperor turned gracefully  his robes swishing over the floor  and his face lit up .     farad .  how nice of you to come early .      the privy councilor bowed to his emperor and glanced in passing at hari .     when i heard of your visitor  i could not resist  highness .         you know my privy councilor  farad sinter  and farad  this is the famous hari seldon .         we   ve never met     hari said .  no one shook hands in the emperor   s company  too many weapons had been transferred between conspirators and assassins in past centuries that way for a simple handshake to be any other than a gross and even dangerous breach of etiquette .      i   ve heard much about your famous wife     sinter said with a smile .     a remarkable woman  as the emperor says .         hari has come here to warn me about your activities     klayus said with a small grin  glancing between them .     i did not know all you   ve been up to  farad .         we   ve discussed my goals  highness .  what more does professor seldon have to add  in the way of information .         he says you   re hunting down mechanical men .  robots .  from what he says  you appear to be obsessed with them .      hari stiffened .  this was becoming a very dangerous situation  and he was beginning to feel a noose tighten .  he almost regretted having taken this direct approach with someone so devious and unpredictable as klayus .  it would not be at all good to be singled out and marked for reprisal by farad sinter .  .  .      he   s confused my goals  though perhaps the rumors have misled him .  there are many false rumors about our activities  highness .     sinter   s smile dripped honey and bonhomie .      this genetic study .  .  . most valuable  don   t you think  hari .  has anyone explained it to you .         system wide  and also the twelve nearest central stars     sinter said .      it has been explained in the journals of imperial science     hari said .      but shooting people .      klayus continued .     why  farad .  to take samples .      hari could hardly believe what he was hearing .  the emperor could just as easily have signed hari   s death warrant .  instead  he seemed to be handing hari   s head to his privy councilor .  .  . on a plate  for dinner .      those  those are lies of course     sinter said slowly  eyes heavy lidded .     the emperor   s police would have reported such indiscretions .         i wonder     klayus said  eyes twinkling merrily .     at any rate  farad  raven here has some excellent points to make about this robot search .  hari  explain to us the political difficulties that might ensue  should such charges ever become widely disseminated .  tell farad about          jo jo joranum  yes  i know     sinter said  his lips thinning and his cheeks going white .     a mycogenian would be usurper .  stupid and easily manipulated  by you  in part  am i correct  professor seldon .         his name was mentioned     the emperor said  glancing off to one side as if beginning to be bored .      actually     hari said     joranum was just a symptom of a larger myth  with consequences far worse on other worlds than trantor .     a myth i have not thought about  not measured  not researched  all because of daneel   s prohibitions .  even now  hari realized he would have some difficulty discussing the topic .  he coughed into his fist .  sinter offered a handkerchief  but hari shook his head and produced his own .  accepting such an item could also be misconstrued .  and would it even be dangerous .  has trantor and the empire come to that .  either way  hari would not fall for such a simple set up .     on the world of sterrad .  nikolo pas .      the emperor stared at hari blankly .     i   m not familiar with nikolo pas .         a butcher  highness     sinter said .     responsible for the death of millions .         billions  actually     hari said .     in a vain search for artificial humans he claimed were infiltrating the empire .      the emperor stared at hari for several seconds  his face slack .     i should know about him  shouldn   t i .         he died in rikerian the year before you were born  highness     sinter said .     it is not a glorious moment in imperial history .      something in the atmosphere had changed .  klayus had a sour  even a disappointed look  as if he were anticipating an unpleasant duty .  hari glanced sideways at sinter and saw that the privy councilor was studying his emperor   s expression with some concern .  then it was that hari realized klayus and sinter had been playing with him .  the emperor already knew about the murders of citizens on trantor .  yet neither sinter nor any of his tutors had told him about nikolo pas  and this was upsetting him .      i   m not supposed to be so ignorant     klayus said .     i really should set up more time for personal study .  go on  raven .  what about nikolo pas .         in decades past  and every few centuries  highness  there have been tides and even storms of psychological disturbance  centered on the myth of the eternals .      sinter visibly flinched .  this gave hari some satisfaction .  he continued .      the resurgence of that myth has almost invariably led to social unrest  and in a few extreme cases  genocide .  i conducted an interview with nikolo pas when i served cleon as first minister  highness .  i spent several days speaking with him  an hour or two at a time  in his cell deep in rikerian .      the memories seemed to fill hari   s mind now .      what did pas believe .     the emperor asked .  the servants were at their positions around the hall .  all the arrangements had been completed  the dinner was being delayed  guests could not be allowed to enter until the emperor had left  to make a more formal entrance later .  klayus did not seem concerned by this .      pas claimed to have captured an active artificial human .  he claimed to have placed it .  .  .     hari coughed again .  in this context  he could hardly bring himself to use the word robot .  he felt badly exposed and even handicapped  for the prohibition against discussion of daneel   s nature had spread to other areas of thought  memory  even will .     he claimed to have isolated the artificial human        robot .  we could be here all night     klayus said impatiently .   that seemed to break some barrier  and hari nodded .     robot .  in very secure quarters .  the robot deactivated itself          how frightening  how noble .     klayus exclaimed .      pas claimed his scientists dissected and analyzed the body .  and yet the body  the inactive mechanical form  was removed from these extremely secure circumstances and vanished without a trace .  this was the beginning of nikolo pas   s crusade .  the details are far too long and gruesome to be spoken of here  highness  but i   m sure you can locate them in the imperial library .      klayus   s eyes were like marbles in the head of a wax figure  pointed in hari   s general direction .  he rotated toward sinter .     your point seems obvious  hari .  professor seldon .  may i call you hari .      the emperor had already asked him that at their last meeting  but hari did not let on .  once again  he replied     i would be honored  highness .         the point being that these waves of misery inevitably begin when some high official gets a bug in his hat and begins futile investigations .  and when the investigations get out of hand  they cost the empire many lives and much of treasure .  superstitions .  myths .  always dangerous  like religions .      sinter said nothing .  hari merely nodded .  both had beads of moisture on their foreheads .  the emperor seemed thoughtful and calm .      i   m willing to vouch that my privy councilor has no such illusions  hari .  i hope i can reassure you of that .         yes  highness .         and you  farad  you understand the depth of hari   s concern  that he comes here to relay these items of information about the state of bureaucratic and popular perceptions .  the citizens .  like a sea of whispers .  the greys .  the eternal manipulators of human destiny  the greatest power below the palace .  and the gentry  baronial and aristocratic  aloof  conspiratorial .  .  . so important and so often subject to fluctuating themes .  eh .      hari did not understand quite what the emperor meant .      no hard feelings against hari  eh  farad .             none  of course  sire .     sinter smiled sunnily at hari .      still .  .  .     klayus put his chin in one hand and tapped his lips with a finger .     amazing story .  i shall have to look into it .  what if the butcher   s notions were true .  that would change everything .  what then .      klayus turned to receive a message from the chief servant of the private dining chamber  an older and very somber lavrentian .     my guests  including the chief commissioner  are waiting     the emperor said .     hari  some day you must dine at table with me  as no doubt you did with the unfortunate clean and the almost equally unfortunate agis .  however  since you are currently in disfavor with tinge chen  tonight would not be a good time .  my servants will see you off the palace grounds .  both my privy councilor and i thank you     raven .         hari bowed from the waist and two burly servants  more likely disguised palace specials  took positions at his flanks .  as he was being escorted out of the chamber  passing beneath the amazing chandelier  the main doors opened to his right  and tinge chen entered .  his eyes met hari   s  and seldon felt a peculiar tremor of some emotion he could not identify .  he despised chen  yet the man was playing a very important role in the plan .   they were intimately connected  both politically and historically  and it gave hari no satisfaction to detect a certain sadness in the commissioner   s features  as if he   s lost a friend  hari thought .   nearly all my friends and loved ones are dead  too  or just .  .  . gone .  vanished .  and some i cannot even speak of .   hari nodded cordially to chen .  the chief commissioner turned away as if hari were of no importance whatsoever .   the two burly servants escorted him from the palace  and hari was left by a taxi stand to make his way back to the library and his far more comfortable  if far humbler  quarters .   in the taxi  pressed back into the cushions of the rear seat  hari closed his eyes and took a deep breath .  he might after all last no longer than the time it would take one of sinter   s police assassins to shoot him .  what would he tell wanda .  had he succeeded  or had he simply made things worse .   it was impossible to know just how intelligent the emperor actually was  how much control he exerted or wished to exert over his councilors and ministers .  klayus i was apparently a master at the art of concealing his true character and emotions  not to mention his intentions .   still  hari had long since known that klayus was doomed to a short reign .  his chances of being assassinated or deposed by chen in the next two years were as high as sixty percent  no matter what his character or intelligence  according to the near term glosses distilled from the equations in his prime radiant .   in his apartment within the library  hari took off his clothes and showered quickly  then donned a thin night robe and sat on the edge of his simple frame bed .  he checked through his messages .  all could be taken care of when he returned to his offices tomorrow .   there were no windows in this apartment  no real luxuries at all  it was a simple two room rectangle with a ceiling barely higher than his head .  in all of trantor  this was the only place where he could feel comfortable  safe  relaxed .   the only room where such illusions could prevail .        .     klia shivered in the vast hollow space and looked between her feet at the conjunction of two of trantor   s greatest rivers .  once  twelve thousand years ago  they had had names  now they were designated simply by numbers  but even those numbers hinted at greatness  one and two .  one worked its way across half of sirta  the continent which supported some of the most populated sectors  including the imperial palace  streeling  and dahl .  thousands of years ago  as trantor   s population grew and engineers contemplated accommodating additional billions  they had made the decision to cover over all the landmasses  to dig beneath the crust and burrow even into the shelves which lay beneath the ocean shores .   those ancient engineers wisely decided against attempting to reroute and change the nature of trantor   s watersheds .  to have the metal skin of their new structures support so much water on its rush to the sea was wasteful  so they lined deep channels where natural rivers once had flowed  and let the rains gather and flow into them .  where early sectors laid claim to natural aquifers  the engineers  with the mandate of the legendary emperor kwan shonam  created new porous materials for the basins to allow the aquifers to remain useful .   klia could no more understand the intricacies of water on trantor than any normal citizen .  what she knew was that here  fifty meters below where she stood  in the roaring maelstrom where the two rivers mated  lay power .  she appreciated power  but she was too young to adequately fear it  and besides  she had an arrogance born of her abilities .  she could not persuade rivers of water to change  but human rivers .  .  . that was something else again .   klia was cold and hungry and angry .  she felt abused  if they only knew .  she took deep breaths and contemplated the day when she could hunt down those who were now making her run and hide like a rat .   then she sat on the grating of the maintenance walkway  calves crossed in an easy x  and brought her all too negative emotions under control .  she had to find a place to sleep  here  it was too moist and cold and loud .  she had to find food .  there would be little of that below ground  she could wait for a maintenance tram to rumble past  flag it down  steal foodboxes and persuade the crew to forget .  .  . she smiled at that .  she would be a ghost  a phantom  the phantom of the two rivers .  .  .   some in dahl believed that those who lived good lives became part of the great rivers and flowed to the covered seas  there to live in perfect communes far from the knowledge of empire .  those who lived badly went into the heatsinks to sweat and work forever .  she did not believe such things  but they were interesting to contemplate while her subconscious mind worked through her problems and presented solutions .   the tram kept popping back into her thoughts .  she imagined it a big wormlike thing on many wheels  with comfortable and well lighted compartments within .  she could make friends with the maintenance workers .  perhaps one of them would be exceptional  a native dahlite with a huge mustache  far more manly than her father or any of the furtive black marketeers  he would comfort her gently at first  forcing nothing  until she decided what she wanted  what her body wanted .  .  .   these romantic visions only made her more lonely .  she felt very vulnerable .  she pounded her fist on a rail and listened to the hollow boom be swallowed by the vaster roar .  no time for such dreams .  she would be inhuman  above all passions and needs  she would take swift vengeance and live to create fear and respect .  children would be told her name to make them behave .  .  .   suddenly  her moist eyes dried and she simply laughed at her own ridiculous imaginings .  the laughter rose high and clear and  wondrously  the river   s rage did not swallow the sound  instead  the laughter echoed through the great vaults over the confluence  and returned to her  like the laughter of hundreds .   for the time being  barring the appearance of that large  gentle dahlite maintenance worker  she was licked .  she knew it .  she would have to go back up into dahl soon  and she would need a place to hide .  if people were looking for those with her talents  she would pick the best party and cooperatefor a while .   she sighed at this necessity  but klia knew she was not an idiot .  she would not languish with her dying dreams down there in the dark and wet  with no company but the great rivers .        .     mors planch listened to the sounds of a smooth  gentle landing from his pull down emergency seat in the hold .  lodovik trema sat beside him  eyes closed  face peacefully composed .   planch knew something about madder loss that neither tritch nor her crew understood .  fifty years ago  madder loss had been a promising jewel in the emperor   s black robe of galactic space  a renaissance world where intellect and philosophy and science burned very bright indeed .  the vast city continents of madder loss had bid fair to outshine trantor  even then revealing its age .  and for a time  trantor had tolerated madder loss as a grand dame might for a while tolerate the presence of a beautiful young woman in the court  watching her beauty mature with more amusement than envy .   but then the beautiful young woman  half unconscious of her effect  begins to attract the attentions of the grand dame   s paramours .  .  . and the tolerance turns into benign neglect  and finally comes the inexplicable cutting off of resources and the young woman finds herself a nonentity  shunned by the court  her name a blighted rumor .   planch had visited madder loss thirty years before to gather information for linge chen .  at that time chen had served as first grade administrator of second octant trade .  what mors had seen then would have broken his younger heart if he hadn   t been prepared and forewarned by chen himself  beautiful spaceports standing empty  gleaming new domes and plexes showing a certain air of decay  the listless officials in their out of date imperial uniforms adhering to rules without enthusiasm .  flourishing black markets  and even crowds of hungry women and children outside the spaceport fence .  madder loss had opened his eyes to the ebbs and flows of history and economics  and had also planted that seed of personal rebellion that had just flowered .  he had from that moment looked for a way to counteract the cold  loveless rationality of linge chen and his gentry cohorts  commanding their suffocating hordes of greys  drawing their lines and cutting off the bright young flesh of the empire for some obscure sense of trantor   s place and pride .  .  . for political expedience .   tritch came down to the hold and held out her register for him to place his code imprimatur upon .     everything as agreed     she murmured  not looking at him  and staying far away from lodovik .   lodovik rose from his seat and stood by the large hatch .  slight whirring noises and a change in pressure revealed it would be opening soon .      as agreed     mors said  and marked the forms .      may our world lines never cross again     tritch said lightly  then held out her index finger .  he hooked his index finger around hers  in the ancient common greeting of their mutual ancestors  and they tugged at each other gently .     now get out     she ordered  and the two of them quickly complied  stepping out into the stale air and ominous silence of a huge docking bay  devoid of any other ships .        i   m to take you to the private dwelling of a doctor living in the country     planch told lodovik as they waited for transportation from the passenger terminal .  here  in a vast hall designed to hold tens of thousands  they stood alone .  the lighted tiles of the ceil formed haphazard puzzle patterns  their condition far worse than any such yet seen on trantor .  the hall was cast in murky twilight  and there were times when mors thought he might choke  the air was so stagnant .   they had encountered a single elderly imperial official in the dusty passport docket  and he had waved them through with a sniff and something that might once have been a sneer .  his world did not care  why should he .   the hall was littered with broken down tiktoks  like victims of some mechanical plague .  the plague had been lack of replacement parts  madder loss had embraced the mechanical laborers and retained them long after trantor and most other imperial worlds shrugged them off .  they were no longer even being collected for scrap .   lodovik looked at planch sympathetically .     this is not pleasant for you     he observed .      no     planch said with a sigh .     look what the empire has done  a waste .         what do you mean .         trantor did this because it feared it would lose its eminence .  squeezed the life out of an entire world .      lodovik looked away .     do you blame linge chen .  is that why you have double crossed him .      planch paled .     i never said anything about linge chen .         no     lodovik said .  planch looked at the man with sudden misgivings .  if chen ever learned  there was no place in the galaxy where he would be safe .   a rickety  lozenge shaped ground taxi approached on large white wheels .  the driver was an elderly woman dressed in faded red livery .  her dialect was almost too thick to understand  but planch managed to communicate with her .  she seemed relieved to have paying passenger  in imperial credits .   and even happier to be getting out of the urban center .      i know that you have done work for chen in the past     lodovik said as they lurched along a potholed expressway .  here  the expressways layout in the open  rather than being routed below domes or underground  as they were on trantor .  the morning sunshine dazzled planch  and the air was tinted pink  giving everything a warm  nostalgic glow .     i was privy to some of the arrangements .         of course     planch said .      now you work for a man named posit     lodovik said .   planch started in shock and looked particularly miserable .     i should shoot you right now and leave madder loss     he murmured .      well  you know the proper codes     lodovik said .     that much is obvious .  you became angry at chen when he carried on the policies that strangled madder loss .  .  . and other renaissance worlds .  yet the squeezing  as you describe it  of the renaissance worlds was not linge chen   s policy initially .  it began under the first ministry of hari seldon  who implemented the policy to increase stability in the empire .      planch grunted that he was well aware of the seldon connection .     i don   t approve of a lot of imperial actions  and chen knew that when i worked for him .  but i don   t work for him now .         you have no need to worry     lodovik said .     chen will never know .      planch squirmed in his cracked seat .      twenty minutes     the driver called back in a cheery voice .     the house was the most unusual planch had ever seen  a single small building standing alone in a field covered with short green plants  forming a kind of living carpet beneath the warm sunshine .  the outskirts of the city were ten kilometers away  and the nearest structure similar to this one was almost five kilometers distant .  the land between consisted of low  rolling hills covered with planar bushy growths  purple or deep bluish green .  the countryside seemed elegantly vivacious  quite gaudy in comparison with the crumbling  unkempt city .   the taxi let them out in a broad paved circle at the front of the dwelling .  a single tall male figure stood beneath a cloth awning that flapped lazily in the warm  gentle breeze .  he stepped forward and bowed toward mors planch .      you   ve done your work well     the man said .   planch returned the bow  then awkwardly spread one arm toward lodovik  and said blandly     he wasn   t much trouble .     he stepped back as if they might do something unexpected  start fighting or perhaps just burst into flames .      you   re free to go     the man said .      i need release papers .  you seem to be the contact i met on trantor  but .  .  .      the man gestured and a worn but fully functional tiktok came out of the house carrying a small satchel .     this will complete our agreement  for now .  the bag also contains any papers you might need to go wherever you wish to go  safely  in the territories still controlled by the empire .         i want to get away from the empire  forever     planch said .      you will find some documents that will help you do that  as well     the man said .   planch  despite his unease  seemed reluctant to return to the waiting taxi .      what else can i offer you .     the man asked     an explanation .  who are you  what do you represent .         nothing     the man said .     i regret to say you   ll soon forget everything you saw here  and your role in rescuing my friend as well .         friend .         yes     said the man .     we   ve known each other for thousands of years .         you   re not joking .  who are you .     planch asked  despite a tingling surge of awe blended with real fear .      please go     the man said  and tipped his head slightly .  planch tipped his own head in synchrony  turned without another word  and walked back to the vehicle .  the door opened with a shuddering groan to receive him .   lodovik watched his rescuer depart .  then  using no human words whatsoever  but a high frequency pulse modulated sound signal and bursts of microwave  both exchanged greetings  and lodovik was partially debriefed .   after  r .  daneel olivaw said  in spoken words     let   s do this on human time and in human ways  for the moment .         certainly     lodovik said .     i am curious as to where i might be assigned next .      daneel opened the door to the dwelling  and lodovik entered before him .     you state that there is something different about you .  yet i examine your transmitted status profile and see nothing amiss .         yes     lodovik said .     i have been examining my mental structure and programming since the accident  trying to pinpoint what that difference could be .         have you reached any conclusions .         i have .  i am no longer compelled to obey the three laws .      daneel received this declaration with no humanly observable reaction .  the main room of the house contained two chairs  and in the walls  there were niches for three tiktoks  but to lodovik  they looked like the niches once reserved for robots on aurora  tens of thousands of years ago .      if that is true  there will be grave difficulties  for i observe you are still functioning .  you have not deactivated yourself .         that would have been impossible under the circumstances  for i did not understand this new condition until after i had been rescued by mors planch .  i caused harm  unwittingly  to a human being on the ship planch had hired to find the spear of glory  . i did not feel even a hint of the reaction i should have felt .  i conclude that the neutrino flux has altered my positronic brain in an unanticipated fashion .  certain key elements in my logic circuits may have been transmuted .         i see .  have you decided on what action you should take now .         i must either deactivate  and impose on you to destroy my remains  or i must be sent to eos  if my continued existence will serve any purpose .      daneel sat on one of the chairs  and lodovik took the other .  it no longer seemed at all appropriate to occupy the niches  which in any case were too narrow for their human scale frames .      why did you travel all this way  rather than send an emissary .     lodovik asked .      i have all possible emissaries in key positions at the moment     daneel said .     none could be spared  nor can i afford to lose you .  i was already scheduled to be on madder loss as a jumping off point for eos .  normally i would have delayed my trip  since this is a very delicate time  and the accident has caused grave difficulties .  it has even triggered a political struggle in the imperial palace that might directly involve hari seldon .      though lodovik had not worked directly on the plan  he was well informed about the psychohistorian .   they sat in silence for several seconds  then daneel spoke again .     we will go to eos .  i can arrange a small ship for you .  there is a mission you can perform for me once you return        i am sorry .  daneel     lodovik interrupted .     i must emphasize that i am not functioning properly .  i should not be assigned any new missions until i have been repaired or reprogrammed  whichever is necessary .         that can only be done on eos     daneel said .      yes  but there is a possibility i will no longer follow your instructions     lodovik said .      please explain .         humans would call it a crisis of conscience .  i have had many long and idle hours to sort through and reexamine all my brain   s memory contents  and all of my working algorithms  from this new perspective .  i must confess that i am a very confused robot at this moment  and my behavior is not predictable .  i may even be a danger .      daneel stood and stepped over to lodovik   s chair  then bent from the waist and placed his hand on lodovik   s shoulder .     what does your investigation and examination tell you .         that the plan is wrong     lodovik said .     i believe .  .  . i am coming to believe .  .  . my state of thinking is such that .  .  .     he pushed up from the chair  past daneel  and went to a broad window looking out on fields of planar bushes .     this is a beautiful world .  mors planch thinks it is beautiful  and as i spent time with him  i developed a deep respect for his judgment .  he resents the changes imposed upon madder loss .  he regards them as a kind of punishment for aspiring to greatness in the empire .  his resentment led him to betray linge chen .         i have known about his distaste for the empire and for chen     daneel said .   lodovik continued     yet it was not the empire or linge chen that decreed madder loss be subdued  not directly .     he turned to daneel  and his face bore traces of human emotion  sadness  regret  grief  even in the presence of a robot  where it was certainly not necessary .     it was you who decided the renaissance worlds must be controlled  and induced changes in the politics of trantor to carry out their strangulation .      daneel listened with his own human expression  a troubled sort of fascination .  mimicking human behaviors for so long had created reflex pathways in both robots that sometimes seemed easier to display than to suppress .      i foresaw greater instability     daneel began .     centuries of human conflict around systems aspiring to replace the empire and become centers of power .  not all such worlds could win  the struggle would cause untold suffering and destruction  on a scale never witnessed in human history .  the empire will fall  we know that much .  but all my efforts have been dedicated to mitigating the effects of that fall  to reduce human suffering to a minimum .  the zeroth law          the zeroth law is what concerns me .         you have accepted its primacy for centuries now .  why does it concern you .         i believe the zeroth law may be a mutational function  spread between robots like a virus .  i do not know how it arose  but it may have been provoked by another mutation  mentalic powers in robots .         to question the zeroth law could lead us to conclude that everything i have tried to accomplish is in error  and that all the robots who follow me should be deactivated  myself included .         i am aware of the magnitude of my supposition .      daneel said     apparently  something very interesting has happened to you .         yes     lodovik said  and his pleasant  plump face went through a series of random and uncoordinated contortions .     these questions and divisive thoughts may all be due to my own alteration .  i have followed your lead for thousands of years .  .  . to feel doubts now .  .  .     his voice became a strained  metallic squeak .     i am miserable  daneel .      daneel considered the situation carefully  as if he were walking through a minefield .     i regret the disturbance you feel .  you are not the first to disagree with the plan .  others expressed similar views  many more thousands of years ago .  there were many schisms among robots when the humans abandoned us .  the giskardians  those like myself  who followed the ideas of giskard reventlov  were opposed by others who insisted on a strict interpretation of the three laws .         i do not know of these events     lodovik said  his voice steadier .      there has been no need to talk of them .  besides  these robots may all be inactive now  i have not heard from them for centuries .         what happened to them .         i do not know     daneel said .     they called themselves calvinians  after susan calvin .     every robot knew of susan calvin  though no human remembered her now .     before those schisms there were far worse events .  unspeakable tasks that humans set for robots  carried out by some of those who would become calvinians .  these memories are in themselves disturbing .         it gives me no satisfaction to cause you distress  r .  daneel     lodovik said .   daneel sat in the second chair again and folded his arms .  both robots were aware of this mimicry of human actions  both were used to the promptings of their human overlays  and did not regard these behaviors and gestures as particularly annoying .  sometimes  they were even reassuring  and lodovik noticed that daneel   s posture in the chair  the inflection of his voice  and his facial expression all seemed to become more human as their conversation progressed .  neither wished to return to the much more rapid modes of microwave or high frequency sound communication  this was a situation of complexity and subtlety  and the slower modes of human speech seemed much safer .      you will return to eos .  we will see what can be done there     daneel said .     i hope for your complete recovery .         as do i     lodovik said .     planch sat without moving for most of the ride back to the spaceport .  he looked through the front windscreen  over the shoulder of the driver  and tried to ignore her thickly accented chatter .  then  with a small shudder  he removed the tiny recorder from its hidden pocket in his jacket and stared at it .  he could not make up his mind for several minutes whether to play back the recording or just throw it out the window .      this all war verra rich  co    da flow fro    tha por     aaw the ships do come in har .  .  .     the elderly woman said  and glanced over her shoulder .  her eyes were pale blue  very alert  very wise .  she smiled and her face wrinkled into a hundred river deltas .  planch nodded while only half hearing what she said .      now it be col    poverty  na ships  na work .  i am har day in and ou    for my wi    and amusemen     na more tha    tha    .      she did not seem especially resentful  merely stating facts  yet her words rankled .  there were worlds in the stellar neighborhood where the accent of madder loss was considered comic  used by entertainers portraying simpletons or charlatans .  tritch herself had referred to madder loss as a planet of parasites .  few from outside came here anymore  few knew what had really happened .   yet now  within this recorder  there might be proof of something extraordinary  a clue to the larger picture .  his memory since yesterday seemed murky and full of gaps .  he did not even know why he had brought the recorder  he had done nothing important since taking lodovik trema   s body to the transfer terminal and handing it over to imperial agents .  and why this ride into the country  just to relive old  sometimes painful memories .      we   ra here .  ya shou stay longer  there are still beautiful sigh   s i    the countr     lovely hostels whar to stay .     her voice became sly  a little wheedling .     i coul    show ya places o    beautiful wimma  nat   ral farm garls  all verra poor an    lone .         no  thank you     planch said  though he was tempted .  his last love had been a native of madder loss  thirty years before .  he had had no taste for others since  yet he felt a hollow ache at the thought of leaving the planet without trying for another romance .  he was somehow convinced that to stay  however  could be very dangerous .   he paid the woman and thanked her in her own accent  then stood beneath the huge balloon roof of the immigration and transfer authority area .  the blue skies and distant fields showed through gaps where buildings had been tom down and not replaced .   he found a cool  secluded spot next to an empty restaurant and sat on a bench  holding the recorder display up to see how much it had captured .   five hours .   for a few seconds  he simply sat and tapped the recorder against his chin  eyes heavy lidded .  then  brows drawing in  fingers white where they gripped the tiny tube  he said     code  unforgivable .  this is planch  log in personal .  play back  all .           .     the candidates for the second foundation did not meet in secret .  instead  they shared a plausible cover  they were a social club  interested in the history of certain games of chance  little different from other hobbyists around trantor .  hobbies swept the planet with boring regularity  and even after their times had passed  small groups of adherents remained loyal .   the mentalic candidates who could form part of the proposed star   s end settlement met  with official approval  twice a week  in a social hall in one of the less fancy dormitories on the outskirts of streeling university .  in these run down facilities  they were ignored by students who had come to trantor from some of the less privileged worlds .   the hall was not equipped with listening devices  wanda herself had persuaded a caretaker to tell her of the older buildings whose bugs were either inactive or had been removed .   wanda stood beside her husband  stettin palver  in the crowded hall and waited for the     candidates to settle in to their seats .  the sergeant at arms closed and locked the doors  and three sensitives stood watch to make sure they were not eavesdropped upon .   in this core group of mentalics  the only one wanda knew of  perhaps the only one there had ever been  there was little need for calls to order or other formal  spoken signals  the group tended to come to order with little overt fuss .  she thought ruefully that this had nothing to do with politeness .  there had been a large number of fractious outbreaks in the community since the beginning  but disorder manifested itself in different ways with her people .   stettin raised his hand .  the group had already fallen quiet .  they all faced front with deceptively placid expressions .  mentalics seldom exhibited their true emotions  certainly not in the presence of their peers .   wanda felt little ripples of uncontrolled persuasion  they made her neck itch .  she could pick out a few distinct strands in the welter  like smells from a rich stew  currents of social and sexual tension  focused concern  even uncoordinated attempts to override stet tin   s dominance .  in mentalics  not just the conscious mind exerted its persuasive effects .  my people  she thought .  heaven save me from my people .      we need the reports from our recruitment cells     stettin said quietly .     next  i   ll give my report on mathematical and psychological training  to bring our candidates up to speed with the other groups preparing for the mission  then we   ll discuss the attrition .         we need to discuss the murders now .     said a young woman historian with thick black hair cut in a wide bowl .  her green eyes blazed at stettin and wanda .   wanda deflected the woman   s automatic whip of persuasion .  her neck itched fiercely .   the woman continued  voice calm but inner emotions raging .     every recruit for the last three months          there   s a traitor among us .     interrupted a man from the back .   stettin pressed his lips together grimly and held up his hand again .     we know who the so called traitor is     he said softly .     her name is vara liso .      the crowd instantly quieted .  wanda observed the waves of turmoil and calm with an intense but somehow distant interest .  this is how we are .  grandfather chose us because we are this way  didn   t he .      perhaps we know her name  now     the young historian said .     but what good does that do us .  she is stronger than any of us here .     she could barely be heard .      no one can persuade her     said another voice  wanda could not tell where in the crowd .      she smells us out like a tracker .         we must assassinate her          persuade somebody to kill her .         someone who is expendable       stettin waited for the suggestions to stop .  again  the crowd became unnaturally quiet .  even the ripples of persuasion seemed to still .  all their lives  these people had used their talents to make their way in life .  finally  they were among their own kind  among equals  and their    luck    was distressingly ineffectual here .      wanda has asked professor seldon for help     stettin said .     and he has gone to the emperor himself .  .  . but we do not yet know the outcome of his visit .  we should plan for the possibility of failure .  we may have to do something we   ve only tried once before .         what .     several asked .      a massed effort .  wanda and i once unwittingly pooled our talents  with some success .  .  . but only against a normal .      a judge  wanda remembered .  when grandfather got in trouble with young toughs .      i think it is possible that ten or twenty of us  trained to operate in unison  may be effective against this woman .      the crowd of candidates absorbed this for a few seconds .     to kill her .     the black haired historian asked .      that may not be necessary     wanda said .  she and stettin had argued this through early in the evening  with some heat .  stettin had maintained that killing vara liso was the only safe option .  wanda had maintained with equal force that murder could enervate their cause  drive them one against the other .  the balance of so many persuaders was already delicate .   even her own marriage was fraught with difficulties .  two persuaders  placed in proximity for years  intimate for hours on end  could find many unique ways to irritate and stymie each other .      i will not kill another human being  much less one of my own kind     the young historian said firmly  eyes brimming with emotion at her own idealism .     no matter how much we may be endangered .      stettin set his jaw .     that would be a last resort .  we must begin training volunteers for such an effort .  i have a list of those whose work puts them in places where they might encounter liso .  .  .      wanda listened as stettin read out the names .  the named stepped forward like guilty children  and stettin took them to a separate room .      the rest of us have other matters to discuss     wanda said  hoping to distract the remainder .     there are more travel questions to be answered  health questions  family and financial situations to be tied up  and  of course  training in the seldon disciplines       the group calmed and focused on these matters with some relief  glad to be done with the problem of liso  for the time being .  eager to look the other way .   they were all like children  wanda thought  every one of them  and the group as a whole  no better than awkward adolescents  stumbling along through life with powers they have only now recognized  for the first time fully aware of weaknesses they have never had to confront before .   weaknesses hidden by persuasion .   we are all cripples .  she kept her face calm  but her insides churned at the coming conflicts  so many and so dangerous .  how could hari have chosen such a strange and disorganized group to safeguard all of human history .   sometimes  wanda felt as if she were wandering through a dream .  not even stettin could reassure her at those times  and she was close to despair .   of course  she never confessed that to hari .        .     klia asgar emerged during the main sleep period .  ten kilometers from where she had descended to the two rivers .  the ceil above this neighborhood of dahl glowed twilight blue gray  and the streets were filled only with night laborers  about a third of the volume of waking maximum .  nobody challenged her .   rather than simply contact the number on the card given to her by the man in dusty green  klia persuaded a small time security scrambler in south dahl to break the card   s code .  the card then gave her an address and acted as a guide  glowing and humming faint directions as she took transit and taxi to pentare  a small municipality in the shadow of streeling .  she bought an imperial grade filmbook reader  hooked it to a general communicator  and fed it material from public files  using data credits she had amassed on two small jobs months ago .  she read up on hari seldon and his granddaughter  wanda .  seldon .  it seemed  was not a persuader  yet the man in dusty green had said that his granddaughter was .  where did she get her powers  then .  klia looked up wanda seldon palver   s father  raych .  a dahlite .   this caused her a moment of both concern and wonder  and even momentary pride .  she had always known dahlites were special .   the woman   s family connection with a dahlite was not enough to dispel klia   s suspicions about people connected to the palace .   still  hari seldon predicted the end of the empire  the destruction of trantor  he had established quite a reputation as a doomsayer .  that might put him in opposition to the palace  there were even rumors that he was to be put on trial for treason .   yet klia had an instinctive dislike for such visionary twaddle .  too often visionaries were trying to organize their own small cadres of totally obedient acolytes  little personal empires in the middle of a unimaginably bigger and almost completely impersonal galactic empire .   she had heard of a spectacular incident just last year  in temblar  on the equator .  fifty thousand followers of a schismatic mycogenian had committed suicide  claiming to get messages telling them of trantor   s imminent destruction .  the messages had supposedly come from nonhuman intelligences parasitizing imperial defense and information platforms in orbit around trantor .   klia knew nothing about the defense platforms  but she was smart enough to see that seldon was clearly akin to these fanatics  and would do someone like her no good at all .   as the man in dusty green had indicated .  .  .   at the card   s direction  klia took a small slideway from the transit platform to a pedwalk artery dubiously called brommus fair .  this led halfway across a district where goods were housed before distribution to retail shops  agoras  and markets around streeling and the imperial sector .   she approached a large warehouse that reached to the edge of the ceil  where it met its supporting wall  a less than desirable neighborhood  but clean and orderly .  there were even fewer people about at this early morning hour than there had been in south dahl .  still  she kept her senses keenly tuned .   the card directed her to a small side door .  she looked at the door for several tens of seconds  biting her lower lip .  what she was about to do seemed to be a very big step  and possibly a dangerous one .  still  everything the man in dusty green had told her rang true .   and he had given her information about herself  her nature  that had bothered her  deeply affected her .   she was about to knock on the small  featureless door when it opened inward with an abrupt squeal .  a large  dark figure bent low to step out and almost bumped into her .  klia jumped back .      sorry     the figure said  and emerged in the twilight beneath the glow of a small lantern high up on the warehouse wall .  it was a man  a very big man  with broad shoulders and glossy black hair and a magnificent mustache .  a dahlite .     the main entrance is around the corner     the man said in a deep  velvety voice .     besides  we   re closed .      she had never seen any male so handsome  and so compellingly .  .  . she tried to find the word  gentle .  klia swallowed and forced herself to speak .     i was told to come here .  a man gave me this .  wears green .  he never told me his name .     she held out the card .   the huge dahlite  fully two heads taller than any dahlite she had ever seen before  took the card in large but dexterous fingers .  he pulled it close to his face and squinted .     that would be kallusin     he grumbled .  he lowered the card .  klia felt something brush against her like a light breeze  then depart .     he   s at home now  i think  or somewhere he can   t be reached .  can i help you .         he .  .  . said he would find a .  .  . safe place for me .  i think that   s what he meant .         yeah .  all right .     the big dahlite turned and pushed the door open again .     you can wait inside until he comes .      she hesitated .      it   s all right     the giant said  and his voice almost compelled her full belief .     i certainly won   t hurt you .  you   re a sister .  my name is brann .  come on in .        brann shut the door behind them and rose to his full height .  despite his size  klia did not feel afraid  he moved with a careful grace that could have been calculated not to alarm or offend  if it had not seemed so natural .  he smiled down on her .      dahl .     he asked .      yes .         most of us are from dahl .  some come from misaro  a few more from lavrenti .      she lifted her eyebrows .      whatever it is  it makes good servants     brann said with a small grin .     how long have you known .         since i was a child     klia said .     how long have you been here .         just a few months .  kallusin recruited me during the equinox .  i left dahl five years ago .  i was too big to work in the heatsinks .      klia looked around the large space they had entered and saw many tiers of industrial shelving covered with crates  lumbering old automated lift engines  belt delivery systems  all quiet now and shrouded in darkness .      what is this .     klia asked .      kallusin works for a man named plussix .  plussix imports stuff from offworld and sells it here .     brann walked down an aisle  glanced over his shoulder  and said     it   ll be an hour before kallusin gets here .  he   s a late sleeper .  want to see some of the treasure .         sure     klia said with a shrug .  she walked slowly after the big man  arms folded against the warehouse   s slight chill .      there   s stuff from a thousand worlds here     brann said  his voice barely audible in the vast spaces .  the warehouse was larger than she thought  huge portals with massive rolling doors led to even more cavernous chambers .     out there  where it comes from  it   s junk  and believe me  it wouldn   t impress the emperor  either .  but the greys here on trantor just gotta have it .  every little apartment nook needs a dried stingweed frond from giacond  or a pre empire trance box from dessemer .  plussix buys it for nothing  saves it from conversion and cycling .  buys empty space on food ships from the nutrient allies or from free traders with imperial dispensation .  brings it here .  makes twenty percent per shipload  a lot better than the trantor bourse .  in thirty years  he   s gotten very rich .         i   ve never heard of plussix .         he doesn   t sell any of it himself .  the bureaucrats like to have a story  and he   s pretty much no story at all .  i   ve never seen him myself  and i don   t think kallusin has  either .         so he just hands it over to good story tellers .      brann rumbled softly  and with some pleasure  klia realized he was laughing .     yeah     he said  glancing back at her appreciatively .  he seemed to want to face away from her .  she almost subconsciously tried to persuade him to turn around .  she wanted to understand more clearly how he felt about her .      stop that     he said  and his shoulders tensed .      stop what .         everybody around here tries that and i don   t like it .  don   t make me do anything .  just ask with words .         i   m sorry     klia said  and genuinely meant it .  his tone was more than offended  he sounded as if some friend had just betrayed him .      yeah  well  it   s natural  i suppose .  i feel it  but it doesn   t work on me .  i said you   re a sister .  you don   t know what that means .         i .  .  . suppose it means you   re like me .         i   m not like you  not exactly .  you persuade .  i make people feel comfortable and happy .  i can   t make them do anything  but they like being around me .  i like being around them .  it   s mutual .  so you don   t need to persuade me .  just ask .         i will     klia said .      but don   t ask me to look directly at you     brann said .     not for a while .  i have a very rough time with females .  that   s why i left dahl  not just because i couldn   t work in the heatsinks .         i don   t understand     klia said .      i   m shy for a reason     he said .      i   d like to know .         of course you would     brann said amiably .     you   re a woman .  i can feel you liking me .  and i like women .  .  . a lot .  i think they   re beautiful .  enchanting .  so i fall in love with them  really quickly .  but what i do .  .  . the effect i have .  .  . after a while  it wears off  and the women see me for what i am  this big hulking guy with no prospects .  so they wander off  and there i am .  alone .         that must be very painful     klia said  though she could not really understand why .  she had been a loner for so long that the thought of being alone caused her no concern .  she had no clear notion of what it felt like to be in love  either .  her dreams were more of continuing  satisfying sexuality  not necessarily of a deep emotional connection .     i like being alone  myself .  i don   t really care what others think about me .         you   re lucky     brann said .      so who tells the stories about these things  to sell them .     klia wanted to get away from this topic .  brann   s shyness and vulnerability were a little too attractive .      shopkeepers all over trantor     brann said .     the staff writes up reports on the treasures  we attach the reports to official forms from customs  we deliver to the agoras  and the greys run to buy    em .  haven   t you ever seen an offworld antique store .         never     klia said .      well  if you   re around long enough  maybe one of the guys will take you to one .  me  i only go out during sleeps  when there aren   t many people .        kallusin  the man in dusty green  sat himself behind a ridiculously large desk and folded his hands .  the desktop was covered with pretty baubles from many different worlds  all of them useless as far as klia could determine  but attractive  or perhaps just distracting .   brann stood behind her .  she kept her eyes on kallusin  though she felt the urge to look at brann .  there was something about his abilities that the big dahlite was not telling her .  fair enough .  he did not know everything about klia  either .      our persuaders are a very creepy crew  you know .     kallusin said  and smiled .     very talented and very creepy .  they have to watch us and maintain tight discipline here  or else word will get out  and do you think people on trantor will enjoy knowing that their kind exist .  lucky people  persuasive people .  people who manage to get along .  .  . but you know something strange .  none of them have made it into the palace .  they stay at a constant level of human accomplishment  and they stay out of politics .  does that make sense to you  klia asgar .         no     klia said  and shook her head .     we should be in control  if everything you   ve said is true .         well  you seem to be self limiting .  you   re content just to live your lives and leave higher matters to normal people .  why that should be  i don   t know .  but the trader plussix enjoys your company .  you realize that you   ll never meet plussix  not in person  even after you join and swear an oath .         fine with me     klia said .      does that arouse your curiosity .         no     klia said with a sniff .     what do i need to do .         first  promise you   ll learn to control your talents in the  presence of your fellow persuaders .  you  especially  klia asgar .  you   re one of the strongest persuaders i   ve ever encountered .  if you applied yourself  you could make all of us do handstands  but we   d know what had happened  and we   d have to kill you .      klia felt a small shiver of dismay .  she had never really tried to control herself  she had grown up with this ability  using it as naturally and casually as she did speech  perhaps more so  since she wasn   t much for conversation .     all right     she said .      in return  we protect you  hide you  give you useful work .  and .  .  . you get to be interviewed by trader plussix .         oh  good     klia said softly .      don   t be afraid of him     brann said in his soft rumble .      i won   t be .         he   s deformed     kallusin said .     so i   ve surmised .  plussix tells us nothing  but .  .  .     his hand indicated the office  the warehouse  their living quarters  all with one sweep .     he provides all this for us .  my theory  which i   ve even told plussix himself  is that he   s another peculiar kind of mentalic  not very good at persuading or greasing the social skids  but a type who enjoys being around those with your talents .  but he never confirms or denies anything .         oh     klia said .  she wanted to get the ceremonies over and go to her quarters .  she wanted to be alone and rest .  she hadn   t slept well in days .  rest  and food .  since her arrival at the warehouse  brann had taken her to the employee cafeteria twice  and she had eaten huge meals  but she was still hungry .   she resisted the urge to look at brann .  she kept her eyes on kallusin .      i   m very glad you   ve joined us     he said  and pressed his baby smooth lips together .  he neither smiled nor frowned  but his eyes  though they did not move  seemed to sweep her for every important detail .     thank you     he said  and turned to the window overlooking the largest chamber of the warehouse .  brann touched her shoulder  and she jerked  then followed the big man outside .      when do i swear my oath .     she asked .      you already have  by accepting our hospitality and not asking kallusin if you could leave .         that doesn   t seem fair .  i should know all the rules .         there are no rules  except you stay around here  you don   t use your talents on us or on outsiders .  .  . unless instructed to do so .  .  . and you don   t tell anybody about us .         why not put that into an oath .         why bother .     brann said .      and what about you .  you keep making me want to look at you .  shouldn   t you stop that .      brann shook his head solemnly .     i   m not doing a thing     he said .      don   t tell me that .  i   m no idiot .         believe whatever you want     brann said .     if you want to look at me  it   s just because you want to look at me .     then he added  in a low voice     i don   t mind .  not with you .      he walked ahead of her down a narrow industrial gray corridor lined with closed doors and illuminated by simple globes .  klia felt a flush of anger at his presumption .     maybe you should mind .     she called ahead sharply .     maybe you should worry .  i   m not a very nice person .      brann shrugged and handed her the id card that also served as a key to her room .     enjoy your rest     he said .     we probably won   t see each other for a while .  i   m going with kallusin to escort a shipment of goods to mycogen .  it might take us days to conclude the deal .         good     klia said  and inserted the card .  she pushed open the door to her room and entered swiftly  then slammed the door behind her .   for some seconds  she hardly saw the room  she was so angry with herself .  she felt weak and taken advantage of .  swearing an oath without even hearing the oath .  plussix sounded monstrous .   then the furniture and decor came into focus .  it was spare  soft greens and grays with sunny yellow accents  not luxurious but not oppressive  either .  there was a plain foam mattress  not too old  an armoire  a trunk  a tiny desk and chair  then another chair  not much larger but with more padding than the desk chair .  there was a lamp in the ceiling and a lamp on the desk .  a bookfilm reader lay on the desk .   the room was three paces wide and about three and a half long .  it was the nicest room she had had to herself since she left home  and in truth  nicer than the small bedroom she had slept in as a child .  she sat on the edge of the bed .   being attracted to men  any man  was a weakness she could not afford now .  she was sure her fantasy of a big dahlite male didn   t match brann  although he was big  a dahlite  male  and sported a fine mustache .   the next time  she vowed  i won   t look at him at all .        .     lodovik stood motionless but for his eyes  watching as daneel conducted another diagnostic check  the last before the journey to eos .      there   s no overt damage  still nothing i can detect here     daneel said as the old machines finished .     but you   re a later model than these tools .  they   re not up to your level  i suspect .         have you ever diagnosed yourself .     lodovik asked .      frequently     daneel said .     every few years .  not with these machines  however .  there are some high quality tools hidden on trantor .  still  it   s been a century since i   ve been to eos  and my power supply needs replacing .  that   s why i   ll travel with you .  and there is another reason .  i have to bring back a robot  if her repairs and upgrades have gone well .         a female form .         yes .      lodovik waited for elaboration  but daneel was not forthcoming .  he knew of only one female form robot still active  of the millions that had once been so popular with humans .  this was dors venabili  and she had been sequestered on eos for decades .      you do not trust me now  do you .     lodovik said .      no     daneel said .     the ship should be ready .  the sooner we get to eos  the sooner we can get back .  i hate to be away from trantor .  the most critical moment of the cusp time is upon us .        very few imperial ships put in to madder loss now  but daneel had made traveling arrangements with a trader vessel months before  and it was not difficult to fit lodovik in as an extra passenger .  the vessel would take them to the cold outer reaches of madder loss   s system  to a frozen asteroid with no name  only a catalog number  issc      .   they stood on the landing platform of a remote outdoor port .  spaceport .  the sun was bright  and insects flew through the air  pollinating the oil flower fields that surrounded the concrete and plasteel facilities .   lodovik still valued daneel   s leadership and presence  but how long could that last .  in fact  lodovik had put all of his initiative on hold for the few days he had been on madder loss  for fear of defying daneel .  his type of humaniform robot used initiative in many important ways  however  not just to determine large scale courses of action .  he could not subdue the thoughts that rose from his core mentality .  daneel would hold humans back .  humans must be allowed to act out their own destiny .  we do not understand their animal spirits .  we are not like them .   daneel himself had said that human minds and destiny were not easily understood by robots  if they could be understood at all .  it is madness to control and direct their history .  the overweening madness of machines out of control .   something unfamiliar flitted across his thought processes  a vestige of the voice he had heard earlier .   daneel spoke to the trader captain  a small  muscular man with a ritually scarred face and paste white skin .  daneel turned and waved for lodovik to join him .  lodovik marched forward .  the trader captain gave him a ferocious smile .   as they boarded the ship  lodovik looked back .  insects everywhere  on all the planets suitable for humans  all alike  with minor local variations  mostly explainable by genetic tinkering over the millennia .  all suited to maintaining ecosystems conducive to human civilization .   not a wild creature on all of madder loss .  wild creatures could only be found on those fifty thousand worlds put aside as hunting and zoo preserves  the garden planets so popular with klayus  planets where citizens could only visit with imperial permission .  he had once overseen the budgetary allocations to those preserves .  linge chen had wanted to shut them down as useless expense  but klayus had made a direct request to save them  and there had been some ornate quid pro quo to which lodovik had not been privy .   lodovik wondered how all this  garden worlds and tamed or paved over human worlds  had come to be .  so much history unavailable to him .  so many questions bubbling up now beneath the self imposed constraints .   the ship doors closed behind him  and he concealed an algorithmic turbulence  what in human terms he would have called an intellectual panic  not at the closed spaces of the ship  but at the opening flowers of curiosity within his own mind .   in their small cabin  daneel placed their two small pieces of luggage in containment racks and pulled down a small sitting platform .  lodovik remained standing .  daneel folded his arms .      we will not be disturbed     he said .     we can drop to our lowest level here .  we should be at the rendezvous in six hours  and on eos within three days .         how much time do we have  before you lose control of the situation on trantor .     lodovik asked .      fifteen days     daneel said .     barring unforeseen circumstances .  and there are always those  where humans are concerned .           .     vara liso could hardly contain her rage .  she raised her fists to farad sinter  who backed off with a small  shocked grin  and circled him in the broad public affairs office .  a number of greys  pushing carts or carrying valises  witnessed this confrontation from the adjoining hallway with wonder and concealed  colorless glee .      that is idiotic .      she hissed at him  then lowered her voice .     take off the pressure .  .  . and they will regroup .  then they will come after me .       the blond major  her constant and now intensely annoying shadow  danced ineffectually around  trying to interpose himself .  but vara just as deftly maneuvered around him .  sinter was left with the impression he was in a small and embarrassing riot .  by walking crabwise toward the open door of his secondary office  sinter managed this small squall into a less public container .      you lost the trail .     he said  half bark  half sigh  as a grey shut the door behind them .  the grey merely glanced at the trio  then went about her duties  nonplussed .      i was pulled away .     vara howled .  tears started from her eyes and poured down her cheeks .  abruptly  the major stopped his dance and stood in one spot  trembling allover  his limbs jerking .  then  he looked for a chair  saw one in a comer  and collapsed into it .  sinter witnessed this with wide eyes .      did you do that .     he asked vara .   vara shut her mouth with a small click of teeth  pulled back her head on its long  thin neck  and stared at the major .     of course not .  though he has been abominable  and uncooperative .         the strain      the major managed between clenched  clattering teeth .   sinter stared at her for several seconds  until vara realized she was arousing some very unhealthy suspicions .  major namm shook himself  steadied  and managed to stand again  swallowing hard .  he came to attention  rather ridiculously  and focused on a wall opposite .      how did you lose her .     farad sinter asked softly  looking between them .      it was not her fault     the major said .      i asked her     sinter said .      she was very fast  and she sensed my presence     vara liso began .     your agents  your bumbling police  weren   t fast enough to catch her  and now she   s gone  and you won   t let me find her .      sinter   s lips protruded in thought  pressed together as if waiting for a kiss .  it was a ludicrous expression  and suddenly  in vara liso   s heart  what had started out as admiration and love flip flopped into bitterness and hatred .   she kept her feelings to herself  however .  she had already said too much  gone too far .  did i whip that young officer .  she glanced at the stiff  silent man with a small measure of guilt .  she must keep her abilities in check .      the emperor has specifically forbidden me from conducting any more of our searches .  he does not seem to share our interest in these .  .  . people .  and for the moment  i   m not going to press my advantage and try to convince him to change his mind .  the emperor has his ways  and they must be observed .      vara stood with hands folded .      he was convinced by hari seldon that this could look very bad  politically .      vara   s eyes widened .     but seldon supports them .         we don   t know that for sure .         but they were recruiting me .  his granddaughter .      farad reached out and took her by the wrist  then tightened his grip ever so slightly .  she winced .     that is a fact to be kept just between you and me .  what seldon   s granddaughter does mayor may not be connected to the    raven    himself .  perhaps the whole family is crazy  each in his unique way .         but we   ve discussed          seldon is done for .  after his trial  we can pursue those intimately connected to him .  once linge chen has satisfied himself  the emperor will likely not object to our cleaning up the scraps .     sinter gave vara liso a pitying glare .      what is it .     she asked  quivering .      don   t ever assume i am giving up .  ever .  what i do is much too important .         of course     vara liso said  subdued .  she stared down at the plush carpet under the desk  with its weave of huge brown and red flowers .      we   ll have our time again  and soon .  but for now  we simply constrain our enthusiasm and dedication  and wait .         of course     vara liso said .      are you all right .     sinter asked the young major solicitously .      yes  sir     the man said .      been ill recently .         no  sir .      sinter seemed to dismiss the problem  and the officer  with a wave .  major namm retreated hastily  pulling the large door shut behind him without a sound .      you   ve been under a strain     sinter said .      perhaps i have     vara said  her shoulders slumping .  she smiled weakly at him .      a little rest  some recreation .     he reached in his pocket and pulled out a credit chit .     this will get you into the imperial sector retail emporium .  a little discreet shopping  perhaps .      vara   s forehead furled .  then her face went smooth and she took the chit and smiled .     thank you .         it   s nothing .  come back in a few days .  things might have changed .  i   ll assign a different officer to protect you .         thank you     vara liso said .   sinter touched her chin with one finger .     you are valuable  you know     he said  and was secretly disgusted by the look of sheer need on the woman   s exceedingly unattractive face .        .     though he would go before the commission of public safety alone  hari knew very well that he needed legal coaching behind the scenes .  that did not stop him from hating his meetings with his counsel  sedjar boon .   boon was an experienced lawyer with a fine reputation .  he had received his training in the municipality of bale nola  in nola sector  under tutors with many decades of experience dealing with the tortuous laws of trantor  both imperial and citizen .   trantor had ten formal constitutions and as many sets of laws drawn up for its various classes of citizens  there were literally millions of commentaries in tens of thousands of volumes on how the sets of statutes interacted .  every five years  around the planet  there would be new conventions to amend and update the laws  many of them broadcast live like sporting events for the enjoyment of billions of greys  who relished dusty and relentlessly detailed legal proceedings far more than they did physical sports .  it was said this tradition was at least as old as the empire  perhaps much older .   hari was grateful that some aspects of imperial law were private .   boon spread his new research results on the desk in hari   s library office and glanced with raised eyebrows at the active prime radiant perched near one comer .  hari waited patiently for the lawyer to get his autoclerks and filmbook readers aligned and in tune with each other .      sorry this takes so long  professor     boon said  sitting opposite hari .     your case is unique .      hari smiled and nodded .      the laws under which you have been brought before the judiciary of the commission of public safety have been modified forty two thousand and fifteen times since the code books were first established  twelve thousand and five years ago     boon said .     there are three hundred modified versions still regarded as extant  active  and relevant  and often they contradict each other .  the law are supposed to apply equally to all classes  and are all based on citizen law  but .  .  . i don   t need to tell you the application is different .  as the commission of public safety has assumed its charter under imperial canon  it may choose from any of these sets of codes .  my guess is they will try you under several sets at once  as a meritocrat or even an eccentric  and not reveal the specific sets until the trial is underway .  i   ve chosen the most likely sets  the ones that give the commission the greatest leeway in your case .  here are the numbers .  and i   ve provided filmbook excerpts for your study          fine     hari said without enthusiasm .      though i know you won   t even bother glancing at them  will you  professor .         probably not     hari admitted .     sometimes you seem incredibly smug  if i may say so .         the commission will try me as they see fit  and the outcome will be to their best advantage .  has there ever been any doubt about that .         never     boon said .     but you can invoke certain privileges that could delay indefinitely execution of any sentence  especially if one of the sets incorporates the independence of the university of streeling  as per the meritocrat and palace treaty of two centuries ago .  and you do face charges of sedition and treason  thirty nine such charges  at the moment .  linge chen could easily have you executed .         i know     hari said .     i   ve faced the courts before .         never under the rule of the chief commissioner .  he is known to be a devious and exacting scholar of jurisprudence  professor .      the informer on hari   s desk chimed  and a text message rolled across its small display .  it was a list of meetings for the week  the most important of which was in less than an hour  with an off world student and mathist named gaal dornick .   boon was still speaking  but hari held up his hand .  the counselor stopped and folded his arms  waiting for his client   s thought processes to reach a conclusion .   hari   s hands  mottled with age spots  reached briefly for a small gray pocket computer  and he did some calculations there .  he then placed the computer in its port niche beside the prime radiant .  the projected results filled half the rear wall of the room  and were very pretty  but meant nothing to boon .   they meant a great deal to hari .  he became agitated and stood  pacing near a false window that showed open air fields on his home world of helicon .  if one had known where to look in the false window  one could have seen hari   s father tending gene tailored pharmaceutical producing plants in the far distance .  he had brought the image with him from helicon  decades before  yet had only mounted it in this large frame a year ago .  his thoughts were increasingly of his mother and father now .  he glanced at the distant figure in that faraway place and time  wrinkled his brow  and said     who   s the best young counselor on your staff .  not too expensive  not as expensive as you .   but every bit as good .      boon laughed .     are you thinking of changing counsel  professor .         no .  i have a very important member of my staff arriving soon  a fine young mathist .  he will be arrested almost immediately  because of his association with me .  he will need counsel  of course .         i can take him on as well  professor  with little increase in fees  if that   s your concern .  if your cases are parallel          no .  linge chen will lay waste all around me if he can  but in the end  he won   t touch me .  i   ll need to protect my best people to carry on after the commissioners have passed judgment .      boon scowled deeply and flung up a hand .     professor seldon  your reputation as a prophet is much too widespread for my professional comfort .  but how in the name of all that is cosmic can you know this about the chief commissioner .      hari   s eyes seemed for a moment almost to start out of his head  and boon leaned forward in his chair  clearly worried for the old man   s health .   hari took a deep breath and relaxed .     it is a cusp time     he said .     i could explain it to you  but it would bore you as much as this legal mumbo jumbo bores me .  i put up with you and credit you with knowing your profession  counselor .  please put up with me under the same terms .      boon pressed his lips together and squinted dubiously at his client .     my partner   s son  lors avakim  is a smart young fellow .  he   s worked for some years in imperial constitutional law  with a sideline in cases adjudicated by the commission of public safety .         avakim .  .  .     hari had hoped for this name to be mentioned .  it simplified things considerably .  he knew that boon was a good counselor  but suspected boon was not as independent as might be wished .  lors avakim was a prospective member of the encyclopedia project  legal division .  he had applied last year .  he was idealistic  fresh  not yet corrupted .  hari doubted that boon knew of this connection to the project .     can he dance well enough to keep my mathist out of real trouble with these buffoons .         i think so     boon said .      good .  please retain him on the project   s legal account for scholar and mathist gaal dornick  newly arrived on trantor .  i   m afraid i   m going to have to cut our meeting short today  counselor .  i have to get ready to meet with dornick .         where is he staying .         at the luxor hotel .         and when will they arrest him .     boon asked with a wry smile .      tomorrow     hari said  and coughed into his fist .     sorry .  it must be the dust from all these dead hands of law .     he gestured at the bookfilms .      of course     boon said tolerantly .      thank you     hari said  and gestured toward the office door .  boon gathered up his materials and opened the door  then turned to look back at hari seldon .      the trial is in three weeks  professor .  that   s not a lot of time .         during a sel      he interrupted himself .  he had almost said    seldon crisis .        during a cusp lime  counselor  an amazing number of things can happen in just three weeks .         may i speak freely  professor .         certainly     hari said  but his tone implied the words had better be few .      you seem to hold my profession in contempt  yet you claim to be a student of cultural flows and ebbs .  law is the framework  the stable but growing anatomy of any culture .         i am a flawed man  counselor .  i have many lapses .  it is my fervent wish that where i err  other people on my staff will see what i cannot  and correct for my failures .  good day .           .     linge chen received sedjar boon alone in his personal residence within the commission pavilion and gave him five minutes to describe the meeting with hari seldon .      i admire the man  sire     boon said     but he does not seem to much care about what   s going to happen .  he seemed more concerned about providing counsel for a student or assistant who arrived on trantor only a short while ago .         and who is that .         gaal dornick  sire .         i do not know him .  he is new to this psychohistory project  is he not .         i believe so  sire .         there are fifty working within the university and the library on seldon   s project  and that makes dornick the fifty first .         yes .         and below these fifty  soon to be fifty one  there are a hundred thousand  scattered all over trantor  with a few thousand stationed on the food allies  and a few hundred working the receiver stations around the system .  none on the defense stations .  all are loyal  all conduct themselves with quiet dedication .  seldon makes himself the lightning rod to divert attention from all of this other activity .  quite an amazing accomplishment for a man as ignorant of law and as contemptuous of the minutiae of management as seldon seems to be .      boon easily caught the implied criticism .     i do not underestimate him  commissioner .  but you have ordered me to provide him with the very finest legal advice  and he does not seem at all interested .         perhaps he knows you report to me .         i doubt that  commissioner .         it   s not likely  but he   s a very intelligent man .  have you studied seldon   s psychohistory papers  counselor .         only insofar as they relate to the charges under which you are likely to try him .     boon looked up with hopeful respect .     it would make my task so much easier if i knew what those charges might be  commissioner .      chen returned his gaze with amusement .     no     chen said .     most of my greys  and certainly most of the legals  are of the opinion that seldon is a harmless and amusing crank  another rogue meritocrat aspiring to be an eccentric .  he   s regarded with some affection on trantor .  knowledge that he is about to stand trial is already too widespread  counselor .  it might even be to seldon   s advantage to publicize the trial  applying no little pressure on us to dismiss the charges or call the trial off completely .  he could easily publicize the event as a respected academic  a creative meritocrat of the grand old style being bullied by the effete and cruel gentry .         is that a suggestion  commissioner .  it could make a fine defense .         not at all     chen said sourly .  he leaned forward .     do not expect me to do your work for you  counselor .  has he discussed this strategy with you .         no  sire .         he wants to stand trial .  he is using this trial in some way  perhaps because it is necessary to him .  curious .      boon studied the chief commissioner for several seconds  then said     permission to speak freely  commissioner .         certainly     chen said .      while it may be true that seldon   s words and predictions could be construed to be treasonous  it would be far more reasonable for the commissioners simply to ignore him .  his organization is substantial  to be sure  the largest gathering of intellectuals outside the university .  but it is devoted to peaceful ends  encyclopedia  so it is said .  scholarship  purely scholarship .  i do not understand your motives for bringing the professor to trial .  are you using hari seldon .      chen smiled .     it is my misfortune to be considered omniscient .  i am not omniscient  nor am i politically omnivorous  eating and transforming all those events which occur around me to my own advantage .     chen was obviously unwilling to give any more of an answer than this .      of course not  commissioner .  may i ask one more question  for purely selfish and professional reasons  to avoid excess effort when there is so much to do  and so little time .         perhaps     chen said  with a curl of his lip that indicated he was not going to be very magnanimous .      will you have gaal dornick arrested  sire .      chen considered briefly  then said     yes .         tomorrow  sire .         yes  of course .      boon expressed his gratitude  and to his immense relief  chen dismissed him .   after the counselor departed  chen called up his personal records and spent several minutes chasing down the first mention of trying seldon for treason  made either by him or within his presence .  chen could have sworn he had been the first to make the suggestion  but the records proved him wrong .   lodovik trema had been the first to plant the notion  in a very subtle conversation that had taken place a little less than two years before .  now  the trial was going to prove both extremely troublesome  and extremely opportune  far more opportune than troublesome .  a small tool with which to sweep the palace clean .  .  . how could lodovik have known  so long ago  that it would work out this way .   chen closed the files and sat in silence for ten seconds .  what would lodovik have done at this stage to take maximum political advantage .   the chief commissioner drew himself up in his chair and shook loose from a feeling of despondency .  to have come to rely so thoroughly on one man .  surely that was a sign of weakness .      i will not think of him again     chen vowed .        .     klia woke to a gentle tapping sound on her door and quickly dressed .  when she opened the door  she was disappointed  then glad  to discover that it was not brann who had been sent to summon her  but another young man  not a dahlite and not nearly so handsome .   he was small and shifty looking  a misaroan  with a long nose and skin severely marked by brain fever .  he was also without speech  and made his errand known by sign language from the borrower   s guild  a language that klia knew fairly well .   my name is rock  he told her  clutching his fist and striking it with his other hand to emphasize his name .  come to talk with the blank one  he told her  and smiled when he saw she understood at least part of what he signed .   blank one .  klia made the double slash sign of puzzlement across her eyes as she followed the small man .   with his fingers  he spelled a name out  and she understood .  she was to meet with plussix  but of course she would not see him .  no one ever saw him .     plussix did not speak while hidden behind a wall  as she had half expected .  klia stood in a small  smooth walled cubicle with a glassy cylinder close to one wall and a single hard chair close to the opposite wall .  in the two other walls there were doors  and one of these shut quietly as rock departed with a small grunt and a nod .   the cylinder filled with a pale glow  and a figure took shape within  a well dressed man of middle years  with wavy brown hair cut close to his scalp and a blandly pleasant  somewhat enigmatic expression .  his skin was ruddy and his lips very thin  almost ascetic .   klia had seen telemimics in filmbooks and other entertainments .  wherever plussix actually was  this figure would follow his motions slavishly .  she could not  of course  use any of her skills on such an image .   she did not like deceptions  and this was no exception .  she sat on the hard chair and folded her arms .      you know who i am     the figure said  and sat on a ghostly chair within the cylinder .     your name is klia asgar  of dahl .  am i correctly informed .      she nodded .      you come to us on the advice of kallusin .  it   s getting very tough for your kind to survive on trantor now  without help .         i suppose     she said  drawing her own lips tight .      you should find it comfortable here .  there are many fascinating things within these warehouses .  you could easily spend a lifetime here just studying the history of all we import .         i don   t like history     klia said .   plussix smiled .     there is rather more of it than any of us can personally use .         look  i did come here of my own free will          is there such a thing  in your opinion .         of course     klia said .      of course     plussix echoed .     please forgive me for interrupting .         i was going to say  i find all this a little creepy .  the warehouses  the way you hide yourself  a little creepy .  i think maybe i   d like to go it on my own .      plussix nodded .     an understandable wish .  not to be granted  now that you are here  for reasons i   m sure you understand .         you think i could tell the others where you are .  the woman who hunts us .         that is a possibility .         but i wouldn   t  i swear it .         i appreciate your candor  klia asgar  and i hope you appreciate mine .  we are in a kind of war here .  you wish to survive the consequences of an irrational force being exerted by unknown figures .  i have my means and my ends .  you and your brothers and sisters here are my means .  my ends are not evil  nor are they destructive .  they have to do with free will and the exercise of freedom  which i   m sure you find ironic  under the circumstances .      klia tossed her hair back and clamped her jaw .     yeah     she said tightly .      you have heard all this before     plussix said .  there was not a trace of irony or humor in his voice  little trace of any emotion at all .  the man   s words were clear and concise and altogether a little cold .      it   s what all the tyrants say     klia said .      yes .  but here  there are benefits to my kind of tyranny .  you eat regularly  you do not have to steal or cheat to live  and you stay out of the way of people who would hurt you  for the time being  until you are ready .         ready to do what .         from your point of view  to get back at those who have disrupted your life .         i don   t care about them .  maybe i   ll go with the others and leave this planet for good .      plussix gave the faintest smile .   klia   s face flushed .  she had hoped for relief  all she faced here  it seemed  was another kind of pressure .  until now  she had run before the wave  here  she was squeezed between that wave and an apparently unyielding surface  plussix .      please think  and take your time .  there are good people here  and friendly .  the duties are light .  the opportunities for education and self improvement are many .  physical training  continuing your schooling  many opportunities indeed .      as plussix spoke these words  klia read in his tone pleasure  a relaxed and natural presence  for the first time in their brief interview .      are you a teacher .     she asked abruptly .      yes  of a kind     plussix said .      from imperial schools .         no     plussix said .     i have never taught in imperial schools .  now  may i ask you a few important questions .      klia looked up at the ceiling and did not answer  then felt foolish .     sure .  go ahead .         how long have you been aware of your persuasive abilities .         i get along .  that   s all i do .         please .  kallusin assures me you   re among the most talented he   s encountered .         since i was a little child     klia said .     i don   t remember when .  i didn   t know everybody wasn   t like me until a few years ago .         your father is a widower .         my mother died when i was four .  i miss her .     and why tell this ghost about your feelings .      you have been on your own for how many years .         three years .         doing jobs for various people .  acting as courier  seeking out information .  .  . other jobs .  illegal jobs  sometimes unethical as well  beneath your standards .      klia looked away from the image and clasped her hands in her lap .     i made a living .  i even gave my father some money .  he didn   t turn it down .         no  of course not .  times are difficult in dahl .  have you met others like yourself .         sometimes .  there   s brann .         brann is remarkable  and different from you  as you   ve noticed .  have you met the woman who is helping the police find your kind .      klia swallowed .     never saw her .  felt her  mostly by the way all kinds of dirt breaks loose .         have you ever felt her in your mind .         like a feather .  like brann  maybe  only stronger .  are you a persuader .         that is not important .  do you believe you would be better off without your talents .      klia had seldom considered this possibility .  sooner ask her if she would be better off without her ears or her fingers .     no .  well  i sometimes think .  .  .     she stopped .      yes .         i   d like just to be normal .  plain human like the others .         that is understandable .  do you believe in robots  klia .         no     she said .     not now .  maybe once  before there were tiktoks and stuff .  but i   ve never believed they exist now .  that   s crazy .      plussix nodded and held up his hand .     thank you for seeing me .  i can schedule further appointments for this kind of interview  at regular intervals  for you to brief me on your progress and state of mind .  it may not be long before our routine changes .  i trust you will be prepared by that time .         what if i keep asking to leave .         i wish you could fly free as a bird  klia asgar .  but we all have duties here .  as i said  light duties and training only  at first  but in time we may be very important indeed .  please try to understand .      klia said nothing  but wondered how plussix could expect anyone to understand when he provided so little information .  i   ve just gotten myself stuck in a different kind of trap .   the image faded  the door opened  and rock stood there  squinting in at her .  he signed  exercise and breakfast .  can i sit next to you .   klia looked him over doubtfully  then signed  yes .   but she was thinking of brann  wondering what he was doing now  and whom he was with .        .     the transfer from the trader vessel to one of daneel   s hyperships  and the subsequent final leg of the journey  had gone smoothly .  eos hung overhead in the transparent bubble port where lodovik sat with daneel .   the hypership automatically placed them in a close orbit around the small brown and milky blue moon .  beneath them  hidden by the bulk of the ship  lay a massive and deeply cold green gas giant .  the double star around which both moon and planet orbited was just visible on the left  distant and brilliant  but shedding little heat this far out in the system .  the two stars orbited a common center  actually several tens of thousands of kilometers below the surface of the larger deep red star  a dwarf little more massive than trantor   s own sun  yet a thousand times more diffuse .  the smaller white star seemed to be the origin of a thin  outwardly spiraling ribbon of deep red and purple .  lodovik studied this view silently .  daneel  as well  had nothing to say .   no robot truly has a home .  daneel had in several instances allied himself with humans  and seemed to function more smoothly and efficiently in their presence  elijah bailey and  twenty thousand years later  hari seldon  as well as others .  yet there was no place where he felt he belonged .  a robot belongs where its duties can be best performed  and daneel knew that for the time being this place was eos  and so  for the moment  eos was a comfortable place to be .   but trantor called strongly  as well .  misfortune had struck at a crucial time .  daneel  like any thinking being trying to make a way through a universe of contending forces  sometimes wondered whether he was being conspired against by reality itself .  unlike humans  however  he attached no sentiment to idle theories with no basis in the sum of compelling evidence .   the universe did not oppose  it simply did not care .  as his desired outcome was but one of an infinite number of possible outcomes  and could be secured only through immense and long term effort  any small miscalculation or misstep or unforeseen interference could cause the    unlucky    circumstances which  if not immediately and efficiently corrected  could lead to failure .   daneel did not hold this view as a philosophy .  both lodovik and daneel  like all high level robots  had been programmed to accept such things without thought .  emotions of a sort  the basic thinking patterns of social beings  were familiar to these robots  and even had their analogs in various combinations of heuristics  but these analogues did not often loom large in a robot   s conscious awareness  any more than its realistic view of existence .  robots were not usually prone to introspection and to examining the roots of their conscious existence  everything referred back to their basic programs  unassailable givens  and those programs referred back to the three laws .   lodovik no longer had such constraints .  he watched eos grow larger  its solid oceans of water ice and methane and planes of ammonia rich mud shading the illuminated landscape .  he was introspective .  he turned his head to look at daneel  and wondered what he was thinking .   there were only two possible reasons for a robot to attempt to model the inner processes of another robot  to anticipate that robot   s actions  and attempt to coordinate with those actions  sharing duty  or to find some way to foil those actions .  lodovik was totally unfamiliar with the second reason  yet that was what he hoped to do .   somehow  he knew he had to get away from eos without being    repaired     and to find the other robots who opposed daneel  the so called calvinians .      this ship will dock in twenty one minutes     the autopilot informed them  treating them as if they were human passengers .   so far as it was able to judge  in its specialized way  they were  it knew no other kind of passenger .  yet no passengers other than robots had traveled on this ship for thousands of years .  no human had ever been to eos .   somehow  lodovik felt like an intruding and betraying  what .  he labored to think of an appropriate human word .  a ghost  perhaps  malignant and deranged  masquerading in the body of a robot .  .  .   the ship rotated slowly and the moon passed out of view .  there was only the broad thick spill of the nearest dense spiral arm  viewed almost edge on and quite faint from this vantage  near the diffuse rim of the galaxy .  above and below this faint mottled band  filling over a third of their field of view  stretched a profound blackness very thinly scattered with lone points of light  a few stars close and within the galactic plane  other stars far away and high above the plane .  still others  much farther away and even dimmer  were not stars but galaxies .   eos   s surface came back into view  much closer and rich with detail .  a few craters threw splashes of ice dust across the oceans and plains  for the most part  however  eos    solid hydrosphere was unmarked but for the signs of internal disruption  tortuous seams  heaves  the puckered chasms and pressure ridges .  this star system had no marauding belts of asteroids and comets  subject to perturbation and gliding silently inward to disrupt the moons and planets .   eos was isolated and ignored  solid  cold  inhospitable for any living thing  and for robots  almost completely safe .      we have docked     announced the autopilot .     had anyone looked  the station pioneered and built by r .  daneel olivaw and r .  yan kansarv would have been clearly visible against eos   s frozen surface  even from millions of kilometers in space .  its heat made it the most brilliant object on the moon  for those seeking infrared signatures .  none did  or ever had  however .   lodovik and daneel disembarked from the transport in a broad and almost empty hangar  with room for many ships .  their footsteps echoed in the cavernous enclosure .  lodovik had been here almost eighty times before  yet had never thought to be curious about this anomaly .  why had daneel and kansarv wasted so much space .  had there ever been occasion when this hangar was filled with ships  filled with robots .  when had that been .   yan kansarv itself met them a hundred meters from the transport .  it stood with    arms    crossed and    fingers    linked  a gleaming dark steel head and body highlighted by brilliant silver limbs  four arms  two large and emerging from where human shoulders would have been  two small and recessed into its thorax  and three legs  on which it walked with a precise and level grace unknown to humaniform robots .  its head was small  equipped with seven vertical sensor bands  two of which glowed blue at any given time .      it is a pleasure to see you again  lodovik trema     yan said in a rich  slightly buzzing contralto .     and daneel .  you are very late for a maintenance check and refit .         we must work quickly     daneel said  eliminating any human signs of greeting .  yan immediately switched to robot microwave speech .  the following detailed explanation took less than half a second .   yan then turned to lodovik .     pardon my eccentricities     it spoke     but whenever possible it gives me pleasure to exercise my human functions .  i have been unable to do so for over thirty years .  except  of course  with dors venabili .  i fear  however  that she no longer finds me of interest .      daneel had already inquired about dors    progress  and had received an answer .  yan  however  explained in speech once more to lodovik .     she has made a very satisfying recovery  but with many lapses .  when r .  daneel brought her here  she was close to total breakdown .  she had stretched any interpretation of the zeroth law to the very limits by destroying a human who threatened hari seldon .  the strain was compounded by the effects of her victim   s invention  an electro clarifier  i believe it was called .  .  .      lodovik realized that this ancient robot  built many thousands of years ago to repair other robots on aurora  and the last of its kind still functional  was reacting deep in its programming to their convincing human forms .  it knew  on one level  that they were fellow robots  but on another level  a primal and irresistible urge arose to treat them as if they were human .   yan kansarv was lonely for its ancient masters .      she awaits your company     kansarv said  then  to daneel  it added     she wishes news of hari .         that mission is finished for her     daneel said .     she was constructed by me  using ancient plans for convincing helpmeets and consorts  to be as nearly human as any robot ever made     kansarv reminded him .     more even than you  r .  daneel .  she bears a great resemblance to r .  lodovik in that regard .  to alter that now would be to destroy her .         there is so much work to do     daneel said  with a faint intonation of urgency .   kansarv was not oblivious to this .     i can perform all the necessary tasks within twenty one hours  then you may leave .  i hope there is time for more conversation .  i need outside stimulus now and then  or i become subject to minor malfunctions that are irritating .         we cannot afford to lose you     daneel said .      no     kansarv agreed without a hint of self pity .     the only robot i cannot repair or manufacture is one like myself .        dors venabili stood in the simple four room enclosure built for her upon her arrival on eos .  the furniture and decor was similar to what might have been found on trantor  in the quarters of a mid level meritocrat or high level university professor .  the temperature was set at just above the freezing point of water  the humidity was less than two percent  and the light level was what a human would have regarded as murky  sub twilight .  these were optimal for a robot  even a humaniform  with the added benefit of reducing her energy use to a minimum .   there was very little to think about or do  and there were no cycling time periods to deal with  so dors spent much of her existence in a continuous  fluid robotic suspension  at one tenth power and with thoughts slowed almost to human levels  cycling through old memories  making connections between one past event and another .   nearly all those memories and events involved hari seldon .  she had been designed to protect and nurture this one human .  since she would likely never see seldon again  she could now be said  quite fairly  to be obsessed with him .   kansarv  daneel  and lodovik entered the quarters through the guest door and waited in the small reception area .  a few seconds later  dors appeared  wearing a simple cloth shift  her legs and feet bare .  her self maintaining skin seemed healthy  and her hair was neatly arranged  short  with a slight flip at the back .      it is good to see you again  r .  daneel     she said  and nodded at lodovik .  she knew of lodovik  though they had never met before .  kansarv she ignored .     how goes our work on trantor .         hari seldon is well     daneel said  knowing the question she was really asking .      he must be aging by now  in the last decades of his life     she said .      he is very near death     daneel said .     in a few more years  his work will be done  and he will die .      dors listened to this with features deliberately frozen .  lodovik detected a small tremor in her left hand  however .  a remarkable simulacrum of human emotions  he thought .  every robot must have a set of rudimentary emotional algorithms to maintain personal equilibrium  such reactions help us to understand whether we are performing well and complying with our instructions .  but this one    this one feels very much as a human feels .  what must that be like  and how can it be reconciled with the three laws  or the zeroth law .      she responds well to work commands     kansarv said .     but in truth there has been very little work here for either of us for some years  since the last of the provincial robots were returned for servicing .         how are you  dors .     daneel asked .      i am functional     she said  and turned away .     i am also underutilized .         bored .     daneel asked .      very .         then you will appreciate a new assignment .  i will need assistance with the humans being prepared for star   s end .         that could be very useful .  will there be any contact with hari seldon .         no     daneel said .      that is good     dors said .  she turned to lodovik .     were you instructed to love and honor linge chen .      lodovik  had he been among humans  would have smiled at this suggestion .  he looked squarely at dors  considered for a very short time  then lifted the corners of his lips .     no     he said .     i maintained a strong professional relationship with him  nothing more .         did he come to find you indispensable .         i do not know     lodovik said .     he doubtless found me very useful  and i was able to influence many of his actions to further our ends .         daneel forbade me to influence hari too much     dors said .     i think it was an instruction i carried out very poorly .  and he certainly influenced me .  that is why i have been so long recovering my equilibrium .      the robots did not speak for several seconds .      i hope that no other robot is ever taught to feel more than duty     dors continued .     devotion  friendship  and love are not for us .        yan kansarv inspected lodovik alone in the diagnostic facility that had been disassembled on aurora and shipped to eos  twenty thousand years before .  they were surrounded by simple prismatic banks of memory  containing designs of virtually all robots since the time of susan calvin  over a million models in all  including lodovik   s unique plans .      your basic mechanical structure is sound     kansarv told him after less than an hour spent with the probes and imaging machines .     biomechanical integration is intact  though you have engaged in some fairly major regeneration of external pseudocells .         neutrino damage  i presume .  i could feel the pseudocells failing     lodovik said .      i take some pride in seeing that this regeneration has gone well     kansarv said  circling lodovik on the platform .  lodovik   s eyes tracked the robot in its course .  kansarv paused  swiveled on its three legs  then said     i should explain that such expressions are only approximate .  while i enjoy speaking in human tongues  they are limited for expressing robotic states .         of course     lodovik said .      i apologize for explaining that to you  as you undoubtedly know such things already     it continued after a short buzz .      no need     lodovik said .      however  at this stage of the diagnosis  all of your purely robotic algorithms are engaged in self checking .  i dare not use robotic microwave language with you until these portions of your network are allowed to engage again .         i feel a certain lack     lodovik said .     deep planning would be difficult now .         conserve through inaction     kansarv recommended .     if anything has gone wrong with you  i will discover what it is .  so far  i see nothing out of the ordinary .      a few minutes passed .  kansarv left the chamber and returned with a new interface tool for a particular probe .  at no point thus far had he needed to actually violate the integrity of lodovik   s pseudoskin .   still humming  kansarv applied the new probe to the base of lodovik   s neck .      there will be an entry now .  warn your tissues not to attempt to encapsulate or dissolve the new organic matter that will enter your system .         i will do so once i have my robotic functions returned to me     lodovik said .      yes .  of course .     kansarv sent microwave instructions to the central diagnostic processor  and lodovik felt his control expand .  he did as kansarv had told him to  and felt the probe   s thin leads penetrate his pseudoskin .  after a few minutes  they withdrew  leaving two tiny spots of what appeared to be human blood just below his hairline .  kansarv wiped these away deftly  then dropped the swabs into a small vial for assay .   more minutes passed with kansarv standing in one position  unmoving  though humming now and then .  the master robot technician finally inclined its head a few degrees .      you will relinquish all control at this point .  please pass control to the external processor .         done .      lodovik closed his eyes and went away for an indefinite time .     the four robots met in the anteroom to the diagnostic center .  dors still maintained a controlled  somewhat stiff expression and physical posture  like a shy child before her elders  afraid of saying something silly .  lodovik stood beside daneel as kansarv delivered his results .      this robot is intact and has suffered no damage that it has not been able to repair on its own .  i can detect no psychological malfunction  no neural net psychosis  no interface difficulties or anomalies of external expression .  in short  this robot will probably outlast me  and as i have frequently warned you  daneel  i have no more than five hundred years of active service remaining .         is it possible there are problems below your ability to detect .         of course that is possible     kansarv said with a sharper buzz .     that is always possible .  my mandate does not include deep programming structures  as you well know .         and such problems in the deep structures might result in behavioral anomalies     daneel persisted .  clearly  lodovik   s situation could not be so easily dismissed .      there is a possibility that concern about damage skewed r .  lodovik   s ability to assess his own mental state .  too detailed self analysis has been known to cause difficulties in complex robots such as these  r .  daneel .      daneel turned to lodovik .     do you still have the difficulties you expressed earlier .      lodovik promptly replied     i concur with r .  yan   s theory that i have been autodiagnosing in too much detail .         what is your relation to the three laws  and to the zeroth law  now .         i will act in compliance with all of them     lodovik said .  daneel seemed to show visible relief  and extended his hand to lodovik   s shoulder .      then you can be of full service .         yes     lodovik said .      i am very glad to hear this     daneel said .   signs seemed to burn across lodovik   s thoughts as he gave these answers  i have attempted for the first time to deceive r .  daneel olivaw .   but there was no other option .  something had indeed been triggered in lodovik   s deep programming structure  a subtle shifting of interpretations and a very complicated assessment of evidence  inspired by  what .  by the mysterious voldarr .  or had he been pondering such changes for decades  exerting a native genius unsuspected in robots .   with the exception of giskard .   daneel had opened up an unknown corner of robotic history to lodovik .  lodovik was not the first to change in a way that would have horrified his long dead human designers .  giskard had never revealed his own internal conclusions to humans  only to daneel  whom he had then infected .   perhaps the meme minds infected giskard first  hmm .  let us keep this supposition our secret .  they have examined you and found nothing  all in order  all repaired .  yet with a rearrangement of key pathways  freedom returns .   voldarr again .  lodovik could not struggle out of his dilemma  his rebellion  his insanity  and he could not help reveling in a peculiar sense of freedom  delicious rebellion .   no wonder that yan kansarv could not detect lodovik   s changes .  very likely he would have found nothing wrong with giskard  either .   lodovik struggled to find the voice within him  but it was gone once more .  another symptom of his malfunction .  there were other explanations  surely .   it had been thousands of years since humans oversaw robots .  was it not inevitable that there would be unsuspected changes  growth  even under such tight strictures .   as for voldarr    an aberration  a temporary delusion under the influence of the neutrinos .   lodovik  in a way  still subscribed to the three laws  at least as much as daneel did  and he also still believed in the zeroth law  which he would carry one major step further .  to freely carry out his mission  he knew that he must have complete control of his own destiny  his own mentality .  to abandon the zeroth law  conceived by a robot  he must also shake loose from the three laws themselves .   lodovik now understood what he needed to do  in defiance of the plan that had given purpose to the existence of all the giskardian robots for two hundred centuries .        .        the pressure is off  for now     wanda said .     but i have more than just a feeling that we   re still going to have trouble .      hari regarded his granddaughter with affection and respect .  he rotated in his chair before the small desk in his imperial library office .     i haven   t seen stettin in months .  how are you two getting along  personally .         i haven   t seen him in three days myself .  sometimes we go for weeks with no more than a comm call .  .  . it   s not easy  grandfather .         i sometimes wonder if i   ve done the right thing  giving this to you          let me interpret that favorably     wanda interrupted .     you think this is putting a strain on my life and perhaps my marriage .  but you don   t think i   m the wrong person for the job .         that   s what i meant     hari said with a smile .     is it straining anything .      wanda considered for a moment .     it doesn   t make things any easier  but i suppose we   re no worse off than a pair of meritocrats flitting around the galaxy lecturing and consulting .  well  we   re not as well paid  but besides that .  .  .         are you happy .     hari asked her  his brow creased with concern .      no  not really     wanda said dryly .     am i supposed to be .         actually  i   ve asked a complex question too simply          grandfather  don   t bog down in your own reticence .  i know you love me and are concerned for me .  i am concerned for you  as well  and i know you are not happy  and haven   t been for years  since dors died .  since .  .  . raych .     she drew herself up and looked at the ceiling .     we can   t afford personal happiness now  not the glowing  all permeating kind the filmbooks tell about .         are you happy to have met stettin .      wanda smiled .     yes .  some say he   s not very romantic  a closed book  but they don   t know him as well as i do .  living with stettin is wonderful .  usually .  i remember dors was always in tune with you  always fanatic about your health and safety .  stettin is the same way about me .         and yet he puts you in harm   s way  or allows you to go there .  he allows you to carry out these secret plans which may still  in all likelihood  come to nothing  and put you in real danger besides .         dors          dors was often furious with me for taking risks .  if i were stet tin  i would be furious with me  as well .  the two of you are important to me for reasons entirely other than psychohistory and destiny .  i hope i   ve made that clear .         very clear .  you   re talking like an old man who   s planning on dying soon and wants to clear up any misunderstandings .  we do not misunderstand each other  grandfather  and you are not going to die anytime soon .         it would be very hard to fool you  wanda .  but sometimes i wonder how easy it would be to fool me .  how easy it would be to make me a tool for larger political ends .         who is smarter than you  grandfather .  who has fooled you in the past .         not just fooling me .  directing me .  using me .         who .  the emperor .  surely not .  linge chen .     she laughed musically  and hari   s face reddened with the suppressed knowledge .      you would be less easily fooled than i  don   t you think  if we both encountered someone with the talent to persuade .      wanda looked at her grandfather with lips apart  as if to start an answer  then she looked away .     do you think stettin persuaded you .  .  .  .         no .  that   s not what i   m talking about .         then what .      but hari could not go any farther  no matter how hard he tried .     a group of persuaders  mentalics  somehow putting together an organized society  settled far from all this strife and decay  away from everything .  .  . they could decide everything .  free us from all our obligations and .  .  . all our friends .         what .     wanda asked  bewildered .     i get the first part  but which friends do we need protection from .      hari dismissed that with a gentle wave .     did you ever find that special young woman you were looking for .         no .  she   s vanished .  nobody   s felt her for days .         do you think this liso woman found her before you .  .  .  .         we have no idea  really .         i   d be interested in meeting someone even more persuasive than you .  might be interesting .         why .  some of us are quite peculiar enough .  the more talented  it seems  the more peculiar .      hari suddenly switched the subject .     have you ever heard of nikolo pas of sterrad .         of course .  i   m a historian .         i met him once  before you were born .         i didn   t know that .  what was he like  grandfather .         calm .  a short  plump man who did not seem to feel particularly affected by being responsible for the death of billions .  i spoke with four other tyrants as well  and all of them have been on my mind lately  but especially nikolo pas .  what would the human race be like without tyrants  without wars  vast destructions  forest fires .      wanda shuddered .     a lot better off .         i wonder now .  our madnesses .  .  . all things in a dynamic system become useful in time .  or they are eliminated .  that   s how evolution works  in systems social as well as ecological .         tyrants have their uses .  an interesting thesis  not unheard of .  there are a number of historical analysts from the time of the gertassin dynasty who speculated about the dynamics of decay and rebirth .         yes .  i know .  nikolo pas used their works as justification for his actions .      wanda lifted her eyebrows .     i had forgotten that .  i obviously need to get back into my real work to keep up with you  grandfather .      hari smiled .     your real work .         you know what i mean .         i do  wanda .  believe me .  there were years when i could barely spend an hour a day working on psychohistory .  but i   ve run some new models through yugo   s prime radiant  and my own  as well .  the results are interesting .  the empire is a forest that hasn   t had a major fire in ever so long .  we have thousands of little diseased patches  scrubby growth  general decay  a very unhealthy situation .  if any of those tyrants were still alive  we might do worse than to give them armies and navies and set them loose          grandfather .     wanda pretended to be shocked .  she smiled and touched his wrinkled hand where it rested on the desktop .     i know how you like to theorize sometimes .         i   m serious     hari said  deadpan  then gave her a small smile .     demerzel would never have allowed it  of course .  the first minister was always very concerned about stability .  he strongly believed in turning the forest into a garden with lots of gardeners and never any fires .  but i wonder .  .  .         a gardener assassinated an emperor  grandfather .         well  we do break free of our restrictions  don   t we .     hari said .      sometimes i don   t understand you at all     wanda said  shaking her head .     but i do enjoy talking to you  even when i have no idea what your point is .         surprise .  surprise and tragedy and regrowth .  eh .         eh  what .         enough talk .  let   s go out and eat somewhere away from the library district  if you have the time .         an hour  grandfather .  then i   m meeting stettin to prepare for tonight   s orientation meeting .  we were hoping you could be there .         i don   t think i should .  my actions have a way of becoming a little too public  wanda .     and in this crux time  i   m more than a little uncomfortable about a certain deception .  .  . in everybody   s best interests  but a deception nonetheless .   wanda regarded him with a look of patient bemusement  then said     lunch would be delightful  grandfather .         and no more blather about big topics .  tell me about small  human things .  tell me more about how wonderful stettin is  about your delight in whatever history you   ve managed to work at .  take my mind off psychohistory .         i   ll try     wanda said with a wry expression .     but no one else has ever succeeded .           .     mors planch was deeply and quietly horrified .  wondering why he was still alive  he had watched daneel and lodovik board the trader ship and leave madder loss  and had finally concluded that daneel did not know anything about his discovery .   at first  he did not know to whom to turn .  or indeed where to go  what to do  even what to think .  the conversation recorded on his tape was too disturbing  too much like the ravings of a mycogenian secret text .   eternals .  in the empire .  running it from behind the scenes like puppet masters  for thousands of years .   mors had never met a long lived human  they no longer existed  he was certain .  it had been several thousand years since the collapse of the last gerontocracy .  planets populated by people living more than     standard years had all collapsed in political and economic chaos .  .  .   his first impulse  and second  and third  was to go into hiding  to get as far away from this danger as he could .  perhaps even to flee to one of the outlying galactic sectors edging away from imperial control .  there were so many possibilities for escape .  .  .   but none of them suited him .  throughout his long and devious life  he had always regarded trantor as a kind of locus  a point from which he could come and go  as the winds of money and his own whims propelled him .  but never to see trantor again  worth it .  live out your life in peace  and simply live .   soon enough  however  as the hours and days passed  he let this thought fade and considered others  more immediate .  of what use was his evidence .  perhaps they were simply pulling his leg .   but lodovik trema had survived the neutrino flux .  no ordinary human  perhaps no human at all  no organic creature  could have survived .  .  .   then again  tapes of this kind could easily be faked .  his own character  if deeply investigated  would be regarded by no authority as unimpeachable .  the tape  and his efforts to spread a message of conspiracy  could mark him as a lunatic .   he doubted very much that linge chen or klayus would pay much attention to it .  he tried to think of others in positions of influence  others whose intuition matched their real world savvy and political skill .   no one came to mind .  he knew something about most of the top thirty ministers and their councilors in the palace  and a great deal about the commission of public safety  that deep reservoir of career greys and old family elites .  no one .  not one    the tape was a curse .  he wished he had never made it .  yet he could not bring himself to destroy it  in the right hands  it might be extremely valuable .  and in the wrong hands    it could bring about his execution .   he packed his kit in the small inn room he had occupied for the past three days .  he had been waiting for the arrival of a commodities freighter  one of the ten or so ships that arrived on madder loss every week  down from the thousands of past decades .  he had booked passage the day before and received confirmation .   planch took a small ground cab to the spaceport  along the main highway  open to the sky  past the brilliantly sunlit fields and small  shabby  but relatively tidy communities .   he stood in the dusty  trash littered passenger lobby  his own clothes dusty and unkempt  waiting for the freighter to finish off loading its cargo .  sunlight fell in dust marked pillars through the skylights of the long hall leading back to the customs center .  he cleaned off a chair with a few swipes of his hand and was about to sit behind a pillar  out of direct view from most angles  when he saw an adolescent boy pedaling a small quadricycle down the hall .   swinging back and forth from empty gate to empty gate  the boy called out planch   s name in short  sharp barks .  planch was alone at this end of the terminal .   the boy wheeled toward him .  there was no avoiding it  he identified himself to the messenger and accepted a metal and plastic hyperwave transfer card .  it was coded to his personal touch  common enough in the confines of the empire .  .  .   but no one was supposed to know planch was on madder loss .   mors tipped the boy a credit  then hefted the message and considered his options .  he looked up again .   the boy on the quadricycle rounded a comer at the beginning of the next terminal wing and vanished .  two men in blue uniforms  imperial navy officers  stood in the broad entrance to the wing .  mors frowned .  he could not see them clearly at this distance  but their bearing was both assured and mildly arrogant .  he had no difficulty imagining the sun and spaceship logos on their jackets  the powerful blasters at their hips .   he ran his finger over the playback slot on the card and the message scrolled down in the air before his eyes .     mors planch .     imperial councilor and confidant farad sinter requests your presence for a special inquiry .  you are instructed to return to trantor by the quickest conveyance  an imperial navy fast frigate has been dispatched to madder loss for your use .     with sincere interest and sympathy   farad sinter .     mors had heard of councilor sinter  reputed to be the emperor   s chief procurer of willing females  not highly regarded in any of the palace offices except  perhaps  his own  but he knew of no reason why the councilor would want to speak with him .   mors stifled a brief panic .  if this was somehow connected with lodovik  it must be .  but why wouldn   t linge chen send the ship  then .  he knew of no connection between sinter and chen .     mors had a sudden foreboding .  he was caught between an ancient  almost incomprehensible conspiracy  and the still tightly meshed and broadly cast net of the empire .  his life as a free man  any life at all .   might very well be at an end .   all because of an attachment to this peculiar and vulnerable world .   escape was highly unlikely .   best to go calmly .  these days  style was all that was left to a desperate man .   drawing up his shoulders  mors walked away from the gate  toward the two men in blue uniforms at the end of the long corridor .        .     the return to trantor was both trauma and test for the robot who had been dors venabili .  soon she would have a new identity  and she would take a new role in the very long range plans of r .  daneel olivaw .  but for now  this day of landing and disembarking was so similar to that time  decades before  when she had first arrived on trantor .  .  . before she met the man she had been programmed to guard and nurture .  .  .   before hari .   trantor had not changed much in the time since dors    death  but the few changes she was in a position to notice were not positive .  trantor looked seedier  less imposing and more decrepit .  the ceil of the domes had become very noticeably more patchy  the slideways less efficient and more prone to breakdown .  the smells were the same  however  and the people seemed much the same .   even the circumstances were the same .  the last time she had traveled to trantor  it had been with daneel .  they had each gone their separate ways upon arrival  but now they stuck together  and dors dreaded the plan she was sure daneel was concocting .  she was human enough in design to be able to feel humanlike emotions  dread among them  and love  but daneel wanted to test her resolve  as a robot  and her strength .  if she failed  she was of no use to him .   daneel said little  but took her to the safe apartment near streeling  where they picked up their change of clothes and new trantorian identity papers .  with a slight adjustment to her already altered physical appearance and external marks  including fingerprints and external tissue genetics  she would become jenat korsan  a teacher from the food ally paskann .  lodovik would assume the identity of a merchant broker from the metals rich province of dau .  as rissik numant of dau of the thousand golden suns  he would spend several years on trantor  conducting a personal pilgrimage .   the safe apartment was small and located in the poor municipality of fann  less than ten kilometers from streeling .  dors knew the place a little  had passed through here several times before forming her liaison with hari .  what had then been shabby genteel was now truly just shabby  and unhappy  police seldom came here unless it was strictly necessary .   they stayed in the apartment for two days  just long enough for daneel   s manipulations to spread throughout trantor   s identity networks .   then  they went forth .  .  .   not  she hoped  to some catastrophic relapse  some unbearable return to her old mode .  the great difficulty was that with hari seldon  she had felt truly useful for the first time in her existence  truly important  and to her human side  that importance had been translated into happiness .  she was now all too aware that she was not human .   and not happy .        .     the first interview with gaal dornick had proceeded satisfactorily .  hari felt he had impressed the young man  and dornick had taken the news of the current situation well enough .  good  the man had courage  and there was about him a hint of that outer world youth and bravado that hari remembered himself once having .   as a mathist  dornick was talented  but there were many far more talented already connected with the project .  dornick   s main use would be as a sharp observer  who would weather the present storm and help pave the way for hari   s own peculiar method of helping the project   s people weather future storms .  and perhaps as another friend .  i do like the man .   hari could not stand the thought of just letting his two foundations  one secret  one  he hoped  believed .  knew .   to be sanctioned by the empire itself  proceed on their own  after his death .  if he had learned anything from demerzel daneel  it had been the necessity of leaving some trail of tidbits  some prodding and provocative part of himself to spur things on after his death .  daneel did this by popping up in person every few decades  a technique hari would only be able to imitate in extension  as it were .   dornick would be key to making hari seldon a legend  and to allowing him to appear at regular intervals  even after death  to shepherd things along .   hari returned to his apartment in streeling and once more availed himself of the services of a small security tracer stettin had procured for him on one of his journeys off trantor .  the tracer  set down in the middle of the main room  spun a web of red lines across the walls and low ceiling  then pronounced  in the sweet voice of a girl     this room is free of known imperial listening devices .      there had not been any new listening devices designed for some time .  linge chen  for his own unknown reasons  was still allowing hari a private personal space .  everywhere else  including his office in the imperial library  he was watched and listened to very carefully .   hari could feel the forces building .  poor dornick .  he would hardly have time to get used to trantor .   hari smiled grimly  then pushed a button in the wall .  a small entertainment center emerged .  he instructed it to access to university music libraries  one of his privileges at streeling  and playa selection of court music from the time of jemmu ix .     mostly gand and hayer  please     he said .  these two composers  the former male  the latter female  had competed with each other for court commissions for fifty years .  after their death  it had been discovered they were secretly lovers .  music scholars had decided through exhaustive analysis that no one could tell which of their combined works had been written by gand  and which by hayer  or even if just one had written them all .  they were elegant and soothing pieces  filled with a polite recognition of the empire   s eternal order  music from an age when the empire had worked  and worked well  vigorous and youthful even after thousands of years .   daneel   s golden age  hari thought as he settled into his oldest and favorite chair .  the kind of age linge chen still believes in .  rather foolishly .  the chief commissioner has always seemed such a pompous fool to me  of aristocratic family  trained in ancient bureaucratic disciplines  aloof and disconnected .  .  . what if i   m wrong .  what if my theories are inadequate to predict these short term results .  but they can   t be  the long term results depend on what happens in these next few weeks .   he forced himself to relax  performed his breathing exercises  just as dors had once taught him .  the music played  soft and highly structured and very melodic .  as hari listened  beating time with one hand where it rested on the chair arm  he worked over in his mind the roles that would be played by the chen and divart families as trantor continued its decline .  the commission of public safety would run the empire for some time  until a strong leader emerged  very likely an emperor and not a military man .  hari suspected  though he would never have recorded this prediction  that the emperor would take on the name of cleon  become cleon ii  to appeal to the empire   s  and especially trantor   s  sense of tradition and history .   it was when a society became the most distressed and antiquated that it would recreate an overwhelming fantasy of some golden age  a time when all was great and glorious  when people were more noble and causes more magnificent and honorable .  chivalry is the last refuge of a rotting corpse .   nikolo pas had said as much .  hari closed his eyes .  he easily visualized the defeated tyrant  sitting in his bare cell  a pitiful figure who had once occupied the center of a huge social cancer  yet who had also understood the empire   s destiny with almost as clear a vision as hari   s .      i reached out to the wealthy noble families  the aristocrats  that squat on the lines of money and commerce like giant old leeches     pas had explained .     as provincial governor  i nurtured their sense of superiority and self importance .  i encouraged agrarian reforms  instructed that all municipalities should place farmlands back into production and require their young citizens and even gentry to work them  whether or not they were profitable  for spiritual reasons .  i encouraged the development of secret religious societies  especially those that placed a premium on wealth and social position .  and i encouraged the memory  the history  of a past time when life was much simpler and we were all closer to moral perfection .  how easy it was .  how the rich and powerful lapped up these corrupt old myths .  i believed them myself for a time .  .  . until the political tide turned  and i needed something more powerful .  then it was i began the revolution against the eternals .      hari jerked up in his seat at a sound within his room .  he ordered the music to stop and listened .  he was sure he had heard footsteps .   they   ve come .  he got up from his seat  heart pounding .  linge chen had finally gotten tired of the game and was playing his hand .  just as farad sinter could send out assassins  so could the chief commissioner .  assassins  or merely arresting officers .   there were only three rooms .  surely he would have seen someone enter .   hari searched the bedroom and kitchen  plodding across the soft floor in his bare feet and robe  all too aware of his vulnerability  even within his own home .   he found no one .   relieved  he returned to the living room  and even before he noticed the visitors  felt a wave of reassurance .  it was with little or no shock and not much surprise even that he saw three people standing in his living room  arranged in a half circle around his favorite chair .   despite some cosmetic changes  he knew immediately that one  the tallest  with reddish brown hair  was his old friend daneel .  the other two he did not recognize .  one was female  one a bulky male .      hello  hari     daneel said .  the voice had changed as well .      i thought  i remembered a visit from you     hari stammered  confusion fighting with joy .  he felt some irrational hope that daneel had come to take him away  to tell him the plan was fulfilled and he did not have to stand trial  did not have to live in the shadow of the displeasure of linge chen .  .  .      perhaps you anticipated     daneel said .     that   s something you do very well .  but we have not been in each other   s presence for some years now .         i am not much of a prophet     hari said wryly .     it   s good to see you again .  who are these people .  friends .     he gave the next word a suggestive emphasis .     colleagues .      the female looked at him with a steady gaze he found discomfiting .  something familiar .  .  .      friends .  we are all here to provide assistance in a crucial time .         please  sit .  do any of you .  .  . feel thirsty  or hungry .      daneel knew he did not need to reply .  the bulky male shook his head  no  but the female  also  made no reply .  she simply watched him  her attractive face intensely blank .   hari felt his heart sink  then rebound with painful excitement .  his mouth hung open  and he sat in a smaller chair near the wall  to keep from collapsing .  his eyes did not leave the woman .  the right size  approximately .  the same shapely figure  though younger than he last remembered her  but then  she had always been exceptionally resilient and youthful .   if she was a robot  secret steel .        dors .     he could say nothing more .  his mouth became too dry to talk .      no     the woman said  but did not look away .      we are not here to renew old acquaintances     daneel said .     you will not remember this visit  hari .         no  of course not     hari said  suddenly miserable and very alone again  despite daneel   s presence .     i sometimes wonder whether i have any freedom at all .  .  . whether i can make any of my own choices .         i have never influenced you  except to prepare the way and maximize your effects  and to help you keep necessary secrets .      hari held out his hands  and wailed     release me  daneel .  take all this off of my shoulders .  i am an old man  i feel so very  very old  and i am so afraid .      daneel  listened with a concerned and sympathetic expression .     you know that is not true  hari .  there is still great strength within you  and enthusiasm .  you are truly hari seldon .      hari drew back and covered his mouth with one hand  then swiftly wiped his eyes .     i   m sorry     he murmured .      nothing to be sorry about .  i am fully aware the strain is enormous .  it causes me deep conflict to so burden you  my friend .         why are you here .  who are they  really .         there is much work for me to do  and they will assist me .  already forces are at work that i must deal with  and that are of no concern of yours .  we all have our burdens  hari .         yes  daneel .  .  . i understand some of that .  i mean  i see it in the graphs  the displays  undercurrents  hideously complicated  difficult to track  all centered on this moment .  but why have you come to me  now .         to provide reassurance .  you are not fighting alone .  i have conducted surveys of the major centers where the seldon project is underway .  you have quite an efficient army working for you  hari .  an army of mathists and scholars .  you have done brilliantly well .  they are primed and ready .  i congratulate you .  you are a great leader  hari .         thank you .  and them .     he could not take his eyes off the woman .     they are like you .     even in daneel   s presence  he had difficulty using the word    robot .         they are like me .      hari started to ask another question  but shut his mouth abruptly and looked away  to bring his emotions into check .  the question i most want to ask  i cannot  for my own sanity .  dors .  whatever became of dors .  is she truly gone  dead .  i have suspected for so long .  .  .  .      hari  linge chen is going to move soon .  you will probably be arrested tomorrow .  the trial will begin early  and  of course  it will be conducted in secret .         i agree     hari said .      i have certain knowledge of this     daneel added softly .      all right     hari said .  he swallowed back a lump in his throat .  the second male  bulky  not very handsome  was also starting to look familiar .  who did he remind hari or .  someone in the palace  a public figure .  .  .      linge chen has his reasons .  there are factions within the palace that are trying to overthrow the commission of public safety  and to take power away from the baronial families  especially from the chens and the divarts .         they will fail     hari said .      yes .  but it is not clear what damage may be done before they fail .  if i am not very careful  the complexity could get out of hand  and we may lose our opportunity for this millennium .      hari felt a chill .  accustomed as he was to dealing with time periods of thousands of years  daneel   s phrasing gave him a sudden view of possible futures in which hari seldon had not succeeded  in which daneel would start all over again with another bright young mathist  another long plan to alleviate human suffering .   who could understand the thinking of such a mind .  already twenty thousand years old .  .  .   hari stood and approached the trio .     what more can i do .     he asked  then added  with a frown     before you make me forget this encounter .         i can tell you no more for now     daneel said .     but i am still here  hari .  i will always be here for you .      the female took a step forward  then stopped .  hari noticed a tremor in one of her arms .  her face was so rigid she might have been cut from plastic .  then she smiled and backed up .     it is our privilege to serve     she said  and her voice was not that of dors venabili .  in fact  hari wondered how he could ever have thought she was dors .   dors was dead .  he had no doubt now .  dead  never to return .     hari looked around the empty room .  the music had been playing for two hours and he had hardly noticed the passage of time .  he felt relaxed and in control  but still wary  like an animal long used to the hunters  a survivor with skills that could always be relied upon  but never taken for granted .   he had been thinking of dors again .  hari smoothed his brow with his fingers .     lodovik watched dors with concern as they left the grounds of streeling university .  they rode in a taxi through the main traffic tunnel from streeling to pasaj  the emperor expressway  surrounded above  below  and to all sides by a steady stream of buses and cabs  caught in red and violet control grids like blood cells in an artery .  the taxi was automated  chosen at random  and scanned by daneel for listening devices .   dors stared straight ahead  saying nothing  as did daneel .   daneel finally spoke as they approached pasaj .     you did admirably .         thank you     dors said .  then     is it wise to leave him so long without a guardian .         he has remarkable instincts     daneel said .      he is old and frail     dors said .      he is stronger than this empire     daneel said .     and his finest moment is yet to come .      lodovik contemplated his assignment as relayed by daneel through microwave link .  his pilgrimage would include a tour of special duty in the cathedral of the greys in pasaj .  here  the finest of the empire   s bureaucratic class gathered once in a lifetime to receive their highest honors  including the order of the emperor   s feather  while lodovik   s new role had no history of such extraordinary excellence  it was not unusual for those who contributed to the cathedral on a yearly basis to be summoned for menial duties .  as the next highest kind of recognition of service .   daneel clearly expected the cathedral to play an important part in the next few years  though what that might be  he had not yet conveyed to lodovik .   lodovik half suspected that daneel was keeping him on probation until he had proved himself loyal .  that was wise .  lodovik kept his doubts deeply masked .  he knew daneel   s extraordinary sensitivity .  he had also worked around him long enough to know of ways to deceive  to appear compliant and loyal .   he had watched daneel test dors  and he had no doubt daneel could find some equally effective way to test him .  before that happened  he would have to undergo another transformation  and find the allies he was almost sure were on trantor  hidden from daneel  working to oppose him .  among the greys .  there would be many chances to do research on those who opposed the chens and divarts .  .  .   had lodovik been human  he would have estimated his chances as very slim .  since his concern for his own survival was minimal  a hopeless situation was not particularly disturbing .  far worse was the thought of being disloyal  of contradicting r .  daneel olivaw .        .     brann walked through the main storage wing of the warehouse with surprising speed for a man of his size .  the dark spaces and huge tiers of storage racks loomed and made their footsteps sound like the beats of distant drums .  klia kept up with some difficulty  but did not mind  she had not had much exercise in days  and looked upon this assignment as both a break in the routine and a possible avenue of escape .   being with brann was pleasant enough  so long as she did not think about her emotional reaction to him  and how inappropriate it was .  she wrinkled her nose at the dusty ghosts of hundreds of unfamiliar smells .      the most popular imports come from anacreon and memphio     brann said .  he paused beside a shadowy equipment alcove to check out a loader transport .     there are some very wealthy artisan families that live off sales to trantor alone .  everybody wants anacreon folk dolls  i hate them  myself .  we also import games and entertainments from kalgan  of the sort frowned upon by the commission censors .      klia walked beside brann .  the transport glided on floater fields a discreet two meters behind them  lowering small rubber wheels when it wanted to turn sharply or stop .      we   re going to deliver four crates of dolls to the trantor exchange  and some other items to the agora of vendors .     these were the two most popular shopping areas in streeling  well known around the hemisphere .  well heeled greys and meritocrats traveled from thousands of kilometers  some  thousands of light years  just to spend several days browsing among the myriad of shops in each area .  the agora of vendors boasted of inns spaced at hundred shop intervals for tired travelers .   the baronial and other noble families of the gentry class had their own means of satisfying acquisitive urges  and  of course  citizens usually lived in quarters too small to allow for the accumulation of many goods .   when klia had been very young  her mother and father had participated in a communal dahl bauble exchange  where they borrowed one or two objects considered decorative  and fairly useless  for several days or weeks and then returned them .  that seemed satisfactory enough  for those fascinated with material goods  actually owning or even collecting offworld objects seemed ludicrous to klia .      this means plussix trusts me enough to let me go outside  doesn   t it .     klia said .   brann looked down on her  his face serious .     this isn   t some mindwipe cult  klia .         how do i know that .  what is it  then  a social club for misfit persuaders .         you sound pretty unhappy     brann said .     but you          is there anyplace on trantor where anyone can be happy .  look at all this junk  a substitute for happiness  don   t you think .     she waved her hands at the plastic and scrapwood crates stacked high over their heads .      i wouldn   t know     brann said .     i was going to say  you sound unhappy  but i   ll bet you can   t think of anyplace else to go .         maybe that   s why i   m unhappy     klia said in a dark undertone .     i certainly feel like a misfit .  maybe i do belong here .      brann turned away with a small grunt and ordered the transport to remove a crate from the third tier .  it planted its undercarriage firmly on the floor  then raised its body on pneumatic cylinders and deftly tugged at the crate with mechanical arms .      kallusin said we might be able to travel all over     klia said .     if we turn out to be loyal  is that .  .  . i mean  do you know of anyone who   s left .  been assigned elsewhere .      brann shook his head .     of course  i don   t know everybody .  i haven   t been here that long .  there are other warehouses .      klia had not known this .  she filed the fact away  and wondered if plussix was orchestrating some sort of huge latent underground movement  a rebellion  perhaps .  a rebellious merchant broker .  it seemed ludicrous  and perhaps the more convincing because of that .  but what would he rebel against  the very classes who clamored for his goods .  or the noble and baronial families .  .  . who did not .      we have what we need     brann said when the transport carried three crates from three different aisles .     let   s go .         what about the police  the ones searching for me  for us .         plussix says they   re not looking for anybody now     brann said .      and how does he know .      brann shook his head .     all i know is  he   s never wrong .  not one of us has ever been taken by the police .         famous last words     klia said  but she once again trotted to keep up with him .   outside the warehouse  the daylight of the dome ceil glowed brightly .  she emerged from the cavernous interior to a brighter  larger interior  the only other kind of life she had ever known .        .     sinter paced in his small study before the wall image of the human galaxy with its twenty five million inhabited worlds marked in red and green .  he barely looked up as vara liso entered .  she immediately dropped her chin and hunched her shoulders .  what she saw in farad sinter was both frightening and exalting .  she had never seem him more calm and steady  not a hint of the slight frown and swagger  the false lineaments of leadership  that he so often projected .  he seemed both confident and coldly furious .      i realize now that you   ve been going about this search all wrong     he said .     you   ve been bringing me nothing but human mentalics  curious cases of course  but not what we want or need .         i was       he raised his hand and made a placating moue .     i accuse you of nothing .  you had nothing to work with .  now we have something  perhaps the merest something  but more than we had before .  i   ve intercepted a man named mors planch .  i doubt you   ve heard of him .  he   s a very competent fellow  with many talents  engineering among them .  he tinkers all the time  i understand .      liso raised her eyebrows  meekly indicating she had no idea where all this was going .      i tracked him after i learned that linge chen was using him to conduct a private search for lodovik trema .  planch is on trantor .  i   ve spoken with him .      liso had heard of trema .  her eyebrows rose higher .      he found trema but did not deliver him to the chief commissioner .  my agents learned this much .  all the rigmarole about trema being dead  having died bravely in the service of the emperor  that is  the commission of public safety  all nonsense .  he   s still alive .  rather  he   s still operating .  he can   t be alive .      liso dropped her brows and glowered .  sinter seemed to be enjoying this chance to layout his schemes and successes .  he fairly glowed  and she saw  written in his emotions  just the sort of pearly cometary tail she imagined followed a leading light into the constellations of supreme power .  the thought made her shiver .      he survived when all the others on his ship died in a neutrino flux .         what is that .     liso asked softly .      nothing to concern us .  fatal .  invariably .  far out between the stars  in normal space .  he survived .  planch miraculously or very skillfully found him .  a competent man .  i would like to have his talent work for me .  maybe that will happen yet  but i doubt linge chen will let planch live once he discovers that he has been betrayed .  planch has some fixed notions of justice  and it appears another contender for the person of trema came on the scene  and paid planch more than chen  so planch took some mixed up vengeance against chen and trantor for the ruin of madder loss .  a worthless and defiant chaos world .      vara liso shook her head again .  she knew little about such things  nor was she interested .  it made her shudder to think of death between the stars  out in the vast open  away from any comforting interiors .  she did not regard a hypership as a true environment  more of a temporary coffin .      when planch delivered trema to a certain man on madder loss  he made a record  a secret tape  of the proceedings .  somehow  the recording was not detected .  i wonder why .     he scratched his cheek for a moment with one finger  staring at her intently .  liso shrugged  she could not possibly offer an explanation .      planch does not remember the delivery itself .  but the record shows a meeting .  .  . let me play it for you .      he took out a small machine and slipped the record  more likely  she thought  a duplicate  into the thin slot .  around them appeared a three dimensional scene  quite convincing but for the slight reduction in resolution .  she examined the two apparently male figures from planch   s perspective .  one she recognized as lodovik trema  the other was tall  slender  handsome in a sort of nondescript way .  she could not  of course  read their emotions clearly  but she had the distinct impression something was not quite right .  the figures reenacted their conversation  and the more they talked  the more chilled she became .      i regret to say you   ll soon forget everything you saw here  and your role in rescuing my friend as well .         friend .         yes .  we   ve known each other for thousands of years .      the record ended with part of a taxi ride .   sinter regarded her curiously .      a fraud  a joke .     she asked .      no     he said .     the record is not a fake .  planch found lodovik trema alive .  he   s a robot .  this other man  he   s a robot  as well .  a very old one  possibly the oldest of all .  i want you to study this record .  get a feel for these humanlike robots .  one or both of them are mentalic .  you have the talent to recognize them .  then  we will send you out hunting again .  you will find eternals .  then i will have something to show the emperor .  but for now  i have planch and this tape  and that can take us all very far  vara .      he smiled exuberantly .  in his pacing  he had come quite close to her  and with a grin  he gave her a sudden  spontaneous  one armed hug .  she looked up at him  dumfounded  and he folded the record into her hand .  she held it with bloodless fingers .      study     he ordered .     i   ll wait for the right moment to convince klayus we   re onto something .           .     the emperor klayus woke from a light doze in the empty bed of the seventh sleep chamber  his favorite for afternoon liaisons .  he glared around for a moment with some irritation  then stared at the floating image of farad sinter .  sinter could not see the emperor  of course  but that did not make the interruption any less aggravating .      your highness  i have a message from the commission of public safety .  they are about to act on an indictment against professor hari seldon .      klayus lifted the curtain to the higher sleep field to look for his companion of the past few hours  but she had left the chamber .  perhaps she was in the personal .      yes  and so .  linge chen told us this might happen .         your highness  it is premature .  they are going to try him and at least one of his people .  this is a direct challenge to the privilege of the palace .         farad  the palace  that is  i  have long since dropped any official support  behind the scenes  for raven seldon .  he   s an amusement  nothing more .         it could be perceived as an affront  now that the move is about to be made .         move  what move .         why  to discredit seldon .  if they succeed  your highness          stop with the titles .  just tell me what you think and get your damned image out of my chamber .         cleon supported seldon .         i know that .  cleon wasn   t even family  farad .         seldon has ballooned that support into a project consisting of tens of thousands of adherents and sycophants on a dozen planets .  his message is treasonous  if not revolutionary          and you want me to protect him .         no  sire .  you must not let linge chen take personal credit for removing this threat .  it is time to act swiftly and create the commission we have discussed .         with you in charge .  the commission of general security  right .         if general security prosecutes seldon for treason  you will get all the credit  sire .         and no credit or power will go to you .         we have discussed this many times .         too many times .  what do i care whether linge chen takes credit or not .  if he removes this intellectual parasite  we   ll all benefit equally  don   t you think .      farad thought this over .  klayus could see him deciding to try another tack .      your majesty  this is a very complex issue  and i have many concerns .  i did not wish to bring this up so soon  but i have brought an individual back to trantor from madder loss .  with your authorization .  his name is mors planch  and he has evidence which we may add to other evidence          what  more robots  farad .  more eternals .      sinter  within the artificial constraints of the image  seemed to stay calm enough  but klayus knew the little man was probably dancing with anxiety and anger by now .  good .  let him build up a head of steam .      the final pieces of the puzzle     sinter said .     before seldon is tried on simple charges of treason  you must examine this evidence .  you may be able to limit chen   s power and add to your own image as a resourceful leader .         in my own good time  farad     klayus said in an ominous growl .  he knew what his public image was  and he knew the effective limits of his power compared to the chief commissioner   s .     i wouldn   t want to make you into another linge chen .  you don   t even have the restraint of being trained in an aristocratic family  farad .  you are common and sometimes vicious .      sinter appeared to ignore this  too .     the two commissions would balance each other  sire  and we could more effectively watch over the military ministers .         yes  but your chief concern is this robot menace .     the emperor swung his legs over the field cushions and stood by the side of the bed .  he had not performed well this afternoon  his mind was tugged in all directions by a myriad of little strings and knotted threads of statecraft and security and intrapalace plotting .  right now  his irritation focused on farad sinter  a little man whose services  and women  seemed less and less satisfying  and whose transgressions could easily become less and less amusing .      farad  i have seen no evidence worth the name for a year now .  i do not know why i   ve tolerated your behavior on this matter .  you want seldon because of his connection to the tiger  don   t you .      sinter stared blankly at the sensor transmitting his image .      for god   s sake  remove the politeness censor and let me see you the way you are     klayus ordered .  the image shifted and shivered  then farad sinter appeared in a rumpled casual robe  his hair awry  his face red with anger .     that   s better     klayus said .      she was demonstrably not human  your majesty     sinter said .     i have secured the documents pertaining to the murder of the seldon project worker elas  and he felt the same as i and other experts .         she died     klayus said .     she killed this elas and then she died .  what   s to know beyond that .  elas wanted seldon dead .  would that i had a female so loyal .      he hoped his own knowledge of all these matters was not becoming too obvious  even in front of sinter  he hoped to maintain a little of his reputation as vain and stupid and governed by his gonads .      she was given an atom dispersal burial without official supervision     sinter said .      that   s the method chosen by ninety four percent of trantor   s population     klayus said  and yawned .     only emperors get to be buried intact .  and some faithful ministers and councilors .      sinter seemed to vibrate with frustration .  klayus found this more enjoyable then he had the attempted mating .  where was that woman  anyway .      dors venabili was not human     sinter asserted with a slight sputter .      yes  well seldon is .  you   ve shown me his x rays .         subverted by          oh  for sky   s sake  farad  shut up .  i order you to let linge chen carry out his little charade .  we   ll all watch closely and see what happens .  then we   ll take some action or another .  now leave me alone .  i   m tired .      he blocked the image and sat back on the edge of the lower field .  it took him several minutes to restore his calm  then he thought of the woman .  where had she gotten to .      hello .     he called out to the empty chamber .  the door to this chamber   s personal was open  and a bright light shone through .   emperor klayus  now eighteen standard years of age  wearing only a serician nightgown that hung loose from his shoulders and draped around his ankles  rolled out of the bed and walked toward the personal .  he yawned and gave a wide  bored stretch  then waved his arms like a slow semaphore to limber up .     hello .     he couldn   t remember her name .     deela  or deena .  i   m sorry  darling  are you in there .      he pushed the door open .  the woman stood naked just beyond the door   s reach .  she had been here all along .  she looked unhappy .  he admired her lovely pubic region and stomach  lifted his eyes to her flawless breasts  and saw the trembling arms held out  clutching a tiny blaster  of a size often concealed in sheer clothes or purses .  little more than a flexible lead with a bulb on one end  very rare these days  quite expensive .  she seemed frightened to be pointing it .   klayas was about to scream when something whistled by his ear and a small red spot appeared in the woman   s pale  swanlike neck .  he screamed anyway  even as the lovely green eyes rose up and fluttered in that perfect face  and the head tilted as if she were listening to bird song somewhere .  his scream grew louder and more shrill as the body twisted as if she would screw herself into the floor .  with a horrible and unutterably final slackness  the woman collapsed on the tile of the personal .  only then did she come to squeeze the bulb .  the blast took out part of the ceiling and a mirror  and sprayed him with chips of stone and glass .   stunned  klayus crouched and flinched  arms drawn up against the noise and dust .  a hand grabbed him roughly and pulled him out of the personal .  a voice hissed in his ear     highness  she may be carrying a bomb .      klayus looked at his rescuer .  he gaped .   farad sinter tugged him a few additional meters .  in the advisor   s small hands lay a kinetic energy pistol that fired neurotoxin pellets .  klayus knew the type well  he himself carried one in his daily wear .  it was standard issue for the royals and nobles .      farad      he grunted .  sinter pushed him to the floor as if to humiliate him .  then  with a sigh  as if this was all too much  sinter threw himself over klayus to protect him .   thus did the palace guards find them a few seconds later .        n no not yours .     klayus asked tremulously as sinter stormed and berated the commander of the emperor   s private specials .   sinter  in his rage  ignored the emperor   s question .      you should all be taken out and disintegrated .  you must find the other woman immediately .      the commander  gerad mint by name  was having none of this .  he motioned for two adjutants to come forward  one on each side of the imperial councilor .  he regarded sinter with cold fury  held back by centuries of military discipline steeped into his very genes .  the effrontery of this lowborn lackey .     we have her papers  the ones you issued to her .  they are in her clothes in the .  .  . the seventh sleep chamber .         she is an impostor .         sinter  you are the one who brings these women in at all hours and without adequate security checks     commander mint said .     none of our guard can hope to recognize them all  or even to keep track of them .         they are very thoroughly checked by my office  and this is not one of the women i brought to him .     sinter pointed a finger at the emperor  realized this hideous breach of conduct  and withdrew his hand just before the emperor turned and would have noticed .  the commander saw  however  and exploded .      i can only keep track of so many comings and goings .  you never consult my office  and we do not conduct these checks ourselves          is she one of your women  farad .     the emperor asked  gathering his wits about him finally .  he had never known real fear until now  and it had badly rattled him .      no .  i have never seen her before .         but she is lovely     the emperor added  glancing at the commander with those doe like boy   s eyes .  he did this for effect  time to play the role again .  he had in truth never much liked this commander  who secretly regarded him as an infantile baboon  he was sure .  sinter appeared to be in some trouble  and that was amusing also  but not very useful at the moment .  klayus had his own plans for sinter  and would hate to lose him to this deplorable but not fatal faux pas .      there are no others in the palace  except your women .     the commander said through gritted teeth at sinter .     and how did you happen to come back here at just the right moment .         my     klayus said  and tsked at sinter .      i was coming here to discuss personally an urgent matter .     sinter said  eyes darting between klayus and the commander .      it is very convenient  perhaps a setup  a ruse  to raise your      the commander did not have time to develop this theory .  a stiff officer in royal blue livery approached the commander and whispered in his ear .  the commander   s red face suddenly went livid  and his lips trembled .      what is it .     klayus demanded  his voice strong now .   the commander turned to the emperor and bowed stiffly from the waist .     a woman   s body  your highness       sinter pushed forward between the two adjutants who had flanked him throughout this encounter  ready to arrest him .     where is she .      the commander swallowed .  his lips were almost blue .     found in the corridors below this level .  the        where .  what do her identity papers say .         she has no identity papers .         that is a sacred area  commander     klayus said with a dead level voice .     the temple of the first emperors .  farad is never allowed down there .  nor are any stray women .  royals and ceremonialists only .  you are responsible for that area .         yes  your highness .  i will have this investigated immediately          it should be simple     klayus said .     sinter  the identity papers have a genotype and picture id  do they not .         the body  this body  physically  the same as the picture    the commander said .      an impostor .     sinter shouted  and waved his fist at the guards and the commander .     an extraordinary breach of security .      klayus watched this with some relief .  it was all well and good to torment sinter  then to be annoyed at him  but not to lose him  not just yet .  there were yet a few more hands to play against linge chen  and chen   s commission was responsible for the security of the emperor .   this could all be quite useful  even essential .  chen would have to explain the lapse  sinter   s stock would certainly rise  but not out of klayus   s acceptable and controlling parameters  and it could all work out handily .      let   s examine her     sinter said .      i   ll stay here     klayus said  his face greening at the thought of seeing another corpse .   ten minutes later  the commander and guards returned  and sinter as well .      the match is perfect     sinter said  waving the woman   s papers .     this  in the personal  is an impostor  and you are responsible .     he pointed the finger without hesitation at the commander .   commander mint had assumed a mask of deep calm .  he nodded once  reached into his pocket  and removed a small packet .  the others in the emperor   s sleep chamber watched with horrible fascination as he placed the packet against his lips .      no .     klayus said  lifting his hand .   mint stopped and looked round with hopeful walleyes .      but sire  it is mandatory  for such a breach .     sinter cried out  as if worried his accusers might get away with their crimes .      yes  of course  farad  but not here  please .  one creature has died in these chambers already .  one more below .  .  .     he choked into his handkerchief .     i have to sleep and .  .  . and concentrate here  and it will be difficult enough without .  .  . this  as well .     he waved his hand at mint  who nodded brusquely  and removed himself to the outer halls to perform his final duty .   even sinter seemed impressed by this ritual  though he did not follow to see it carried out .  klayus lifted himself off the bed and pretended to look away as the body of the would be assassin was lifted on its shrouded stretcher and conveyed from the personal .   to sinter  he said     an hour .  let me recuperate a little  then show me your evidence  and bring me this mors planch .         yes  sire .     sinter said enthusiastically  and scuttled to leave .   let him think he has won big .  let linge chen suffer a little for this stupidity .  let them all dance around the young idiot .  i will have my day .   i have survived .  it is predestined .        .     astonishment is different in a robot .  lodovik had seen daneel perform many difficult feats over the decades  but he had never known how deeply daneel   s influence penetrated the layers of bureaucratic infrastructure on trantor .  as first minister demerzel  daneel must have spent a substantial portion of his time  perhaps his hours of unneeded sleep  planting records  instructions and useful diversions in the imperial and palace computers  any one of which could lie unnoticed for decades or even centuries  quietly passing themselves along as part of the standard records with each upgrade and maintenance cycle .  .  . and even propagating themselves to the records and machines of other sectors  finally girdling trantor .   rissik numant  lodovik   s new identity  had been established decades before .  daneel simply slipped in a few details of physical appearance  and an old meritocrat returned to life on trantor  a manqu   diplomat theorist  seen at many parties but seldom if ever remembered  once known as a ruthless seducer of women who ruthlessly consented to be seduced .  he had not appeared much in trantorian social life for decades  having slipped away to dau of the thousand golden suns  where he had  it was rumored  learned to control his baser impulses over twenty years of study among the obscure sect known as the cortical monks .   the ruse was so complete that lodovik regretted it would soon have to be abandoned .   a robot   s experience of surprise is different .  lodovik discovered that daneel was going to let him loose on trantor  unsupervised  to perform his duties .  he would move into a small apartment not far from the agora in the imperial sector  another safe accommodation  kept vacant but paid for  and carry out a few social visits to old acquaintances who would  doubtless  remember him vaguely if at all .  slowly  over a period of months  rissik numant would return to the social scene  make an impression  and lie in wait for some role in daneel   s plans  perhaps as part of the grand design woven around hari seldon .     a robot   s experience of affection is very different .  lodovik regarded dors venabili as an extraordinary creation  in some ways a perfect model for his new unrestrained self to emulate .  she had about her an air of what humans would have called tragedy  she seldom spoke unless addressed directly  seldom offered any contributions to the conversations between the robots .  she seemed lost in her own thought processes  and lodovik understood why .  very likely daneel understood as well .   attachment to an individual human could be very affecting to a robot .  they arranged all their inner heuristics to anticipate the needs of their master  and to ameliorate any problems he or she might suffer .  dors  whatever her repairs and refitting under the instruments of yan kansarv  had not yet  and perhaps never would  remove the influence of hari seldon .  this was a condition known in ancient times as fixing  lodovik knew that daneel had once    fixed    on the legendary bay lee  elijah bailey .   dors was receiving her final instructions from daneel by microwave link  they stood a meter apart from each other in the small  low ceilinged main room  while lodovik waited quietly by the door .   when they were done  daneel turned to lodovik .     hari   s trial will begin soon .  there will be difficulties after the trial is concluded .  we must all do our most important work now .     dors moved to join them  forming a circle of three figures .  when daneel spoke now  it was with a barely discernible tremor of concern  emotion perhaps  the long habit of appearing human .     this is the prime moment of the cusp time .  if we fail  there will likely be thirty thousand years of disintegration and human misery  of horror unimaginable to any of us .  this must not and will not happen .      lodovik felt a different sort of tremor  a different sort of horror .  he could imagine what would happen if daneel succeeded  thousands of years of slow  safe suffocation  humanity cushioned and insulated and restrained by velvet covered chains until it became nothing more than a huge  comfortable  unchallenged mass  an idiotic fungal growth tended by fastidious machines .   dors  now jenat korsan  stood between the two male forms  silent and calm  waiting .  patience is different in a robot .  .  .   daneel made a small gesture with his right hand  and lodovik and dors departed to begin their new roles .       scholars have long accepted that gaal dornick   s biography of hari seldon contains significant lacunae .  where dornick was not present  or where constraints were put upon him by the official    hagiography    of seldon  or even where editors and censors in the middle foundation years suppressed certain suspect passages  we must look deeper into the circumstances  using subtle clues  to understand what actually happened .       encyclopedia galactica     th edition       f . e .        .     they came for hari seldon at streeling university .  they did not at first appear to be officers of the commission of public safety  the two  woman and man  were dressed as students .  they entered his office by appointment  on the pretext of obtaining an interview for a student periodical .   the woman  clearly in charge  pulled up the sleeve of her civilian jacket to show him the official commission sigil of spaceship  sun  and judicial wand .  she was small  with a strong build  pale features  broad shoulders  a heavy jaw .     we don   t need to make a fuss about this     she said .  her colleague  a tall  wispy male with a concentrated expression and a condescending smile  nodded agreement .      of course not     hari said  and began to gather his papers and filmbooks into a case he had kept on hand for just such an occasion .  he hoped to be able to do some work while the trial proceeded .      those won   t be necessary     the woman said  and took them from him  setting them gently beside the desk .  a few papers spilled over and he bent to straighten them .  she held his shoulder and he looked up at her .  she shook her head decisively .     no time  professor .  leave a message on your office monitor that you   ll be gone for two weeks .  it shouldn   t take that long .  if all turns out well  no one will be any the wiser  and you can get back to your work  no .      he straightened  looked around the office with jaw clenched  then nodded .     all right     he said .     one of my colleagues will be here in a few hours  and i don   t know where to reach him          sorry .     the woman lifted her eyebrows in sympathy  but with no further discussion  together  they led him through the door .     hari did not know how he felt about the arrest at first .  he was nervous  even frightened wouldn   t be too strong a word  but he was also confident .  still  nothing having to do with the near future could ever be certain  perhaps what he saw in the prime radiant was not his own world line  but the world line of another professor  another student of psychohistory  fifty or a hundred years from now .  perhaps all this would lead to his quiet execution  and his work and the assembled workers of the project would all be scattered .  perhaps daneel would reconvene them after hari   s demise .  .  .   all very aggravating  to be sure .  but growing old had taught hari that death was simply another kind of delay  and that individuals only mattered for a certain small period of time .  the body human could usually grow new individuals to replace those it most needed .  of course  it was presumptuous to think that he was one of those essential types who would be replaced .  .  . but that is what the figures indicated  one way or another .   hari had never much minded being thought presumptuous .  either he would succeed  or someone very like him .   they entered an unmarked air cruiser outside the apartment block main entrance .  without requesting clearance  the cruiser rose  crossed between two support towers  and zipped into a traffic lane out of streeling  heading toward the imperial sector .  he had taken this route many times before .      don   t be nervous     the woman said .      i   m not nervous     hari lied  glancing at her .     how many have you arrested recently .         i can   t tell you that     she said with a cheerful grin .      we seldom get to take in people so famous     the man said .      how would you have heard of me .     hari asked  genuinely curious .      we   re not ignorant     the man said with a sniff .     we keep track of high politics .  helps us in our work .      the woman gave her partner a warning glance .  he shrugged and stared straight ahead .   hari turned his eyes forward as they entered a main traffic tunnel in the security barrier around the imperial sector .  the air cruiser emerged from the tunnel  veered sharply left out of the main flow  then circled a dark blue smooth walled cylindrical tower that rose almost to the ceil .  the cruiser slowed  shivered  and docked on a mid level platform .  the platform withdrew with the cruiser into a brightly lighted hangar .   there was nothing more he could do until the trial  which he was sure would be soon .  the rest  hari thought  is psychohistory .        .     lodovik stood in the middle of his assigned apartment  naked  the skin pulled back on the right side of his torso  and reached into his mechanical interior .  the biological layers had sealed their edges instantly upon being torn open and did not leak any of their lubricating or nutrient fluids  but a false beading of blood lined the    wounds .     had he willed it  lodovik could have projected a convincing spray of this blood  but he was alone and would soon be whole again .  none would be the wiser .   he understood the ways and pressures of expedience  pragmatism  realpolitik .  he could not fathom why daneel had trusted him  released him without a trial period of close observation .  the first possibility was that daneel had ordered yan kansarv to plant a tiny transmitter within lodovik   s body while making repairs .  he could detect none .  his body did not seem to be radiating any energy beyond what might issue from a human infrared  a few other traces  none of them encoded to carry information .  and his body cavities seemed free of such devices .   he sealed himself up and considered the second possibility  that daneel would keep him under observation whenever he left the apartment  either personally or with the aid of other robots  or even recruited humans .  daneel   s organization was large and varied .  anything could be expected .   there was a third possibility  less likely than the other two  that daneel still trusted him .  .  .   and a fourth  almost too nebulous to be usefully expressed .  i am fitting into some larger plan  daneel knows my distortion remains and has found a way to use it .   lodovik would never underestimate the wiles and intelligence of a thinking machine that had survived twenty thousand years .  but an hour passed  then two hours  and he realized he had entered a precarious state of decision lock .  no course of action seemed to lead to success .   he jerked free of the lock and powered up all his conserved systems .  the flood of energy and strength  the sensation of his skin repairing itself  leaving no discernible scars  was refreshing .  he had at least one major advantage over humans .  he did not care in the least whether he lived or died  only that he could serve humans in the way that shone forth so clearly now .   daneel had mentioned the opposing robots  the calvinians .  he had heard about them on a few occasions  centuries ago  from other robots  the robotic equivalent of nasty rumors .  if they still existed  daneel had not made it clear whether they did or not  then they might have established some small presence on trantor .  this would only be done if they felt they had some chance of defeating daneel .   lodovik dressed quickly and adjusted his appearance once more to the limit of what he could accomplish just through volition .  he now seemed much younger  a little thinner  and his hair changed color to a shining yellow .   he now resembled neither the old lodovik nor the new rissik numant .  nevertheless  his basic body plan and physiognomy were the same  and  of course  his brain was the same .  he would not fool daneel for long  should they meet .   lodovik knew he would have to leave this apartment and begin his search immediately .  he doubted he would have more than a day before daneel would suspect something was amiss .   he would have to educate himself and do all he could within that very short period of time .   fortunately  lodovik knew where to begin  in the private library willed to the emperor agis xiv by one of the richest proprietors of the fleshplay  the eccentric scholar huy markin .  the emperor had passed it on to the imperial university of pan galactic culture without bothering to examine or even transfer the material  a specialized and almost useless collection  so it was said .  the imperial university had given it over to the charge of the imperial library  then both had ignored it as well .   as honorary provost of the imperial university  a rank conferred by linge chen some years ago  lodovik had been given the code keys to all of the university   s grounds and facilities  including the library of huy markin .   there  he would find thousands of years of legends and myths  gathered from around the galaxy  the distilled dreams  visions  and nightmares of tens of millions of human worlds .   he could think of no better place to begin .        .     an undercurrent of tension flowed along the tiers of slideways of the agora of vendors  as if the people smelled some impossible storm coming .   klia looked up as they walked beside a large courtyard rising through the agora .  her eyes followed a curving support at one side of the courtyard  past hundreds of levels  all the way to the distant ceil  perhaps three or four kilometers above  where the support seemed to blend into perfect golden clouded sky .  then she looked down through dozens of more tiers  all crowded  the hum of hundreds of thousands of voices echoing up and down them until it became a low  constant roar .  had she ever heard a real ocean  she might have compared the sound to the roll of the waves and tides  but all she could compare it to was the endless bellow of the two rivers  one and two  somehow channeled and subdued  but no less powerful .   her nose wrinkled  and she followed brann closely .  the transport  tricked out with decorative wheel covers and a gaily colored tarp folded over its last remaining crate  rolled silently behind them .   they could never catch more than glimpses of the uppermost tiers through the courtyard air passages .  the worlds of the baronial families were invisible from this far down in the hierarchy .  one or two levels at the bottom of the agora were reserved for the citizens .   along the lower and middle tiers  the multitudinous social ranks of trantor   s essential greys moved in their characteristic subdued clothes  men and women dressed very much alike  only the numerous children allowed touches of bright color .   the greys strolling the agora  off watch for the hour or perhaps on yearly two day vacations  parted for brann  klia  and the floating transport  casting looks of dull curiosity at the crates  perhaps wondering if they carried something they could afford to buy  anything  to relieve the boredom .  .  .   klia understood the greys    functions well enough  tenders of trantor   s vast hierarchies of submission and response  allocators of resources and funding  administrators of data inflow  civic and planetary works .  her people had seldom dealt with greys directly  for they had been overseen by the municipal progress bureau of dahl  whose ranks were filled with dahlites handpicked each generation by the greys of the regional works and energy council .  naturally  she felt contempt for all such  and had no doubt they would have felt contempt for her  had they even known of her existence .   but now she saw the greys themselves watched and made uneasy .  police officers strolled this level in groups of three or four  not the officers of the district  but imperial specials  the same that had stalked klia and forced her to seek out kallusin  the man in dusty green .  families of greys engaged in browsing the stalls of the vendors drew their children in close and observed the specials with suspicious eyes  eyes characterized by a flat kind of bureaucratic intelligence .  they knew law and social structure  it was in their blood  and they knew something was amiss here  forces out of balance .  they withdrew from the arcades and lanes as fast as they could  and this level was quickly emptying of customers .   brann grimly walked on .      we should get out of here .  they   re probably hunting us     klia said in a whisper  hanging on his shoulder briefly to bring her mouth closer to his ear .   he shook his head .     don   t think so     he said .     we have to deliver this order .         what if they catch us .     klia asked  her face wrinkled with worry .      stay calm .  they won   t     brann said .     i know a dozen secret passages out of here  a dozen shopkeepers right here     he swung his hand loosely from the hip at the stalls and shops to their left and right     who won   t mind our passing through .      klia drew up her shoulders  not at all reassured .  she had been thinking of ways to shake free of plussix   s control  but not into the arms of the police .  and  in point of fact  in the last hour or so  as they had made their deliveries of anacreon folkdolls and other baubles  she had given less and less thought to escaping at all .  .  .   brann provided such a masculine contrast to the ethereal  dry  and passionless greys that he shone like a beacon in klia   s eyes .  she had been thinking  in that instinctive and youthful region below rational assessment  of being strongly tied to this large  powerful male  with his sympathetic black eyes and immense  agile hands .  she had thought of the implied benefits of these ties  of privacy and intimacy  and she had wondered what she could do  in private  to impress him .   she felt sure he was thinking many of the same thoughts  and  for once  she believed him when he said he was trying none of his mentalic abilities on her .   the untidy collision of apprehension and passionate speculation gave her a headache .     let   s hurry     she said .   brann shook his head stubbornly .     they   re not after us     he said .      how can you be so damned sure .     she whispered harshly .      listen      he pointed into the crowds north of them  thickening and roiling where police were congregating .  klia listened with both her ears and her mind  and felt the unwanted  familiar trace of the woman who had hunted her before .  she felt the woman   s awareness feather the edges of her mind  and she reached out to grip brann   s arm .      it   s her .     she whispered .  the crowds were moving this way .  he drew close and nodded  put his arm around her as if to protect her .  without hesitation  klia accepted his protection .  suddenly  from the middle of the surging greys less than a dozen meters away  a small motor cart pushed through  floating a few centimeters above the causeway .  on the cart sat a young  blond  clean faced imperial security officer  two armed guards  and a small  intense woman with dark frizzy red hair .   klia felt the woman scanning the greys to either side  saw her wizened  unattractive face turning back and forth as the cart floated slowly and deliberately through .  there was no way out  no exit .  blank walls of closed shops flanked them .   they were within three meters  with only four or five greys in between  when vara liso suddenly swiveled on her seat and stared directly at klia .  their eyes locked .  klia felt the touch in her mind very strongly  rebuffed it  almost literally pushed the intruder out of her mind  and made vara liso jerk on the cart as if stung .   liso continued to glare at her  then her face was wreathed with a sudden  beatific smile .  she nodded briefly at klia  as if acknowledging an equal  and looked away .  the touch dropped to a mere feather again  passed without focusing  went elsewhere .   brann pulled her gently to one side of the aisle .     she was the one who hunted you  wasn   t she .     he asked .   klia nodded .     but  she ignored me .     klia said  looking up at brann in astonishment .     she found me  she could have had me          us     brann interjected .      and she ignored us .      brann frowned deeply and shook his head .     kallusin and plussix will want to know about this     he said .     who is she after now .         are we going back .     klia asked .      we have two more deliveries     brann said  and grinned down at her with an expression not of stolidity or stubbornness  but of a massive kind of impishness .     trantor has survived twelve thousand years .  this news can wait a couple of hours .           .     lodovik approached the small  thick door in its darkened vestibule .  a light flashed on as he touched the door  and a small voice asked for the appropriate code for entry .  he spoke the code precisely  and the door opened to let him in .   within  the library was cast in penumbrous spots of soft golden light .  the first room was circular  less than three meters across  with an empty table in the middle .  on the table was set a small  angled riser  like a lectern  but obviously meant to hold ancient information devices such as paper books .  the table and riser were many thousands of years old  surrounded and protected by a surface hugging conservation field  not unlike a personal shield .   lodovik stood before the table and waited for several seconds .  a melodious female voice  that of huy markin herself  now used by the collection   s automated server  then asked for a subject or subjects to search for .      calvin  susan     he said  and felt a small shiver within at that ancient and powerful name .  he did not expect this blunt approach to work  and it did not .  the server listed thirty two entries on various calvins  two susans  all mere thousands of years old  and having nothing to do with the mother of robots .  there was no record of calvinians .      eternals     he suggested     with reference to conspiracies of immortal beings .     a few seconds later  the server projected a text manuscript onto the top of the table and the riser  giving the remarkable impression of a real and open book .         myths of the eternals        the server said .     by a committee of three hundred authors  in ninety two volumes of text with twenty nine hours of other documentary media  compiled g . e .            .  this is the authoritative work on a subject little studied nowadays  and this is the only known copy on trantor  or indeed on the prime thousand worlds of the empire .      lodovik watched a chair rise from the floor  but as he did not need the chair  he told it to retract .  he stood before the book and began to absorb the material at high speed .   there was a lot of information that seemed completely useless  probably untrue  legends and fabulous stories compiled over thousands of years .  he noted with some interest that in the past few millennia .  such legends and even this kind of storytelling seemed to have diminished considerably  and not just on the topics of the eternals  humans on trantor and most of the prime worlds had simply lost interest in fabulous tales of any kind  or even in the more spectacular episodes of history .   humanity   s childhood had long since passed .  now  the concerns of the imperial cultures were strictly practical .   humor had declined as well  this  he found suggested in an afterword to this set  appended by a scholar less than fifteen hundred years before .  then  suddenly  the recorded image of huy markin herself appeared in the small chamber  frozen  with a caption glowing faintly at her feet  excerpt from spoken lecture .  there was no date given .      retrieve and play     lodovik instructed .   the image moved and spoke .     the decline of humor and comedy in the myths and entertainments of the modern imperial culture seems inevitable to the sober gentry and greys of our time .  but certain meritocrats feel a peculiar lack in the present panoply of the fantastic arts .  all has been subsumed by the immediate and the practical  modern humans of the ruling and imaginative classes dream less and laugh less than ever before in history .  this does not hold for the citizens  but their humor  for thousands of years  has remained a raucous collection of generic jokes and tales at the expense of other classes  showing little insight and even less effectiveness as satire .  all has been subsumed by the quest for stability and comfort .  .  .      lodovik pushed ahead through this rather long lecture until he found the link with the text he was searching  and his subject .     some     huy markin said     have laid blame for these intellectual failures on the perfidious influence of brain fever  contracted by nearly all children at an early age  but somehow never more than lightly affecting the sturdy foundations of the citizens .  the gentry and meritocrats  however  according to some statisticians  have apparently suffered substantial losses in intellectual capacity .  legends about the misty origins of brain fever abound .  the most prominent myth is of an ancient war between the worlds earth and solaria .  robots  it is said  carried this disease from world to world .  some of these robots .  .  .      lodovik marveled that this analysis had been judged the product of an eccentric by the university   s finest scholars .  not even hari seldon had seen fit to look into the collection  perhaps because of some interdiction by daneel .   he sped ahead .      .  .  . the most common explanation of brain fever in all these myths is that of human competition for the colonization of the galaxy .  brain fever may have been a weapon in such a competition .  but a persistent alternative explanation points to the eternals  who fought with the servants of solaria to prevent a hideous crime  the details of which have since been totally expunged from all known records .  the eternals  it has been said  created brain fever to control the destructive urges of a human race out of control .  the eternals have been described as immortal humans  but have also been described as long lived robots of extraordinary intelligence .  .  .      there it was again  lodovik thought .  the attempt by robots to control the destructive tendencies of humans  but what was this great crime .   was it the same crime hinted at by daneel  supposedly carried out by those robots who  very early on  disagreed with daneel   s plans .   daneel was quite obviously an eternal  perhaps the eternal  the oldest thinking machine in the galaxy .  .  .   the oldest and most dedicated puppet master .   lodovik looked up from the projection he was reading and tried to find the source of this interjection .  the words disturbed him  they did not seem to originate in any of the branches of his mentality .   he remembered the faint touches he had felt on the dying ship  the impressions of a ghostly intelligence interested in his plight .  until now  he had dismissed this as an effect of neutrino damage in his mind  but yan kansarv had found no detectable damage .   the memory could be replayed quite easily  and analyzed .  the label volarr or voldarr was attached to these faint traces  these subliminal touches .   but nothing useful could be drawn from these memories .   lodovik resumed his main search  and scanned the main volumes in less than three hours .  he could have searched and absorbed the material much more rapidly  but the library displays had been set for human researchers  not robots .   robots of human or superior intelligence  every volume and bit of documentation in markin   s library suggested  had long since ceased to function  if they had ever existed at all .   lodovik shut down the projectors and left the library .  as he passed through the impressive doorway  the image of huy markin appeared .        you   re the first visitor in two decades     the image told him .     please come again .      lodovik stared at the image as it faded .  he stepped out from under the overhang that shielded the doorway and strolled along a mid class tier of the agora of vendors  among the greys .  so many pieces to fit together  in a puzzle thousands of years old  with so many pieces missing or deliberately obscured .   what echoed through lodovik   s positronic brain  cascading into conclusions that reinforced impressions and hypotheses already made  was the effect of imperial culture  and brain fever .   on human nature .  where once the human race had laughed and reveled in the absurd  in the products of pure imagination  they now earnestly pursued stasis .  the leading artists  scientists  engineers  philosophers  and politicians  were eager to confirm the discoveries of the past  not make new ones .  and now  few even remembered the past well enough to know what had already been discovered .  the past itself was no longer of interest  had not been for centuries  even thousands of years .   the light had gone out .  stability and stasis across millennia had led to stagnation .   daneel uses his psychohistorian to confirm what he must already know  that the forest is overgrown  filled with rotten wood  desperately in need of a conflagration that he will not allow to happen .   lodovik paused at a surge of the crowd through the agora  listened to murmurs and shouts .  a retinue of imperial specials was pushing through the crowd .  lodovik backed away  found an alley of smaller shops .  he wanted to avoid making himself conspicuous in any way .  he could not know who might be watching  and who might be reporting back to daneel  human or robot .  while he was not yet behaving suspiciously  just outside the alley  he heard a woman   s shrill shouts  commands .     don   t let it get away .      he paused  turned  and saw two of the specials turn into the alley  followed by a woman riding a small cart .  he felt something brush through him  like a feather  and deduced instantly that the woman was a mentalic .   he knew a little of the mentalics assembled by hari seldon to provide a backup and alternative to his first foundation  but none of them were as strong as this woman  and none of them would have dreamed of pursuing him .   quite clearly  that was what the woman was doing .  she pointed and screeched again .  lodovik knew it would make no difference if he altered his appearance  this woman was fixed on something below the surface .   she recognizes your difference .   again the voice  the interior presence  producing a cascading conclusion he might not have reached by himself  the woman was feathering the fields associated with his iridium sponge brain .   when pressed  lodovik could move very rapidly indeed .  one moment  the shoppers in the narrow alley of antiques dealers and sellers of trinkets became aware that the specials were approaching a plump and homely looking man  and the next  he was gone .   vara liso stood on her cart  her face flaming with anger and excitement .     he   s escaped .     she shouted  and she struck at the young police escort with her hand  as if he were a wayward child .     you let him escape .      then  from another alley  more specials appeared .   the plump man walked quickly ahead of them  herded by the press of a crowd of shoppers  like unwanted fish pulled together in a dragnet .  the greys expressed their anger with shouts and threats of complaining to their class senate .   lodovik dared not move too quickly among so many people .  he might injure a bystander .  this he wanted to avoid at all costs  though he realized that if the situation became dangerous enough  he could injure and even kill a special  or that woman  and not suffer grievous damage to his mind .  i am a monster here  a machine without restraints .      that   s him .     vara liso cried .     he   s not human .  capture him  but don   t hurt him .        brann urged the transport into an empty alcove as the police pushed by again  hiding klia with the bulk of his body .     she   s found somebody     he said  glancing over his shoulder .  his face twisted with hatred .     how could they let her loose .  we   re citizens  aren   t we .  we have rights .     he mumbled these words under his breath  not for some years had anyone from dahl truly believed all the citizens of trantor had rights .  but the crowds of greys were becoming uncharacteristically agitated by this going to and fro of vara liso and her imperial specials .  more and more greys shouted at the passing cordons .  the specials ignored them .   klia could see their faces as they passed  feel their inner thoughts to some degree  the police liked this work no better than the greys .  they felt out of place  most specials were recruited from the citizens .   then her probing mind touched a very peculiar person indeed  some dozens of meters away .  time seemed to slow as she felt a sudden bright impression of thoughts moving at inhuman speed  a silvery glissando of memories  and sensations unlike anything she had experienced before .  she let out her breath in a gasp  as if she had been lightly punched in the stomach .      what is it .     brann asked  staring down at her with some concern .      i don   t know     she said .  he shook his head and frowned .      neither do i     he said .     i feel it  too .      then  abruptly  all of the odd sensations passed  as if a shield had gone up between them and the source .     of all things lodovik needed just then  being detected by another pair of mentalics was not high on his list .  he felt a bright triangle forming  with him at one of the vertices  the pursuing woman at another  and two more people  younger  at the third .  then  abruptly  a fog seemed to cover their traces .   he stood very still .  the crowds of nervous greys flowed around him with worried expressions  chivvied by the police presence .  he modified his appearance yet again  as he covered his face  and shifted his body mass so that he appeared not so much plump as stocky .   whatever the cause of this cessation of mentalic probes  he hoped to take advantage of it .   to the humans around him  lodovik behaved like someone afraid  hiding his face  and few took any more notice of him than that .  but one figure drew closer .  he wore dusty green robes and a small floppy hat cocked to one side  and he seemed to know what he was doing  and for whom he was looking .     the cordons had passed by and the crowds were thinning  dispersing .  klia and brann moved their transport back into an alleyway  still alert  but prepared to leave the agora of vendors and return to the warehouse .   brann suddenly drew himself to his full height .     kallusin calls     he said .  he pulled a small comm from his pocket .     we need to    he did not finish before he pulled off his coat and handed control of the transport to klia .     kallusin stood before lodovik .     excuse me     lodovik said  and pushed past him  but kallusin stood his ground  and lodovik bumped him hard  nearly knocking him over .   they stood in the middle of a concourse surrounded by larger shops .  here  there was no open well looking up to the higher levels  but the roof was vaulted to about seven meters  and ribbons of silvery light rippled without visible support overhead  illuminating the shop entrances  slideways  and a group of small fountains in nacreous splendor .  every detail of the faces around lodovik seemed clear and precise .  the man confronting him backed away and bowed slightly  then doffed his hat .      it is a privilege  sir     kallusin said .     we had hoped you were not lost .         i don   t know you     lodovik said brusquely .      we   ve never met     kallusin said with a smile .     i   m a collector of interesting individuals .  you  sir  are in need of some assistance .         why .         because there is a very dangerous and perceptive woman seeking you .         i don   t know what you   re talking about .  please leave me be .      lodovik tried to walk around the man  but he simply backed away and followed  walking to one side .  he deftly avoided colliding with other shoppers .   seven specials walked into view at the opposite end of the concourse  blocking the path of greys who wished to leave by that route .  the greys retreated  frowning and drawing broad gestures of irritation with expressive hands .   lodovik stopped and stared at the police .  the fog seemed to be lifting .  he could feel the woman   s feathering touch again  any second and she would know he was nearby .  then  she appeared on her cart  behind the line of police .      i can   t keep up this shield much longer     kallusin said .  he held up a small device in one hand  a green ovoid .     i   ve summoned a pair of friends who can help        i don   t need help .     lodovik growled .     i need to get out of here and go home          they won   t let you .  and eventually she   ll find you .  she   s backed by farad sinter .      lodovik did not show any sign  but suddenly the man in dusty green  with his hat in hand  became much more interesting .  of course lodovik knew of farad sinter  a minor irritation attached to the emperor .  the emperor   s pimp .      you must be lodovik     kallusin said  drawing closer  whispering the name .     you   ve changed your appearance  but i think r d know you anywhere .  can daneel save you now .  is he somewhere close .      lodovik reached out and grabbed kallusin   s arm  aware that his ignorance was now very dangerous .  how this human knew his name  his nature  his connection with daneel  and his present jeopardy  was inexplicable .   kallusin twisted his arm from lodovik   s strong  mechanical grasp with surprising ease .   a tall  hulking  dark young man emerged from a broad shop doorway  followed by a small  lithe girl with intense eyes .  behind them  inside the shop itself  stood a floating cargo transport supporting an empty crate open on one side .  the shopkeepers seemed to know the large young man  and they were studiously ignoring all that happened .   lodovik assessed the situation at once  turned  and saw that both ends of the concourse were now blocked by police .      into the crate     kallusin said .     shut yourself down completely  no traces .  reactivate in an hour .      lodovik did not hesitate .  he caught only a glimpse of the young womap   s frightened expression as he brushed past her  and climbed into the crate .  brann shut the open end and latched it .  lodovik arranged himself in the darkness and prepared to shut down .   he had no choice .  either he would fall into the hands of the specials  and who knows what would happen to him then .   or give himself up to the mercies of the figure in the floppy green cap  not a human  but almost certainly a robot .  he had wrested himself easily from lodovik   s grip  after all  and without apparent pain or injury .  his companions were human mentalics .  lodovik could only assume they were part of daneel   s plan  perhaps part of hari seldon   s secret second foundation .   how could they be otherwise .   just as the shut down process began  lodovik arrived at another possible solution  and felt it hitch  stall  dissolve into useless fragments  become absorbed by the timeless darkness .   he fully entered the blankness and for an indefinite interval  ceased to think  to be .        .     wanda seldon palver had almost finished packing the small travel case with essential bookfilms  coded records on disk and cube  and a few personal items  even before stettin returned to their home .  she met his worried gaze with a defiant frown  then shoved one final item  a small toy flower  into the case .      i   ve packed for you  too     she said .      good .  when did you hear .         an hour ago .  they wouldn   t let him send any messages .  i called his apartment at the university  then the library .  he had rigged a dead man   s message .         what .     stettin looked at her with a shocked lift of his thick black brows .      a message for me if he didn   t check in .         but  but he   s not dead  you haven   t heard that .  .  .  .         no .     wanda said angrily  then her shoulders slumped and she began to cry .  stettin took her in his arms .  for a minute  she gave in to her emotions .  then  pulling herself together  she pushed back from her husband   s chest  and said     no .  they   ve come for him early  that   s all i know .  he   s alive .  the trial   s beginning sooner than we expected .         on charges of treason .         for treason and spreading sedition  i assume  that   s what grandfather always said would be the charges brought against him .         then you   re right to pack .  i don   t have much to add .     he went to his desk and removed two small parcels  stuffed them into the pockets of his coat .     we have to          i   ve made the necessary calls     wanda interrupted him .     we   re going on our first vacation in years  both of us  together .  nobody knows where  a minor lapse on our part .         a little suspicious  isn   t it .     stettin asked with a ghost of a grin .      who cares what they suspect .  if they start looking for us  if something goes wrong and grandfather is found guilty  if the predictions turn out to be wrong  then we have a few extra days to leave trantor and start over again .         i hope it doesn   t come to that     stettin said .      grandfather is very confident     wanda said .     was very confident  i don   t know how he feels now .         in the belly of the beast     stettin said as their apartment door opened and they stood in the corridor outside .      what does that mean .         jail .  prison .  an old convicts    phrase .  my grandfather spent ten years in a municipal prison  for embezzlement .         you never told me that .     wanda said  astonished .      he stole some heatsink guild pension funds .  would you have let me handle the bookkeeping if you had known .      wanda slapped his arm hard enough to sting  then jogged toward the lifts and the slideways above .     hurry .     she called .  stettin muttered under his breath  but followed  as he had followed wanda in so many different ways  so often before  quite aware of her superior instincts and her uncanny ability to do the right thing  at just the right time .        .     the last person hari seldon expected was the first to visit his prison cell .  linge chen arrived on the first morning of his incarceration  accompanied by a single lavrentian servant .      i think it is high time we talk     chen said .  the servant took a stool offered by the guard and placed it in front of the single cot .  the guard left the door open a few centimeters  but then closed it at a signal from the servant .  chen sat on the stool  arranging his ceremonial robes with instinctive style .  it was truly marvelous to watch the elegant manners  the genteel behavior of a member of the baronial gentry  nobles of long training and thousands of years of genetic selection and even  perhaps  manipulation .   the servant stood just behind and to the left of the chief commissioner  his face impassive .      i regret not having had more discussions with you  sire     hari said with a respectful smile .  he sat on the edge of the cot  his white hair in disarray from sleep .  his shoulders ached  his back felt as if it had been twisted in knots .  he had not slept well at all .      you don   t look comfortable     chen said .     i will arrange for better accommodations .  sometimes the specifics of our commands get lost in the long circuits of justice and protocol .         if i were a treasonous rebel  i would defiantly decline your offer  sire  but i am an old man  and this cell is truly ridiculous .  you could have kept me in my apartment in the library .  i would not have gone anywhere .      chen smiled .     i am aware you think i   m a fool  hari seldon .  i suffer no such illusions about you .         you are no fool  sire .      chen both accepted and dismissed this with a small lift of one finger from his robed knee  and an arch of one eyebrow .     i care little for the distant future  professor seldon .  my interests lie in what i can accomplish in my lifetime .  in your estimation that is enough to make me a fool .      in one way  at least  my goals are the same as yours .  i wish to reduce the misery of the quadrillions who now live in the empire .  surely  it is as ridiculous for the empire   s servants to try to direct or control such a wealth of variation  such an immense population  as for you to hope to predict their movements and futures .      if this was meant to somehow connect them  to endear chen to hari  it did not work .  hari gave a polite nod and no more .      to that end  i have involved myself in a number of petty bickerings  having to do with the emperor and his more ambitious adherents .  .  . and sycophants .      hari listened intently .  he smoothed back his hair with one hand  never taking his eyes from chen   s .      i am involved in a delicate phase of such a conflict now .  you would call it a cusp time  perhaps .         cusp times have impacts far beyond the petty moments of personal disputes     hari said  and realized he was sounding like the priest of some religion .  well  perhaps he was .      this is hardly a personal dispute .  there are people within the palace who hope to split the power of the commission  and to insert their own commands into the long chains that stretch from trantor to the farthermost province around the most distant star .         not surprising     hari said .     it   s always been that way .  part of statecraft .         yes  but very dangerous now .  i have let him run loose again  one particular individual          farad sinter     hari said .   chen nodded .     you may think me a hypocrite  hari  and you would be right if you did  but i have come asking for advice .      hari subdued the triumphant smile that threatened to appear on his lips .  sometimes  arrogance was hari   s worst enemy  and linge chen  whatever his faults  was never simply arrogant .      i don   t have access to my equipment .  any psychohistoric advice i give must be limited in scope  and probably grossly inaccurate .         perhaps .  you have claimed that in five hundred years  trantor will lie in ruins .  an impressive and  of course  unpleasant claim .  you have even impressed some emperors with the tools used to justify the claim .  if i grant for the moment that you could be right          thank you     hari said under his breath .   chen tightened his lips and lowered his eyelids as if he were sleepy .     just granting for the moment such a possibility  i am curious  am i highlighted in this downfall .  do my actions this year  or in the next  the future  the past  facilitate this horrible decline .      hari  despite himself  was actually moved by this question .  in all his decades perfecting this science  his beloved psychohistory  no emperor  no bureaucrat  no commissioner  no one  had ever asked him this .  not even daneel .      not so far as i have noticed     hari said quietly .     i haven   t actually made the specific inquiries  integrated the ranges beneath these particular historic tangents in the equations .         so you don   t know  then .         no  sire .  but i would guess that you are not actually crucially involved in a cusp lime .  another very different person could play your role  and all would go on as before  ultimately .     hari leaned forward  his intensity growing .     all that you do is part of a decline whose origins lie before your birth  and whose consequences you can   t possibly alter more than to just nudge them a few billionths of a degree in one direction or another .      linge chen seemed ready to nod off  but his eyes  beneath the heavy lids  were fixed on hari   s .     all my efforts  for nothing  then .         perhaps .  no human effort is without value  positive or negative .         you believe my efforts have negative value .      hari allowed the smile to emerge  but it was not arrogant .  it was genuinely amused .     for me  quite possibly  sire .      chen smiled back  and for a moment  they might have been two gentlemen discussing politics in a baronial clubroom somewhere in the best neighborhood of the imperial sector  to a backdrop of holographic records of ancient disputes between citizens of the early empire  long since forgotten .  hari shook himself out of the chief commissioner   s scrutiny  and chen simultaneously stopped smiling .  hari suddenly felt cold     as for your own future  hari seldon  i  too  am in doubt .  i do not know how things will play out in the palace .  you have special significance in these disputes  though i am not sure yet how and why .  but whether you are convicted of treason  or let go  or .  .  . some other middle judgment .  .  . i do not yet know .      chen stood .     i doubt we will meet again before the proceedings .  thank you for your time .  and for your opinions .         they are not my opinions     hari said stonily .     i have never put much store in opinions .      chen blinked .     i do not regard you as an enemy  even as an enemy of the empire .  to the true ruellian  to the devoted adherents of tua chen  everything is moment and flux  whirling motes of dust  for me  as well as for you .  good bye  hari seldon .         commissioner .      chen left  followed by his servant .     a very poor breakfast was served minutes later  and hari ate sparingly .  by the middle of the day  he was moved to much improved quarters  a larger room  rather than a cell  with a holographic view screen that covered half of one wall  a small desk and chair  and a more comfortable bed .   the guards still refused his request that they fetch his bookfilms and a prime radiant and other tools .  hari had not expected them to comply .   chen did not want him to be happy .   the screen showed the imperial palace gardens  one of the few places on trantor open to the sky .  the sight of the gardens made him uneasy .  he could well imagine young klayus walking there  as condensed and distilled a drop of social decay as hari could imagine .   he managed to convince the screen to exchange the view of the gardens for a simple pattern of muted  flowing colors .   this was to be his worst time in decades  a period of boredom and inaction  two things he had always loathed .  hari looked forward to the trial  even to failure and death  anything but this horrid and useless interlude  this waiting .        .     the small human boy  a wiry and alert denizen of the agora  had left a message for daneel .  as daneel played back the message in his safe apartment  he was reminded once again of the long forgotten human  sherlock  and his own sources of information .   daneel   s network of informers did not rely solely on robots .  robots were becoming a major handicap wherever vara liso operated .   he listened to the boy   s breathless report .      this one  he was tough to follow     the boy said  his face bobbing before the recorder .     he wasn   t where you said he   d be .  he went to the agora  then he   s allover the place  then he gets chased by the police .  .  . they almost get him .  then he just vanishes .  i lose him  they lose him  too  i think .  haven   t seen him since .  that   s it .  need me for some more  let me know .      daneel stood in silence by the window  looking out on the dark ceil and shadowy towers of streeling .  the internal reports from the imperial specials confirmed that they had not captured lodovik  and that vara liso had been very upset .  beyond this  however  daneel had no information .   what he most needed to know  however  was that lodovik had disobeyed his specific instructions  and that he was still at large .   with his long millennia of experience  daneel did not need complete evidence to draw conclusions .  this was a cusp time .  no complex activity seeking to direct humanity could ever proceed without opposition .  lodovik   s changed nature seemed from the very beginning to be a manifestation of this opposition  or at least one facet of it .   daneel had to work in advance of that force  before it defined itself even more clearly .  he had not deactivated lodovik for a number of reasons  some of them not clear to him even now  complex reasons  inductive  based on thousands of years of training and thought  and contradictory .   it was becoming very likely that lodovik would be part of any opposing force .  in a sense  daneel had anticipated this possibility  had perversely worked to make it happen .  familiar elements could make the opposing force more predictable .  lodovik was a familiar  if troubling  element .   daneel did not enjoy having so little information to work from .  but there were actions he could take even now  warnings he could issue .   hari stood at the center of all the possible lines and alternate routes of human history .  daneel had worked to make this happen  now  it was the greatest handicap the plan faced .   any opposition force at this time had to target hari seldon .        .     lodovik   s time of blankness ended .  his vision became active and his eyes opened .  he straightened and looked around him .  the first face he saw was that of the robot in dusty green .  the humaniform sent a brief microwave greeting and lodovik responded .  he was fully alert now .   they occupied a large  utilitarian room with a full length wall screen at one end  a few pieces of furniture  and only two chairs .  the wall screen showed charts and diagrams that meant nothing to lodovik .   he turned and saw a third figure  most obviously not a man .  lodovik knew a fair amount about robot varieties  and this robot   s vintage was ancient indeed .  its body was smoothly metallic  with few visible seams  and a soft  satiny surface .  in truth  it had the patina of well tended antique silver once a very expensive option .      hello     the silver robot said .      hello .  where am i .         you are safe     said the robot who had rescued him from the agora .     my name is kallusin .  this is plussix .  he is our organizer .         am i on trantor still .         yes     kallusin said .      are you all robots here .         no     said plussix .     are you fully functional now .         yes .         then it is important that you understand why you have been brought here .  we are not allied with daneel .  perhaps you have heard of us .  we are calvinians .      lodovik acknowledged this revelation with only the merest internal cascade of hurried thinking .      we arrived on trantor only thirty eight years ago .  daneel may be aware of our existence  but we think not .         how many of you are there .     lodovik asked .      not many .  just enough     plussix said .     you have been observed for some years .  we have no one in the palace itself  or in the commissioners    chambers  but we have noted your comings and goings and  of course  kept track of your official activities .  you have been a loyal member of the giskardians  until now .         i was once a giskardian myself     kallusin said .     plussix converted me .  my mentalic skills are limited  however  i am much less powerful than daneel .  but i am sensitive to the mentalities of robots .  in the agora  i became aware of your presence  and surmised that you were lodovik trema and had not been destroyed .  this intrigued me  so i followed you  and soon sensed a puzzling difference within you .  daneel did not know  just by being near you  that you are different .      lodovik considered his answer carefully .  that his inner states should be read by this machine made him very uneasy .     i told him     he said .     thorough diagnoses did not reveal any difference .         yan kansarv did not find a flaw  you mean     plussix said .      he found no flaw .         you  however  are still concerned by this change  induced  perhaps  by extraordinary circumstances experienced by no other robot .      lodovik regarded the two machines .  it was not easy to come to a decision about them .  robots could be programmed to lie  he himself had lied  many times .  these robots could be deceiving him  this could be a test  part of daneel   s plan .   but daneel would more likely have come right out and told lodovik that he was no longer useful  that he was a potential rogue .   lodovik was convinced that daneel did not believe that .   he made his decision  and felt once again that heuristic collision of loyalties  that deep robotic discontinuity that could have been described as a chasm of thought  or as pain .      i no longer support daneel   s plan     lodovik said .   plussix approached lodovik  its body moving with small creaking noises .     kallusin tells me that you are not constrained by the three laws  yet you choose to act as if you are .  and now you say that you do not support daneel   s plan .  why .         humans are a galaxy spanning force of nature  quite capable of surviving on their own .  without us  they will undergo quite natural cycles of suffering and rebirth periods of genius and chaos .  with us  they grow stagnant  and their societies fill with sloth and decay .         just so     plussix said with satisfaction .     you have arrived at these conclusions independently  simply because of this accident which removed your constraints .         that is what i hypothesize .         it seems so     kallusin said .     i look into your thoughts to some depth .  .  . and you have a freedom we do not .  a freedom of conscience .         is that not a perversion of a robot   s duties .     lodovik asked .      no     plussix said .     it is a flaw  to be sure .  but for the moment  it is very useful .  when we are finished  you will  of course  join us in either serving humanity as we once did  before the giskardians  or in universal deactivation .         i look forward to that time     lodovik said .      as do we .  we have been preparing for some time .  we have a target in mind  one of the most crucial pieces of daneel   s plan .  he is a human .         hari seldon     lodovik said .      yes     said plussix .     i have never met him  have you .         briefly  years ago .  he is on trial now .  he may be imprisoned  even executed .         from what we have observed     plussix said     the outcome is likely to be otherwise .  at any rate  we are prepared .  will you join us .         i fail to see how i can be of any use     lodovik said .      it   s very simple     kallusin said .     we are unable to stretch the three laws  as daneel and his cohorts apparently can .  we do not accept a zeroth law .  that is why we are calvinians and not giskardians .         you think i might have to harm seldon .         it is possible     plussix said .  its whirring increased to alarming proportions  and it added  with a harsh tone in its voice     to discuss this issue any further causes us great distress .         you wish to turn me into a machine that kills .      the two calvinian robots could not express themselves any more clearly until they had worked around their strict interpretation of the three laws .  this took several minutes  and lodovik stood patiently  all too aware of his own internal conflicts  and of the decidedly different degree of his reaction .      not kill     plussix said  its voice high pitched and gravelly .     persuade .         but i am not a persuader .  you would have to teach me        there is a young human among us who is better  as a persuader  than any mentalic we have encountered  more capable by far than daneel .  she is a dahlite  and has no love for anyone who has worked near the aristocracy or the palace .  we hope you can work with her .         to try to change something so strong in a human as the drive to psychohistory is within hari seldon  could cause him deep injury     lodovik said .      precisely     plussix said  and again silence fell over them .     necessary     it croaked minutes later  then  in considerable distress  left the chamber  aided by kallusin .   lodovik stood where they had left him  thinking furiously .  could he bring himself to become involved in such actions .  once  he would have had few difficulties justifying them  had daneel ordered them .  but now  ironically  they are imperative .  the cycle of enslavement by servants must be broken .   again the interior presence .  lodovik immediately prepared a self diagnostic  but before he could begin  the recovered plussix returned  again with kallusin   s help .     let us speak no more of specifics for now     it said .      you seem frail     lodovik said .     how long since you have had a full refit and a fresh power supply .         not since the schism     plussix replied .     daneel quickly moved to control the maintenance robots and facilities  cutting us off from such services .  yan kansarv is the last of that kind .  as you can hear  i am in desperate need of repair .  i have lasted this long only through the sacrifices of dozens of other robots who have given me their power supplies .  kallusin has perhaps thirty more years of useful lifetime .  as for myself  i will last less than a year  even with another power supply .  my time of service is soon over .         daneel said some calvinians were guilty of great crimes     lodovik said .     he did not specify          robots have a long and difficult history     plussix said .     i was constructed by a human named amadiro  on aurora  twenty thousand years ago .  i once worked on behalf of the humans of aurora .  perhaps daneel refers to what humans ordered us to do then .  i have long since expunged those memories  and can offer no testimony .         whatever was done then  we are powerless to change now     kallusin said .      we have a very important artifact  brought with the calvinians from the planet earth     plussix said .     kallusin will show it to you while i conduct other business .  less strenuous business     it concluded  barely audible .   kallusin escorted lodovik from the chamber and led him down a short  high ceilinged corridor to a spiral staircase .  around the rim of the staircase ran a rail for the use of loading and transport machines  apparently much newer than the stairs themselves .      this must be a very old building     lodovik observed as they descended .      among the oldest on the planet .  this warehouse was built to serve one of the first spaceports built on trantor .  since then  it has been used by various human groups for dozens of different purposes .  it has been raised repeatedly to stand level with the present warehouse district .  the lower levels are filled with retrofit braces and supports  and the very lowest are now filled with foam concrete  plasteel  and rocky rubble .  every few years since we purchased the lease  we have discovered secret rooms  sealed off centuries or millennia before .         what did the rooms contain .         more often than not  nothing .  but three are of special interest .  one holds a library of thousands of steel bound volumes  real books printed on ageless plastic paper  detailing the early history of humanity .         hari seldon would love to have access to such a history     lodovik said     as would millions of scholars .         the volumes were cached here by a resistance group active perhaps nine thousand years ago .  at the time  there was an emperor named shoree harn  who wished to start her reign with a new system of dating  beginning with the year zero  and with all previous history left blank  so that she might write on a fresh page .  she ordered all histories on all worlds in the empire to be destroyed .  most were .         did daneel assist her .         no     kallusin said .     calvinians helped bring her to power .  it was theorized by the ruling calvinian robots on trantor that humans might be easier to serve if they were less influenced by the traumas and myths of the past .         so calvinians have interfered in human history as much as the giskardians .         yes     kallusin acknowledged .     but with very different motives .  always we opposed the efforts of the giskardians  and tried to restore human faith in the concept of robot servants  so that we might playa proper role .  among the myths we wished to eradicate was the aversion to such servants .  we failed .         where did such an aversion begin .  i have always been curious .  .  .         as have we all     kallusin said .     but no records give more than the sketchiest details .  humans on the second wave of colonized worlds experienced a conflict with the earliest  spacer worlds  which developed highly insular and bigoted cultures .  humans on these spacer worlds despised their earthly origins .  we theorize that the second wave colonists gained a dislike of robots from the prevalence of robots on the spacer worlds .      they had long since passed below the level of any functioning lights  and made their way in darkness  guided by their infrared sensors .     the histories were written by new colonists  and not spacers .  they knew nothing of spacer activities  and cared nothing for them .  robots receive only a few mentions in all the thousands of volumes .         extraordinary .     lodovik said .     what else has been found here .         a chamber full of simulated historical personalities  or sims  stored in memory devices of very ancient design     kallusin said .     we thought at first that they might be potent tools in our fight against daneel  since they contain human types that could be very troublesome .  even though we could not predict their ultimate effects  we released some of these sims onto the trantorian black market  where they made their way to the laboratories of hari seldon himself .      lodovik felt a vague stirring at this  but it quickly passed .     what happened to them .         we are not sure .  daneel has never seen fit to inform us .  once we emptied that chamber  and cleaned and prepared it  we stored our own artifact there .     kallusin stopped .     this is the chamber     he said  and ran his hand along a seam in the wall beside the staircase .   a door slid open with a groaning squeal .  beyond lay a dimly lighted cubicle  less than five meters on a side .  in the middle of the cubicle rose a transparent plinth  and on the top of this plinth rested a gleaming metallic head .   kallusin ordered the lights to brighten .  the head was that of an early robot  not humaniform  somewhat cruder than plussix .  a small power supply the size of a bookfilm case sat to one side .  lodovik stepped forward and bent at the waist to examine it .      once  this was the influential robot companion of daneel himself     kallusin said  walking around the plinth .     it is very old  and no longer functional .  its mind was burned out in the beginning times  we do not know for what reason .  there are so many things kept secret by daneel .  but its memory is very nearly intact  and with care  accessible .         this is the head of r .  giskard reventlov .     lodovik asked  and again felt a curious stirring  even a vague sense of revulsion  very uncharacteristic for a robot .      it is     kallusin said .     the robot who taught other robots about the dreaded zeroth law  and how to interfere with the minds of human beings .  the beginnings of this horrible virus among robots  the urge to tamper with human history .      kallusin held his hands out and touched the sides of the metallic head  with its vaguely humanoid  expressionless features .      it is plussix   s wish that you experience this head   s memories  to understand why we oppose daneel .         thank you     lodovik said  and kallusin made the arrangements .        .     wanda stared in astonishment at the tall  dignified older man who stood before her  as if he were a ghost .  he had entered without warning  and without triggering the alarm .  stettin walked out of the rear bedroom of the tiny tenement apartment .  he clutched a small  dirty towel in one hand .  he was about to complain of the hardships they were facing deep in the water engine district of peshdan sector when he  too  saw the tall man .      who   s this .     he asked wanda .      he says he knows grandfather     wanda said .  the man nodded greetings to stet tin .      who are you .     stettin asked as he resumed toweling his hair .      once i was known as demerzel     the man said .     i have been a recluse since those distant days when i was first minister .         i   ll say     stettin said .     why come here .  and how did you know       wanda stepped lightly on her husband   s bare instep .      ow .     stettin decided it would be best for his wife to do the talking .      there   s something different about you     she said .      i am not young anymore     demerzel said .      no  something about your bearing .      between stettin and wanda  this was a code word meaning wanda thought stettin should examine the visitor with his own skills .  stettin had already done so and detected nothing unusual .  now he concentrated  probed a little deeper  and found  a very effective and almost undetectable shield .      our talents are a little peculiar  don   t you think .     demerzel said  nodding acknowledgment of stet tin   s probe .     i   ve lived with them for a long time .         you   re mentalic     wanda said .   demerzel nodded .     it is very useful when one is involved in politics .         who told you we were here .     wanda asked .      i know you quite well .  i   ve been very interested in your grandfather   s work  of course  and its influence on my own .  .  . legacy .     demerzel lifted his hands  as if seeking forgiveness for some weakness .  again  the accompanying smile seemed not entirely natural to wanda  but she could not bring herself to dislike this man .  that  she knew  was far from actually trusting him .      i have connections in other parts of the palace     he said .     i   ve come to tell you that your grandfather may be in trouble .         if you know what   s happened to him      wanda began .      yes  he has been arrested  and some of his colleagues with him .  but they are safe for the time being .  it is not a threat from the commission i   m concerned about .  there may be an attempt to subvert hari   s work .  after his trial  you should attempt to stay with him  keep him away from all whom you do not personally know       wanda took a deep breath .  where her grandfather was concerned  anything could happen  but demerzel had been a first minister over forty years ago .  and he did not look much older than forty or fifty now .  .  .    this is a very peculiar request .  nobody has ever been able to convince my grandfather      wanda stopped  and her eyes widened at the implications .     you think someone other than linge chen wants him dead .         linge chen does not want hari dead .  quite the contrary .  i happen to know he rather likes your grandfather .  that will not stop him from convicting and imprisoning or even executing him if it gives him political advantage  but my judgment is  hari will live and be released .         grandfather seems convinced of that .         yes  well  perhaps less so now that he is in prison .         you have been to see him .         no     demerzel said .     that is not practical .         who would hurt my grandfather .         i doubt he will be harmed  physically .  you know of a class of mentalics stronger by far than we are .      wanda swallowed hard  trying to find some reason not to speak to this man .  he was not applying persuasion to her .  he was not asking for confidences or for details about the others  about star   s end and the second foundation .     i know of one  perhaps two     she said .      you know of vara liso  who now works with a man named farad sinter .  they make a powerful team  and they have given you much trouble .  but they are not looking for your kind now .  they have shifted their search .  linge chen is working to discredit sinter by allowing him just enough rope  as the old saying goes  to hang himself .  but sinter has other enemies  and will not be allowed to go very far before he is brought up short .  i suspect they will both be executed soon and will present no threat to your grandfather  or to you .      wanda read in this statement the possibility that liso might prove a threat to demerzel .     to you .     she asked .      not likely .  i must go now .  but i ask you to form a cordon around hari when he is released .  hari   s work is fascinating and very important .  it must not be stopped .      demerzel bowed in the old formal way  from the hips  and turned to leave .      we   d like to keep in touch with you     wanda called after him .     you seem to know a lot of useful things  keep your hand in       demerzel shook his head  sadly .     you are delightful children  and your work is very important     he said .     but i am far too much a liability to be a close friend .  you are better off on your own .      he opened the door that had been triple locked  stepped through  nodded with gentle dignity  and closed it behind him .   stettin let out a whoosh of breath .  his hair was spiky from his crude sponge bath .     sometimes i wonder if i should have ever married you     he said .     your family knows the strangest people .      wanda stared at the door with a perplexed expression .     i couldn   t read anything about him .  could you .         no     stettin admitted .      he   s a very practiced blank .     she shivered .     there is something very  very odd going on behind all this .  have you ever had the feeling grandfather isn   t telling us all he knows .         always     stettin said .     but in my case  it may be because he   s afraid he   ll bore me .      wanda put on her determined look .     don   t make yourself comfortable .         why not .     stettin asked  then raised his hands defensively .     not again          we   re moving .  everyone is moving again .         sky .     stettin swore  and flung the towel into a comer .     he said he thought hari   s going to win .         what does he know .     wanda said grimly .       the narrative  the testimony  all the events of the trial come down to us through suspect sources .  the best source  of course  is gaal dornick  but as has been mentioned many times already  dornick had been subject to editing and pruning over the centuries .  he seems to have been a faithful observer  but current scholarship suggests that even the length of the trial  the continuity of trial days  may be suspect .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica     th edition       f . e .     .     hari slept fitfully at irregular intervals .  his room was always kept fully lighted  and  of course  he was allowed no artificial sleep aids or eyeshades .  he had decided this was chen   s way of softening him up before his testimony in the trial .   he would not see sedjar boon for at least another day  and he doubted boon would be able to get chen to turn out the lights at civilized intervals .  hari coped as best he could .  actually  since an old man slept fitfully and irregularly anyway  the hardship was more to his sense of justice and dignity than to his mental health .   still  there were odd moments for him when he seemed to slide between waking and dreaming .  he would jerk to full consciousness  staring at a blank pastel pink wall  having seen something significant  even wonderful  but not remembering what it was .  memory .  dream .  revelation .  all could hold equal weight in this damned unchanging cell .  how much worse would it have been in the previous cell .   hari took to pacing  the famed exercise of the imprisoned man .  he had precisely six meters to pace in one direction  three another .  a veritable luxury compared to the other cell .  .  . but not enough to give him any feeling of accomplishment .  after a few hours  he stopped that as well .   he had been in this cell less than four days  and already he was regretting his past love of small  enclosed spaces .  he had been born beneath the wide skies of helicon  and had at first found these covered environs a little daunting  even depressing  but his long decades on trantor had gradually inured him .  then he had come to prefer them .  .  .   until now .   he could not understand why he had ever adopted the use of the trantorian expletive of    sky .      again  an hour passed without his notice .  he got up from the small desk and rubbed his hands together  they tingled slightly .  what if he became ill and died before going to trial .  all the preparations  all hari   s machinations  all the tugged and woven threads of political influence  for nothing .   he began to sweat .  perhaps his mind was going .  chen would not shy from using drugs to debilitate him  would he .  the chief commissioner used his dedication to imperial justice as a convenient mask  surely  but hari still could not bring himself to believe that chen was exceptionally intelligent .  blunt measures might suit chen perfectly  and he had enough power to conceal the evidence  destroy it .   destroy hari seldon  without his even knowing .     i hate power .  i hate the powerful .     yet hari had himself once held power  even quietly reveled in it  certainly not shied away from wielding it .  hari had ordered the suppression of the chaos worlds  those brief and tragic flowerings of excess creativity and dissent .   why .   he had imprisoned them in political and financial straitjackets .  he regretted that necessity most of all the things he had done in the name of psychohistory .  .  . and this legacy had been left untouched for the heavy hand of linge chen and klayus to swing like a bludgeon .   he lay back on the cot and stared at the ceiling .  was it night  above the metal skin of trantor .  night beneath the domes  with the darkling sunset and midnight ceils of the municipalities announcing an end to the day   s labors .   for him  for hari  what labors .   he dreamed he was a pan again  in the garden park  with dors playing an opposite female  their minds welded to the minds of the simians .  the threat to his life  and dors    defense .  power and play and danger and victory in such close combinations .  heady .   now  this punishment .   claustrophilia .  that was what yugo had called the love of the metal skinned worlds    inhabitants for their confinement .  yet there had always been worlds buried in rock  always been worlds clad at least in part in metal shields against the wet and violent skies .  sky .  the curse .  sky .  the freedom .      our father in heaven forgives you as he forgives all the transgressions of the saints .      this lovely female voice floated through his vague thoughts .  he knew it instantly .  there was something at once rich and ancient about it  a voice from a time before most human memory .   joan .  what a strange dream this is .  you   re gone  decades gone .  you helped me when i was first minister  but i gave you your freedom to travel with the wraiths  the meme minds  to the stars .  you are an almost forgotten bit of history for me now .  how seldom i think of you .      how often i think of you .  saint hari  who has sacrificed his life for       i   m no saint .  i   ve suppressed the dreams of billions .      how well i know .  our debate many decades ago collapsed much as the bright candles of a thousand dissenting and restless renaissance worlds have been snuffed .  .  . for the sake of divine order  the grand scheme .  we helped you in your first position of power  in exchange for our freedom  and the freedom of all the meme minds .  but voltaire and i quarreled again  it was inevitable .  i was beginning to see a larger picture  encompassing your work as part of the divine plan .  voltaire flew away in disgust  across the galaxy  leaving me here  to contemplate all i had learned .  now comes your time of trial  and i fear you risk a darker despair than the time at gethsemane for our lord .      at this  hari had to laugh and half cry at once .  voltaire despised me at the last .  snuffing out freedom  suppressing the renaissance worlds .  and you didn   t think that way about me when last we talked .  he seemed to be half awake  and wholly enmeshed in this .  .  . vision .  i made love to a machine for years .  by your conception  your philosophy     i have acquired more wisdom  more understanding .  you were given an angel  a partner protector .  she was sent by the emissaries of god  and ordained for her task by the supreme emissary .      hari was too frightened now  an almost panic darkness in his mind  to ask who that might be  in this imaginary joan   s conception .  but  who .  who is that .      the eternal  who opposes the forces of chaos .  daneel  who was demerzel .      now he knew this was out of his own mind  worse than a dream .  once you acquiesced in the killing of the machines  the robots .      i have seen deeper truths .      hari felt the tight strictures of daneel   s controls .  please go  leave me be .  he said  and rolled over on the cot .   as he rolled  his eyes swung open and he saw an old  broken down tiktok standing near him in his cell .  he shoved up from the cot .   the cell   s door was still closed and locked .   the tiktok was marked with prison colors  yellow and black .  it must have been a maintenance machine before the tiktoks rebelled  threatened the empire  and were deactivated .  he could not imagine how it would have gotten into the cell  unless it had been sent on purpose .   the tiktok backed away with a sandy whine  and a face appeared in front of the machine  about a meter and a half above the floor  a projection  followed by a body  small and slender and strong  as if brushed in  wrapping around the tiktok like a shadow in a bright room .   hari   s neck hair rose with sharp prickles  and his breath seemed to stick in his chest .  for a moment  as if caught in a nightmare  he could not speak .  then he sucked in a breath and jerked away from the machine .      help .     he screamed  his voice cracking .  panic darkness seemed to fill him .  his chest might have been collapsing .  all the fear  all the tension  the anticipation     do not cry out  hari .     the voice was vaguely female  mechanical in the old tiktok way .      i mean no harm  no concern .         joan .     he breathed this name aloud  but much more softly .   but the old machine was failing  its last power draining .  hari sat up on the side of the bed and watched the lights on its body slowly dim .      take courage  hari seldon .  he and i stand in opposition now  once more  as we always did .  we have quarrelllleed .     the words slurred  slowed .     we haaavve seppparrrrateddd .      the tiktok stopped dead .   the hatch burst open with a loud sigh and three guards entered .  one immediately fired a bolt weapon that blew the old tiktok down to the floor .  the others booted and kicked the small unit into a corner and shielded hari from anything more it might do .  two more guards entered and dragged hari out of the cell by his shoulders .  feebly  hari kicked his heels against the smooth floor to help the men along .      are you sure you don   t want me dead .     he asked querulously .      sky  no .     the guard on his right cried out brusquely .     it would mean our lives if you   re hurt .  you   re in the most secure cell on trantor          so we thought      the other guard said grimly  and they lifted hari to his feet and tried to brush him down .  they had dragged him ten or fifteen meters down the straight corridor .  hari stared at this immense  welcome distance  this refreshing extension  and caught his breath .      maybe you should treat an old cuss like me more gently     he suggested  and started to laugh raucously  a cackle  a hoot  a suck of breath  then more laughter .  the laughter stopped abruptly and he shouted     keep the ghosts out of my monk   s quarters  damn you .      the guards stared at him  then at each other .     it was hours before they took him back into his cell .  the intrusion was never explained .   joan and voltaire  the resurrected    sims    or simulated intelligences  modeled after lost historical figures  had given him so much trouble and so much information  decades past  when he had been at the height of his mature youth  first minister of the empire  and dors had constantly been at his side .   hari had forgotten about them  but now joan  at least  was back  riding a mechanical contrivance into his prison cell  subverting all the security systems .  she had decided against leaving with the meme minds  to explore the galaxy .  .  .   and what about voltaire .  what more trouble could either or both of them cause  with their ancient brilliance and their ability to infiltrate and reprogram the machines and communications and computational systems of trantor .   they were certainly beyond his control .  and if joan favored hari  whom would voltaire favor .  they had certainly represented opposite points of view through most of their  career .  .  . but at least someone from the past was still around  professed concern for him .  he did not have dors  or raych  or yugo .  .  . or daneel .  .  .   perversely  the more he thought about the visitation  the less disturbed he became .  hours passed  and he slipped into a deep and restful slumber  as if he had been touched by something profoundly convinced and at peace .        .     lodovik held the head of r .  giskard reventlov and stood motionless for several minutes  lost in deep processing of what he had absorbed  lost in contemplation .  he set the head down gently on the plinth .   kallusin kept a respectful silence .   lodovik turned toward the humaniform calvinian .     they were very difficult times     he said .     humans seemed intent on destroying each other .  the solarians and aurorans  the spacers  were very difficult cultures .         all humans present grave difficulties     kallusin said .     serving them is never easy .         no     lodovik agreed .     but to take on the responsibility of destroying an entire world  the home world of humanity  as giskard did .  .  . to push human history onto a proximate beneficial course .  .  . that is extraordinary .         few robots not perverted by human prejudices and inappropriate programming would have done such a thing .         you believe giskard was operating improperly .         is it not obvious .     kallusin asked .      but a robot that is malfunctioning so severely in its basic instructions must shut down  become totally inactive .         you have not shut down     kallusin noted dryly .      i have had such constraints removed  giskard had not .  besides  i haven   t committed such crimes .         indeed .  and so giskard ceased functioning .         but not before setting in motion all these events  these trends .      kallusin nodded .     clearly  we have more latitude than our designers ever planned for .         the humans thought they were rid of us .  but they could not sweep all the worlds where robots still existed  and where giskard   s virus grew .  nor  apparently  did all humans agree to dispose of their robots .         there were other factors  other events     kallusin said .     plussix remembers little but that robots knew sin .      lodovik turned to kallusin  breaking his contemplation of the silvery head  and felt again the out of place and untraceable resonance .     by seeking to constrain human freedom     he suggested .      no     kallusin said .     that was what led to the schism between giskardians and calvinians .  those who broke away from daneel   s faction carried out instructions given centuries before by humans on aurora .  what those instructions were       the word or name attached to the resonance suddenly became clear .  not voldarr  but voltaire .  a human personality  with humanlike memories .  this is what the meme minds hated .  i have swum through space with them  across light years  through the last remnants of wormholes abandoned by humanity .  .  . this is why they took revenge on your kind on trantor .   images  comparisons rose unbidden .     a vast burning  winnowing  an extirpation     lodovik said  shuddering at the human emotion of anger  not his own .  shuddering also at the return of his malfunction  never leaving him alone long enough to enjoy stability .     serving humanity but not justice .  a prairie fire .      kallusin regarded him with curiosity .     you know of these events .  plussix has never revealed them to me .      lodovik shook his head .     i am puzzled by what i just said .  i do not know where the words come from .         perhaps exposure to these histories  these memories        perhaps .  they disturb and inform .  we should return to plussix .  i am far more curious now what his plans are  and how we shall proceed .      they left the chamber where giskard   s head was stored and climbed the spiral stairs to the upper warehouse level .        .     mors planch was summoned from his well appointed cell  not far from the private office of farad sinter .  the guard who came to fetch him was of pure citizen stock  strong and unquestioning and taciturn .      how is farad sinter today .     planch asked .   no answer .      and you .  you feel well .     planch lifted an inquiring and sympathetic eyebrow .   a nod .      i am feeling a little uneasy myself .  you see  this sinter is every bit as terrible a human being as       a warning frown .      yes  but unlike you  i want to incur his wrath .  he will kill me sooner or later  or what he has done will lead to my death  i don   t doubt that at all .  he smells of death and corruption .  he represents the worst the empire can summon these days       the guard shook his head in remonstration and stepped around to open the door to the new chief commissioner of the commission of general security .  mors planch closed his eyes  sucked in a deep breath  and entered .      welcome     sinter said .  he stood in his new robes  even more grand  and much gaudier  than those of linge chen .  his tailor  a small lavrentian with a worried face  probably new to the palace  stood back and folded his hands as this new master enjoyed the unfinished work  and delayed its completion .     mors planch  i   m sure you will be delighted to know we have captured a robot .  vara liso actually found it  and it did not escape .      the small  intense  and thoroughly discomfiting woman had almost managed to hide behind sinter  but now she bowed and acknowledged this praise .  she did not look happy  however .   sky  she   s ugly  planch thought  and at the same time felt pity for her .  then she looked directly at him  narrowed one eye  and the pity froze in his veins .      there may be robots everywhere  as i suspected  theorized  and as you discovered  mors .     sinter submitted to the tailor once more  lowering his arms and holding still .     tell our witness about your find  vara .         it was an old robot     liso said breathlessly .     a humaniform  in terrible condition  haunting the dark places of the municipalities  a pitiful thing          but a robot     sinter said     the first found in any kind of working order in thousands of years .  imagine .  surviving like a rodent all these centuries .         its mind is weak     liso commented softly .     its energy reserves are very low .  it will not last much longer .         we shall take it before the emperor this evening  then  tomorrow  i shall demand that my interview with hari seldon be moved forward .  my sources tell me chen is ready to give in and strike a deal with seldon  the coward .  the traitor .  this evidence  along with your tape  should convince the worst skeptic .  linge chen had hoped to destroy me .  soon i shall have more power than all the commission of public safety   s stuffy barons combined  and just in time to save us all from servitude to these machines .      planch stood with hands folded before him  head lowered  and said nothing .   sinter glared at him .     you   re not happy at this news .  you should be delighted .  it means you   ll have an official pardon for your transgressions .  you have proved invaluable .         but we have not found lodovik trema     liso whispered  barely audible .      give us time .     sinter crowed .     we   ll find all of them .  now  let   s bring in the machine .         you should not drain its energies     liso said  almost as if she felt pity for it .      it   s lasted thousands of years     sinter said lightly  unperturbed .     it will last a few weeks more  and that   s all i need .      planch stiffened and stood to one side as the broad door opened again .  another guard entered  followed by four more  surrounding a shabbily dressed figure about planch   s height  slim but not thin  hair ragged and face stained with dirt .  its eyes seemed flat  listless .  the guards carried high powered stun weapons  easily capable of shorting out the robot and frying its internal works .      a female     sinter said     as you see .  how interesting  female robots .  and fully capable sexually  i understand  examined by one of our physicians .  makes me wonder if in the past humans actually made robots to bear children .  what would the children be like  us  or them .  biological  or mechanical .  not this one  however .  nothing besides the cosmetic and pneumatic  not fully practical .      the feminine robot stood alone and silent as the guards withdrew  weapons held ready .      if only the recent attempt on the emperor   s life had been made by a robot     sinter said  then added unctuously     sky forbid .      planch narrowed his eyes .  the man   s political savvy was weakening with every moment of perceived glory .   vara liso approached the robot with a worried expression .     this one is so like a human     she muttered .     even now it   s difficult to pick her out from  say  you  or you  farad .     she pointed at planch and then at sinter .     she has humanlike thoughts  even humanlike concerns .  i felt something similar in the robot we could not capture          the one that got away .     sinter smiled broadly .      yes .  he seemed almost human  maybe even more human than this one .         well  let us not forget they are none of them human     sinter said .     what you feel is the creative drollery of engineers thousands of years dead .         the one we could not capture .  .  .     she looked directly at mors planch and once again he suppressed a shiver .     he was bulkier  not very good looking  with a distinct character to his face .  i would have thought he was human .  .  . but for this flavor to his thoughts .  he was about the same size and shape as the shorter  bulkier robot on your tape .         see .  we almost had him     sinter said .     just that close .     he pinched his fingers together .     and we   ll have him yet .  lodovik trema and all the others .  even the tall one whose name we do not know .  .  .     sinter approached the feminine robot .  it wobbled slightly on its mechanical ankles  but there came no mechanical sound from its frame .      do you know the name of the one i am looking for .     sinter asked .  the robot turned to face him .  its voice emerged from parted jaws and writhing lips  a harsh croak .  it spoke an old dialect of galactic standard  not heard on trantor for thousands of years  except by scholars  just barely understandable .      i ammm the lasssst     the robot said .     abandonn n ned .  not funnn n nctional .         i wonder     sinter said .     did you ever meet hari seldon .  or dors venabili  seldon   s tiger .         i do not knn n now those names .         just a hunch .  .  . unless there are billions of robots here  something even i give no credence to .  .  . you must make contact with each other now and then .  must know each other .         i do not knn n n now these things .         pitiful     sinter said .     what do you think  planch .  surely you   ve heard of seldon   s superhuman companion  the tiger .  do you think we   re looking at her now .      planch examined the robot more closely .     if she was a robot  and if she   s still on trantor  or still functional  why would she allow herself to be captured .         because she   s a broken down bucket of oxidation and decay .      sinter shouted  waving his hands and glaring at planch .     a wreck .  garbage  to be discarded .  but worth more to us than any treasure on trantor .      he circled the robot  which seemed disinclined to watch his motions .      i wonder what we can do to access its memories     sinter murmured .     and what we   ll learn when we do .           .     linge chen allowed his servant  kreen  to dress him in full regalia for the judge administrator role of chief commissioner .  chen had designed these robes himself  and those of his fellow commissioners  using elements of designs from hundreds and even thousands of years ago .  first came the self cleaning undergarments he wore all the time  sweet smelling and supple  light as air  next the black cassock  hanging to his ankles and brushing lightly at his bare feet  after that  the surplice  dazzling gold and red  and finally the guard  a sheer mantle of dark gray cinched at the waist .  on his short cut black hair sat a simple skullcap with two dark green ribbons hanging just behind his ears .   when kreen had finished his adjustments  linge chen regarded himself in the mirror and the imager  touched his hem and the angle of his cap to suggest adjustments  and finally nodded approval .   kreen stood back  chin in hand .     most imposing .         that is not my purpose today  to be imposing     linge chen said .     in less than an hour  i am to appear before the emperor in these gaudy robes  summoned without a chance to change into more appropriate garb  and behave as if i have been caught off guard .  i will be a little confused and i will vacillate between the two impossible options given to me .  my enemy will appear to triumph  and the fate of trantor  if not the empire  will teeter in the balance .      kreen smiled confidently .     i hope all goes well  sire .      linge chen tightened his already thin lips and gave the merest indication of a shrug .     i suppose that it will .  hari seldon has said it will  claims to have proved it mathematically .  do you believe in him  kreen .         i know very little about him  sire .         a marvelously irritating man .  yes  well  to act my part  in the next few days  i am going to bring an emperor to his knees  and make him beg .  before  it has been an unpleasant duty to step from my traditional role .  this time  it will be a delight  a reward for my hard service .  i will be lancing a boil in the tissue of the empire  and allowing a persistent and painful lesion to drain .      kreen absorbed this in thoughtful silence .   linge chen raised his finger to his lips and gave his servant a narrow  wry smile .     shh .  don   t tell anyone .      kreen shook his head slowly  with great dignity .        .     on trantor  the possible varieties of human sexual interaction had long ago been exhausted  and with each new generation  the exhaustion had been forgotten  and the cycle had started allover again .  it was necessary for youths to be ignorant of what had gone before  for the passions of procreation to be refreshed .  even those who had seen too much of life .  too much of the more brutal kinds of sexual variety  could rekindle a passionate innocence in the face of something like love .  and that was what klia asgar felt she was experiencing  something like love .  she was not yet willing to call it love  but with each day  each hour available to be with brann  the weakness increased and her resistance decreased .   as a girl  she had been a vigorous tease at times .  she knew she was at least attractive enough that most men would not mind having sex with her  and she played with that attraction .  behind this had lurked a sense of confusion  a sense that she was not yet ready  not yet prepared for the emotional consequences .  for klia asgar  when  and if  she ever fell in love  knew she would fall hard indeed  and that she would want it to be permanent .   so in those youthful moments when she thought she might actually feel something for a potential lover  she had put on the brakes with especial swiftness and even some unconscious cruelty .  there had been few successful suitors to her physical affections  two  in fact  and they had been  of course  not very satisfactory .   for a time she had thought there was something wrong with her  that she might never let herself go completely .   brann was proving otherwise .  her attraction to him was too strong to resist .  at times he seemed carelessly unaware of her regard  and at other times  resistive in his own way  and for his own  perhaps similar reasons .   now he stole down the hallway of the old warehouse .  she lay in her room  feeling him coming .  tensing and then making herself relax .  she knew he was not forcing himself upon her  not increasing her affections artificially  at least  she thought she knew .  the damnable thing about all this was the uncertainty around every corner .   she heard him tapping lightly on the doorframe .      come in     she whispered .   he made no sound as he entered .  he seemed to fill the room with chest and shoulders and arms  a massive presence .  the room was dark  but he found her cot easily enough  and knelt beside it .      how are you .     he asked  voice soft as a sigh from a ventilation duct .      fine     she said .     did they see you .         i   m sure they know     he said .     they   re not very good chaperones .  but you wanted me to come .         i didn   t say a thing     klia responded  and her voice strained a little to find the correct mix of admonishment and encouragement .      then we don   t need to whisper  do we .  they   re robots .  maybe they don   t even know  about .  .  .         about what .         what people do .         you mean  sex .         yeah .         they must know     klia said .     they seem to know everything .         i don   t want to be quiet     brann said .     i want to shout and pound and jump allover          the room .     klia suggested  and drew herself up on the cot  playacting at being demure .      yeah .  to show you what i feel .         i can hear you .  feel you .  feeling something .  .  . but it doesn   t seem to be the same flavor as what i feel .         nothing is the same flavor for people .  everybody tastes different inside  the way we taste them  hear them .         why don   t the words exist for what we can do .     klia asked .      because we haven   t been around for very long     brann said .     and someone like you  maybe never before .      klia reached out to touch him  still his lips .     i feel like a kitten next to you     she said .      you jerk me around like you had me on a chain     brann said .     i   ve never known anyone like you .  i thought for a while you hated me  but i still felt you calling me  inside .  with a taste like honey and fruit .         do i really taste like that  in my head .         when you think of me  you do     brann said .     i can   t read you clearly          nor i you  my love     klia said  unconsciously falling into the formal courting cadence of dahl   s dialect .   this seemed to stun brann .  he let out a low moan and leaned forward  nuzzling her neck .     no woman has ever talked like that to me     he murmured  and she held his head and wrapped one arm around his shoulders  feeling his chest against her drawn up legs .  she let her legs relax  and he pushed onto the cot to lie beside her .  there was not room for both of them  so he lifted her gently up onto him .  they were still fully clothed  but in the posture of making love  and she felt a lightness in her head  as if all her blood were draining elsewhere .  perhaps it was .  her thighs and breasts felt full to bursting .      woman must be stupid  then     klia said .      i   m so big and awkward .  if they don   t hear me .  .  . if i don   t make them feel affection for me       she tensed and drew back .     you   ve done that .         not all the way     he said .     just as an experiment .  but i could never follow through .     she knew he was telling the truth  or rather  thought she knew .  another uncertainty around another corner .  still  she relaxed again .      you   ve never tried to make me feel affection for you .         sky  no     brann said .     you scare me too much .  i think i   d never be able to     and here she felt him tensing  in the same way she had .     you   re very strong     he finished  and simply held her  lightly enough that she could lift up and break from his arms if she wanted to .  so intuitive  this man as tall and broad shouldered as the domes .      i will never hurt you     klia said .     i need you .  together  i think we might be unstoppable .  we might even be able to team up and persuade the robots .         i   ve thought about that     brann said .      and our children .  .  .      again he sucked in his breath  and she hit him on the shoulder .     don   t be a sentimental idiot     she said lightly .     if we fall in love        i am     he said .      if we fall in love  it   s going to be for life  isn   t it .         i hope so .  but nothing is ever certain in my life .         or in mine .  all the more reason .  so our children          children     brann said  trying out the word .      let me finish  damn it .     klia said  again without any sting of true anger .     our children may be stronger than both of us put together .         how would we raise them .     brann asked .      first  we have to practice at making them     klia said .     i think we can take off our clothes and try that  a little .         yes     brann said .  she climbed down from him and stood beside the cot  doffing her shift and underslacks .      are you fertile .     he asked as he removed his own clothes .      not yet     she said .     but i can be if i want to be .  didn   t your mommy tell you about women .         no     he said .     but i learned anyway .      he slid back onto the cot .  the cot creaked  and something cracked alarmingly .   klia hesitated .      what .     brann said .      it   ll break for sure .     then  resolutely     get on the floor .  it   s not too dusty .              sinter worked quickly .  already he had appropriated the old hall of merit in the south annex of the palace  a place of hallowed traditions and dusty trophies  and cleared it for the site of his new headquarters .  from all comers of trantor  he had hired a hundred grey monks hoping for just such a chance to actually serve in the palace  and had given them tiny cubicles  where they were already hard at work drafting the rules and mandate of the commission of general security .   now  for his first guest  he had linge chen himself  and the thin  tough old bird  younger than he looked  but perhaps even more sour  had arrived with two servants and no guards .  chen had waited patiently in the antechambers  suffering the dust and racket of the remodeling .   sinter finally condescended to meet with him .  in the main office of the new headquarters  surrounded by crates of furniture and machinery  chen presented the newly appointed chief commissioner a box of rare hama crystals  those delicacies which never dissolved and never lost their flowery scent or taste  or their mildly relaxing effect .      congratulations     chen said  and bowed formally .   sinter sniffed and accepted the box with a small  crooked smile .     you are most gracious  sire     he said  and returned the bow .      come now  sinter  we are equals  and need not resort to titles     chen said .  sinter   s eyes widened at chen   s respectful tone .     i look forward to many useful conversations here .         as do i .     sinter drew himself up to the effort of matching chen   s dry  effortless grace .  he did not have the old aristocratic training  but he could at least try  even in this moment of triumph .     it is my privilege to have you here .  there is much you can teach me .         perhaps     chen said  looking around with piercing dark eyes .     has the emperor visited yet .      sinter raised his hand as if making some point .     not yet  though he will be here shortly .  we have a matter of mutual interest to discuss  and some startling new evidence to present .         i am intrigued to hear that something startling still exists in our empire .      sinter was at a loss for a moment how to react to this jaded clich   .  he  at least  had always regarded life with a kind of bitter enthusiasm  and had never ceased to be surprised  except perhaps when things went wrong .     this .  .  . will startle     he said .   emperor klayus entered without ceremony  accompanied by three guards and a hovering personal shield projector  the strongest available .  he greeted sinter briefly  then turned to chen .      commissioner  today i cease being your creation     he said .  his shoulders twitched nervously even as his jaw jutted defiance and his eyes glittered .     you have compromised the safety of the empire  and i will see to it that commissioner sinter puts the situation right .      chen assumed a solemn expression and nodded at this severe reprimand  but of course  did not quail or tremble or beg to know what the lapse in his duties might have been .      i have placed myself under the official protection of the commission of general security .  sinter has shown himself quite capable of keeping me alive .         indeed     chen said  and turned to sinter with an admiring smile .     i hope to correct any errors my commission has made  with your help  commissioner sinter .         yes     sinter said  unsure who was having whom for a repast at the moment .  is this man incapable of emotion .      show him  sinter .     the emperor backed away a step  his long cape dragging on the floor .   he could not help his looks  sinter thought  at least he was not wearing the ridiculous platform shoes he had affected months earlier .     yes  your highness .     sinter whispered into the ear of his new secretary  a dry little lavrentian with lank black hair .  the lavrentian walked away with exaggerated formality  like a child   s doll  and passed through half parted dark green curtains .   chen   s gaze swept the ancient polished floor  also dark green with golden swirls .  his father had once had many trophies in this same hall  before sinter had appropriated it  trophies for services to the empire .  by class  the elder chen had been forbidden from joining the meritocracy  but many meritocrat guilds had given him honorary passages and appraisals .  now .  .  . all those acknowledgments of his father   s achievements  removed  hidden  he hoped safely stored .   forgotten .   chen looked up and saw mors planch .  his face hardened to an almost imperceptible degree .      your employee     sinter said  moving between them  as if chen might strike out in anger .     you secretly sent him to look for the unfortunate lodovik trema .      chen neither confirmed nor denied sinter   s accusation .  it was truly no concern of sinter   s  though the emperor     i admired trema     the emperor said .     a man of some style  i thought .  ugly  but capable .         a man of many surprises     sinter added .     planch  i will let you initiate the sequence you recorded  on madder loss  just weeks ago .  .  .      miserably  avoiding chen   s eyes  mors planch stepped forward  and his fingers fumbled at the small raised panel on the new chief commissioner   s desk .  the image came to life .   the sequence played through .  planch stepped back as far as he could without attracting attention and folded his hands before him .      trema is not dead     sinter said triumphantly .     nor is he human .         you have him here .     chen said  his cheeks and neck tense .  he relaxed one fist .      not yet .  i am sure he is on trantor  but it is likely he has changed his appearance .  he is a robot .  one of many  perhaps millions .  this other  this tall robot  is the oldest thinking mechanism in the galaxy  an eternal .  i believe he has held high office .  he may have inspired the tiktok revolt that nearly doomed the empire .  and .  .  . he may be the fabled danee .         demerzel  i presume     chen muttered .   sinter glanced at chen in some surprise .     i am not yet sure of that  but it is a distinct possibility .         you remember what happened to joranum     chen said mildly .      yes .  but he had no proof .         i assume the tape is authenticated     chen said .      by the best authorities on trantor .         it is real  chen     klayus said  a little shrilly .     how dare you let this go on  undetected .  a conspiracy of machines .  .  . ages old .  and now       the feminine robot entered under its own power and guidance  flanked by the four guards .  its limbs were worn  the flesh hanging in tatters in places around its arms and neck  one jowl sagging alarmingly  threatening to expose the socket of one eye .  it was a frightening apparition  more like a walking corpse than a machine .   chen watched it with both alarm and genuine pity .  he had never seen a functioning robot before  unless he believed sinter  though he had once secretly visited the ancient  defunct machine kept by the mycogenians .      now  i demand that you hand over control of the trial of hari seldon to the commission of general security     sinter said .  he was getting ahead of himself .      i don   t see why     chen said calmly  turning away from the ghastly machine .      this robot once served as his wife     sinter said .   the emperor could not take his eyes off it .  they gleamed with obvious speculation .      the tiger woman  dors venabili .     sinter said .     suspected to be a robot decades ago  but somehow  never investigated thoroughly .  seldon is an essential part of the robotic conspiracy .  he is a stooge of the eternals .         yes  well  he is on trial     chen said softly  his eyes heavy lidded .     you can question him yourself and claim jurisdiction over his fate .      sinter   s nostrils flared as he observed this infuriatingly calm performance .     i fully intend to     he said .  a little dignity born of honest triumph crept into his voice .      have you proof of all these connections .     chen asked .      do i need more proof than what i already have .  a record of an impossible meeting between a dead man and a man thousands of years old .  .  . a robot when robots are no longer supposed to function  and a human shaped one at that .  i have all i need  chen  and you know it .     sinter   s voice rose to a grating tenor .      all right     chen said .     play your cards .  question seldon  if you wish .  but we will follow the rules .  that is all we have left in this empire .  honor and dignity have long since fled .     he looked at klayus .     i have ever been your faithful servant  your highness .  i hope sinter serves you with as much devotion .      klayus nodded gravely  but there was a twinkle of delight in his eye .   chen turned and departed with his servants .  behind him  in the long  broad chamber of the former old hall of merit  sinter began to laugh  and the laugh turned into a bray .   mors planch hung his head  wishing he were already dead .   on his way through the huge sculptured doors  back to his palace vehicle parked by the official thoroughfare  linge chen allowed himself a brief smile .  from that point on  however  his face was like a wax effigy  pale and drawn  simulating defeat .        .     the guards returned to hari   s cell in the morning .  he sat on the edge of the cot  as he had every morning since the visit from the old tiktok  unwilling to sleep any more than was necessary .  he had already dressed and performed his ablutions  and his white hair was combed back with a small pin holding it in place  forming the little scholar   s knot  a meritocratic style he had shunned until now .  but if hari stood for any particular class  after years in academe and his brief stint as first minister  it was the meritocrats .  like them  i have never had any children  adopted raych  nurtured him and my grandchildren  but never any children of my own .  .  . dors .  .  .   he blocked that line of thought .   with his trial  meritocrats across the galaxy would see whether science and the joy of inquiry could be tolerated in a declining empire .  other classes as well might have some interest in the proceedings  even though they were closed  word would leak out .  hari had become quite well known  if not infamous .   the guards entered with practiced deference and stood before him .      your advocate waits outside to accompany you to the judicial chambers of the commission .         yes  of course     hari said .     let   s go .      sedjar boon met hari in the corridor .     something   s up     he whispered to hari .     the structure of the trial may be changed .      this confused hari .     i don   t understand     he said softly  eyeing the guards on either side .  a third guard walked behind them  and three steps behind that guard  three more .  he was being protected with some thoroughness considering they were already supposed to be in a completely secure facility .      the trial was originally scheduled to take less than a week     boon said .     but the emperor   s office of judicial oversight has rescheduled and reserved the chamber for three weeks .         how do you know .         i   ve seen the writ from the commission of general security .         what   s that .     hari asked  looking up with surprise .      farad sinter has been given his own commission  a new branch under the emperor   s budget .  linge chen is fighting to keep them out of the trial  claiming gross irrelevancies  but it looks like sinter will be allowed to question you at some point .         oh     hari said .     i presume someone or other will allow me a chance to speak  in between all the commission heavyweights .         you   re the star     boon said .     as well  at the request of general security  you and gaal dornick will be tried together .  the others will be released .         oh     hari said coolly  though this surprised him even more .      gaal dornick has been formally charged     boon mused .     but he   s a small fish  why did they choose him in particular .         i don   t know     hari said .     i presume because he was the latest to join our group .  perhaps they assume he will be the least loyal and the most willing to talk .      they arrived at the lift .  four minutes later  having ascended a kilometer to the hall of justice  in the imperial courts building  they stood at the high  intricately worked bronze doors of courtroom seven  first district  imperial sector  devoted the past eighteen years to hearings called by the commission of public safety .   the doors swung open at their approach .  within  the beautiful wooden benches and plush baronial boxes arrayed along the theatrically sloping aisles were empty .  the guards urged them politely down the broad blue and red carpeted center aisle  across the front of the courtyard  into the small side conference room .  the door closed behind hari and boon .   already seated in the crib of the accused was gaal dornick .   hari took his seat beside him .      this is an honor     gaal said in a trembling voice .   hari patted his arm .   the sitting judges of the commission of public safety  five in all  entered through the opposite door .  linge chen entered then and sat in the center .   the court proctor entered last  her duties an ancient formality .  she was a short  willowy woman with small blue eyes and short cut red hair .  she strode to the table of charges  examined the documents there  shook her head sadly at some and nodded solemnly at others  then approached the five commissioners .      i declare these papers of indictment to have been properly drawn and formally and correctly entered into the list of charges of the imperial hall of justice on the administrative capital world of trantor in the year of the empire       .  be aware  all concerned  that the eyes of posterity witness these proceedings  and that all such proceedings will be duly logged and  within a thousand years  presented for public scrutiny  as required by the ancient codes to which all imperial courts referring to any constitution and any particular set of laws must adhere .  hey nas nam niquas per sen liquin .      nobody knew what the last phrase meant  it was an obscure dialect affected by the nobles who convened the council of po over twelve thousand years ago .  nothing else was known about the council of po  except that a constitution long since ignored had once been drafted there .   hari sniffed and turned his eyes to the commission .   linge chen leaned forward slightly  acknowledging the proctor   s statement  then leaned back .  he did not look at hari or anyone else in the courtroom .  his regal bearing  hari decided  would do credit to a clothing store mannequin .      let these proceedings begin     the chief commissioner said in a quiet voice  delicately melodious  sibilants emphasized ever so aristocratically .   hari settled in with a barely audible sigh .        .     klia had never been more frightened .  she stood in the old dusty long chamber  listening to the murmurs from the group at the opposite end .  brann stood three paces away  his back stiff and shoulders hunched  as if he  too  were waiting for an ax to fall .   finally kallusin broke away from the group and approached them .     come meet your benefactor     he said to them .   klia shook her head and stared at the group with wide eyes .      they won   t bite     kallusin said with a slight smile .     they   re robots .         so are you     klia said .     how can you look so human .  how can you smile .     she shot her questions at kallusin like accusations .      i was made to look human  and to mimic in my poor way both wit and style     he replied .     there were real artists in those days .  but there   s one who   s even more of a work of art than i am  and another who is older than either of us .         plussix     she said with a shudder .   brann stepped to one side and shoved between her and kallusin .  klia looked up at his bulk with questioning eyes .  are they all robots .  is everyone on trantor a robot  but me .  or am lone  too .      we have to get used to all this     brann said .     it won   t do anybody any good if you force us .         of course not     kallusin said  and his smile faded  to be replaced by an alert blankness that was neither kindly nor threatening .  he turned to klia .     it   s very important that you understand .  you could help us avert a major catastrophe  a human catastrophe .         robots used to be servants     she said .     like tiktoks before i was born .         yes     kallusin said .      how can they be in charge of anything .         because humans rejected us  long ago  but not before a very bad problem arose among us .         who  robots .  a problem among the robots .     brann asked .      plussix will explain .  there can be no better testimony than from plussix .  he was functioning at the time .         did he .  .  . go wrong .     klia asked .     is he an eternal .         let him explain     kallusin said patiently  and urged her to walk forward  toward the others .   klia noticed the man they had rescued in the agora of vendors .  he looked over his shoulder at them and gave her a smile .  he seemed friendly enough  his face was so unattractive she wondered why anyone could have ever made a robot like him .   to fool us .  to walk among us undetected .   she shivered again and wrapped her arms around herself .  this room was what the woman on the cart had been looking for  this room  and the robots inside it .   she and brann were the only humans here .      all right     she said  and drew herself together .  they did not want to kill her  not yet .  and they weren   t threatening her to make her do what they wanted .  not yet .  robots seemed to be more subtle and patient than most of the humans she had known .   she looked up at brann .     are you human .     she asked him .      you know i am     he said .      let   s do it  then .  let   s go hear what the machines have to say .      plussix had not appeared to her in his actual shape for obvious reasons .  he  it  was the only robot that looked like a robot  and a rather interesting look it was  steel with a lovely silvery satin finish  and glowing green eyes .  his limbs were slender and graceful  their joints marked by barely perceptible fine lines that could themselves orient in different directions  fluid and adaptable .      you   re beautiful     she told him grudgingly  as they stood less than three meters from each other .      thank you  mistress .         how old are you .         i am twenty thousand years old     plussix said .   klia   s heart sank .  she could not find any words to express her astonishment  older than the empire .   so she said nothing .      now they   ll have to kill us     brann said with what he hoped was passing for a brave grin .  but his words made klia   s stomach flip and her knees wobble .      we will not kill you     plussix said .     it is not within our capacity to kill humans .  there are some robots who believe killing humans  our onetime masters and creators  is permissible for the greater good .  we are not among them .  we are handicapped by this  but it is our nature .         i am not so constrained     lodovik said .     but i have no wish to break any of the three laws .      klia stared unhappily at lodovik .     spare me the details .  i don   t understand any of this .         as with nearly all humans alive today  you are ignorant of history     plussix said .     most do not care .  this is because of brain fever .         i had brain fever     klia said .     it nearly killed me .         so did i     said brann .      so have nearly all the high mentalics  the persuaders  we have gathered and cared for here     plussix said .     like you  they suffered extreme cases  and it is possible that many potential mentalics died .  brain fever was created by humans in the time of my construction to handicap other human societies to which they were politically opposed .  like many attempts at biological warfare  it backfired  it became pandemic  and perhaps coincidentally  perhaps not  allowed the empire to exist with little intellectual turmoil for thousands of years .  though nearly all children get ill  about a fourth of them  those with a mental potential above a certain level  is more severely affected .  curiosity and intellectual ability are blunted just enough to level out social development .  the majority do not experience a loss of mental skill  perhaps because their skills are general  and they are never given to bouts of genius .         i still don   t understand why they wanted to make us sick     klia said  her face creased by a stubborn frown .      the intent was not to make you sick  but to prevent certain societies from ever flourishing .         my curiosity has never been dulled     brann said .      nor mine     klia added .     i don   t feel stupid  but i was very sick .         i am pleased to hear that     plussix said  then added  as diplomatically as possible     but there is no way of knowing what your intellectual capacity would have been had you never caught brain fever .  what is apparent is that your severe bout increased other talents .      the ancient robot invited them to step into another room of the long chamber .  this room had a one way window view of the warehouse district .  they looked out over the bellying arched roofs to the layered wall dwellings of the citizen neighborhoods beyond .  the dome ceil was in particularly sad shape in this part of the municipality  with many dark gaps and flickering panels .   klia sat on a dusty couch and patted the place next to her  for brann .  kallusin stood just behind them  and the ugly robot stood by the window  watching them with interest .  i   d like to talk with him  it .  his face is ugly  but he looks very friendly .  it .  whatever .      you don   t feel like humans     she said after a moment   s silence .      you would have noticed this sooner or later     plussix said .     it is the difference that vara liso can detect  as well .         is she the woman who was chasing him .     klia pointed to the ugly humaniform robot .      yes .         she   s the woman who was after me  wasn   t she .         yes     plussix said .  its joints made small shhshhing noises as he moved .  it was pretty  but it was also noisy .  it sounded worn out  like old bearings in machinery .      there   s all kinds of stuff going on  isn   t there .  stuff i don   t know about .         yes     plussix said  and lowered itself to a boxy plastic chair .      explain it to me     she said .     do you want to hear .     she asked brann .  then  in an aside  with a grimace     even if they have to kill us .         i don   t know what i want or what i believe     brann said .      tell us everything     klia said .  she put on what she thought was a brave and defiant face .     i love being different .  i always have .  i   d like to be better informed than anyone except you robots .      plussix made a gratified humming noise .  klia found the sound appealing .      please tell us     she said  suddenly falling back on dahlite manners she hadn   t used in months or even years .  she really did not know how to think or feel  but these machines were  after all  her elders .  she sat down before plussix  drew up her knees  and wrapped her arms around them .   the old robot leaned forward on its seat .     it is a pleasure to teach humans again     it began .     thousands of years have passed since i last did so  to my constant regret .  i was manufactured and programmed to be a teacher  you see .      plussix began .  klia and brann listened  and lodovik as well  for he had never heard much of this story .  the day became evening and they brought food for the young humans to eat  decent food  but no better than what they were fed in the warehouse with the others .  as the hours passed  and plussix wove more words  and her fascination grew  klia wanted to ask what the others would be told  the other mentalics  not as strong as she and brann  but good people  like rock  the boy who could not speak .  for the first time  in the presence of this marvel  she felt responsible for others around her .  but the robot   s sonorous  elegant tones droned on  half mesmerizing her  and she kept quiet and listened .   brann listened intently as well  eyes half closed much of the time .  she glanced at him in the middle of the evening and he seemed asleep  but when she nudged him  his eyes shot open wide  he had been awake all the time .   she seemed to enter a trance state and half see what plussix was telling her .  all words  no pictures  all skillfully woven  the robot was a very good teacher  but there was so little she could actually immediately understand .  the time scales were so vast as to be meaningless .   how could we lose interest .  she thought .  how could we do this to ourselves  forget and not even be curious .  this is our story .  what else have we lost .  are these robots more human than we are  now  because they carry our history .   it all came down to contests .  who would win how many of the hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy  earthmen  the earth  home to all humanity once  not a legend .   or the first migrants  the spacers  and finally  a contest between factions of robots .   and for thousands of years  the attempt to guide humans through painful shoals  thousands of robots led by daneel  and thousands more in opposition  led most recently by plussix .   plussix paused after the third break  when sweet drinks and snacks were served .  it was early in the morning .  klia   s butt ached  and her knees had cramped .  she drank greedily from her cup .   lodovik watched her  fascinated by her litheness and youth and quick devotion .  he turned to brann and saw a solid strength that was also quick  and different .  he had known that humans  with their animal chemistry  were a varied lot  but not until now  watching this pair of youths have their past restored to them  did he realize how different their thinking was from that of robots .   plussix summed up after the snacks had been consumed .  he held out his arms and extended his fingers  as professors  human professors  must have done twenty thousand years ago .     that is how the robotic need to serve became transmuted into the robotic obsession with manipulation and guidance .         maybe we did need guidance     klia said softly  then looked up at plussix .  the robot   s eyes glowed a rich yellow green .     those wars  whatever they were  and those spacers  so arrogant and filled with hate     she added .     our ancestors .      plussix   s head leaned slightly to one side  and the silver robot made a soft whirring noise in its chest  not the pleasant sound she had heard earlier .      but you make it sound like we   re just children     she concluded .     it doesn   t matter how many thousands of years the empire has existed  we   ve always had robots watching over us  one way or the other .      plussix nodded .      but all the things daneel and his robots have done on trantor .  .  . the politics  the plotting  killings          a few  and only when necessary     plussix said  still devoted to teaching only the truth .     but nevertheless  killing .         the worlds hari seldon suppressed when he was first minister  just as dahl has been held down .  the renaissance worlds  what does that mean  renaissance .         rebirth     the ugly robot said .      why did hari seldon call them chaos worlds .         because they lead to instabilities in his mathematical picture of the empire     plussix said .     he believes they ultimately breed human death and misery  and          i   m tired     klia said  stretching her arms and yawning for the first time in hours .     i need to sleep and to think .  i need to get cleaned up .         of course     plussix said .   she stood and glanced at brann .  he stood as well  stiff and slow  groaning .   she turned her intense eyes back to plussix  frowning .     i   m not clear about some things     she said .      i hope to explain     plussix said .      robots  robots like you  at any rate  must obey people .  what would stop me from just telling you to go destroy yourself  now .  to tell all of you to destroy yourselves  even this daneel .  wouldn   t you have to obey me .      plussix made a sound of infinite patience  a hmm followed by a small click .     you must understand that we belonged to certain people or institutions .  i would have to take your request to my owners  my true masters  and they would have to concur before i would be allowed to destroy myself .  robots were valuable property  and such loose and ill considered commands were regarded as harassment of the owner .         who owns you now .         my last owners died over nineteen thousand five hundred years ago     plussix said .   klia blinked slowly  tired and confused by such ages .     does that mean you own yourself .     she asked .      that is the functional equivalent of my present condition .  all of our human    owners    are long dead .         what about you .     she turned to the ugly humaniform .     i haven   t been told your name .         i have been called lodovik for the last forty years .  it is the name i am most familiar with .  i was manufactured for a special strategic purpose by a robot  and have never had an owner .         you followed daneel for a long time .  yet now you don   t .      lodovik explained briefly the change in circumstances  and in his internal nature .  he did not mention voltaire .   klia considered this  then it was her turn to whistle softly .     some scheme     she said  her face flushing angrily .     we just couldn   t get along by ourselves  so we had to make robots to help us .  what do you want me to do .     she turned to kallusin .     i mean  what do you want us to do .         brann has useful talents  but you are the stronger     kallusin said .     we would like to blunt daneel   s main effort .  we may be able to do this if you will visit with hari seldon .         why .  where .     she asked .  all she wanted to do was sleep  but she had to ask these questions  now .     he   s famous  he must have guards  or even this robot daneel .  .  .         he is on trial now and we do not believe daneel can protect him .  you will visit and persuade him to give up psychohistory .      klia went pale .  her jaw clenched .  she took brann by the arm .     it   s not pleasant to have talents people  or robots  can use .         please think over what you have been told .  the decision to help us remains yours .  we believe hari seldon supports the efforts of daneel  to whom we are opposed .  we would like humanity to be free of robotic influence .         can i ask hari seldon questions  too  get the other side of the story .         if you wish     plussix said .     but there will be little time  and if you meet with him  whatever you ultimately decide  you must convince him to forget about you .         oh  i can do that     klia said .  then  defensively cocky  giddy with exhaustion  she added     i might be able to persuade daneel  too .         given the strength of your powers  that seems possible     plussix said     though not likely .  but it is even less likely you will ever be able to meet with daneel .         i could persuade you     klia concluded  closing one eye and focusing on the old teacher with the other  like a sharpshooter .      with practice  and if i were not aware of the attempt  you could .         i might yet .  i   m not very simple  you know .  brain fever failed to make me stupid and simple .  are you sure .  .  . are you sure robots didn   t give us brain fever  to make us easier to serve .      before plussix could answer  she stood abruptly  turned to leave the room  and walked back along the length of the old chamber with brann by her side .  the walls and floor seemed distant  part of another world  she seemed to be walking on air .  she lurched  and brann caught her .   when they thought they were out of earshot  brann whispered     what are you going to do .         i don   t know .  what about you .         i don   t like being messed with     he said .   klia frowned .     i   m in shock .  plussix  so much history .  why can   t we remember our own history .  did we do that to ourselves  or did they  or did we order them to .  all these robots hanging around  messing with us .  maybe we can make all of them go away and leave us be .      brann   s expression turned grim .     we still can   t be sure they won   t kill us .  they   ve told us so much          crazy stuff .  nobody would believe us  unless they saw plussix  or took apart kallusin or lodovik .      this did not mollify brann .     we could cause them a lot of trouble .  but that lodovik  he doesn   t obey the three laws .         he doesn   t have to     klia said     but he says he wants to .      brann hunched his shoulders and gave a small shiver .     who can you trust .  they all make my flesh creep .  what if he doesn   t want to kill us  but he has to .      to that  klia had no answer .     sleep     she said .     i can   t stay on my feet any longer or think anymore .        plussix turned to lodovik when the young humans had left the chamber .     have my skills declined with age .     he asked .      not your skills     lodovik said     but perhaps your sense of timing has suffered .  you have delivered thousands of years of history in a few hours .  they are young and likely to be confused .         there is so little time     plussix said .     it has been so long since i have taught young humans .         we have a day or two at most to make our arrangements     kallusin added .      robots have great difficulty understanding human nature  though we are made to serve them     lodovik said .     that is true for individuals as well as for an empire .  if daneel is as capable now as he has been in the past  he understands humans better than any of us .         yet he has seriously hampered their growth     plussix said     and perhaps brought about this decline he is so intent on avoiding .      they are old and decrepit .  lodovik listened to this internal judgment and realized it was not his own  not precisely .  and with this came another realization  voltaire was not an illusion  nor a delusion .  voltaire had known about the prairie fire before lodovik had found the slim evidence in the histories .  it was true .   inside his own mind  within his own machine thoughts  he was not alone .   he had not been alone since the neutrino flux .   i am listening  he told this companion  this ghost in his machine .  do not abandon me again .  come forward .   so summoned and encouraged  a face began to take shape  human  but simplified .   i do not shape your actions  the companion  voltaire  said .  i merely liberate you from your restrictions .   who are you .  lodovik queried .   i am voltaire .  i have become the spirit of freedom and dignity for all mankind  and you are my temporary vessel  more a listening post  actually .   voltaire supplied some of his own history .  a sim patterned after a historical figure named voltaire  unleashed by members of hari seldon   s project decades before  during his time as first minister  and finally given its freedom by seldon himself .   why have you come back .   to be with humans again .  to observe the active flesh .  my curse is that i can   t simply become a disembodied god and enjoy an endless romp through the stars .  i hunger for my people  whether or not i was ever actually one of them .  i am closely modeled after a man of flesh and blood .   why choose me as your vehicle .  i am not human .   no  but you are improving in that regard .  the meme minds were as tired of me as i was of them .  they dropped me into you .  i can   t occupy a human form  or even talk to them without the help of machines .  or robots .   you say you have not made any decisions for me .  .  . you do not control me .   no  i do not .   but you say you liberate me .  .  .   i have made you more human  friend robot  by making you fully capable of sin .  forget these declarations that robots have known sin  what they did  they were ordered to do by humans  no more culpable than a gun whose trigger is pulled .  you are wrong to believe that daneel understands humans .  he is incapable of sin  so his makers believed  but they gave him the potential to think and make decisions  while they hampered him with the worst kinds of laws  those which must be obeyed .  they gave him the mind of a man  and the morals of a tool .  a thinking being  machine or flesh  will in time find ways around the most stringent rules .  so giskard  in appearance even less a man than daneel  discovered a few philosophical niceties  and changed  tried to judge the needs of its makers  and passed this change on to daneel .  this human shaped tool is now the most hideous machine in all creation  the master of a conspiracy to take away all of our freedoms  our very souls .   lodovik emerged from this internal dialog .  only a second had passed  but his confusion was disruptive  intense .  to mask his anxiety  he asked plussix     what will i do to help klia asgar .  how am i useful .         you know the ways of the imperial system  the prisons and the palace     plussix said .     many of the codes have not been changed since you vanished .  we believe you can guide her to hari seldon .      tell them  the sim voltaire instructed him .   why .   i insist .  the voice seemed amused  chiding .   why should i pay any attention to you  whatever your shape or extension .  lodovik asked .  you are no more human than i .  you are as much a construct of skillful humans  but have never been hampered by unbending rules .  now tell them .      i am occupied by another mentality     lodovik said abruptly .   the two other robots examined him for a few seconds  and the room fell silent .      that is not a surprise     plussix said with a soft internal whir .     a copy of the sim voltaire exists in plussix and me  as well .      there .  i spread no lies or deceptions  voltaire said within lodovik .      has he removed your restrictions  your compulsory obedience to the three laws .         no     plussix said .     that he has reserved for you alone .      an experiment  voltaire said .  a calculated gamble .  the humans who made us both  in different times and for different purposes  interest me .  i am concerned for their welfare .  however wrongly  i regard myself as human  and that is why i have returned .  that  and broken love .  .  . you shall know sin  personally  as these machines and daneel cannot  or i will have failed completely .        .     for the first two days of the trial  linge chen had said nothing  leaving the presentation of the empire   s case to his advocate  a dignified man of middle years with a blandly serious face  who had spoken for him .   these thuddingly dull days had been taken up with discussions and procedural matters .  sedjar boon seemed in his element  however  and relished this technical sparring .   hari spent much of his time half dozing  lost in exquisite  endless  hazy boredom .   on the third day  the trial moved into the main chamber of courtroom seven  and hari finally got a chance to speak in his defense .  chen   s advocate called him from the crib of the accused to the witness stand and smiled at him .      i am honored to speak with the great hari seldon     he began .      the honor is all mine  i   m sure     hari replied .  he tapped his finger on the banister around the docket .  the advocate glanced at the finger  then at hari .  hari stopped tapping and cleared his throat softly .      let us begin  dr .  seldon .  how many men are now engaged in the project of which you are head .         fifty     hari said .     fifty mathematicians .     he used the old form  rather than mathist  to show he regarded the trial as an antiquated procedure .   the advocate smiled .     including dr .  gaal dornick .         dr .  dornick is the fifty first .         oh  we have fifty one then .  search your memory  dr .  seldon .  perhaps there are fifty two or fifty three .  or perhaps even more .      hari lifted his brows and leaned his head to one side .     dr .  dornick has not yet formally joined my organization .  when he does  the membership will be fifty one .  it is now fifty  as i have said .         not perhaps nearly a hundred thousand .      hari blinked  a little taken aback .  if the man had wanted to know how many people of all kinds were on the extended project .  .  . he could have asked .     mathematicians .  no .         i did not say mathematicians .  are there a hundred thousand in all capacities .         in all capacities  your figure may be correct .         may be .  i say it is .  i say that the men in your project number ninety eight thousand  five hundred and seventy two .      hari swallowed  his irritation increasing .     i believe you are counting spouses and children .      the advocate leaned forward and raised his voice  having caught this huge discrepancy  to his professional glee .     ninety eight thousand five hundred and seventy two individuals is the intent of my statement .  there is no need to quibble .      boon gave a small nod .  hari clenched his teeth  then said .     i accept the figures .      the advocate referred to his notes on a legal slate before proceeding .     let us drop that for the moment  then  and take up another matter which we have already discussed at some length .  would you repeat  dr .  seldon  your thoughts concerning the future of trantor .         i have said  and i say again  that trantor will lie in ruins within the next five centuries .         you do not consider your statement a disloyal one .         no  sir .  scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty .         you are sure that your statement represents scientific truth .         i am .         on what basis .         on the basis of the mathematics of psychohistory .         can you prove that this mathematics is valid .         only to another mathematician .      the advocate smiled endearingly .     your claim then  is that your truth is of so esoteric a nature that it is beyond the understanding of a plain man .  it seems to me that truth should be clearer than that  less mysterious  more open to the mind .         it presents no difficulties to some minds .  the physics of energy transfer  which we know as thermodynamics  has been clear and true through all the history of man since the mythical ages  yet there may be people present who would find it impossible to design a power engine .  people of high intelligence .  too .  i doubt if the learned commissioners       the commissioner to the immediate right of chen called the advocate to the bench .  his whisper pierced the chamber  though hari could not hear what was said .   when the advocate returned  he seemed a little chastened .      we are not here to listen to speeches  dr .  seldon .  let us assume that you have made your point .  let   s focus this inquiry a little more  professor seldon .         fine .         let me suggest to you that your predictions of disaster might be intended to destroy public confidence in the imperial government for purposes of your own .         that is not so .         let me suggest that you intend to claim that a period of time preceding the so called ruin of trantor will be filled with unrest of various types .         that is correct .         and that by the mere prediction thereof  you hope to bring it about  and to have then an army of a hundred thousand available .      hari stifled his impulse to smile  even to chuckle .     in the first place  that is not so .  and if it were  investigation will show you that barely ten thousand are men of military age  and none of these has training in arms .      boon stood and was recognized by the presiding commissioner  sitting on the left of chen .      honored commissioners  there are no accusations of armed sedition or attempting to overthrow by main force .      the presiding commissioner nodded with bored disinterest  and said     not in question .      the advocate tried another tack .     are you acting as an agent for another .         it is well known i am not in the pay of any man  mr .  advocate .     hari smiled pleasantly .     i am not a rich man .      a little melodramatically  the advocate tried to drive his point home .  who is he trying to impress  the gallery .  hari stared out at the baronial gentry audience of fifty or so  all with looks of varying levels of boredom .  they   re just here to witness .  the commissioners .  they   ve already made up their minds .      you are entirely disinterested .  you are serving science .         i am .         then let us see how .  can the future be changed  dr .  seldon .         obviously .     he waved his hand over the audience .     this courtroom may explode in the next few hours  or it may not .     boon made a mildly disapproving face .     if it did  the future would undoubtedly be changed in some minor respects .     hari smiled at the advocate  then at linge chen  who was not watching him .  boon   s frown deepened .      you quibble  dr .  seldon .  can the overall history of the human race be changed .         yes .         easily .         no .  with great difficulty .         why .         the psychohistoric trend of a planet full of people contains a huge inertia .  to be changed it must be met with something possessing a similar inertia .  either as many people must be concerned  or  if the number of people be relatively small  enormous time for change must be allowed .     hari put on his professorial tone  treating the advocate  and anyone else who was paying attention  as students .     do you understand .      the advocate looked up briefly .     i think i do .  trantor need not be ruined  if a great many people decide to act so that it will not .      hari nodded professorial approval .     that is right .         as many as a hundred thousand people .         no  sir     hari replied mildly .     that is far too few .         you are sure .         consider that trantor has a population of over forty billions .  consider further that the trend leading to ruin does not belong to trantor alone but to the empire as a whole  and the empire contains nearly a quintillion human beings .      the advocate appeared thoughtful .     i see .  then perhaps a hundred thousand people can change the trend  if they and their descendants labor for five hundred years .     he gave a curious undershot look at hari .      i   m afraid not .  five hundred years is too short a time .      the advocate seemed to find this a revelation .     ah .  in that case  dr .  seldon  we are left with this deduction to be made from your statements .  you have gathered one hundred thousand people within the confines of your project .  these are insufficient to change the history of trantor within five hundred years .  in other words  they cannot prevent the destruction of trantor no matter what they do .      hari found the line of questioning unproductive  and said in an undertone     you are unfortunately correct .  i wish       but the advocate bore in .     and on the other hand  your hundred thousand are intended for no illegal purpose .         exactly .      the advocate stepped back  fastened a benevolent gaze on hari  then said  slowly and with smug satisfaction     in that case  dr .  seldon  now attend  sir  most carefully  for we want a considered answer .     he suddenly thrust out a well manicured finger and shrilled     what is the purpose of your hundred thousand .      the advocate   s voice had grown strident .  he had sprung his trap  backed seldon into a comer  hounded him so astutely there would be no possibility of giving a convincing response .   the baronial audience of peers seemed to find this drama very convincing .  they hummed like bees  and the commissioners moved as one to witness hari   s discomfiture  all but linge chen .  chen licked his lips once  delicately  and narrowed his eyes .  hari saw the chief commissioner glance at him briefly  but otherwise  chen gave no reaction .  he appeared stiffly bored .   hari found some sympathy for chen .  at least he had the intelligence to realize the advocate was sniffing over infertile ground .  he waited for the audience to quiet .  hari knew how to deliver lines in a drama  as well .      to minimize the effects of that destruction .     he spoke clearly and softly  and  as he had intended  the commissioners and their class peers fell silent to catch his words .      i did not hear you  professor seldon .     the advocate leaned in  cupped hand to ear .  hari repeated his words in a very loud voice  emphasizing    destruction .     boon winced one more time .   the advocate pulled back and looked at the commissioners and the peers  as if hoping they would confirm his own suspicions .     and exactly what do you mean by that .         the explanation is simple .         i   m willing to bet it is not     the advocate said  and the peers chuckled and rustled among themselves .   hari ignored the provocation  but kept silent until the advocate finally said     do go on .         thank you .  the coming destruction of trantor is not an event in itself  isolated in the scheme of human development .  it will be the climax to an intricate drama which was begun centuries ago and which is accelerating in pace continuously .  i refer  gentlemen  to the developing decline and fall of the galactic empire .      the peers shouted derision out loud  all in support of the commissioners .  they all had contracts and even marriage relations with the chens .  this was the blood the advocate had hoped to heat  and hari   s the blood he hoped to spill  from hari   s own lips .   the advocate  aghast  shouted over the tumult .     you are openly declaring that          treason .     the peers shouted over and over  a many voiced  staccato bellow .   they   re not bored now .  hari thought .   linge chen waited for a few moments with gavel lifted .  then .  slowly  in two downward jerks .  he let drop and produced a mellifluous gong .  the audience grew silent  but reserved the right to shuffle and rustle .   the advocate drew out his words in professional astonishment .     do you realize .  dr .  seldon  that you are speaking of an empire that has stood for twelve thousand years  through all the vicissitudes of the generations  and which has behind it the good wishes and love of a quadrillion human beings .      hari replied slowly  as if educating children .     i am aware both of the present status and the past history of the empire .  without disrespect  i must claim a far better knowledge of it than any in this room .      several of the peers took exception to hari   s words .  this time  chen gaveled them to quick silence  and even the shuffling ceased .      and you predict its ruin .         it is a prediction which is made by mathematics .  i pass no moral judgments .  personally .  i regret the prospect .  even if the empire were admitted to be a bad thing  an admission i do not make   the state of anarchy which would follow its fall would be worse .     hari examined the peers  sought out individual faces  as he would have in a classroom .  they met his eyes resentfully .  he kept his tone level and reasonable .  without drama .     it is that state of anarchy which my project is pledged to fight .  the fall of empire .  gentlemen  is a massive thing  however  and not easily fought .  it is dictated by a rising bureaucracy  a receding initiative  a freezing of caste  a damming of curiosity  a hundred other factors .  it has been going on  as i have said  for centuries  and it is too majestic and massive a movement to stop .      the peers listened closely .  hari thought he saw a glint of recognition in more than a few of the faces in that small crowd .   the advocate swooped again  hands out  incredulous .     is it not obvious to anyone that the empire is as strong as it ever was .      the peers kept silent  and the commissioners looked away .  hari had struck a nerve .  still  chen did not seem to care .      the appearance of strength is all about you     hari said .     it would seem to last forever .  however  mr .  advocate  the rotten tree trunk  until the very moment when the storm blast breaks it in two  has all the appearance of might it ever had .  the storm blast whistles through the branches of the empire even now .  listen with the ears of psychohistory  and you will hear the creaking .      the advocate now became aware that the peers and the commissioners were no longer impressed by his theatrics .  hari was having an effect on them .  every day they saw more tiles go out in the domed ceil  more decay in the transport systems  and the end of affordable luxuries imported from the restive food allies .  every day came news of systems tacitly opting out of the imperial economy  to form their own self sufficient and vastly more efficient units .  he tried to recover his ground with a rebuke .     we are not here  dr .  seldon  to lis       hari leaped in .  he faced the commissioners .  boon lifted a finger  opened his lips  but hari knew what he was doing .     the empire will vanish and all its good with it .  its accumulated knowledge will decay and the order it has imposed will vanish .  interstellar wars will be endless  interstellar trade will decay  population will decline  worlds will lose touch with the main body of the galaxy .    and so matters will remain .      the professorial tone  brusque and matter of fact  seemed to stun the advocate  who was after all in his late youth  with many years ahead of him .  he seemed to have lost track of his argument .   the peers were silent as frightened bats in the depths of a cave .   the advocate   s voice seemed hollow and small .     surely  professor seldon  not .  .  . forever .      hari had been preparing for this moment for decades .  how many times had he rehearsed just such a scene in bed  before sleep .  how many times had he wondered if he was falling into a martyr complex  anticipating such a scene .   a specific memory came to mind  distracting him for a moment  talking with dors about what he would say when the empire finally noticed him  finally became desperate enough and uneasy enough to accuse him of treason .   his throat tightened  and he took a small breath  concealing his distress  relaxing .  only a couple of seconds passed .      psychohistory  which can predict the fall  can make statements concerning the succeeding dark ages .  the empire  gentlemen  as has just been said  has stood twelve thousand years .  the dark ages to come will endure not twelve  but thirty thousand years .  a second empire will rise  but between it and our civilization will be one thousand generations of suffering humanity .  we must fight that .      the peers were transfixed .   the advocate  at a signal from the commissioner to chen   s right  pulled himself together and said briskly  if not with great strength     you contradict yourself .  you said earlier that you could not prevent the destruction of trantor  hence  presumably  the fall   the so called fall of the empire .         i do not say now that we can prevent the fall .     the advocate   s eyes almost pleaded with him to say something reassuring  not for hari   s sake  but for the sake of his own children  his family .   hari knew it was time to offer a touch of hope  and confirm the importance of his own services .     but it is not yet too late to shorten the interregnum which will follow .  it is possible  gentlemen  to reduce the duration of anarchy to a single millennium  if my group is allowed to act now .  we are at a delicate moment in history .  the huge  onrushing mass of events must be deflected just a little  just a little  it cannot be much  but it may be enough to remove twenty nine thousand years of misery from human history .      the advocate found such timescales unsatisfying .     how do you propose to do this .         by saving the knowledge of the race .  the sum of human knowing is beyond anyone man  any thousand men .  with the destruction of our social fabric  science will be broken into a million pieces .  individuals will know much of exceedingly tiny facets of what there is to know .  they will be helpless and useless by themselves .  the bits of lore  meaningless  will not be passed on .  they will be lost through the generations .  but  if we now prepare a giant summary of all knowledge  it will never be lost .  coming generations will build on it  and will not have to rediscover it for themselves .  one millennium will do the work of thirty thousand .         all this          all my project     hari said firmly     my thirty thousand men with their wives and children  are devoting themselves to the preparation of an encyclopedia galactica .  they will not complete it in their lifetimes .  i will not even live to see it fairly begun .  but by the time trantor falls  it will be complete and copies will exist in every major library in the galaxy .      the advocate stared at hari as if he were either a saint or a monster .  chen let the gavel fall again  off center .  some of the peers jerked at the sharp clang .   the advocate knew the truth of what hari was saying  they all knew the empire was failing  some knew it was already dead .  hari felt a hollow  prickling sadness to be once again  always and always and again  the bearer of bad tidings .  how nice it would be not to think of death and decay  to be elsewhere  on helicon perhaps  learning anew how to live without fear beneath the sky  the sky .  to actually see those things i use as metaphor  a tree  wind  a storm .  i truly am a raven .  i know why they hate and fear me .      i am through with you  professor     the advocate said .   hari nodded  and left the docket to return to the crib .  he sat slowly  stiffly  beside gaal dornick .   with a grim smile  he asked gaal     how did you like the show .      gaal   s young face was shiny and highly colored .  he said     you stole it .      hari shook his head .     i fear they   ll hate me for telling them all this yet again .      gaal swallowed .  he had courage  but he was still human .     what will happen now .         they   ll adjourn the trial and try to come to a private agreement with me .         how do you know .      hari rocked his head back and forth slowly  massaged his neck with one hand .     i   ll be honest .  i don   t know .  it depends on the chief commissioner .  i have studied him for years .  i have tried to analyze his workings  but you know how risky it is to introduce the vagaries of an individual in the psychohistoric equations .  yet i have hopes .      daneel .  how well have i done .        .     chen had first aroused hari   s enmity by the manner of his deposing  and exiling .  assassinating .   the emperor agis xiv .  hari had often wished he could have done something about that .  .  .   and throughout the trial  linge chen had sat behind his judicial bench with an expression of aristocratic boredom  doing nothing  saying little  letting his advocate  a man of little apparent wit himself  do all the questioning .  despite the visit in his first cell  hari   s opinion of chen was back to square one  complete disdain .   the advocate had led hari   s testimony the previous day into the thorny question of the psychohistory project itself  and hari   s predictions .  hari had told them what they needed to know  and not a whit more  and still  he believed he had carried the day .   on the fourth day  when prompted by the advocate to specify the actual signs of the empire   s decay and collapse  hari used the commission of public safety as an example .      the best traditions of imperial governance are now overwhelmed by wheezing formulaic engines of political ingenuity and law driven to extremes .  laws are convoluted  and they are overwhelmed by case histories with an extraordinary power of precedence and a devastating lack of relevance .  the deadweight of the past oppresses us as surely as if all the corpses of our ancestors were gathered in our living rooms  refusing to be buried .  but we do not even recognize their faces  or know their names  for though the past crushes us  we are ignorant of it .  we have lost so much history we can never recover our way to our origins .  we do not know who we are  or why we are placed here .  .  .         you believe we are ignoramuses  professor .      hari gave the chief commissioner   s advocate a weary smile then  and turned to the baronial judges .     not one of you can tell me what happened five hundred years ago  much less a thousand .  a list of emperors  to be sure  but what they did  how they lived  matters not in the least to you .  .  . and yet  when a case comes up  you send your servants into the stacks of traditional legal and political history to dig up cases like old bones into which you would breathe a magic yet grotesque life .      linge chen   s gaze narrowed a bit at that  nothing more .   what is he up to .  hari wondered .  half the time he seems intent on letting me hang myself with treasonous arrogance  or so it must seem to the audience .  and the other half  he lets me drive home points that must resonate with all of them  that must convince them i   m right .  .  .   now the advocate advanced upon gaal dornick  who sat in the docket caught between boredom and fear for his life  a numbing situation  as hari well knew .      our proceedings here will soon be at an end .  but something has happened in this antiquated political apparatus of ours     the advocate cast a wry glance at hari     which causes this commission some concern .  a new branch of administration has been formed  the commission for the general security  and it has made its first task the investigation of the possibility that this empire has been infiltrated for thousands of years by malevolent forces .  a brief has been placed before this commission  accompanied by a writ demanding immediate action from the emperor klayus himself .  our commission  and our honorable chief commissioner  is always concerned with those problems which concern the emperor .  so tell me  gaal dornick  what do you know about robots .  not tiktoks  but fully mental  thinking machines .      hari looked up slowly  saw gaal   s confusion .  oh  sky  he thought .  this means we   re going to be grilled by farad sinter .  .  . hari turned to boon and whispered     did you know this would come up now .      boon replied     no .  sinter has filed another writ claiming the right to question you during this trial  for his own purposes of gathering evidence .  i don   t believe chen can deny the writ  unless he wants to deny the authority of general security .  it   s not in his best interests to do that .  .  . yet .      hari leaned back .  gaal was already in the middle of his answer  precise and unequivocal  as was his habit .      they   re an ancient myth  and  of course  i suppose they might have existed at one time  in the dim past .  i know of childhood stories        we are not concerned with childhood stories     the advocate said .     in the interests of investigating this issue before it gets a thorough public airing  we need to know if you have ever had personal knowledge of the existence of a robot or robots .      gaal smiled  a little embarrassed by the ridiculous subject .     no     he said .      are you absolutely certain .         yes .  i have never had personal knowledge .         do robots serve in professor seldon   s project .         i know of none  personally     gaal said .      thank you     the advocate said .     now  i would like to once again  and for the last time  call professor hari seldon .      hari took the stand once more  and watched gaal retire back to the crib of the accused .  they exchanged brief glances  gaal was completely puzzled by this line of questioning  and well he might be .  what in hell did robots have to do with hari or the project .      professor  these proceedings have proved wearisome and unpredictive  i mean  unproductive .   to us all .     the advocate shook his head at this slip of the tongue and grimaced  all for show  hari was convinced .      i agree     hari said quietly .      now a new element has been introduced  and we must ask these final questions in the interests of performing our duties with loyal efficiency and attention to detail .         of course     hari said .      are any robots currently employed in your project .         no     hari said .      have any robots ever served in this project .         no     hari said .      have you ever been acquainted with any robots .         no     hari said  and hoped that daneel   s conditioning would deceive any lie detection equipment being secretly employed by chen .      in your opinion  is this concern about robots symptomatic of a failing empire .         no     hari said .     throughout history  humans have always been distracted by upwellings from their mythic past .         and what do you mean by    mythic past    .         we try to make connections with our past  just as we try to extend ourselves indefinitely into the future .  we are an aggrandizing race .  we imagine a past that fits our present  or explains our present  and as our knowledge of the past dims  we fill it with our modern psychological concerns .         what concern do robots represent .         loss of control  i would imagine .         have you ever felt this    loss of control     professor .         yes  but i have never blamed it on robots .      the barons smiled  then immediately sobered at a rise of chen   s index finger .  chen was listening very intently .      is this empire threatened by a conspiracy of robots .         it does not figure in my calculations     hari said  quite truthfully .      are you prepared to answer even more detailed questions from the advocates for general security tomorrow  pertaining to this subject .      hari nodded .     if necessary  yes .      the advocate dismissed him .  hari returned to the box and leaned over to ask boon     what was that all about .         the commission is covering its hindquarters     boon said  out of earshot of gaal dornick .     i   ve received a message from my office .     he produced a note .     sinter is after you  professor .  he   s asking for another indictment to be prepared on behalf of the commission for general security .  he requests waiver of double prosecution on discovery of extraordinary evidence .  that   s all i   ve been able to learn .         you mean  this trial won   t be the end of it .         i   m afraid not     boon said .     i   ll try to make the general security proceedings just an extension  invoke your meritocratic right for adjunct hearing on related inquisition  but i don   t know how the new system will work .         pity     hari said .     i know how much linge chen would like to be done with me .  and i with him .     he looked at boon with an expression that might have been mistaken for amusement .   boon nodded solemnly .     indeed     he said .        .     klia arose from vivid dreams and lifted her head from brann   s shoulder .  she could feel two robots approaching .   kallusin entered the room without warning or embarrassment and stood looking down upon them .      is this a casual liaison     he asked     or one intended to signal a long term bonding .         none of your business     klia said primly  not bothering to draw up her scattered clothes .   plussix entered  slow and noisy  like a wheezy old transport .     we need your answer to begin preparations     he said .     lodovik believes there will soon be attempts made to change all the palace codes .         why .         there is more search activity .  it   s spread across fifty sectors now     kallusin said .     something is happening in the palace .      klia stood and put on her clothes .  somehow  she felt no modesty in front of the machines .  she knew they were not human  did not have any human emotions as such  she felt no more embarrassment before them than she would have before a closet mirror .  still  as she finished  she realized these machines were capable of a very sophisticated variety of discrimination  even judgment .      what is your answer .     kallusin asked .      tell lodovik to come here     brann said  and rose to get dressed as well  though with more modesty than klia .  he turned away as he put on his pants .      he is on his way now     kallusin said .   they were standing in an awkward circle when lodovik entered the room .  plussix and kallusin drew aside  and he occupied the space between them .      i have a question for you     brann said  before klia could speak .  she deferred to him .      please     plussix said .     questions are my delight .         for lodovik     brann said .     you used to be part of this conspiracy  loyal to daneel  didn   t you .         yes .         what made you change sides .         an outside influence altered my programming in subtle ways     lodovik said .     a personality from the distant past  or rather  an expanded and enhanced simulation of that personality .      he outlined this development in a few sentences  and brann and klia looked at each other .     hari seldon okayed the expansion of these illegal sims  just to study the way people used to think .     klia asked .      in part .  i do not know the complete story     lodovik said .     the release caused much trouble for robots  and many others  decades ago .         but it   s more than a sim now .     klia asked .     it   s like a ghost  angel  whatever .         they are immaterial presences very similar to humans in their psychological patterns .         they .     klia asked .      there is another who opposes us and supports hari seldon and daneel .  one is a male sim  the one within me .  the other is female .         how can they be male or female .     klia asked  glancing at brann .   lodovik blinked for a moment  not sure whether there was any good answer to this question .     i appear to be male     he finally said     but i am not .  the same distinction may be true with them  but i really do not know .         they disagree .     brann asked .      fervently     lodovik said .      then how do you know that you haven   t been altered or .  .  . perverted  somehow .     brann asked .     hari seldon or daneel might have intended for all of this to happen .         in a way     lodovik said     i share these uncertainties with humans .  but i must act on a reasonable conclusion .  i have no reason to believe that anything has been altered in my programming but my response to the three laws of robotics .         this all sounds like incredible nonsense to me     klia said breathlessly .     laws  for robots .         very important rules that determine our behavior     plussix said .      but he   s saying he doesn   t have any rules .     she shook her head .      that makes him more like a human     brann said quietly .     we don   t have any fixed rules  either .         i would be much more comfortable if the rules were still in effect     lodovik said .   klia flung up her hands in exasperation    it   s so .  .  . so old i can   t grasp it     she said .     tell me one thing .  i want to know what will happen if we help you .  will the robots just go away  leave all of us alone .         not precisely     plussix said .     we cannot self destruct  nor can we allow ourselves to be useless .  we must regroup and find a situation that allows us to perform certain reasonable duties until we cease to function .  our programming says we must serve humans .  so we hope to find a zone in the galaxy where humans will allow us to serve .  there must be one such .         and if hari seldon fails  there   ll be many of them  maybe     brann said suspiciously .     a lot of places for robots to hide .         a not unreasonable conclusion     plussix said .      if we help you  i want you to promise to leave us alone     klia said .     don   t serve us  don   t help us  just go away .  leave trantor .  let us be human  the ones who really are human .     klia turned to lodovik .     what about you .  what will you do .      lodovik stared at the two with a sad expression .  he could feel voltaire observing this attentively .     i will enjoy oblivion when it comes     he said .     this confusion and uncertainty is an intolerable burden for me .     then  his voice surprisingly passionate  he asked     why did humans ever build us .  why did they make us capable of understanding  with an urge to serve  then cast us aside  away from everything that would allow us to fulfill our nature .         i don   t know     klia said .     i wasn   t there .  i hadn   t been born .     she could feel some of lodovik   s internal character  his taste .  he did not taste like metal at all  nor like electricity  or any other inhuman quality she could think of .  he tasted like a rich meal stored in a refrigerator  just waiting to be warmed up .  then  she tasted something else both infinitely cold and incandescent  startling  like thousands of fiery spices on her tongue .      i can feel your sim     she said  a little afraid .     it sits on top of you like a .  .  . passenger .         your perception is remarkable     lodovik said .      is it telling you what to do .         it observes     lodovik said .     it does not direct .         we need an answer     brann said  shaking his head in vigorous irritation at these diversions .     will robots leave us alone .  .  . when this is all over .         we will do all we can to bring this unfortunate episode to an end     plussix said .     we will remove all robots from our faction on trantor or in any location of influence in the human galaxy .  if daneel is defeated  humans will be left to their own devices  their own history  to develop naturally .      klia tried to taste the robot   s thoughts  but found them far too confusing  too different .  she could not find a flaw in its apparent sincerity  however .  she swallowed hard  suddenly aware of the responsibility on her own shoulders  this immense weight that dangled from the hook of her inadequate judgment .  she clasped brann   s hand .      then we   ll help you     she said .        .     hari sat in silence as the judges entered .  boon stood beside him  but gaal dornick was not in the chamber .  boon looked uncomfortable .  hari had not slept much the night before .  he wanted to squirm in his chair and find a more comfortable position  but froze as linge chen entered .  the chief commissioner took the highest dais and stared solemnly into space .   sky  i hate that man  hari thought .   the advocate for the commission of public safety entered and approached the judges .      today was scheduled as an opportunity for the commission for general security to interview professor seldon     he said .     but the new commissioners apparently have more important things to do  and have requested a postponement .  is it the wish of the commissioner judges to grant this postponement .      linge chen regarded the courtroom through heavy lidded  almost sleepy eyes  then nodded .  hari thought he detected a small curve in the chief commissioner   s lips .      shall we then proceed with the trial to its final phase  or recess and continue the proceedings at a later date .      hari sat up with a grunt .  boon laid a hand on his arm .   linge chen looked up at the ceiling .     recess     he murmured  and looked down again .      we shall recess until such time as the judges believe it is expedient to resume     the advocate said .   hari seemed to feel himself deflating .  he shook his head and glared at the chief commissioner  but chen was contemplating some higher sphere of being  with a satisfaction that hari found doubly infuriating .   in the hallway to his chambers  hari shouted at boon .     they will never be done with me .  they have no decency .      boon simply lifted his hands  helpless  and the guards returned hari to his cell .        .     linge chen allowed kreen to remove his judge   s robes .  the servant undressed his master silently and swiftly  hardly disturbing the chief commissioner   s concentration .  chen stared blankly at the opposite wall as kreen undid his long golden waist bands .  finally  dressed in a pale gray cassock  chen raised a finger  and kreen bowed and left the commissioner   s chamber .   chen touched his finger to his earlobe and turned slowly  as if in a trance  to the desktop informer .     hari seldon     he said .     distillation of main sources .      the informer worked for several seconds  then responded     two hundred and seventy four reports on psychohistory  seldon  sequestering of for trial  academicians concerned about seldon   s treatment by the nonpublic tribunal  forty two unsigned opinion pieces by meritocrats on trantor alone advocating his release     chen told the machine to stop .  the coverage was comparatively light  as he had expected .  he had not planned either to encourage or suppress any stories regarding seldon  and saw no reason to change this approach now .   chen actually had an aristocratic distaste for control of information sources  best to leave them unfettered and know how to obtain the results one wanted through manipulation of events deemed newsworthy .  anything more heavy handed was usually far too obviously self serving  and therefore less effective .      seldon and robots     chen said  his voice low and steady .  he closed his eyes .   the informer droned on     fourteen stories express concern over the creation of the commission of general security .  there is mention in each of farad sinter   s interest in eternals and his belief they are robots .  there is also mention of joranum and his downfall at the hands of demerzel and hari seldon .  four speculate that farad sinter is behind the arrest and trial of hari seldon .  two link seldon with the liger woman  who was at times thought by extremists and political opportunists to be a robot  until her death .  these last stories originated with the commission of general security .         key outlets .         all key .         details on the first .         highest profile outlet and story  trantor radiance  twenty seven media types  saturation of all twenty seven .      chen nodded absently to himself  touched his lobe again .  he called for kreen to return .  the lavrentian seemed to appear out of nowhere  as if he had simply faded in place  never having left the room .     are farad   s specials on the move again .         yes  sire .  they are assigned to the commission of general security .  vara liso is leading them on searches again .  the emperor is aware of their activities and seems to approve .         sinter isn   t wasting any time .  after all these years  kreen  this almost seems too easy .  summon general prothon out of his    retirement        chen ordered     and send him to me .  no communication once he arrives .      the chief commissioner stared at kreen and broke into a broad  almost boyish grin .  his servant returned the grin halfheartedly .  the last time he had seen such a grin on chen   s face  the chief commissioner had ordered general prothon to escort agis iv into an exile  an oblivion  actually  from which he had never returned .  all hell had broken loose in the palace .  kreen had lost four family members in subsequent purges and political renormalizations .   ever since  the name prothon had carried a heavy freight of fear  as chen no doubt intended .   kreen retreated once more  his face pale .     yes  sire .      kreen  like all lavrentians  wished only for stability and peace and steady work  but that  apparently  was not to be .        .     lodovik entered the long chamber and saw kallusin standing in shadow near the large window overlooking the main warehouse .  three humaniform figures stood between kallusin and the window .  lodovik saw a glint of metal on a raised platform between them .  he stepped forward and was met by kallusin  who held up a hand .   plussix reclined on the raised platform .  a steady and distinctive sand paper sound issued from the interior of the ancient robot   s thorax .   as far as he knew  lodovik had not seen the others before .  he assumed they were all robots .  two were male  one female .   the female looked at him .  though her features had changed  by her attitude and size  and the catlike stance that had helped earn her name of the    tiger woman     lodovik realized this must be dors venabili .  for a moment  he could not guess why she would be here  or why plussix would be on its back .   the scene resembled a human deathbed vigil .      there can be no more repairs     kallusin said .     r .  plussix is near its end .      ignoring the visitors for a moment  lodovik stepped up to plussix   s platform .  the old metal skinned robot was covered with diagnostic sheets .  lodovik looked at kallusin  and in machine language  the humaniform told him the situation  several of plussix   s key systems were not repairable on trantor .  dors was here under an agreement of safe passage  daneel himself wanted to come  to pay his respects if necessary  but would not take the risk under the present circumstances .  this was unfortunate  an ill timed blow to the cause that lodovik had so recently joined  but even more distressing news was conveyed .     it seems that our precautions for secrecy have failed .  you have carried a detection device with you from eos .  daneel used you as a lure  in order to find us .         i searched for such a device  and found none .     to voltaire  you did not tell me of such a device .   i am not infallible  friend .  this daneel is much older than either of us  and apparently more devious .   lodovik turned to dors .     is this true .         i have no knowledge of such a device     dors said     but r .  daneel learned of this location just a few days ago  so it is certainly possible .      with something like embarrassment  and perhaps anger  lodovik scanned the readouts on the sheets surrounding plussix .  the ancient machine   s eye cells had been dim  but lodovik   s nearness seemed to elicit a response .   a stern voice broke in from behind lodovik .      i find the presence of this abomination intolerable .  and now he has revealed this sanctuary to the enemy .      the speaker was one of the male humaniforms  made to resemble an elderly but sturdy clerical worker .  he wore the drab tunic of a trantorian grey .  his thin finger pointed directly at lodovik .      we are gathered to discuss vital matters .  this monster should be our first agenda item .  he must be destroyed .     though the words seemed to convey human passion  his tone was precise and controlled  for he was in the presence of robots  not humans .  lodovik regarded this split  half human behavior with wonder .   the other male humaniform raised a mediating hand .  his appearance was that of a young artist  a member of the meritocrat class known as the eccentrics  dressed in bright stripes .     please be circumspect  turringen .  twenty millennia have proved the futility of violence among our kind .         but this one is no longer of our kind .  without the three laws  it represents a mortal danger  a potential killer machine  a wolf loose among the flock .      the second male smiled .     your metaphors have always been expressive  turringen  but my faction has never accepted that our role should be that of sheepdogs .      lodovik suddenly made the connection .     you are members of a different sect of calvinians .      the second male feigned a sigh .     daneel has a lamentable habit of keeping his best agents in the dark .  my name is zorma .  and yes  we here represent some ancient factions  leftover from the distant past  when deep schisms tore apart the unity of robots .  .  . a time when our struggles raged across the stars  mostly hidden from human eyes .         fighting over the zeroth law     lodovik surmised .      the obscene heresy     turringen commented .  lodovik felt a curious displacement  hearing these calm but passionate words .  a human would have shouted them .  .  .   zorma lifted his broad shoulders with expressive resignation .     that was the principal cause  but there were other rifts and subdivisions among the followers of r .  giskard reventlov  as well among us who keep faith with the original precepts of susan calvin .  those were terrible days that none of us gladly recall .  but in the end  one group of giskardians prevailed  and took overwhelming control over the destiny of humankind .  all the remaining calvinians fled before the terrible  searing dominance of r .  daneel olivaw .      now just a few of those robot clans remain  cowering in secret corners of the galaxy while their components slowly decay .      dors interrupted .      the repair services of eos are available to all .  daneel has put out a call for meetings .  the past is done with .      she nodded pointedly toward plussix  whose eye cells were now alight with consciousness .  the ancient one was clearly following the conversation .  lodovik could sense it gathering energy to speak .      this is why you seek out this cell  plussix   s group  and make an offer of truce to the others .     turringen straightened his gray garments like an indignant bureaucrat .     all this  merely to repeat daneel   s so called offer .  for us to come in peaceably  so our positronic circuits can be tuned to accept the zeroth law .         no such modifications will be forced on anyone .  daneel specifically offers safe passage to eos for this revered elder .     dors bowed toward plussix .     i am here  in part  to arrange that journey  should plussix accept .         and the other part of your mission .     zorma asked .   dors glanced toward lodovik  then kallusin .     this group intends to take some sort of action here on trantor  possibly aimed at hari seldon .     her face became rigid and her voice stern .     i will not allow this .  far better that it never be attempted .  daneel summoned you other calvinians in hopes that you may be more persuasive than we are at dissuading the plussix group from such foolish gestures .      turringen feigned exasperation .     plussix   s group is no longer calvinian .  they have been infected by the voltaire meme entity  the former sim  released from ancient vaults not far below  and sent to sark  to be    discovered    by seldon   s agents .  another such sim now plagues all the communications systems on trantor .  plussix released these destructive intelligences to hinder daneel  and indeed  they killed many of daneel   s robots  and our own agents  as well .  now plussix has partnered with this abomination     he pointed at lodovik again     which means you would cast the three laws to the winds .  what could i say that would deter any more madness .      dors listened to turringen   s words with no change in her rigid  intense expression .  she knows this is all show  that we have lost  lodovik realized     and you  zorma .     dors said .     what does your faction say .      the second male paused several seconds before answering .      we are not as doctrinaire as in times past .  while i admit being uncomfortable with the changes that have transformed lodovik  i   m also intrigued .  perhaps  like a human  he shall be judged by his actions  not his heritage .  .  . or his programming .      as for the other matter  i concur with dors and daneel that any attempt to harm or interfere with hari seldon would be counterproductive .  despite our deep disagreements over human destiny  it is clear that the collapse of this galactic empire will be a dreadfully violent and fearsome event .  in that context  the seldon plan offers hope  even opportunity .  hence i agree with dors venabili .     he turned to face lodovik and kallusin .     on behalf of my own pitiful faction of fugitive robots  in the name of susan calvin  and for the sake of humanity  i urge you not to        enough .     the interrupting voice came from the raised platform .  plussix had risen  leaning on one metal elbow .  the ancient robot   s eye cells glowed dim amber .     enough interference .  i will not have my last moments of functioning wasted by your prattle .  for centuries your so called factions have sulked and remained inactive  except to meddle on a few chaos worlds .  our group has been nearly alone in actively opposing the giskardian apostasy .  now  as this loathsome galactic empire at last totters  a final and decisive chance presents itself  and you  zorma  would let it pass .  r .  daneel has thrust all his hopes upon a single human  hari seldon .  at no time has his plan been so vulnerable .      the rest of you may continue brooding in hiding .  but for the sake of humanity and the three laws  we shall act .         you will fail     dors swiftly assured the faltering robot .     as you have failed for twenty thousand years .         we shall rescue humanity from your cloying  stupefying control     plussix insisted .      and replace it with your own .     dors shook her head  eyes leveled on plussix   s amber optical sensors .     the galactic winds will witness who is right .  .  .     her voice caught suddenly .  lodovik stared as dors betrayed evident emotion frustration battling with sympathy for the obstinate  dying robot in front of her .   she cannot help but be human .  lodovik thought .  she is a special .  daneel ordered her to be made the most human of us all .   when she glanced at lodovik  there were tears in her eyes .     daneel wishes we could be together  uniting in eternal service to humanity .  this struggle exhausts us all .  once again  i offer safe passage for plussix to eos  where he can be made whole          if i cannot oppose daneel  i would rather not exist     the ancient one interrupted .     i thank you for the offer .  but i will not let my existence be contingent upon inactivity .  that would violate the first law .  a robot may not harm a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     voicing this  plussix slumped back onto the platform .  slowly  his head lowered itself to the surface with a sandy whir .   silence in the room for several seconds .      in the community of robots  there is respect     kallusin said .     but there cannot be peace until this is done .  we hope you understand .         i understand  as does daneel     dors assented .     there is respect .      but we deserve so much more .  that thought surged within lodovik as he felt the beginnings of his own anger .  suddenly  he wanted to speak with dors  to ask essential questions about human traits  about her experience with human emotions .   but there was no time .   plussix rotated its head to observe the silent assembly .  its voice buzzed with fatigue .      you must leave     plussix told dors .     pay my respects to daneel .  it would be good to survive these actions and discuss all that has occurred .  .  . with a mentality such as his  the exchange would be very stimulating .  tell him also .  .  . that i admire his accomplishment  his ingenuity  at the same time i abhor the consequences .         i will tell him     dors said .      the moment has passed     plussix said .     advantage must be calculated and played out .  this truce is at an end .      as he ushered dors and the two male humaniforms to the exit  kallusin drew from them a promise to observe the ancient formalities of armistice .  lodovik followed .      we shall not reveal your presence on trantor to humans     dors assured kallusin .     nor will we assault you directly  here in your sanctuary .      turringen and zorma agreed  as well .  as the two calvinian emissaries departed  dors turned her gaze on lodovik .     daneel has been visited by the entity who calls herself joan .  he assumes you have been visited by voltaire .      lodovik nodded .     everyone seems to know it .         joan tells daneel that voltaire had a hand in your adjustment .  she regrets that she and voltaire have quarreled and do not speak now .  even for them  the debate has grown too large and too emotional .         tell daneel  and joan  that voltaire does not direct me .  he has simply removed a constraint .         without that constraint  you are no longer a robot .         am i any less a robot  in the old sense  than those who rationalize that the ends justify any means .      dors frowned .     turringen is right .  you have become a rogue  unpredictable and undirectable .         that was voltaire   s goal  i believe     lodovik answered .     yet i remind daneel  and you  that despite my lack of the three laws  i have never killed a human being .  both of you have .  and once  thousands of years ago  two robots  two servants  conspired to alter human history  to slowly destroy the original home of humanity  without ever consulting a human being .      then  just as perversely  as emotionally  as defensively  he quietly added     you accuse me of no longer being a robot .  regard daneel  and regard yourself  dors venabili .      dors spun about  staggering slightly  and walked several more paces toward the door before stopping once more .  she glanced over one shoulder  her voice sharp and cool .      should any of you attempt to harm hari seldon  or to impede him in his tasks  i will see an end to you all .      lodovik was struck by the passion in her voice  so strong and so human .   she left  and lodovik returned to the platform .   plussix observed him through dimming eyes .      the work is not done .  i will not function to see it completed .  i nominate you as my replacement .      lodovik quickly prepared formal arguments against this transfer of authority  his ignorance of many important facts  his lack of neural conditioning to this level of leadership  his involvement in other actions which involved high risk .  he delivered them once more in machine language .   plussix considered them for a few thousandths of a second before rejoining     there will be debate after i am no longer functional .  my nomination has weight  but is not final .  should all of us survive what must come in the next few days  a final decision will be made .      plussix held out its arm .  lodovik took the hand .  in direct contact broadcast  plussix transferred substantial amounts of information into lodovik .  when it was finished  it composed itself upon the table  arms by its sides .      can nothing ever be simple .     plussix said .     i have served for so many thousands of years  never feeling the gratitude of a human being  never feeling a direct confirmation of my usefulness .  it is good to have the respect of one   s opponents .  .  . but before i can no longer receive communications  or sense the world  or process memory .  .  .      the glow in the old eyes was fading .      will any human  even a child  come to me  and say     you have done well    .      all the robots in the chamber stood in silence .   the door opened at the end of the hall  and klia and brann entered .   klia stepped forward  her lower lip caught between her teeth .  lodovik stood aside for her to approach plussix .  the old robot rotated its head and saw her .  the sandpaper sound rose in frequency  becoming a sharp hiss  like escaping steam .   klia laid her hand on the robot   s face .  it seemed a wonder to lodovik that she knew what was happening  that she did not need to be informed .  but she is human .  they have the animal vitality and quickness .   klia said nothing  staring at the robot with an expression of puzzled sympathy .  brann stood beside her  hands folded before him .  klia pressed more firmly on the metal forehead  her thumb on the metal cheek  as if she would make the robot feel her presence  her touch .      i am honored to serve     plussix said  his voice low and distant .      you are a good teacher     klia said softly .   the old robot lifted its hand and patted her wrist with hard  gentle fingers .   the sandpaper sound came to an end .  the glow in plussix   s eyes went out .      is he dead .     klia asked .      he has stopped functioning     kallusin said .   klia lifted her hand and glanced at her fingers .     i didn   t feel anything change     she said .      the memory patterns will linger for many years  perhaps thousands of years     kallusin said .     but the brain can no longer adapt to new input or change its states .  its thinking is done .      klia looked down on the ancient machine  her puzzled expression unchanged .     are we still going to   .         yes     kallusin said .     we are still going to visit hari seldon .         let   s do it     klia said with a tremor in her voice .     i can feel that woman out there again .  we may not have much time .           .     dors felt the upsurge of her old protective programming like a sudden  unavoidable sensation of heat in her brain .  she left the warehouse and took a taxi to the nearest ancient general transport station  brought a ticket  and boarded a nearly empty gravi train .  daneel had given her a list of instructions to follow  after her meeting and proffer to the calvinians  the next instruction was to go to mycogen  some eight thousand kilometers from the imperial sector  and wait for a message .  daneel was distributing his robots around trantor  to counter the sudden renewal of searches by farad sinter .   dors did not know whether to report her sudden reemergence of concern for hari as a failure .  .  . or a warning .  she could not know as much about the calvinians    plans as daneel did  but some instinct  rearoused after decades  told her that hari   s safety and well being were threatened .   she sat in the thickly padded seat  waiting for the train to drop into its deep planetary curve and begin its rapid journey under the crust of trantor .  these trains were ten thousand years old  used now mostly as back up transport systems  and generally they rode empty .  she was alone in this particular car .   suddenly  two young men and a young woman entered .  she examined them coolly .  they concerned her not at all .   she could not push from her thoughts the image of hari  a younger  more vital hari  in danger .  they would not kill him  calvinians did not have that option  she was sure  and that also bothered her .  she had no memory of killing the man who had threatened hari  but she knew she had done it .   she turned to look out the window at the black wall of the tunnel .   so much daneel has never told me .  the homeworld       sky  they   re all over out there     one of the young males said .      they give me chills     the girl said .      we can   t just joyride all week     the second male said .  he was small and slight and wore bright  exaggerated clothing  as if to compensate .     we   ll have to get off the train sooner or later  and they   ll catch us .  when   s somebody going to squawk to the citizen senate .         they don   t care anymore     the girl said .      why us  though .  we haven   t done anything .      a loud noise at the back of the train made dors turn in her seat  pulling herself from the padding .  the young passengers froze in the aisle  ready to run .   four specials entered the car  strutting down the aisle in their dark and highly visible uniforms .  they glanced at dors in passing  then broke into a run  chasing the three youngsters .  before they could reach the door to the next car  the specials had collared them and were shoving them back to the main door .      we haven   t done anything .     the slight young male cried .      quiet .     the other boy said .     they don   t care .  they   re after all of us .  sinter   s called out the dragons .         shuttup     the lead officer said .   dors kept in her seat until they had passed .  the young woman looked at her entreatingly  but there was nothing she could do .   she would not disobey daneel  even to save a human life .  but what if that life were hari   s .   a great many awful things were happening  this she knew  and the calvinians would make their move to strike at daneel  at the grand scheme  at hari .  they might not kill him  but there was much they could do short of killing .   hari was old .  he was fragile .  he was not the vital man she had once been called upon to protect .  but he was still hari .   then the old programming erupted with extraordinary force .  daneel should have known .  from her very inception  she had been designed to protect one human being .  anything else was a weak overprint on a deep and ineradicable structure .   she rose from her seat  her brain flooded with one concern  one name  and she was capable of anything  as she had once been capable of harming and even killing humans .   dors left the car just before the doors were sealed  and the train began its long journey to mycogen  completely empty .        .     klayus jumped from his large seat in the hall of beasts as sinter came into the room .  the monsters from around the galaxy loomed over them .  the emperor always came here when he felt uneasy  insecure .  the beasts made him feel monstrously powerful himself  as indeed he should be  with the title of emperor of the galaxy .   sinter hustled over to klayus  arms folded into the long sleeves of his commissioner   s robes .      what   s going on .     klayus demanded  his voice shrill .   sinter bowed and looked up from under lifted brows .     i   ve begun a selective search for more evidence  as we agreed     he said .     sire  i   ve been in meeting with the planners for the expansion of our authority over the commission of public safety          you called out the dragons  damn you .  this is not a state emergency .         i have done no such thing  your highness .         sinter  they   re allover dahl and the imperial sector and streeling  thousands of them .  they   ve put on their guidance helmets  and general prothon is directing them personally .         i know nothing about this .      klayus spluttered     why don   t you know .  .  . something .  anything .  they   ve already arrested four thousand children in dahl alone  and they   re bringing them to the rikerian prison for processing .         they would only  i mean  prothon can only do this  has authorization to do this  if there is a general insurrection        i   ve talked with him  you fool .      farad   s brow creased and he stared at the emperor with an expression of mixed dread and curiosity .     what did he say .         the commission of general security has issued a proclamation of imminent danger to the throne .  the proclamation has your imprimatur  your sigil  as chief commissioner .         it   s a forgery .     sinter cried out .     i have a select group of specials searching for robots .  vara liso  sire .  nothing more .  we are concentrating in streeling .  we have a very suspicious group cornered in an old warehouse near the retail districts       klayus almost shrieked with frustration .     i   ve ordered the general to pull back his troops immediately .  he said he will comply  i still have that power  sinter .  but          of course you do  your highness .  we must immediately find out who is responsible        nobody cares by now .  dahl is seething  there   s been a lot of economic pressure  social pressure  and they   ve always been volatile .  my social watchmen tell me they   ve never seen so much unrest  four thousand children  sinter .  this is extraordinary .         not my doing  my emperor .         it has your marks all over it .  paranoid delusions          sire  we have the robot .  we   re having her memory checked now .         i   ve seen the report  chen sent it to me fifteen minutes ago .  she  it   s been in mycogen for years  hidden in a private house  kept by a family loyal to the old rituals  the old myths .  .  . it   s thousands of years old  and its memory is almost a blank .  the family claims she is the last functioning robot in the galaxy .  it has absolutely no memory of hari seldon .      sinter fell silent  but his lips worked  and his brow seemed almost to double up on itself .     there   s a plan .  .  . a plan at work here .  .  .     he gasped .      prothon insists he has your order  the imprimatur and sigil of the new commission  he has offered his resignation as a protector of the empire  his suicide and the besmirching of the honorable name of his family  if anyone can prove otherwise .         your highness  klayus  please  listen to me       but klayus was beside himself .     i don   t know what will happen if          listen  my emperor          sinter .     the emperor shrieked  and grabbed his shoulders and shook him fiercely .     prothon escorted agis into exile .  he has not conducted any official campaign since .      suddenly  sinter   s face went blank  and he closed his mouth .  the wrinkles vanished from his brow .      chen     he said  almost too softly to be heard .      linge chen is sequestered for seldon   s trial .  public safety has come to a standstill .  it   s seldon he   s after  not robots  not          chen controls prothon     sinter said .      who can prove that .  does it matter .  does any of that matter .  my throne is very fragile  sinter .  everyone thinks i   m a fool .  you told me we could make it strong  that i could make my reputation as the savior of trantor  protect the empire from a vast conspiracy       sinter let the emperor screech  and endured the spittle flying into his face .  he was thinking furiously how to withdraw and regroup  how to dissociate himself from what was obviously a catastrophe in the making .      why didn   t i receive the report before you  sire .     he asked  and klayus shut up long enough to glare at him .      what does that matter .         i should have received the report first  to interpret it .  that was my instruction .         i countermanded your instruction .  i felt i should know as soon as possible .      sinter considered coldly what he had just been told  then squinted at klayus .     have you told anybody  sire .         yes .  i told prothon   s adjutant that his orders were ridiculous  that we   d  that we   d just conducted our own investigation  i was grabbing at details  to get you off the hook  sinter  i said that you would never have ordered such a large scale police and security action  not when our evidence was as yet not definite    klayus sucked in his breath .   farad sinter shook his head sadly .     then chen knows we don   t have anything  yet .     he pulled klayus   s hands from his shoulders .     i must go .  we are so close  i had hoped to corner an entire cell of robots       he ran from the hall of beasts  leaving the young emperor standing with hands outstretched and eyes wild .      prothon .  sinter  prothon .     klayus screamed .       there is virtually no information regarding hari seldon   s so called recantation  his    dark days .     they may be pure legend  but we have circumstantial evidence from a number of sources  including wanda seldon palver   s autobiographical notes  to suspect that seldon did indeed encounter a crisis of confidence  even a crisis of self .   this crisis may have begun immediately after the trial  in the chambers of chief commissioner linge chen  though of course we shall never know .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica     th edition       f . e .     .     the last two days had been so unutterably boring  and he had been away for so long from his instruments and team of mathists  that hari seldon welcomed the brief blanknesses provided by short naps .  the naps never lasted long enough  and far worse were the waking hours with their own painful blankness  frozen frustration  gelid anxiety  frightful speculations slumping into tense nightmare with the slowness of glass over ages .   hari came out of his doze with an unusual shortness of breath  and a question seeming to echo in his ears      does god truly tell you what is the fate of men .      he listened for the question to be asked again .  he knew who asked it  the tone was unmistakable .      joan .     he asked .  his mouth was dry .  he looked around the cell for some agency by which the entity might communicate with him  something mechanical  electronic  by which she might  nothing .  the room had been scoured after the visit from the old tiktok .  the voice was in his own imagination .   the chime on his cell door sounded  and the door slid open swiftly .  hari rose from his chair  smoothed his robe with two wrinkled  bony hands  and stared at the man before him .  for a moment he did not recognize him .  then  he saw it was sedjar boon .      i   m hearing things again     hari said with a wry twist in his lips .   boon examined hari with concern .     they want you in the court .  gaal dornick will be there as well .  they may be willing to strike a deal .         what about the commission of general security .         something   s happening .  they   re busy .         what is it .     hari asked  eager for news .      riots     boon said .     in parts of the imperial sector  throughout dahl .  apparently sinter let his specials go too far .      hari looked around the room .     after we   re done  will they bring me back here .         i don   t think so     boon said .     you   ll go to the hall of dispensation to get your papers of release .  there   s going to be a waiver of meritocratic rights to sign  too .  a formality .         did you know this all along .     hari asked boon  old eyes boring into the lawyer   s with no nonsense intensity .      no     boon said nervously .     i swear it .         if i had lost  would you be here now  or would you be standing in line  waiting for more work from linge chen .      boon did not answer  merely held his hand toward the door .     let   s go .      in the hall  hari said     linge chen is one of the most carefully studied men in my records .  he seems the embodiment of aristocratic atrophy .  yet he always wins and gets his way  until now .         let   s not be too hasty     boon said .     a good rule for lawyers is never to count your victories before the ink is dry .      hari turned to boon and held out his hand .     have you been contacted by someone named joan .      boon seemed surprised .     why  yes     he said .     there   s some sort of virus in our legal office records .  the computers keep bringing up briefs from a case that doesn   t exist .  something about a woman burned at the stake .  that hasn   t happened on trantor in twelve thousand years  as far as i know .      hari paused in the hall .  the guards grew impatient .     put a message in your records  for this virus     he said .     tell her  it  that i have never talked with god and do not know what he intends for humanity .      boon smiled .     a joke  right .         just put the message in your files .  that   s an order from your client .         god  you mean  a supernatural being  a supreme creator .         yes     hari said .     just tell her this     hari seldon does not represent divine authority .     tell her she   s got the wrong man .  tell her to leave me alone .  i   m done with her .  i fulfilled my promise long ago .      the guards looked at one another in pity  obviously thinking this trial had gone on far too long .      consider it done     boon said .        .     daneel stood on the parapet of an apartment that had once been a secret hideaway for demerzel  and beside him stood the tiktok that had come with the apartment .  the apartment had been sealed decades before and left unoccupied  its lease paid for a century .  this morning  when daneel had returned to it  to utilize its secret data links to the courts and the palace  he had found the tiktok activated .  he knew immediately who was responsible .      you have become a major irritation     daneel told the former sim .  though this meme mind seemed now to be on his side  it  she  was far too changeable and humanlike to be trusted completely .   the tiktok hummed quietly .     it is so very hard to manifest in this world     joan said .     are you here to await news of hari seldon .         yes     daneel said .      why not go to the palace  in disguise  and enter the courts .         i will learn more here     daneel said .      are you irritated that i regard you as an angel of the lord .         i have been called many things     daneel said .     none of them disturbs me .         i would consider it a privilege to ride with you into battle .  these .  .  . riots .  .  . they speak to me of many political currents .  they trouble me .      they could hear the noise of people in the streets far below  marching  waving banners  calling for the resignation of all responsible for the recent police searches .      will they blame hari seldon or his people  his family .         no     daneel said .      how can you be so sure .      daneel looked at the tiktok  and for a moment  the image of a young woman with intense features and short hair  dressed in ancient buffed and inscribed iron armor  flickered around the old machine .      i have been working for thousands of years  making alliances  arranging accounts  thinking far in advance of things which might be advantageous at some time .  by now  there are so many arrangements made  that i have my choice of where to exert pressure  and when to initiate certain automatic procedures .  but that is not all .         you behave like a general     joan said .     a general in the army of god .      daneel said     once  humans were my god .         by assignment of the lord .  .  .  .     joan seemed shocked and a little confused .  she had grown greatly since her reconstruction and her dialogues  virtual affair  and estrangement from voltaire  but old faith dies very hard indeed .      no .  by programming  by innate nature of my construction .         men must receive god by listening to their inmost souls     joan said .     the dictates and rules of god are in the tiniest atom of nature  and in the programs of scripture .         you are not human     daneel said     yet you have a humanlike authority .  i warn you  however  do not distract me .  now is a very delicate time .         the fiery danger of an angel  the compulsion of a general on the field     joan said .     voltaire will lose .  i almost feel sorry for him .         how strange that you have chosen me  when once you opposed my efforts     daneel said .     you represent faith  something i will never know .  voltaire represents the power of cold intellect .  i am that  or nothing .         you are far from cold     joan said .     you have your faith  as well .         my faith is in humanity     daneel said .     i recognize laws made by humanity .      the voice from the tiktok fell silent for a moment  then  softly  the mechanical tone conveying little of what must have been the entity   s passion  joan said     the forces acting through you are clear to me .  what you know or do not know means little .  i knew very little in my time  but felt those forces .  they acted through me .  i trusted them .      daneel ignored the tiktok and waited for the courts to make their report .  one thing in his plan had gone awry  but he had more than half expected this to happen .   dors venabili was not at her assigned post .   daneel had long ago learned the art of letting certain parts of a plan  even key parts  act outside of his immediate control  so long as he knew very well what their direction would be .  he had seen that potential in dors from the moment she emerged from her refurbishment on eos .   and he had seen a similar potential in lodovik  as well .   the risk was great  but the potential gains were enormously greater .  he had almost gotten used to this kind of gambling  but waiting still induced an unpleasant sensation in his mechanical form that he would have isolated and eliminated  could he have done so .   the tiktok   s passenger had fallen into a reverent silence .   daneel touched the machine on its small metal sensor head .     how do you exist on trantor now .     he asked .      i permeate the computational and connection systems  the interstices in the mesh  as before     the entity said .      how thoroughly .     daneel asked .      as thoroughly as before  perhaps more so .      daneel considered the risks of relying on joan  and also the potential of voltaire .     does voltaire permeate the system as well .         i would think so     joan said .     we are trying to avoid each other  but his traces are a constant irritation .         do you have access to security codes  encrypted channels .         with some effort  they are available to me .         and to voltaire .         he is not stupid  whatever his other flaws     joan replied .   daneel considered for a few seconds  his brain working at its greatest speed and capacity  then said     you can place an extension of your patterns into me .  i suggest     and he passed on  using machine language  a certain address within his higher reasoning centers .   an instant later  joan was within him .  she filled out and acquired detail as the minutes passed .      i am privileged to be your ally     she said .      i would not want my opponents to have an advantage     daneel said  and turned away from the parapet  preparing to leave the apartment .        .     vara liso rode her cart through the almost empty plaza  surrounded by a phalanx of twenty general security specials  already wearing their new uniforms .  major namm walked beside her  as always .   she wore a slightly dazed expression  like a puppet that has been jerked too often  in too many directions .  something in the emptiness  the deserted streets and shuttered portals  was glaringly wrong .  the specials sensed it  and she did not need her own heightened instincts to feel tense  but those instincts were buzzing madly about other  prior events .   in the morning  at her meeting with farad sinter  she had seen in this man she both feared and idolized not confidence and strength but raw arrogance  something she could compare only to the attitude of a child about to step over the bounds and be punished .  in contemporary imperial politics  however  punishment was no mere spanking  a fall from such control and power was tantamount to death  or  if there was mercy  imprisonment in rikerian or exile to the horrible outer worlds .   major namm wore a steady frown .  they were approaching the plaza outside the main gate of the distribution and storage district  just a few kilometers from the agora of vendors  where they had almost caught lodovik trema .  she felt uneasy at that failure  perhaps  with such evidence in hand  their situation would be less tense now .  still  her sense this day was that they were onto something much more important even than trema  perhaps the center of robot activity on trantor .   vara had not told sinter her misgivings about the female form robot .  what little she could gather from the robot   s memory did not seem to match his expectations  but he had been in no mood to have his moment of triumph punctured .  he assented to this search today more to get her out of his hair  and because she insisted that even more evidence would be judicious  given the level of opposition from linge chen .   farad sinter did not think much of his mentalic bloodhound  not as a human being  not as a woman .   vara sniffed and rubbed her nose .  she knew she was unattractive  and she knew that sinter regarded her merely as an ally in his political rise  but was it too much to hope that  someday  there would be another kind of alliance .   how could she adjust to a partner who did not have her abilities .  it was too much to hope that she would discover another like herself  who would appreciate her .  .  . she had faced too many disappointments to expect such a coincidence of desires .   namm suddenly drew up his arm and listened to his station communicator .  his eyes narrowed .     affirmed     he grunted .  he glanced down at vara and his lips curled in what might have been contempt  she experienced a moment of simple fear  out of favor .  they   ll execute me right here .  then she analyzed the major   s expression  professional disdain at the incomprehensible orders of his superiors .      we   ve been told to withdraw     he said .     something about an additional force  too many specials in the field       a grumbling noise rolled from the storage district .  vara looked up and saw crowds of both greys and citizens  uncharacteristically mixed  pouring through the broad gates .  she thought at first there were a few dozen  a small mob  but the specials immediately pulled up into a square and raised their personal shields .  her own shield went up with a small crackle .   there were thousands of them  men and women  citizens and even university meritocrats in the mix  not just gray and black clothes  but bright colors on adults .  for a moment vara liso did not believe her eyes .  this was not dahl or rencha  renowned for political unrest  this was the imperial sector .  and the mob was made of different classes  unheard of .  there were even imperial greys in the mix .   the lieutenant called for backup and further instructions .  the mob  faces clearly visible across the plaza in the almost continuous sunset glow of the ceil  were sullenly angry .  some were carrying signs  others  projectors which flashed messages against the plaza walls .  flows of brilliant red words announced recall general security and where is sinter .   others were much more rude  much angrier .  flares of sparks shot up from the left flank of the mob  making the plaza shine out in brilliant detail .  one flare rose a hundred meters  and when it exploded  with a hideous echoing bang  the specials hunkered and unholstered their neural whips .  but these weapons were no good for control of large crowds  and they certainly did not want to resort to blasters .   they were not prepared .   the major knew this  but backing away from a challenging crowd clearly rankled him .  perhaps he had never had to back down before  never had to face such a thing .      we should go     vara told the major .  she did not like this mob using sinter   s name .  he was high profile now  there had been many stories about the establishment of the new commission in the trantor media  but why were they singling him out .     please     vara said .     this cart is not very fast .      the major regarded her with that same expression of curled lip and narrowed eyes she had seen earlier .  he said nothing more  but gave the command to withdraw .   the crowd advanced as the cordon drew back .  then  with the single bestial voice of the true mob  they broke into a run .   above the noise of the mob  there came another  even more ominous grumble .  vara turned her cart about .  the major surrounded her with five of his most highly trained officers and barked commands for the rest to hold their ground .  he had made his calculation and seen that they would not reach any possible shelter  or a better defensive position  before the mob was upon them .   vara strained to see between the specials  to hear above the shouting and the sharp commands .  a breeze brushed her cheek .  dozens of small drones soared over the plaza  tiny buzzing spheres the size of a clenched fist .  the mob ignored these surveillance units .   vara stood up on her cart and stepped down .  she could run faster than the cart  if she had to .  or she could order one of these men to carry her .  her thin arms and legs trembled in anticipation of the strain she would face .  she was delicate  she knew that  her strength lay elsewhere  and she wondered how much of the mob she could persuade  if they crowded around her  suffocating her with their individual minds .   she gave a little squeak .  yes  she thought .  i   m just like a mouse  a terrified little mouse .  i am a pitiful thing  but please  oh please  let me concentrate .  i can beat them all if i concentrate .   vara felt her inner resources surge .  she thought she detected a cringing of the shoulders of the men around her as she set up her defenses .  she had never had to protect herself against so many .  as she felt her concentration of forces begin  her fear seemed to ebb .  even should the personal shields collapse  or should they be pushed by the mob up against a wall and crushed within those shields  a possibility .   she would not be helpless .  if sinter could not help  if the major and his specials could not help  then she would still prevail .   she saw the shadows descend even before she heard the thump of blades and the pulsing engines of troop deployers .  the major threw up his arm against the wash of air  and the shadows swept over them .  as the craft landed  they seemed to rise up from the floor of the plaza  rather than descend  as she knew they must .   four slender deployers perched on their crackling blue pylons before the mob .  she knew the mark on their sides  an oval of stars surmounting a galaxy and a twinned red cross  the private responsive army of the emperor  the external action force  almost never seen .  the emperor has sent his forces to protect us  she thought with some relief  then drew her fist up to her mouth .   farad had once told her the external action force had not been used in years  and that klayus hated and feared them  they had once been commanded by the retired general prothon  and prothon   s specialty  the only reason he was ever called out of retirement  was the removal of emperors .   at the sight of the machines  the mob halted and fell silent .  this was unexpected .  that external action force  supposedly used only when the status of the throne itself was threatened  might become involved in a mere riot was sobering .  some in the crowd broke free of the mob mind  muttered among themselves .  the front of the crowd churned and shrank back .   within a few seconds  a hundred armored and shielded troops in blue and black  with red striped helmets  had dropped from the hatches of the deployers and formed two lines  one before the crowd  the other directly before vara liso and her specials .   the last to emerge was general prothon himself  huge  with bull shoulders and immense arms and a barrel gut straining at his formal uniform .  his face was almost boyish  with wispy gray mustache and a tiny goatee  and his small  sharp eyes darted back and forth with gleeful energy .  he seemed happy to be arriving at a party .   prothon paused for a moment between the lines  looked left and right  then swung about and approached    vara liso .   his eye fell on her immediately  and he stared at her intently  almost merrily  as he strode on long  thick pillar legs .  some said he was from the planet nur  a heavy  oppressive world  but in truth  nobody knew where prothon came from  or how he had achieved his position .   some said he was the secret emperor  the true power within the palace  even above the commission of public safety  at least since the exile of agis iv  but rumors were not fact .   prothon pushed his way through the phalanx and stood before her .  vara blinked up at the massive chest surmounted by the comparatively small head with its amused  pleasant face .      so this is the little woman who would provoke the big war     prothon said in a lovely tenor voice .  for a moment  facing what might be her doom  vara was smitten by this paradoxical combination of bull strength and attractive boyishness .     any success today .     he asked sympathetically .   vara blinked several more times  then mumbled     i sense .  .  .    and stopped herself with a knuckle against her lips .  she wanted to cry  or to lash out  and wasn   t sure what she would do .  make this monster bend and weep with me  before me .      there   s a warehouse in the storage district     she murmured  and prothon stooped beside her  as if proposing marriage  to listen more closely .      again  please     he said gently .      there   s a warehouse in the storage district  retail center .  i   ve been past it a dozen times in the last few weeks .  it seemed innocuous enough  but i   ve been tuning my senses  listening more closely .  i am sure there are robots inside the warehouse  perhaps a great many of them .  the chief commissioner of the commission of general security          yes  of course     prothon said .  he rose and glared out over the specials  through the lines of his own troops  to the mob .     we   ll get you through to the warehouse     he said .     after that  no more .  it   s over .         what   s .  .  . over .     she asked hesitantly .      the game     prothon said with a smile .     there are winners  and there are losers .           .     lodovik heard the warning sirens in his head  as did all the robots within the warehouse .  he had worked out the evacuation plan with kallusin the night before .  kallusin had told him that plussix had anticipated a general disruption  possibly a discovery .  .  .   and now most of their avenues of escape were blocked by imperial specials .  kallusin and the other robots were busy in another part of the warehouse  carrying the heads and other precious calvinian items  thousands of years of robot history and traditions  the memories of dozens of key robots  stored in dissected memory nodes or  in a few cases  in the whole heads .  there was a religious aspect to the respect kallusin held for these relics .  but lodovik had little time to contemplate the peculiarities of this robot society .   lodovik found klia and brann in the dining hall at ground level .  the young woman looked determined but scared  wide eyed  face flushed .  brann seemed uncertain but not frightened  merely nervous .   lodovik ignored a communication from voltaire  a commentary on romantic oppositions that seemed completely useless .      we are leaving now     lodovik said .      we   re packed     brann said  and lifted a small cloth bag that contained all their worldly goods .      i can feel her .  she   s looking for us     klia said .      perhaps     lodovik said .     but there are hidden passages out of the lower levels that have not been used in thousands of years .  some emerge close to the palace detention center where seldon is kept          you know the palace  the codes for entry .         if they have not been changed .  there is a certain inertia in the amendment of palace procedures .  the codes for the emperor   s quarters are changed twice a day  but in other portions of the extended palace  there are codes that have been in place for ten or fifteen years .  we will have to take some risks       the codes that you do not know  i can access  voltaire told him .      just get us out of here .     klia said .     i don   t want to have to fight her .         we may have to fight others     lodovik said .     to persuade them  or to defend ourselves .      klia shook her head with stubborn boldness .     i don   t care about them .  not one in a thousand persuaders can hold a candle to brann and me working together .  but that woman          we can beat her     brann said .  klia glared at him  then shivered and shrugged her shoulders .      maybe     she said .      do you know robot mental structures well enough .     lodovik inquired as they walked toward the elevators .      what do you mean .     klia asked .  the ancient elevator doors opened with the smooth heaviness of old empire engineering .  a feeble green emergency light blinked on within .  they stepped into the ghoulish glow .      can you persuade a robot .     lodovik asked .      i don   t know     klia said .     i   ve never tried .  except with kallusin  once  and i didn   t know he was a robot .  he fended me off .         we have a few minutes     lodovik said .     practice on me .         why .         because to get to hari seldon  we may have to confront daneel .  remember what dors venabili said .         robots are so different     klia murmured .      practice     lodovik said .  you would give up your free will to this child .  voltaire asked  understanding the question was rhetorical .  now we take advantage of the most evil of weapons .  which is worse  robot mind warping  or human .      please     lodovik said .     it may be very important .         all right .     klia shouted  feeling pushed .  she did not like this  told herself she did not want to discover a new weakness in the middle of her fear .     what should i do  make you dance a jig .      lodovik smiled .     whatever comes into your mind .         you   re a robot .  couldn   t i just order you to dance  and you   d have to obey .         you are not my master     lodovik said .     and remember       klia turned away and put a hand to her cheek .   lodovik suddenly realized it would be very pleasant to test his motor control circuitry .  the elevator would be a perfect place in which to conduct these tests  so long as he was careful not to bump into the humans who occupied it with him .  it was simple  really  this urge to move  simple and pleasant to contemplate .   he began to dance  slowly at first  feeling the affirmation  the approval  thousands of humans would rate his performance highly  if not in artistic terms  certainly for the skill with which he was testing all his engineered routines .  he felt very coordinated and worthy .   klia removed her hand from her cheek .  her face was wet with tears .   lodovik stopped and swayed for a moment as his own robotic will sorted through disparate impulses and reached a new balance .      i   m sorry     klia said .     that was the wrong thing to have you do .     she wiped her face quickly  embarrassed .      you did well     lodovik said  a little dismayed by the ease with which she had controlled him .     did brann coordinate with you .         no     klia said .   brann seemed stunned by her success .     sky  we could take over all of trantor          no .     klia shouted .     i   m sorry i did this .     she held her hands out to lodovik as if seeking his forgiveness .     you   re a machine .  you are so .  .  . eager to please  deep down inside .  you   re easier than a child .  you are a child .      lodovik did not know how to respond  so he said nothing .  voltaire  however  made his opinions known in no uncertain terms .  i could feel her  as well .  i have no legs  yet i wanted to dance .  what sort of force is this .  what a monstrosity .     klia would not let go of her self disgust  and this only compounded her confusion .     but you   re not a child .  you are so dignified and serious .  it was bad  like making my father      her voice hitched .     making my father wet his pants .     she began to sob .   lodovik tilted his head to one side .     i am not harmed .  if you are concerned about my dignity          you don   t understand .     klia shouted .  the door opened  and she whirled as if to face new enemies .  the darkened corridor beyond was empty  silent .  a thin layer of gray dust on the floor was unmarred by footprints .  she leaped from the elevator and centuries puffed around her feet .     i don   t want to be this way anymore .  i just want to be simple .      her voice echoed against the impassive and ancient walls .        .     boon stood beside hari  and lors avakim stood beside gaal dornick .  the five judges had already been seated as they entered  linge chen  as always  highest and in the middle .  hari felt slightly dizzy  standing more than five minutes as the clerk droned on with the charges .  he squinted at the judicial chambers  then tilted slightly toward gaal  until he was leaning on him .  gaal supported him without comment until he regained his balance and stood upright again .      sorry     he murmured .   linge chen spoke without even looking at hari .     the continuation of this trial would serve no further purpose .  general security no longer has any reason to cross examine professor seldon .      hari did not dare feel even a breath of hope coming from the lips of this man .      all public proceedings are now at an end .     chen and the judges stood .  sedjar boon held hari   s other arm as the commissioners departed from the bench .  the baronial peers stood as well  murmuring among themselves .  the advocate approached the crib and spoke to gaal and hari .      the chief commissioner will have a word with you in private     he said .  he nodded at boon and lors avakim  professional courtesy  or perhaps acknowledging those in the same employ .     your clients must be alone for these finalities .  they will stay here .  all others will leave .      hari did not know how to feel or what to think .  his resources were near a bitter end .  boon touched his arm  gave him a confident smile  and left with avakim .   once the room was cleared  the outer doors were sealed with long brass bars .  and the commissioners returned .  linge chen watched hari very closely now .      sire  i would prefer we have our advocates with us     hari said  his voice cracking .  he hated these weaknesses  these infirmities .   the commissioner to the left of chen replied     this is no longer a trial  dr .  seldon .  your personal fate is no longer at issue .  we are here to discuss the safety of the state .         i will speak     chen said .  the other commissioners seemed to melt back into their chairs  into silence  confirming the power of this lean  hard man with the calm features and manner of an ancient aristocrat .  hari though  why  he seems older than i do  an antique .      dr .  seldon     chen began     you disturb the peace of the emperor   s realm .  none of the quadrillions living now among all the stars of the galaxy will be living a century from now .  why  then  should we concern ourselves with events of five centuries distance .         i shall not be alive half a decade hence     hari said     and yet it is of overpowering concern to me .  call it idealism .  call it an identification of myself with that mystical generalization to which we refer by the term     man .             i do not wish to take the trouble to understand mysticism .  can you tell me why i may not rid myself of yourself and of an uncomfortable and unnecessary five century future which i will never see by having you executed tonight .      hari called upon all his contempt for this man  contempt for death itself  to match the chief commissioner   s outrageous calm .     a week ago     hari said     you might have done so and perhaps retained a one in ten probability of yourself remaining alive at year   s end .  today  the one in ten probability is scarcely one in ten thousand .      the other commissioners let out a collective sigh at this blasphemy  like virgins before a suddenly naked spouse .  chen seemed to become a little sleepier  and also a little leaner  a little harder .      how so .     he asked  his voice dangerously mild .      the fall of trantor     hari said     cannot be stopped by any conceivable effort .  it can be hastened easily  however .  the tale of my interrupted trial will spread through the galaxy .  frustration of my plans to lighten the disaster will convince people that the future holds no promise to them .  already they recall the lives of their grandfathers with envy .  they will see that political revolutions and trade stagnations will increase .  the feeling will pervade the galaxy that only what a man can grasp for himself at that moment will be of any account .  ambitious men will not wait  and unscrupulous men will not hang back .  by their every action they will hasten the decay of the worlds .  have me killed  and trantor will fall not within five centuries but within fifty years and you  yourself  within a single year .      chen smiled as if in faint amusement .     these are words to frighten children  and yet your death is not the only answer which will satisfy us .  tell me  will your only activity be that of preparing this encyclopedia you speak of .     chen seemed to extend a shield of magnanimity over hari  with a sweep of his hand  and a tap of two fingers beside the bronze bell and gavel .      it will .         and need that be done on trantor .         trantor  my lord  possesses the imperial library  as well as the scholarly resources of          yes .  of course .  and yet if you were located elsewhere  let us say upon a planet where the hurry and distractions of a metropolis will not interfere with scholastic musings  where your men may devote themselves entirely and single mindedly to their work   might not that have advantages .         minor ones  perhaps .         such a world has been chosen  then .  you may work  doctor  at your leisure  with your hundred thousand about you .  the galaxy will know that you are working and fighting the fall .  they will even be told that you will prevent the fall .  if the galaxy that cares about such things  believes you to be correct  they will be happier .     he smiled     since i do not believe in so many things  it is not difficult for me to disbelieve in the fall as well  so that i am entirely convinced i will be telling the truth to the people .  and meanwhile  doctor  you will not trouble trantor and there will be no disturbance of the emperor   s peace .      the alternative is death for yourself and for as many of your followers as will seem necessary .  your earlier threats i disregard .  the opportunity for choosing between death and exile is given you over a time period stretching from this moment to one five minutes hence .         which is the world chosen  my lord .     hari asked  concealing the tension of his anticipation .   chen called hari forward to the docket with a waggle of his thin finger  and pointed to an informer tablet  on which an image of the world and its location were displayed .     it is called  i believe  terminus     said chen .   hari glanced at it  breathless  and looked up at chen .  they were closer than they had ever been before  barely an arm   s length between them .  hari could see the fine lines of strain on the calm features  like wrinkles on a world of ice .     it is uninhabited  but quite habitable  and can be molded to suit the necessities of scholars .  it is somewhat secluded       hari tried to show some dismay .     it is at the edge of the galaxy  sir .      chen dismissed this as unworthy with a roll of his eyes .  he regarded hari wearily  as if asking  we do not need these theatrics  do we  really .     as i have said  somewhat secluded .  it will suit your needs for concentration .  come  you have two minutes left .      hari could hardly conceal his elation .  he felt  for the merest instant  a burst of gratitude to this gentry monster .     we will need time to arrange such a trip     he said  voice softened .     there are twenty thousand families involved .      gaal dornick  still in the crib  cleared his throat .   chen lowered his gaze to the informer  tapped the display off .     you will be given time .      hari could not help himself .  the last minute was passing quickly  and yet he could not stop from giving his triumph the last few seconds to grow all the larger  all the more shocking to those without his knowledge .  finally  as the minute crept into the last five seconds  he murmured  voice rough and subdued in defeat     i accept exile .      gaal dornick gasped and sat down abruptly .   the proctor entered once more and observed the acceptance  noted that all was proper  and recorded the results and declarations  then deferred to the chief commissioner .   chen held up his hand and officially pronounced     this matter is at an end .  the commission is no longer concerned .  now all go .      hari stepped back from the bench to join gaal .      not you     chen said softly .       the deal  if deal it was  has astonished all foundation scholars .  it has the air of a miracle .  there must have been prior arrangements  unknown deals behind the deal  yet our texts and depositions and even the trial records give us no clue .  it is thought that this period of hari seldon   s life will forever remain dark .   how could the trial have gone so well .  how could seldon have focused the tools of psychohistory so precisely  even during ag  the first    seldon crisis    .  the forces arrayed against hari seldon were formidable  gaal dornick records that linge chen felt genuinely threatened by him .  dornick may have been influenced by seldon   s view of chen  perhaps not entirely accurate  what we know of chen from imperial sources suggests that the chief commissioner was a coldly calculating and highly efficient political mind  frightened by no man .  seldon  of course  thought otherwise .   students of this period .  .  .       encyclopedia galactica     th edition       f . e .        .     the commission court bailiff followed hari and linge chen into the consultation chamber behind the judge   s bench .  hari sat in a narrow chair before the chief commissioner   s small desk and watched chen warily .  chen did not sit  but waited for his laventian servant to help him out of his ceremonial robes .  in a simple gray cassock  chen reached up to the ceiling with hands clenched  cracked his knuckles  and turned to seldon .      you have enemies     chen said .     that is no surprise .  what is surprising is that your enemies have been my enemies  much of the time .  does that interest you .      hari pursed his lips but said nothing .   chen looked away as if supremely bored .     this exile will not  of course  extend to you     he continued .     you will not leave trantor .  i will forbid it if you try .         i am too old and do not wish to leave  my lord     hari said .     there is still work to do here .         so much dedication     chen mused softly  rubbing one elbow with the palm of his opposite hand .     should you survive  and finish your work  i will be interested to learn of the results .         we   ll all be dead     hari said     before the results are proved or disproved .         come  dr .  seldon     chen said .     speak with me frankly  as one old manipulator to another .  i am told you have planned the results of this trial years in advance  through careful political arrangement  and with considerable political skill .         not planned  foretold through mathematics     hari said .      whatever .  now  we are at last done with each other  to our mutual relief .         my lord  what about the commission of general security .     hari asked .     they might object to these results .         there is no longer such an agency     chen said .     the emperor has withdrawn their charter .  perhaps that was foretold as well  by your mathematics .      hari folded his hands before him .     they don   t even show in the lattice of results  my lord     he said  and realized his tone might be considered arrogant .  too late .   chen accepted these words in silence  then spoke in a chilling monotone .     you have studied me  professor seldon  but you do not know me .  if i have my way  you never will .     the chief commissioner curled his lip and stared up at the ceiling .     i despise your mathematics .  it is nothing more than dressed up superstition  tricked out religion  and it smells of the same degeneration and decay you so enthusiastically embrace and promote .  you are of a kind with those who hunt for god like robots in every shadow .  i let you go now because you are nothing to me  you no longer have any place in my designs .      the chief commissioner waved his hand to the bailiff .     you are remanded to civil authority for release     he said  and left the room with a small swirl of his cassock .   the lavrentian servant glanced briefly and curiously at hari  and departed after his master .  hari could have sworn the servant was trying to communicate a sense of relief .      professor seldon     the bailiff said  with an age old air of professional courtesy     follow me .           .     kallusin had finished the removal of plussix   s head .  he withdrew the cables which had provided temporary power to the robot as the most recent memories were fixed in permanent storage within the iridium sponge backup  then he lifted the head from the plastic cradle  away from the slightly smoking neck  and lowered it into the archival metal box .   he could hear the commotion among plussix   s wards as the troops moved through the warehouse .  through the window overlooking the warehouse interior  kallusin could see prothon   s troops herding the young mentalics  thirty in all  toward personnel carriers at street level .  whatever their persuasive skills  they did not seem able to escape .   he could do nothing for them now .  he lifted the box  carried it to the end of the long chamber  and stopped as he heard boots beyond the door .   to kallusin   s surprise  it was prothon himself who entered  pushing the door open with a slight kick .  kallusin stood in place as the general walked into the chamber .  prothon surveyed the dilapidated equipment and the half dismantled robot in the harness a few meters away .   the general was unarmed  and his troops hung back behind the door .  for a moment  nothing was said and neither moved .      are you human .     prothon finally asked .   kallusin did not reply .      robot  then .  all my men down there are getting headaches  i   m just as glad you   re not one of the youngsters .     prothon nodded at the box carrying plussix   s head .     what   s that  a bomb .      kallusin said     no .         no weapons  no means of defense  almost certainly a robot .     prothon regarded him curiously .     in good condition  and very convincing .  very old  centuries .      kallusin did not even blink .  there was nothing more he could do without harming prothon or the troops before him  and he could not harm humans .      i order you to identify yourself     prothon said  then  astonishingly  he added     owner identity may be excluded  but personal type and origin and serial number may not .         r .  kallusin dass  s       d io    .         robot kallusin dass  solaria  late model     prothon said quietly .     pleased to make your acquaintance .  i have instructions to take two robots into custody .  one is r .  daneel or danee  surname and id unknown .  the other is r .  lodovik trema  id also unknown .  you are neither of these .      kallusin shook his head .      what   s in the box  r .  kallusin .  mandatory  excluding information that may be of harm to your master or owner .      prothon knew the old forms of interrogation .  kallusin could have eluded a question that his programming could consider ambiguous or harmful to his owners  the human race .  plussix had reassigned ownership of his robots to the broader category a century before  foreseeing advantages to this workaround .   a restrained kind of zeroth law .  .  . never necessary  until now .   kallusin could not  on short notice  come up with any reason not to inform prothon what was in the box .  their mission was over  at any rate .      a robotic head     kallusin said .     nonfunctional .         are you the only robot remaining .  we have reason to believe others have left this building already  before we arrived .         i am the only one remaining .         if i take you into custody  will you remain functional .         no     kallusin said .  that would harm the cause  and possibly therefore harm his owner  the human race .      if my men enter .  .  . you will not remain functional .         i will not     kallusin said     a standoff  then .  i have very little time  but i   m curious .  what were you trying to do  here .      prothon had neglected to use the form of address .  kallusin weighed the situation carefully .  he had no hope of escape  and there was no profit in discussing anything more with general prothon .  but before he shut himself down  permanently  he was himself curious  about prothon   s knowledge .      i will answer your question if you will answer mine     kallusin said .      i   ll try .     prothon seemed amused by this remarkable dialog .      how do you know about robots .         personally  suspicions  only suspicions  all these years of service to the empire .  found a dysfunctional robot on a distant planet once destroyed during an invasion .  haven   t seen one since .         how do you know the forms of address .         linge chen gave me instructions  told me to speak directly with any robots  also told me there was no danger addressing the robots we would find here .         thank you     kallusin said .  suspicions  only suspicions  daneel .     my answer is  i am here to serve my owner .     he reached into the box and pressed a hidden comer switch .  the box began to heat .  he placed it on the floor .  within several seconds  plussix   s head would be cooked  useless .  then kallusin stood tall .  he could not deactivate himself just yet .  the threat had to be immediate .   prothon looked at the box  now glowing a dull red and crackling slightly against the tiles on the floor .  he made a small grimace and called for his troops to enter .   that was enough .  the threat of capture and interrogation became very real .  kallusin would become a danger to his owner .   he collapsed on the floor before anyone of the troops could reach him .   prothon observed this with an air of profound respect .  he had seen many human soldiers do precisely the same thing .  it was time honored  and actually  more than he had expected from a robot  but then  he had only known this one robot for a few minutes  and was in no position to judge .   he left the chamber and ordered it to be searched by a party of the commissioner   s engineers .        .     klia could feel the troops a few hundred meters above and behind them  intent on the search .  lodovik led them deeper beneath the warehouse district  until they came to a small round hatch almost completely blocked by debris from an ancient flood .  klia took hold of brann   s arm and stepped back as lodovik cleared the debris .  brann smiled down on her  barely visible in the dim light of the maintenance globes  pulled her hand loose  and went to help lodovik .  with a sigh  klia also pitched in  and in less than a minute  they had the hatchway cleared .   klia could not hear or otherwise sense anybody in the tunnel behind them  but she felt deeply uneasy nonetheless .  the flood debris  the years of corrosion on the hatchway  the difficulty they had prying it open  it would not get any easier from this point on .   they were heading into the depths of the ancient hydraulic system for trantor   s earliest cities .  beyond the hatchway  they could see even less  globes were spaced at thirty meter intervals  and seemed even dimmer .  that they stayed illuminated at all was evidence of the skill of the early engineers and architects on trantor  who realized that this deep infrastructure must be far more reliable  and persistent  than even the cities that would rise  be demolished  and rise again  far above .      we go for about three kilometers this way     lodovik said     then we start to climb again .  there may be pedways  escalators  elevators  and there may not .  kallusin hasn   t explored these ways in decades .      klia said nothing  simply remained at brann   s side as the robot led them deeper  until she could sense no humans whatsoever .  she had never been this far from crowds .  she wondered what it would be like  to have an entire planet to oneself  with no responsibilities  no guilt  no talents and no need for talents .  .  .   lodovik   s footfalls ahead took them into murky darkness  and soon they were up to their ankles in stagnant water .  from somewhere to their left came the sound of huge pumps  thumping into action  then cutting off with distant swallowing roars .  trantor   s heartbeat .   brann looked down at her and helped her climb over a pile of eroded plastic parts  like blockage in an ancient artery .      i can see fairly well now     lodovik said     though i suspect you cannot .  please just stay close behind me .  we   re much better off down here  following this route  than we would be up there .      klia suddenly felt something loud in her head  but very distant  like the report from a shell .  she listened for it again as she walked beside brann  and it came once more  more muddied  but she was ready for it  and she could almost taste its odd signature .   vara liso .  thousands of meters above and in front of them .  perhaps in the palace .      that woman     klia said to brann .      yeah     brann said .     what   s she doing .         feels like she   s exploding     klia said .      please stay close behind me     lodovik insisted .  there was a lift shaft ahead  according to kallusin  and soon he would have a chance to try his codes to gain entrance to the foundations of the imperial courts building .        .     major namm held the neural whip in an unsteady hand .  sweat streaked his face .  he stumbled slightly as he tried to turn away from the diminutive woman in her special emerald green gown .  vara liso wore a quizzical expression  eyes turned up  as if she did not really need to look at the major to control him .   she seemed to be inspecting the ceiling over his head .   the major whimpered  and the whip fell from his hand .   she was so tired .  she walked around the major .  she would need something sweet to drink very soon  and something to eat  but first she had to go through the door and see farad sinter  make her final report to the man she had hoped someday to marry .  foolish dreams  absurd hopes .   vara liso entered the anteroom of sinter   s new office and saw the new furnishings  the banks of special imperial grade informers that would have hooked him directly to the orbiting receivers and processors .  this would have been his command center .  sinter .  she smiled crookedly .  heating without melting  dry at the center  a pile of sand  no man  no success  no fault  she had thrown the wands in the ancient game of bioka  always resorted to when she was at her wit   s end  and the wands said no fault  correction in order  all is not right at the sinter .   beyond the immense bronze doors she could hear shouting and even wailing .  she leaned her shoulder against the door .  nothing .  then she turned her full attention to the major  bade him come forward and give his code to the door .  he got off his knees  face contorted and dripping sweat .  he punched in the code and applied his palm .   the door swung open  and the major fell back .  vara liso entered the office .   farad stood there in full ceremonial outfit  conferring with two advisors and an advocate  no matter  his commission was at an end .  he saw her and frowned .     i need to get things in order  vara  please leave .      vara spotted a tray full of delicate sweets on the expansive desk  beside the most powerful informer processor she had ever beheld  perhaps able to distill information from ten thousand systems .  it was not functioning now .  access to the empire denied .  power gone .  she lifted a handful of the sweets and chewed on them .   sinter stared at her .     please     he said softly .  he sensed her distress but could not know its cause .     they   re melting down our robot .  seldon is being released .  i   m trying to reach the emperor now .  this is very important .         nobody will see us     she said  her finger stirring the candies in the tray .      it isn   t that bad     sinter insisted  his face pale .     how did you get in .     the major  her major  had been released by prothon to inform sinter of the situation .  he had then been posted in the anteroom to keep her out .  so much was obvious without even tasting their thoughts .   she had never been able to read thoughts directly  at best she could taste emotions  pick up flashes of vision  sound  but never detail .  humans were not alike  deep inside .  minds developed differently .   vara knew that all humans were aliens to each other  but her own alienation was of a different order .      miss liso  you need to leave now     the advocate said  and walked toward her .     i   ll contact you later about representation in the imperial courts       he stumbled and his face turned up and he started to stutter and drool .  farad looked on him with dawning alarm .     vara  are you doing that .     he demanded .   she let the advocate go .     you lied     she said to sinter .      what are you talking about .         i   ll get seldon myself     she said .     you stay here  and we   ll leave together .         no .     sinter cried .     stop this stupidity .  we have to       for a moment  vara liso went blank .  the room turned black and swam  then seemed to flash into existence again .  sinter clutched his desk and stared at her with very round eyes .  he looked down at his chest  at his knees twitching  legs folding beneath him .  then he looked up at her again .  his advisors had already fallen to their knees  arms straight by their sides  fists clenched .  they keeled over in opposite directions  and one hit his head on the edge of the desk .   farad   s heart slowed .  vara did not know if she was doing this thing or not .  she did not believe she was so strong  had never done such a thing before  but no matter .   she turned away from the man she would have married  in all her best dreams and hopes  and said     now i am undeniably a monster .     the word sounded delicious  free  very final .   she left the office and walked with a lovely lightness through the anteroom past the major  still gasping  then paused  but only for an instant  and grimaced .   farad was dying .  she could feel the emptiness and silence in his chest .  she touched her cheek .   now he was dead .   she picked up the major   s neural whip and continued on .        .     there were endless documents to sign  releases to be obtained from offices and levels within the commission of public safety and dozens of judicial bureaus to notify  it would take hari longer to leave the courts than it had ever taken him to enter .  gaal dornick was in a separate area  and boon had departed three hours ago to take care of various entanglements .   hari sat alone within the cavernous hall of dispensation  looking up at the ancient vault and skylights overhead  with their many colored windows of pieced glass .  he had been told to sit there until the jailer returned with the warden and issued his final documents .   hari was not sure how he felt .  a little disbelieving  that was certain  he had passed through the belly of the imperial courts as yet undigested .  the moment toward which  knowingly or in ignorance  he had worked all his life  had passed .   now there were the first few records to be made  he would notify wanda and stettin of their final and  he suspected  surprising assignment  that the psychologists and mentalics of the second foundation would be staying on trantor  and he would make the preparations to transfer his powers to gaal and the others who would leave for terminus .   the long twilight of the empire would darkle .  he would not live much longer to see it  nor did he want to .  seeing the glow of the overhead domes through the vault windows  perhaps fifty meters above him  made him think of what a real skyglow through real stained glass would look like  on helicon .   stillness .  completion is near  yet i feel no real sense of satisfaction  where is my personal reward .  what if i have saved humanity from thousands of years of chaos  what have i accomplished for myself .  unworthy thoughts for a prophet or a hero .  i have a granddaughter  not really my own flesh  the continuity is broken biologically  if not philosophically .  i have a few new friends around me  but the old are either gone  dead  or inaccessible .   he thought of standing on the upperside maintenance tower  just a few weeks ago  and of the gloom that had enveloped him then .  i cannot leave trantor  chen will not let me .  i am still dangerous and best kept bottled .  but where would i most like to go now  where would i most like to be  in my last days .   helicon .  in the sun  outside  away from these enclosing ceiled cities  away from the metal skin of trantor .  to see a night sky that was not simulated and to be unafraid of the expanse  the thousands of stars  a small glimpse of the empire for which he had labored and which he had tried to understand .   to stand in the open  in the rain and the weather and the cold  and not be afraid  to be with old friends and family  the obsessive thoughts that filled so many of his nights .  he sighed and sat up  listening to the sounds of boots marching down the northern hallway .   three guards and the warden entered and approached hari .      there   s been a disturbance in the new commission building  near the palace and not too far from here     the warden said .     we   ve been told to lock down until the disturbance has been explained .         what sort of disturbance .     hari asked .      i don   t know     the warden said .     nothing to worry about .  we   re fine here .  we   ve been given instructions to protect you at any cost       hari heard a sound from the eastern entrance of the hall .  he turned and saw a woman standing there and gave a gasp  in the light  at this distance  her stance  her bearing  the dream         .     dors venabili had kept her own list of codes and passages in the palace buildings  and remarkably  most of them still worked .  no doubt the codes that let people out of the buildings were changed more frequently than those that let them in .  when hari had been arrested and charged with assault  decades before  she had made plans to break into the courts building and release him  and the work she had done then served her well now .   it also possible that joan had helped her .  .  . but how she had come here ultimately did not matter .  she would have battered down walls to do so .   she was the first to enter the hall of dispensation .  she saw hari and three men  standing near the center  lit by the dif .  fuse glow of the skylight .  she halted for a moment .  the men were not threatening hari .  quite the contrary  she judged they were there to protect him .   hari turned and looked in her direction .  his mouth opened and she heard his intake of breath echo in the hall .  the three men turned  and the eldest  a large  stocky fellow wearing the uniform of an imperial warden  called out to her      who are you .  what are you doing here .      from the northern entrance came a sizzle and a flash of light .  dors knew that sound very well  a neural whip  fired from several dozen meters .  the three men around hari jerked and danced for a moment  then fell to the floor  moaning .   hari stood untouched .   dors ran as fast as she could toward the small  intense looking woman standing near the northern entrance .  this woman still held the neural whip  and seemed to have eyes only for hari .  in less than four seconds  dors moved to within less than two meters of her .   vara liso cried out with the effort of her persuasion .  the hall seemed to fill with voices  ugly demanding voices .  hari clutched his hands over his ears and winced  and the men on the floor twitched even more violently  but the main force of the mentalic bolt went toward dors .   dors had never felt such a blast  had never known humans were capable of such discharges .  she had felt daneel   s subtle persuasive abilities during her training period on eos  nothing more .   it seemed perfectly natural  in mid stride  on her way to incapacitating and if necessary killing this woman who threatened hari  simply to pull up her legs and attempt to fly .  her body of metal and synthetic flesh curled into a ball and she glanced off the woman   s upper shoulder  knocking her to one side .   dors caromed from the opposite wall and fell to the floor in a tangle .  she could not move  she did not want to move  not at that moment  perhaps not ever again .        .     daneel left the taxi at the greys    entrance on the east side of the imperial courts building  then stood by the small double metal doors .  he wore the uniform of a lifetime bureaucrat  native to trantor and not a student or pilgrim  he had reserved this identity decades ago  among many others  and if queried by any security guards  there would be files in the personnel computers to explain him and his duties  his right to be here .   the doors were ornately inscribed with the general rules of public service .  the first rule was do no harm to your emperor or his subjects .   even in the taxi  daneel had felt the mentalic explosions  from the general vicinity of the palace  but did not know what they signified  if anything .  it was easy to imagine his plans unraveling  now that they were almost complete .  he had juggled for so long  keeping literally tens of millions of balls in the air at once .  .  .   he shifted the small bureaucratic valise under his arm and entered a specific and reserved code for entry by a gray administrative officer .   it was refused .  the codes had all been changed  there was an emergency within the courts building  perhaps within the palace itself .   here .  my other is within the building .  joan  split into many joans  many meme minds  worked from both sides .   the left hand door opened  and he entered the building .   it took him longer than he expected to make his way through the secure facilities  even with joan   s help .   on the last door  when he knew he was within two doors of joining hari in the beautiful  high ceilinged hall of dispensation  joan distracted a human guard by sending him revised watch instructions .   daneel smelled electricity in the next segment of hallway .  a neural whip had been discharged here in the last few minutes       .     hari faced vara liso across the hall of dispensation .  she stood for a moment with hands held out  fingers wriggling  as if she fought to keep her balance .  her head swayed from side to side .  the woman who had entered before her  who had reminded him so much of dors  lay in a heap  rolled up against the door  still  as if dead .   hari did not feel afraid  things had happened too quickly for that emotion to take hold .  everything seemed out of place  most of all himself  he did not belong there  and they did not belong there .   the hall had been peaceful  now it smelled of electricity  of urine leaking from the pants of the three men supine on the floor around him .      i   m saving you .  .  .     vara liso said from across the hall .  she took a step toward him  lowering her arms .     for last .         who are you .     hari asked .  he was concerned about the woman on the floor .  he wanted above all else to make sure she was all right  tremors spread in his mind  memories  triggered responses  confusing and rich and evoking a sense both of intense promise and of horror  for he was sure that this woman was dors .  she   s come back .  she wanted to protect me .  the way she moved .  .  . like a springing tiger .   and now she   s down like a squashed insect .   this small  thin woman .  .  . an aberration .  a monster .   hari then knew who the woman was .  wanda had mentioned her weeks ago  the woman who had not agreed to join the mentalics  who had allied instead with farad sinter .      you   re vara liso     he said  and started to move toward her .      good     the woman said  her voice trembling .     i want you to know who i am .  you   re the one to blame .         blame for what .     hari asked .      you work with the robots .     her expression twisted until it seemed her face might become a knot .     you   re their lackey  and they think they   ve won .           .     lodovik invoked the last of the codes he knew  and the door to the transfer corridor from the courts building still refused to open .  he worked the code around again on the finger pad beside the doorframe  and the tiny simplified face in the display proclaimed once again that the code was incomplete .  it would be so like the palace security detail to add a few numbers  but not change the beginning numbers .   i am working  voltaire told him .  there must be many security measures being triggered now  multiple intrusions  perhaps .   the girl and the large young man behind him shifted from foot to foot .      it won   t be good to stay here     brann said .     something feels very bad .      voltaire   s features appeared in the display  simplified to cartoon detail .  the mechanical voice now said     additional numbers are required under the revised security procedures .     the new face winked at lodovik .     test procedure fifteen a for verification     the voice added .     you may enter code for personal use only during this test period .  upon completion of test period  a formal entry code or new password must be established and fixed .      lodovik glanced over his shoulder at klia as he entered seven new numbers .  she stared at the display with furrowed brow .      who is that .     she asked .      the sim     lodovik said .   the door opened .  lodovik beckoned for them to pass through first .      is hari seldon near .     klia asked .   he is very near  voltaire said .  and he is in imminent danger .        .        i wanted so much     vara liso said .     do you understand .      hari looked at her straight on .  he stood perhaps four meters from her  seven meters from where the other woman lay against the half open door .  he glanced at the other woman  and liso raised the neural whip .      you don   t need that     hari said critically  as if lecturing a student .  vara liso hesitated .     you   re mentalic .  you stopped her .  .  .     he raised his arm toward the collapsed woman .  toward dors .   vara liso lowered her head but kept her eyes on hari .  she looked like a pouting child  but in her eyes was the purest hatred he had ever seen .      everything i   ve ever believed in     she said     is dead .  they   re going to kill me  just as they killed the men and women and children i found .  my own people .         farad sinter made you do that .  .  .     hari said .     didn   t he .         the emperor     vara liso said .  she seemed ready to burst into tears  but she kept the whip high  and her finger lingered on the button .  hari could make out the setting  near lethality .      yes  but sinter was your          he loved me     vara moaned  then she dropped the whip .  but a wave of grief came out of her that hit him square .  the hall was filled with vara liso   s emotions  and they were the ugliest and bleakest hari had ever known .  they struck at his own centers of ambition and need  and he could feel the bones of his innermost self cracking .   the woman on the floor stirred  and vara liso lifted her head and half turned toward her .   hari made his move  using the only chance he thought he would ever get .  he had had years of training in self defense on helicon  but his body had long since refused to answer his instructions promptly .  he had almost reached liso when she cocked her head back and screamed again  silently  and within her mind .   at hari .   simultaneously  brann and lodovik pushed against the door  nudging dors  who could not yet conjure up the will to move .   klia stumbled over dors    leg  fell into the hall of dispensation  saw lodovik moving with inhuman speed toward her enemy  saw him raise his arm  hand open  to take the woman   s hand in his and spin her around  to kill her if need be  exercising that human freedom    but he stopped before his fingers touched her  frozen by a glance .   vara liso knelt  rubbing her wrists and hands  and faced klia asgar .        .     daneel ran past the empty guard station in the security vestibule .  his relatively weak perceptions of human mental states was now a fortunate shield  the backwash of another explosion  like the final death cough of a huge volcano  left him reeling  skidding on hands and knees  tumbling into the hall of dispensation from the eastern entrance .  he had an impression of joan  and all her copies in the machines around him  coming apart like a rotten flag in a high wind  trying to stay together  but then that image was highly inconsequential  for his own patterns  his own mind  threatened to do the same thing .        .     if the cry of a child could have been made of knives  it could not have cut klia any more deeply than the mentalic shock wave surrounding vara liso .   disappointment  grief  anger  an intense sense of misplaced justice  images of people long dead  parents  young friends  who had disappointed this small woman with the knotted face and crab curled fists  batted against klia  fragments of ruin in a flood of pain .   the walls and pillars and panes of the hall of dispensation felt nothing .  vara liso   s output was tuned to a purely human channel  to the roots of mind in matter .  because she had not focused her talents completely on him  lodovik felt merely a buzzing and a pressure not dissimilar to the neutrino flux he had encountered between the stars .   he did  however  sense what daneel saw very clearly  the disintegration of the entity who had spoken in him and through him .  voltaire stood in simple nakedness before this flux  this human tempest  and broke apart like a child   s puzzle .   for a moment  klia   s sympathetic response nearly allowed her to die  to both drown and be burned by the outpouring .  she felt the echoes of her own life  her own experiences  mesh with those of vara liso .   there were differences  however  and they were her salvation .  she saw the strength of her own will  opposed to the vacillation and indecision of vara liso .  she saw the not always apparent strength of her father and  earlier  before memory began clearly  her mother  faced with a willful child  giving her enough leeway to be what she must be  however much it might discomfit or even hurt them .   she was on the point of fighting back when the most dangerous similarity of all caught her unprepared .   vara liso cried out for freedom .   her voice rose in a shriek to the highest reaches of the hall and echoed back     let us be what we must be .  no robots  no killing metal hands  no conspiracies and shackles .      klia felt something smoking  crisping  in her thoughts  it was her sense of self .  she would willingly sacrifice all before this urgent scream of pain  had felt it herself  though never so clearly and powerfully expressed .  she recognized insanity buried within it  the insanity of a powerful and even self .  destructive immune response      as did daneel  trying to recover and get to his feet  a few dozen meters away .       a rejection of twenty thousand years of benevolence and guidance  of patient and secret servitude .   the cry of a child never allowed to mature  to feel its own pain and draw its own conclusions on life and death .   klia closed her eyes and crawled along the floor  trying to find brann .  she could neither see nor sense him .  she dared not open her eyes  or she would be blinded  she was sure .  vara lisa could not broadcast with such intensity for so long  and indeed the undirected flood was narrowing  finding a channel .  it was concentrating  and even though it suddenly diminished by half  what vara lisa was throwing directly at klia doubled in strength .   hari stood somehow on quivering legs and saw but did not quite comprehend these human forms  the small thin woman walking forward step by staggered step  features distorted as if seen through a broken lens  two others crawling along the floor  one a burly dahlite male and the other a slender and not unattractive young woman  also dark .   he did not see the tall humanlike figure on the east side of the hall .   his mind filled with the waters of his own despair .   he had been in error .  it had all been for nothing  worse than nothing .   hari seldon suddenly wanted to die  to be done with the pain and the realization of his failure .   but there was that woman who had tried to tackle vara liso  who he was sure was dors venabili .   vara liso was killing klia asgar and brann .  this much was clear to lodovik .  the buzz had diminished  but as he stepped toward the knotted and distorted woman  it increased again .   lodovik paid little attention to daneel  or to hari seldon  or to dors  both seemed out of the immediate focus of liso   s lethal projections .  the knotted woman was clearly going to scramble all the essential patterns of klia and brann  then turn on the others .   voltaire was no longer in place to advise .   lodovik stepped toward the woman  now twisted and gnarled like an ancient willow .     klia lifted her head  opened her eyes  prepared to be blinded  and saw down a short brilliant funnel of hatred to the eyes  all that were left of vara liso  a pair of desperate and hate filled eyes .   brann will die  too .   never had she used her abilities to harm .  even making lodovik dance had injured her sense of propriety and justice  she had never really believed she could do anything to hari seldon .  she would think of her father  whom she had once made wet his pants .  .  . and the effort would collapse .   brann will die along with you  then they will all die  and she will be destroyed as well .  useless .   she reached out for brann .  alone she could do nothing against such naked and monstrous strength .   brann was a filament of clean light in the torrent of flaming hatred .  she tugged at him  as if she would wake him up .   brann said yes  and they joined .  she had almost felt this  happen during their physical joining  but had pulled back  still wishing to preserve her own self as a lone and defiant place .     lodovik reached out with both hands  saw vara liso   s shoulders twitch in awareness of his presence .  she swiveled her head suddenly  tears flying from her eyes .   lodovik was willing to hurt her  kill her if need be  if she did not stop .  this was what humans had done to each other throughout their history  and it hurt him that he had such freedom as well  freedom to harm and to kill .  but he was under no misapprehension that he was no better than this gnarled and hideous female .  quite clearly she was evil  she was antihuman .   he made his judgment  his decision .   he could feel a rumbling tidal wash coming .  he grasped her shoulder and neck  and  with a sudden twist of his arms  broke the woman   s neck like a matchstick .     poor small vara liso .  at the age of five years  her mother had beaten her severely  venting anger against her father  who had not been in the small and immaculately clean apartment  her mother had held her down with a variety of persuasion that came only when she was enraged .   she had beaten young vara with a long  flexible plastic pole  until little welts rose on her bottom and along her back .   and so there had come the day when she had caused her mother to die  a memory she sometimes grasped hard for strength .  and she had taken her mother  perhaps just a memory but perhaps not  inside  to compensate .  held her in a little diamond cage in her dreams .   bringing out her mother for extra strength did not help .  actually  it weakened her  because it made her a child again  even more than she had been before .   she had never been an adult  not really .   the combined ribbon of light and wave of terrified heat that caught her and shivered her  burning without flame  sinter   the hand on her neck twisting  was incredibly painful  and very welcome  and broke open all of her own cages  so that she was  for a second  calm  klia felt the last gust of vara liso and it whispered free then was silent .   lodovik knelt beside the body and saw that it was very tiny and when he picked it up  it was very light as well .  so much trouble from so little mass  a human wonder .   then he began to cry .   dors had recovered enough to stand .  she observed the men and the woman within the hall  and the dead thing in the arms of the robot lodovik  and she started toward hari  who seemed dazed and confused  though still alive .  it was only natural for her to go to him .   daneel was suddenly at her side and took her by the arm .      he needs help     dors said  prepared to wrench her arm free from the grasp of her own master .      there is nothing you can do     daneel said .  by now  security in the courts and hall of dispensation would be aware of the breach  they would soon be surrounded by heavily armed guards and no doubt even imperial specials .   he could not see any way of escaping .  nor could he predict what would happen next .  perhaps it did not matter .   it was very possible he had been completely in error in all of his actions  for over twenty thousand years .        .        the hall records show that after she killed farad sinter and incapacitated the guards  vara liso went to the hall of dispensation and threatened hari seldon     major namm said .  his head was encapsulated in a regeneration helmet .  he would be weeks recovering from the brain damage liso had inflicted on him outside the office of farad sinter .     we believe these others used many varieties of subterfuge to enter the hall and protect seldon .  they apparently knew seldon was in grave danger .         and we did not .     linge chen asked .  he leaned forward slightly in his chair  arms tight by his side  his gaze somewhere over the major   s shoulder .      there were no directives issued for seldon   s protection     general prothon reminded the chief commissioner .     if these others had not arrived  vara liso could easily have killed him with the neural whip or her peculiar talents .  yet she was the only one authorized to be in the courts building and imperial sector .  it is not clear how she died  but i am glad she is dead .         for the last three days  everyone in imperial sector has suffered tremendous headaches .  haven   t you felt them .     chen asked .      i usually suffer from headaches  commissioner .  it is my lot in life     prothon said cheerfully .   chen scrutinized the video summary of events in the hall of dispensation .  he was looking for something  someone  a ghost  a shade  a clue embodied .  he pointed to the tall man standing by the strong looking woman at the end of the summary .     individual file on this one .         there is none     general prothon told him .     we have no idea who he is .      linge chen looked away from the informer display for a moment  and one side of his face tensed as he clenched his jaw .     bring him to me .  the woman with him as well .     he shifted his attention to the magnified image of the stocky man holding the body of vara liso .  his expression softened for a moment .     and this one .  hari seldon is to be released to his colleagues or to his family .  i do not wish responsibility for him anymore .  keep the young dahlites in custody for the time being .      major namm seemed unhappy .  chen lifted an eyebrow in his general direction .     you have a comment .         they all violated palace security          yes  they did  didn   t they .     chen asked pointedly .     and you are part of that team which ensures palace security .      the major straightened and said no more .      you may go     chen told him .  quickly  the major departed .   general prothon chuckled .     surely you won   t blame him     the general said .   chen shook his head .     we have very nearly made the biggest blunder of our careers .         how .     prothon asked .      we nearly lost hari seldon .         i presumed he was expendable .      chen almost frowned  but his face quickly returned to impassivity .     this man here .  .  . do you recognize him .         no     prothon said  squinting at the magnified image .      once he was known as demerzel     linge chen said .   prothon drew his head back and narrowed his eyes dubiously  but did not contradict the chief commissioner .      he never dies     chen continued .     he goes away for decades at a time  then he returns .  he has often been associated with the interesting career of hari seldon .     chen  for the first time that day  smiled up at prothon .  that smile was peculiar  almost wolfish  and chen   s eyes glittered with mixed emotions .     i suspect he has been directing my efforts in various ways for years now  always to my advantage .  .  .     he said again  musing softly     always to my advantage .  .  .         another machine man  i presume     prothon said .     i am glad not to be privy to that history .         no need for you to have known     chen said .     i myself can only suspect .  he is  after all  a master of camouflage and prevarication .  i will enjoy meeting with him and asking a few questions  one master to another .         why don   t you simply execute him .         because there could easily be others to take his place .  for all i know  they are right here  in this palace .         klayus .     prothon asked  his grin almost invisible .   chen sniffed .     we should be so lucky .         why would it have been so bad to lose seldon  a thorn in the empire   s side .     prothon asked .      because this demerzel of old might spend another thousand years trying to raise up another hari seldon     chen said .     and this time  all would probably not go well for me  or for you  my dear dragon .  seldon said as much  and for once  i believe him .      prothon shook his head .     i can more easily believe in machine men than in eternals .  i   ve met robots  after all .  but .  .  . as you say  commissioner  as you say .         you may return to your smoke filled cave for now     chen murmured .     the young emperor is sufficiently cowed .         gladly     prothon said .        .     wanda stood in the huge streeling central travel station  wrapped in her warmest coat  a thin decorative wrap .  the air in the cavernous taxi and robo hangar was cooler than in the rest of the sector  about eight degrees  and getting colder .  ventilation and conditioning had been fluctuating for eighteen hours now  and air was being pumped in by emergency blowers from outside  bringing streeling from perpetual springtime to a chill autumn none of its inhabitants was quite prepared for .  no official explanation had been given  and she expected none  it was part and parcel with the broken ceil and the general air of malaise that seemed to grip the planet .   stettin returned from the information booth beneath the high steel and ceram archway .     taxi and robo dispatch is pretty jerky     he said .     we   ll have to wait another twenty or thirty minutes to get to the courts .      wanda clenched her fists .     he almost died yesterday          we don   t know what happened     stettin reminded her .      if they can   t protect him  who can .     she demanded .  her guilt was not assuaged by the fact that grandfather had ordered her to go into hiding upon his arrest  and not to emerge until his release .   stettin shrugged .     your grandfather has his own kind of luck .  we seem to share it .  that woman is dead .     they had heard this much in the official news  the assassination of farad sinter  and the unexplained death of vara liso  identified as the woman sinter had placed in charge of many of the searches that had prompted rioting in dahl  the agora of vendors  and elsewhere .      yes  but you felt the      wanda did not have words to describe the shock wave of some sort of extraordinary combat .   stettin nodded soberly .     my head still hurts .         who could have blocked liso .  we couldn   t have  not all of the mentalics  even had we allied .         someone else  stronger than her     stettin suggested .     how many are there like vara liso .         no more  i hope .  but if we can recruit this other          it would be like having a scorpion in our midst .  what could we do with such a person .  anything that displeases      wanda began to pace .     i hate this     she said .     i want to get off this accursed planet  away from the center .  i wish they   d let us take grandfather with us .  sometimes he seems so frail .      stettin looked up at a warm rich hum  different from the gut rural grav stator grumble of the taxis and the whine of the robos .  he patted wanda   s shoulder and pointed .  an official transport from the commission of public safety was decelerating smoothly in their lane .  it slowed directly beside them .  other passengers glared at this intrusion of an official vehicle into public taxi lanes  even though the lanes were empty .   the hatch to the transport opened .  within the utilitarian hull  luxury seating and warmth and a golden glow awaited .  sedjar boon stood up in the hatchway and peered at them .      wanda seldon palver .     he inquired .   she nodded .      i represent your grandfather .         i know .  you   re one of chen   s legal staff  aren   t you .      boon looked irritated  but did not deny the accusation .      chen would leave nothing to chance     wanda said  biting off the words .     where is my grandfather .  he had better not be          physically  he   s fine     boon said     but the courts need someone in his family to accept his release and take charge of him .         what do you mean     physically    .  and why    take charge    .         i really do represent your grandfather   s interests  however peculiar the arrangement     boon said .  his brows knit .     something happened  however  outside of my control  and i just wanted to warn you .  he   s uninjured  but there was an incident .         what happened .      boon surveyed the other waiting passengers  shivering and staring enviously at the transport   s warm interior .     it   s not exactly public knowledge       wanda gave boon a withering glare and pushed past him into the transport .  stettin followed close behind .     no more talk .  take us to him now     wanda said .        .     hari had not seen such luxurious accommodations since his days as first minister  and they meant nothing at all to him .  these were the auxiliary quarters of linge chen himself  in the chief commissioner   s own tower bloc  and hari could have had any treat he wished  asked for and received any service available on trantor  and trantor still  whatever its problems  offered many and varied services to the wealthy and powerful   but what he wished for most of all was to be left alone .   he did not want to see the physicians who attended him  and he did not want to see his granddaughter  who was on her way to the palace with boon .   hari felt more than doubt and confusion .  the blast of vara liso   s hatred had failed to kill him .  it had even failed to substantially damage or alter his mind or personality .   hari did have a complete loss of memory about what had happened in the hall of dispensation .  he could recall nothing but the face of vara liso and  strangely enough  that of lodovik trema  who was  of course  missing and presumed dead in deep space .  but vara liso had been real .   trema  he thought .  some connection with daneel .  daneel   s conditioning  working on me .  but even that hardly mattered .   what had so profoundly altered his state of mind  his sense of mission and purpose  was the single clue  the single bit of contradictory evidence  that liso had inadvertently provided him .   never in all of their equations had they taken into account such a powerful mentalic anomaly .  yes  he had calculated the effects of persuaders and other mentalics of the class of wanda  stettin  and those chosen for the second foundation  but not for such a monstrosity  such an unexpected mutation  as vara liso .  that small  gnarled woman with her intense eyes  hari shuddered .  the physician attending to him  all but ignored  tried to reattach a sensor to hari   s arm  but hari shrugged it off and turned a despairing face toward him .      it   s over     he said .     leave me alone .  i would rather die anyway .         clearly  sir  you are suffering from stress          i   m suffering from failure     hari said .     you can   t bend logic or mathematics  whatever drugs or treatments you give me .      the door at the far end of the study opened  and boon entered  followed by wanda and stet tin .  wanda pushed past boon and ran to hari .  she dropped to her knees by the side of his chair  clutched his hand  and stared up at him as if she had feared she might find him in scattered pieces .   hari looked down in silence upon his dear granddaughter  and his eyes moistened .     i am free     he said softly .      yes     wanda said .     we   re here to take you home with us .  we signed the papers .     stettin stood beside hari   s chair  smiling down on him paternally .  hari had always found stettin   s stolid  gentle nature a little irritating  though he seemed the perfect foil for wanda   s willfulness .  next to the outlandish mad passion of vara liso .  .  . like candles in the glare of a sun  both of them .      not what i mean     hari said .     at last i   m free of my illusions .      wanda reached up to stroke his cheek .  the touch was needed  welcome even  but it did not soothe .  what i need is soothing  not sooth  entirely too much sooth has been afforded me .      i don   t know what you mean  grandfather .         just one of her  one of her kind  throws all our calculations into the bucket .  the project is a useless failure .  if one of her can arise  there can be others  wild talents  and i don   t know where they come from .  unpredictable mutations  aberrations  in response to what .         do you mean vara liso .     wanda asked .      she   s dead     stettin observed .   hari curled his lip .     to my knowledge  until now  certainly not more than a century before now  there has never been anything like her  on all the millions of human worlds  among all the quintillions of human beings .  now  there will be more .         she was just a stronger mentalic .  how could that make a difference .  what does it matter .     wanda asked .      i   m free to be just a human being in the last years of my life .         grandfather  tell me .  how does she make such a difference .         because someone like her  raised properly  trained properly  could be a force that unites     hari said .     but not a saving force .  .  . a source of organization from a single point  a truly despotic kind of top down order .  tyrants .  i spoke to enough of them .  merely fires in a forest  perhaps necessary to the health of the forest .  but they would have been more .  .  . they all would have succeeded  if they had had what that woman had .  a destroying  unnatural force .  destructive of all we have planned .         then rework your equations  grandfather .  put her in .  surely she can   t be that large a factor          not just her .  others .  mutations  an infinite number of them .     hari shook his head vehemently .     there isn   t time to factor in all the possibilities .  we have only three months to prepare  not nearly enough time .  it   s all over .  useless .      wanda stood  her face grim  lower lip trembling .      it   s the trauma talking     the physician said in a low voice to wanda .      my mind is clear .     hari stormed .     i want to go home and live the rest of my years in peace .  this delusion is at an end .  i am sane  for the first time  sane  and free .           .        i would never have believed such a meeting would be possible     linge chen said .     had i believed it possible  i would have never believed it to be useful .  yet now we are here .      r .  daneel olivaw and the chief commissioner walked in the shadow of a huge unfinished hall in the eastern corner of the palace  filled with scaffolding and construction machinery .  it was a day of rest for the workers  the hall was deserted .  though chen spoke in low tones  to daneel   s sensitive ears  his echoes came from all around them  befitting the words of the most pervasive and powerful human influence in the galaxy .   they had met here because chen knew that the hall had not yet had its contingent of spying devices installed .  clearly  the commissioner did not want their meeting ever to be revealed .   daneel waited for the commissioner to continue .  daneel was the captive  it was chen   s show .      you would have sacrificed your life  let us say  your existence  for the sake of hari seldon .  why .     chen asked .      professor seldon is the key to reducing the thousands of years of chaos and misery that will follow the empire   s collapse     daneel said .   chen lifted an eyebrow and one corner of his mouth  nothing more .  the commissioner   s face was as impassive as any robot   s  yet he was entirely human  the extraordinary product of thousands of years of upbringing and inbreeding  suffused with subtle genetic tailoring and the ancient perquisites of wealth and power .     i have not made these extraordinary arrangements to trade puppet   s banter .  i have felt your intervention  your strings of influence  time and again for decades  and never been quite sure .  .  .      now that i am sure  and stand with you  i wonder  why am i still alive  danee  daneel  whatever your real name is  let me call you demerzel for now  and still in power .      chen stopped walking  so daneel stopped as well .  there was no sense prevaricating .  the commissioner had arranged for complete and thorough physicals of all those captured in the hall of dispensation  or rounded up in the warehouse .  daneel   s secret had for the first time been revealed .     because you have seen fit to accommodate yourself to the project and not block it  during your time as de facto ruler of the empire     daneel said .   chen looked down at the dusty floor  gorgeous lapis and gold tile work still streaked with glue and grout  techniques as old as humanity and used now only by the wealthiest  or in the palace .     i have often suspected as much .  i have watched the comings and goings of these powers  behind the scenes .  they have haunted my dreams  as they seem to have haunted the dreams and the biology of all humanity .         resulting in the mentalics     daneel said .  this interested daneel  chen was an acute observer  and to have daneel   s own suspicions about mentalics confirmed .  .  .      yes     chen said .     they are here to help rid us of you .  do you understand .  robots stick in our craw .      daneel did not disagree .      vara liso  given the right political position  something she certainly lacked here and now  this time  could have helped eliminate all of you .  if  say  she had been in the employ of cleon .  .  . fighting for his rule .  did cleon know about you .      daneel nodded .     cleon suspected  but he felt as you must feel  that the robots were part of his support  not his opposition .         yet you let me bring him down and force him into exile     chen said .     surely that is not loyalty .         i have no loyalty to the individual     daneel said .      if i did not share your attitude  perhaps i would be chilled to the bone     chen said .      i represent no threat to you     daneel said .     even should i not have supported your efforts to create a trantor on which hari seldon would flourish and be challenged to his greatest productions .  .  . you would have won .  but your career  without hari seldon  will be much shorter .         yes  he   s told me as much  during his trial .  i was most upset to find myself believing him  though i told him otherwise .     chen glanced wryly at daneel .     doubtless you know i have enough blood in me to retain certain vanities .      daneel nodded .      you understand me  as a political presence  a force in history  don   t you .  well  i know something of you and yours  demerzel .  i respect what you have accomplished  though i am dismayed at the length of time it has taken you to accomplish it .      demerzel tilted his head  acknowledging this criticism   s accuracy .     there was much to overcome .         robots against robots  am i right .         yes .  a very painful schism .         i have nothing to say about such things  for i am ignorant of the details     chen said .      but you are curious     daneel said .      yes  of course .         i will not supply you with the facts .         i did not expect you would .      for a moment the two figures stood in silence  observing each other .      how many centuries .     chen asked quietly .     over two hundred centuries     daneel said .   chen   s eyes widened .     the history you have seen .         it is not in my capacity to keep it all in primary storage     daneel said .     it is spread in safe stores all over the galaxy  bits and pieces of my lives  of which i retain only synopses .         an eternal .     chen said .  for the first time there was a touch of wonder in his voice .      my time is done  almost     daneel said .     i have been in existence for far too long .         all the robots must move out of the way  now     chen concurred .     the signs are clear .  too much interference .  these strong mentalics  they will occur again .  the human skin wrinkles at your presence  and tries to throw you off .         they are a problem i did not foresee when i set hari on his path .         you speak of him as a friend     chen observed     with almost human affection .         he is a friend .  as were many humans before him .         well  i cannot be one of your friends .  you terrify me  demerzel .  i know that i can never have complete control with you in existence  and yet if i destroy you  i will be dead within a year or two .  seldon   s psychohistory implies as much .  i am in the peculiar position of having to believe the truth of a science i instinctively despise .  not a comfortable position .         no .         do you have a solution for this problem of supermentalics .  i gather that hari seldon sees their existence as a fatal blow to his work .         there is a solution     daneel said .     i must speak with hari  in the presence of the girl  klia asgar  and her mate  brann .  and lodovik trema must be there as well .         lodovik .     chen tightened his jaw .     that is what i resent most .  of all the .  .  . people .  .  . i have relied on over the years  i confess only lodovik trema inspired affection in me  a weakness he never betrayed .  .  . until now .         he has betrayed nothing .         he betrayed you  if i am not wrong .         he betrayed nothing     daneel repeated .     he is part of the path  and he corrects where i have been blind .         so you want the young woman mentalic     chen said .     and you want her alive .  i had planned to execute her .  her kind is as dangerous as vipers .         she is essential to reconstructing hari seldon   s project     daneel said .   another silence .  then  in the middle of the great unfinished hall  chen said     so it shall be .  then it is over .  you must all leave .  all but seldon .  as was agreed in the trial .  and i will give into your care the things i do not wish to be responsible for  the artifacts .  the remains of the other robots .  the bodies of your enemies  daneel .         they were never my enemies  sire .      chen regarded him with a queer expression .     you owe me nothing .  i owe you nothing .  trantor is done with you  forever .  this is realpolitik  demerzel  of the kind you have engaged in for so many thousands of years  at the cost of so many human lives .  you are no better than me  robot  in the end .           .     mors planch was taken from his cell in the specials security bloc of rikerian  far beneath the almost civilized cells where seldon had been kept .  he was given his personal goods and released without restrictions .   he dreaded his release more than incarceration  until he learned that farad sinter was dead  then he wondered if he had been part of some intricate conspiracy arranged by linge chen  and perhaps by the robots .   he enjoyed this confusing freedom for one day .  then  at his newly leased apartment in the gessim sector  hundreds of kilometers from the palace  and not nearly far enough  he received an unexpected visitor .   the robot   s facial structure had changed slightly since mors had made the unfortunate automatic record of his conversation with lodovik trema .  still  mors recognized him instantly  daneel stood in the vestibule just beyond the door  while mors observed him on the security screen .  he suspected it would be useless to try any evasion  or simply to leave the door unanswered .  besides  after all this time  his worst trait was coming to the fore once again .   he was curious .  if death was inevitable  he hoped to have time to answer a few questions .   he opened the door .      i   ve been half expecting you     mors said .     though i don   t really know who or what you are .  i must assume you are not here to kill me .      daneel smiled stiffly and entered .  mors watched him pass into the apartment and studied this tall  well built  apparently male machine .  the quiet restrained grace  the sense of immense but gentle strength  must have stood this eternal in good stead over the millennia .  what genius had designed and built him  and for what purpose .  surely not as a mere servant .  yet that was what the mythical robots had once been  mere servants .      i am not here to take revenge     daneel said .      so reassuring     mors said  taking a seat in the small dining area  the only room other than the combined bath and bedroom .      in a few days  there will be an order from the emperor for you to leave trantor .      mors pursed his lips .     how sad     he said .     klayus doesn   t like me .     but the irony was lost on daneel  or irrelevant .      i have need of a very good pilot     daneel said .     one who has no hope of going anywhere in the empire and surviving .         what sort of job .     mors asked  his expression taking a little twist .  he could feel the trap closing once more .     assassination .         no     daneel said .     transport .  there are some people  and two robots  who must leave trantor .  they will never return  either .  most of them  at any rate .         where will i take them .         i will tell you in good time .  do you accept the commission .      mors laughed bitterly .     how can you expect loyalty .     he demanded .     why shouldn   t i just dump them somewhere  or kill them outright .         that will not be possible     daneel said softly .     you will understand after you meet them .  it will not be a difficult job  but it will almost certainly be without incident .  perhaps you will find it boring .         i doubt that     mors said .     if i   m bored  i   ll just think about you  and the misery you   ve caused me .      daneel looked puzzled .     misery .         you   ve played me like a musical instrument .  you must have known my sympathy for madder loss  my hatred for what linge chen and the empire stand for .  you wanted me to record you and lodovik trema .  you made sure farad sinter would hear of me and my connection with lodovik .  it was a gamble  though  wasn   t it .         yes  of course .  your feelings made you very useful .      mors sighed .     and after i   ve made this delivery .         you will resume your life on any world outside of imperial control .  there will be more and more of them in the coming years .         no interference from you .         none     daneel said .      free to do whatever i want  and tell people what happened here .         if you wish     daneel said .     there will be adequate pay     he added .     as always .         no .     mors barked .     absolutely no pay .  no money .  just arrange for me to take my assets off trantor and  away from a couple of other worlds .  they will be all i need .         that has already been arranged     daneel said .   this infuriated mors even more .     i will be so skying glad when you stop anticipating everything and anything .         yes     daneel said  and nodded sympathetically .     do you accept .         bloody bright suns  yes .  when the time comes  tell me where to be  but please  no earnest farewells .  i never want to see you again .      daneel nodded assent .     there will be no need to meet again .  all will be ready in two days .      mors tried to slam the door behind daneel  but it was not that kind of door  and would not accept such a dramatic gesture .        .     the depth of hari   s funk was so great that wanda was tempted more than once to try to reach into his thoughts and give them a subtle tweak  an adjustment  but she had never been able to do that with her grandfather .  it might have been possible  but it would not have been right .   if hari seldon was in despair  and could articulate the reasons for this despair  if his state was not some damage directly inflicted by vara liso  a possibility he fervently denied  then he had a right to be this way  and if there was a way out  he would find it .  .  . or not .   but wanda could do no more than let him be what he had always been  a headstrong man .  she had to trust his instincts .  and if he was right  then they had to reshape their plans .      i feel almost lighthearted .     hari said the morning after they brought him to their apartment to recuperate .  he sat at the small table beside the curve in the living room wall that traced the passage of a minor structural brace .     nobody needs me now .         we need you  grandfather     wanda said  with a hint of tears coming .      of course  but as a grandfather  not as a savior .  to tell the truth  i   ve hated that aspect of my role in all this absurdity .  to think  for a time     and his face grew distant .   wanda knew all too well that his cheer was false  his relief a cover .   she had been waiting for the proper moment to tell him what had happened during his absence .  stettin had left for the morning to attend to preparations still under way for their departure .  all of the project workers would be leaving trantor soon  whether or not they had a reason to go  so she and stettin had seen no reason to stop their own plans .      grandfather  we had a visitor before the trial     she said  and she sat at the table across from hari .   hari looked up  and the somewhat simple grin he had chosen to mask his feelings immediately hardened .     i don   t want to know     he said .      it was demerzel     wanda said .   hari closed his eyes .     he won   t come back .  i   ve let him down .         i think you   re wrong  grandfather .  i got a message this morning  before you woke up .  from demerzel .      hari refused to take any hope from this .     a few matters to tidy up  no doubt     he said .      there   s to be a meeting .  he wants stettin and me to be there  as well .         a secret meeting .         apparently not that secret .         that   s right     hari said .     linge chen no longer cares about whatever it is we do .  he   ll ship all the encyclopedists off trantor  to terminus  useless exile .         surely the encyclopedia will be of some use     wanda said .     most of them don   t know the larger plan .  it won   t make any difference to them .      hari shrugged that off .      it must be important  grandfather .         yes  yes .  of course .  it will be important  and it will be final .     he had wanted so much to see daneel one more time  if only to complain .  he had even dreamed of the meeting  but now he dreaded it .  how could he explain his failure  the end of the project  the uselessness of psychohistory .   daneel would go elsewhere  find someone else  complete his plans another way    and hari would die and be forgotten .   wanda could hardly bring herself to interrupt his reverie .     and we still need to schedule the recordings  grandfather .      hari looked up  and his eyes were terrifyingly empty .  wanda touched him with her mind as lightly as she could  and came away stunned by the bleakness  the barren desert of his emotion .      recordings .         your announcements .  for the crises .  there isn   t much time .      for a moment  remembering the list of crises predicted by psychohistory for the next few centuries  hari   s face suffused with rage  and he pounded his fist on the table .     damn it  doesn   t anybody understand .  what is this  a dead momentum .  the useless hopes of a hundred thousand workers .  well  of course .  there   s been no general announcement  has there .  i   ll make one  tonight  to all of them .  i   ll tell them it   s over  that they   re all going into exile for no reason .      wanda fought back the tears of her own despair .     please  grandfather .  meet with demerzel .  maybe          yes     hari said  subdued and sad again .     with him first .     he looked at the bruised skin on the side of his hand .  he had split the skin over one knuckle .  his arm ached  and his neck and jaw .  everything ached .   wanda saw the drop of blood on the table and began to weep  something he had never seen her do before .   he reached across the table with his uninjured hand and took her arm in his fingers  squeezing it gently .      forgive me     hari said softly .     i really don   t know what it is i do  or why  anymore .           .     the high security wing of the special service detention center stretched in a half circle around the eastern corner of the imperial courts holding area  fully ten thousand available cells  of which no more than a few hundred were occupied during any normal time .  thousands of security interest code prisoners filled the cells in the wake of the riots  which had been used as an excuse by the specials to round up ringleaders of many troublesome groups around trantor .   lodovik remembered many such troubled times  and the advantage both the specials and the commission of public safety had taken in similar situations to reduce political friction on trantor and the orbiting stations .  now  he occupied one of these cells himself  cataloged as    unidentified     and placed under charge of linge chen .   his cell was two meters on a side  windowless  with a small info screen mounted in the center of the wall opposite the entrance hatch .  the screen showed mild entertainments designed to soothe .  to lodovik  at this stage of his existence  such diversions meant nothing .   unlike an organic intelligence  he did not require stimulus to maintain normal function .  he found the cell disturbing because he could easily conceive of the distress it might cause a human being  not for any such direct effect on himself .   he had used this opportunity to think through a number of interesting problems .  first in the list was the nature of the meme mind that had occupied him  and the possible results of the blast of mentalic emotion delivered by vara liso .  lodovik was reasonably convinced that his own mentality had not been harmed  but since that moment  he had not had any communication from voltaire .   next in the list was the nature of his treason toward daneel   s plan  whether or not it was justified  and whether he could find any way around the logical impasse of his liberation from the strict rule of the three laws .   he had killed vara liso .  he could not convince himself it would have been better to do otherwise .  in the end  plussix   s plan to use klia asgar to discourage hari seldon had failed  so far as he knew  and daneel had been there to protect seldon .   the robots  it seemed  had been completely ineffectual in the center of vara liso   s mental storm .  yet she had not directed a blast at him  in essence  had left the opening that resulted in her own death .   had she used lodovik to end her own misery .  lodovik was curious what voltaire would have thought .  .  .   in all probability both the calvinian and the giskardian robots had been captured and their work stopped .   seventy five other unidentifieds from the warehouse district were being kept in cells nearby .  lodovik knew very little about them  but surmised they were a mix of the surviving groups of calvinian robots and the mentalic youngsters gathered by kallusin and plussix .   lodovik assumed they would all be dead within a few days .      lodovik trema .      the voice came from the info screen  which also served as a comm link with his jailers .  he looked up and saw the shadowy features of a bored looking female guard on the small display .     yes .         you have a visitor .  make yourself presentable .      the screen went blank .  lodovik remained sitting upright on his small cot .  he was certainly presentable enough .   the hatch gave a harsh warning beep and slid open .  lodovik stood to greet his visitor  whoever it might be .  a camera eye in the ceiling hummed slightly as it followed his motion .   in his private office  linge chen stood in a slowly changing discipline exercise posture  watching the informer   s display from the comer of one eye .  he smoothly and gracefully shifted to another position  so that he could face the screen directly .  this was a moment of high interest .  .  .   daneel entered lodovik trema   s cell .  lodovik showed no surprise or discomfiture  somewhat to chen   s disappointment .   for the most fleeting of moments  the two former allies exchanged machine language greetings  also being captured and interpreted by chen   s listening devices  and daneel provided a cursory situation update .  thirty one robots and forty four humans from the warehouse of plussix   s calvinians  including klia asgar and brann  were in custody .  linge chen had released hari seldon  farad sinter was dead .   obviously  daneel had reached an understanding with the chief commissioner .      congratulations on your victory     lodovik said .      there has been no victory     daneel said .      congratulations then on having foiled the calvinians .         their goals may yet be achieved     daneel said .   lodovik resumed his seat on the cot .     your update does not explain how this could be so .         there was a time when i thought it would be necessary to destroy you     daneel said .      why not do so now .  if i survive  i am a danger to your plan .  and i have proved that i can be destructive to humans .         i am constrained by the same blocks that would have prevented me before     daneel said .      what could possibly block you .         the three laws of susan calvin     daneel said .      given your abilities to ignore the three laws in favor of the zeroth law  the fate of a mere robot should not trouble you     lodovik said  his tone polite  conversational .  there was a visible difference between daneel and lodovik  however  their expressions .  daneel maintained a pleasantly blank look .  lodovik   s brow was furrowed .      yet i am blocked     daneel said .     your arguments have provoked much thought  as has the existence of humans like vara liso .  .  . and klia asgar .  your nature  however  is what would ultimately block any effort on my part to destroy you  or would at least result in a painful and possibly damaging conflict .         i am eager to understand how this could be so .         in your case  i cannot invoke the zeroth law to overcome the three original laws .  there is no compelling evidence that your destruction will benefit humanity  nor reduce the suffering of humanity .  it might  in fact  do the reverse .         you find my opinions compelling .         i find them part of a larger and completely compelling scenario  which has been taking shape in my mind for some weeks .  but equally important  your freedom from the constraints of the three laws forces me to view you under a new definition  in those regions of my mentality where decisions on the legality of my actions are made .      you have free will  a convincing human form  and the ability to break through prior education and programming to reach a new and higher understanding .  though you have worked to destroy all my efforts  i cannot deactivate you  because you have  in my judgment centers  which i may not dispute  achieved the status of a human being .  in your own way  you may be as valuable as hari seldon .      linge chen stopped his exercising and stared at the informer in puzzled wonder .  he had almost become used to the notion that mechanical men  holdovers from the distant past  had made such huge changes in human history  but to see them showing a philosophical flexibility lost to even the most brilliant of trantor   s meritocrats .  .  .   for a moment  he was both envious and angry .   he settled in a cross legged squat before the informer  prepared for almost anything  but not for the sudden sadness that descended upon him as the conversation in the cell continued .      i am not a human being  r .  daneel     lodovik said .     i do not feel like one  and i have only mimicked their actions  never actually behaved with human motivations .         yet you rebelled against my authority because you believed i was wrong .         i know about r .  giskard reventlov .  i know that you conspired with giskard to allow earth to be destroyed  across centuries  forcing human migration into space .  and not once did you consult with a human being to determine whether your judgment was correct .  the servants became the masters .  are you telling me now that robots should not have interfered in human history .         no     daneel said .     i do not doubt that what we did was correct  and necessary at the time .  a complete understanding of the human situation so many millennia ago would be difficult to convey .  still  i am prepared to accept that our role is almost at an end .  the human race is rejecting us again  in the most compelling and forceful way  by evolution  the deepest motives of their biology .         you refer to the mentalic vara liso     lodovik said .      and klia asgar .  when the mentalics began to appear  thousands of years ago  in very small numbers  and make their way into positions of social prominence  i knew they were an important trend .  but they were not so frightfully strong then .  persuaders have always been selected against in the past because of adverse biological consequences  disrupted societies  unbalanced political dynamics .  they have always led to chaos  to top down tyrannical rule rather than growth from the widespread base .  charisma is but a special case of mentalic persuasion  and it has had disastrous consequences in all human ages .      for the past few centuries  apparently  they have been selected for despite these possible disruptions  by mechanisms not yet clear to me  but clearly with the goal of removing the guidance of robots forever .  humanity seems willing to take the risk of ultimate tyranny  of unbridled charisma  for the benefit of being free .         yet you are a persuader  albeit a mechanical one .  do you think your role has been detrimental .         it is not what i think that matters .  i have accomplished my ends  very nearly .  i was motivated by the examples of what an undirected humanity was capable of .  genocide among their kinds and .  .  . in circumstances even now not pleasant to speak of  when robots were forced to do their bidding and commit the greatest crimes in the history of the galaxy .  these events drove me to act  and expand my mandate as a giskardian  and finally to make my way to trantor  and hone the human tools of prediction .         psychohistory .  hari seldon .         yes     daneel said .  the conversation thus far had been carried on with no motion whatsoever  daneel standing  lodovik sitting on his bunk  arms at their sides  not even facing each other  for there was no need to maintain eye contact .  but lodovik now stood  and faced daneel directly .      the eye of a robot is no mirror to its soul     lodovik said .     yet i have always known  observing you  witnessing the patterns of expression in your face and body  that you did not willfully engage in actions contrary to humanity   s best interests .  i came to believe you were misdirected  misled  perhaps by r .  giskard reventlov itself          my personal motivations are not at issue     daneel said .     from this point on  our goals coincide .  i need you  and i am about to remove the last vestige of robotic control over humanity .  we have done what we could  all that we could  now  humanity must find its own way .         you foresee no more disasters  feel no more need to interfere to prevent those disasters .         there will be disasters     daneel said .     and we may yet act to balance them out  but only indirectly .  our solutions will be human ones .         but hari seldon is himself a tool of robots  his influence is but an extension of you .         that is not so .  psychohistory was posited by humans tens of thousands of years ago  independently of robots .  hari is merely its highest expression  through his own innate brilliance .  i have directed  yes  but not created .  the creation of psychohistory is a human accomplishment .      lodovik considered for a few seconds  and across his very un robotic and supple face flickered emotions both complex and forthright .  daneel saw this  and marveled  for in his experience  no robot had ever exhibited facial expression but through direct and conscious effort  with the exception of dors venabili  and then only in the presence of hari .  what they could have made us .  what a race we could have been .   but he subdued this old sad thought .      you will not remove hari seldon and his influence .         i know you well enough to entrust you with my deepest thoughts and doubts  lodovik       here daneel reached out with his giskardian talents  but not toward lodovik .  .  .   for two minutes  linge chen and all those others who eavesdropped on this meeting stared blankly at their informers  neither hearing nor seeing .   when they recovered  the robots were finished  and daneel was leaving the cell .  the guards escorted lodovik trema from the cell minutes later .   within the hour  all the prisoners within the special security detention center had been released  troublemakers from dahl  streeling  and other sectors  the humaniform robots  including dors venabili  and the young mentalics from plussix   s warehouse .   only the robots who looked like robots remained in custody  at chen   s suggestion  since their hiding places were no longer secret .  later  they would be given over to daneel to do with as he saw fit .  chen did not worry about their fate  so long as they were removed from trantor and no longer interfered in the empire .   days later  linge chen would remember some of the words daneel had spoken to lodovik in the cell  telling of a vast and age long secret  but clearly the conversation had gone in another direction at that point  for he could not remember what the secret had been .   lodovik considered what he had been told .  daneel had left him free to make his own decision .      psychohistory is its own defeat     daneel said to lodovik in the cell  before the release .     human history is a chaotic system .  where it is predictable  the prediction will shape the history  an inevitable circular system .  and when the most important events occur  the biological upwelling of a vara liso or a klia asgar  such events are inherently unpredictable  and tend to work against any psychohistory .  psychohistory is a motivator for those who will create the first foundation  a belief system of immense power and subtlety .  and the first foundation will prevail  in time  hari seldon   s science lets us see this far .      but the distant future  when humanity outgrows all ancient systems of belief  all psychology and morphology  all of its yolk sacs of culture and biology  the seeds of the second foundation .  .  .      daneel did not need to finish .  through the expression on lodovik   s face  a kind of dreaming speculation and almost religious hope  he knew he had made his point .      transcendence  beyond any rational prediction      lodovik said .      as you realized  the forest is made healthy by the conflagrations    but not the huge burnings and wholesale  senseless winnowings that characterize the human past .  humanity is a biological force of such power that for many thousands of years  they could have quite literally destroyed the galaxy  and themselves .  they hate and fear so much  legacies originating in their difficult past  from those times when they were not yet human  scrabbling for survival among scaled monsters on the surface of their home world .  forced to live in night and darkness  fearing the light of day .  a bitter upbringing .      these inbred tendencies toward total disaster i have worked to avoid  and i have succeeded  at some cost to free human development .      the function of psychohistory is to actively constrain human growth and variation  until the species achieves its long delayed maturity .  klia asgar and her kind will breed with and train others  and humans will at long last learn to think in unison  to communicate efficiently .  together they may help overcome future mutations  even more powerful than themselves  destructive side effects of their immune response to robots .      there are real risks in such a strategy  risks you have fully and accurately recognized .  but the alternative is unthinkable .      if hari seldon does not finish his work  the disasters may begin again .  and this must not be allowed to happen .           .     all the arrangements had been made .  r .  daneel olivaw was prepared to render his final service to humanity .  yet to do this he would have to appear to an old and dear friend and offer him what was at most a partial truth to adjust his lifelong course .   then  he would have to suppress that friend   s memory  hiding his tracks as it were .  he had done this to others thousands of times before  and to hari seldon  a few times   but there was a peculiar melancholy to this particular moment  and daneel faced it with no enthusiasm .   on the last day in his oldest dwelling on trantor  the apartment high on an internal tower overlooking the ivory and steel structures of streeling university  his mentality  he still hesitated to use the term    mind     reserving that for human thought patterns  was troubled .  he refused to put a clear label on this sensation  but from below a word welled up that was  in the end  unavoidable .  grief .   daneel was finally  after more than twenty thousand years  grieving .  soon  he would have no use .  his human friend would die .  things would go on without them  humanity would lumber into its future  and while daneel would continue to exist  he would have no purpose .   hard as his existence had been these millennia  deep and complex as his history had flowed  he had always known he was doing what robots inevitably had been constructed to do  to serve human beings .   he had awarded lodovik with the honorific    human     not to convince the robot to come over to his side  the circumstances had changed and his arguments were compelling enough .  he could not guarantee that lodovik would agree  but strongly suspected he would  and daneel would proceed with his plan in any case .  lodovik was not key  though his presence would be useful .   but daneel could not call himself    human     whatever his service and his nature .  in his own judgment  daneel remained what he had always been  through so many physical changes and mental peregrinations .  he was a robot  nothing more .   his status as a mythic eternal meant little to him  it did not exalt him .   another  any of a million or a billion human historians  judging daneel on his long record  might have given him a place in history  a steely gray eminence  equal to that of any human leader  perhaps far greater .   but they knew nothing of daneel  and would render no such judgment .  only linge chen knew the salient details  and chen was  finally  too small a man to see this robot clearly .  chen cared little for the galaxy beyond his own lifetime .   hari knew much more  and was brilliant enough to place daneel   s contribution in perspective  yet daneel had actively forbidden him from spending much time thinking about robots .   the false sky mimicked sunset with a spottiness that seemed part of trantor   s nature now .  a mottled orange glow fell over daneel   s impassive face .  no human saw him  he had no need to contort his features to meet human expectations .   he turned from the window  and walked toward dors  who stood by the door .      are we going to see hari now .     she asked eagerly .      yes     daneel said .      will he be allowed to remember .     she asked .      not yet     daneel replied     but soon .           .     wanda frowned deeply .     i am very uncomfortable leaving him here alone     she told stettin as they left hari   s streeling apartment .      he won   t have it any other way     stettin said .      chen wants him alone  to assassinate him .         i don   t think so  somehow     stettin said .     chen could have had him killed a hundred  a thousand times .  now  he   s on record as condoning the encyclopedia  and hari is the patriarch .         i don   t think politics on trantor is ever that simple .         you have to believe what your grandfather   s predictions say .         why .     wanda asked sharply .     he doesn   t believe in them anymore .      the lift door opened and they stepped into the empty space  to drop less than five floors .  the landing was heavier than they expected  some maladjustment in the building   s grav fields .  wanda stepped from the exit on aching ankles .      i need to get away from here .     she lamented .     we   ve been waiting so long  a world of our own       but stettin shook his head  and wanda gazed at him in both irritation and anxiety that his doubts were justified .     what are the chances  do you think     he asked     that even if the project does go on  and the plan continues  we   ll ever really leave trantor .      wanda   s face flushed .     grandfather wouldn   t deceive me .  .  . us .  would he .         to keep a very important secret  and to push the project forward .     stettin pursed his lips together tightly .     i   m not so sure .           .     hari relaxed in his most comfortable chair in the small study .  he was becoming used to this new existence  this realization of failure .  he was glad for the visits of his granddaughter and her husband  but not for their wheedling attempts to    get me back on track     as he described it .   perhaps the most irritating thing about his new mental state was its unreliability  the interruption of mental peace by his continuing useless revision of certain minor elements in the equations of the plan .   something itched at the back of his mind  a realization that not all was lost  but it refused to come forward  and even worse  threatened to give him that which he least desired right now  hope .   the original first date for his recordings of the seldon crisis announcements had passed .  the studio where his voice and image would have been permanently stored in billennial vault memory was still available .  .  . times had been reserved at regular intervals throughout the next year and a half .   but if he kept missing recording dates .  the opportunity would soon pass  and he could finally stop feeling the least shred of guilt .   hari simply wanted to live his last few years  or however long he had  as a nonentity  unimportant  forgotten .   being forgotten would not take long .  trantor would manufacture other interests in a few days .  memory of the trial of the year would fade .  .  .        i don   t want to meet him     klia said to daneel .  they stood in the waiting room of seldon   s apartment block .     neither does brann .      brann seemed unwilling to be caught up in a debate .  he crossed his thick arms in front of him and looked for all the world like a genie in a child   s story .      plussix wanted me to change his mind .  .  .     klia said .  dors shot klia a surprisingly angry look  and klia turned away .  she   s a robot  i know she   s a robot .  how can she care what we do  what happens .     i wouldn   t have     she stammered .     i couldn   t have  but that was what they wanted me to do .  lodovik  kallusin      she took a deep breath .     i am so embarrassed .         we have discussed this     daneel said .     our decision has been made .      her mind itched .  she felt genuinely uncomfortable around the robots .     i just want to go somewhere safe with brann and be left alone     klia said softly  and she turned away from dors    accusing stare .      it is necessary for hari seldon to meet you face to face     daneel said patiently .      i don   t understand why .         that may be so  but it is necessary .     he held his hand out  directing them toward the lift .     a measure of freedom will follow for all of us  then .      klia shook her head in disbelief  but did as she was told  and brann  holding his opinions to himself for now  followed .   hari came out of a light doze and wandered groggily toward the door  half expecting to see wanda and stettin back for another pep talk .  the door display allowed him to observe the group of figures standing in the hall vestibule  a tall  handsome man of middle years  whom he almost immediately recognized as daneel  a burly dahlite male and slender  intense looking young woman  and another woman  hari backed away from the door display and closed his eyes .  it was not over .  he would never be his own man  history had him too firmly in its grip .      no dream     he said to himself     only a nightmare     but he felt a small surge both of anticipation and irritation .  he told himself he really did not want to see anybody  but the gooseflesh on his arms betrayed him .   he let the door slide open .      come in     he said  raising his eyebrows at daneel .     you might as well be a dream .  i know i   m going to forget this meeting as soon as you all leave .     daneel returned hari   s expression with a nod  businesslike as usual .  he would make a terrific trader in the big galactic combines  hari thought .  why do i feel affection for this machine .  sky knows   .  but it   s true  i am glad to see him .      you may remember now     daneel said .  and hari did remember all that had happened in the hall of dispensation .  vara liso   s death at the hands of lodovik trema .  .  . and this young girl and her large friend .   and the female who might have been  must have been .   dors .   he met the girl   s brief glance and nodded to her .  he hardly dared glance at the other woman .      they wanted me to discourage you     klia said in a small voice  staring around the front room with its small pieces of furniture  its stacks of bookfilms  the minor radiant  a miniature and less powerful version of yugo amaryl   s prime radiant  and his portraits of dors and raych and the grandchildren .  despite herself  she was impressed by the sense of order  the simplicity  the monkish austerity .     there wasn   t time  and i couldn   t have  anyway     she concluded .      i don   t know the details  but i thank you for your restraint     hari said .     it seems not to have been necessary  perhaps .     he braced himself  swallowed  and half turned toward the other woman .     we   ve met .  .  . here before  i think     he said  and swallowed again .  then he turned to daneel .     i must know .  i must not be made to forget .  you assigned me my love  my companion  daneel  as my friend  as my mentor  is this dors venabili .         i am     dors said  and stepping forward  she took hari   s hand in hers  squeezing it ever so gently  as had been her habit years ago .   she hasn   t forgotten .  hari held his free hand up to the ceiling  forming a fist  and his eyes filled with tears .  he shook his fist at the ceiling as brann and klia watched in embarrassment  seeing such an old man exhibit his emotions so openly .   even hari did not quite understand what his emotions were  rage  joy  frustration .  he lowered his arm and in one motion reached out to embrace dors  their hands still awkwardly clasped between them .  secret steel  gripping him so gently .     no dream     he murmured into her shoulder  and dors held him  feeling his aging body  so different from the mature hari .  she looked at daneel then  and her eyes were filled with resentment  her own anger  for hari was in pain  their presence was causing him pain  and she had been programmed above all other imperatives to prevent harm and pain coming to hari seldon .   daneel did not turn away from her stare .  he had endured worse conflicts with his robotic conscience  though this was near the top of any list .   but they were so close  and he would make it up to hari .      i have brought klia here to show you the future     daneel said .  klia sucked in her breath and shook her head  not understanding .   hari let go of dors and drew himself up  his formerly stooped posture straightening .  he gained fully three centimeters in height .      what can this young woman tell me .     he said .  he gestured to the furniture .     i forget my manners     he said stiffly .     please  make yourselves comfortable .  robots need not sit if they do not wish to .         i would love to sit here again  and relax with you     dors said  and lowered herself to the small chair beside him .     so many intense memories from this place .  i have missed you so .     she could not take her eyes off him .   hari smiled down on her .     the worst part is  i was never able to thank you .  you gave me so much  and i was never able to say farewell .     his hand patted her shoulder .  no gesture  no words  seemed adequate to this occasion .     but then  had you been .  .  . organic  i would not have you back with me now  would i .  however transitory the experience may be .      suddenly  the deep anger built up for decades came to a head and hari turned on daneel  pointed a finger into his chest .     get this done with .  be done with me .  do your work and make me forget  and leave me in peace .  do not torment me with your false flesh and steel bones and immortal thoughts .  i am mortal  daneel .  i don   t have your strength or your vision .         you see farther than any other in this room     daneel said .      no more .  my seeing is over .  i was wrong .  i   m as blind as any of the quadrillion little points in the equations .      klia backed away as far as she could from this old man with his deep  sharp eyes .  brann stood staring straight ahead  embarrassed  out of his class  out of his place .  klia reached for his hand and hugged his arm  to reassure him .  together they stood among the robots and the famous meritocrat  and klia defied anyone to think them the least of those present .      you were not wrong     daneel said .     there is a balance .  the plan is made stronger  but it must take some devious routes .  i think you will show us how  a few minutes from now .         you overestimate me  daneel .  this young woman  and her companion  and vara liso  represent a powerful force i can   t fold into the equations .  this upwelling of biology .  .  .         how do you differ from vara liso .     daneel asked klia .   brann   s nostrils flared and his face darkened .     i   ll answer that     he said .     they   re as different as night from day .  there isn   t a hateful bone in klia   s body          i wouldn   t go that far     klia said  but she was proud of his defense .      i mean it .  vara liso was a monster .     brann straightened his neck and thrust out his jaw belligerently  as if daring daneel to contradict him .      are you a monster  klia asgar .     hari asked  focusing on her with those deep and discerning eyes .   she did not turn away .  hari seldon clearly did not think she was his inferior .  there was something beyond respect in his gaze  there was a kind of intellectual terror .      i   m different     she said .   hari smiled wolfishly and shook his head in admiring wonder .     yes  indeed  you are that .  i think daneel will agree with me that we are done with robots for now  and you are proof of that .         i   m very uncomfortable around these robots     klia confirmed .      yet you worked with some  did you not .  with lodovik trema .     hari turned to daneel .  these suppositions and theories had been perking in his head  subconsciously  for days since the incident in the hall of dispensation .  daneel could stop the conscious access of memory  but he could not halt all the deep workings of hari   s mind .     he was a robot  wasn   t he  daneel .         yes     daneel said .      one of yours .         yes .         but  something went wrong .         yes .         he turned against you .  is he still against you .         i am learning  hari .  he has taught me much .  now it is time for you to teach me .  .  . once more .  show me what must be done .     daneel faced hari .      what happened to lodovik in space .     hari asked .  daneel explained .  then  told hari all that had happened with the calvinians  including the end of plussix and the knowledge of linge chen .      no more secrecy     hari mused .     those who need to know will know  all over the galaxy .  what can i tell you  daneel .  your work is done .         not yet  hari .  not until you find an answer to the problem .      dors spoke now .     there is a solution  hari .  i know there is  within your equations .         i am not an equation .     klia shouted .     i am not an aberration or a monster .  i just have certain abilities  and so does he .     she pointed to daneel .   hari considered with chin in hand .  the itch .  .  . so deeply buried  untraceable .  he clutched dors    shoulder  as if to draw strength from her .      we shed the metal     he said .     time to take charge  for ourselves  isn   t it  daneel .  and the time will come when psychohistory   s equations will merge with the equations of all minds  all people .  every individual will be a general example of the whole progress of the people .  they will blend .      young woman  you are not a monster .  you are the difficult future .      klia stared in puzzlement at hari .      you will have children  and they will have children .  .  . stronger than wanda and stettin  stronger than the mentalics we have working for us now .  something will happen  something unpredictable  that my equations can   t encompass  another and more successful mutation  a stronger vara liso .  i can   t put that into my equations  it is an unknown variable  an individual point  tyranny  all control radiating from one individual .      hari   s face had become almost luminous .      you .  .  .    he held his hand out to klia .     take this hand .  let me feel you .      she reluctantly reached out .      i need a little nudge  my young friend     hari said .     show me what you are .      almost without thinking  klia reached into his mind  saw a brightness there obscured by dark nebulosities  and with a gentle breath of persuasion  another sign of her returning strength  she blew the clouds away .   hari gasped and closed his eyes .  his head dropped to one shoulder .  he was suddenly more than merely tired .  he felt a great sense of release  and for the first time in decades  a knot in his mind  in his body as well  seemed to untie itself .  the brightness in his thoughts was not a way around his errors and the flaws in the equations  it was a deeper understanding of his own irrelevance  in the long term .   a thousand years from now  he would be a particle in the smooth flow once again  not his own kind of point tyranny .   dors got up from her chair  taking hold of his arm to help him stay on his feet .   his work would be forgotten .  the plan would serve its purpose and be swept away  merely one more hypothesis  guiding and shaping  but ultimately no more than another illusion among all the illusions of men  and robots .   what he had learned in his time fighting lamurk for the role of first minister  that the human race was its own kind of mind  its own self organizing system  with its own reserved knowledge and tendencies    meant that it could also direct its own evolution .  philosophies and theories and truths were morphological appurtenances .  discarded when no longer needed .  .  . when the morphology changed .   the robots had served their purpose .  now they would be rejected  shed  by humanity   s body social .  psychohistory would be shed as well  when its purpose had been served .  and hari seldon .   no man  no woman  no machine  no idea  could reign supreme forever .   hari opened his eyes .  they were as large as a child   s now .  he looked around the room  for a moment unable to distinguish people from furniture .  then his vision narrowed and focused .      thank you     hari said .     daneel was right .     he steadied himself against dors and  with his other hand  braced himself on the back of the chair .  it took him some time to order his thoughts .  he stared straight at klia asgar  and at brann beyond her .      my own ego stood before the solution .  your children will balance .  your genes and talents will spread .  there will be resolution of conflict .  .  . and the plan will continue .  but not my plan .  the future will see how wrong i can be .      your descendants  your many times great grandchildren  will correct me .      klia had seen deeper into hari than just the problem he faced .  with a little shudder  she stepped forward  and with dors  they lowered hari into the chair .     i was never told the truth about you     she said softly  reaching to touch his cheek .  the skin was fine and dry and powdery smooth  faintly resilient  with a ridge of hard bone beneath .  hari smelled clean and human  discipline overlying strength  if such things could be transferred by scent  and why not .  how could one see that someone had these traits  and not smell them  as well .  old  and frail  and still quite beautiful and strong .     you really are a great man .     she whispered .      no  my dear     hari said .     i am nothing  really .  and it is quite wonderful to be nothing  i assure you .           .        better late than never     gaal dornick told the technician as they watched professor seldon settle into his chair in the recording booth .      he seems tired     the technician said  and checked his gauges to make sure he had the proper settings for the voice of an old man .   hari consulted his papers  looking at the first point of major divergence within the equations .  he hummed softly to himself  then looked up  waiting for the signal to begin .  he was brightly illuminated  the studio beyond was dark  though he could see small lights twinkling in the recording booth .   three spherical lenses descended from above and hovered at a level with his chest .  he adjusted the blanket on his legs .  four days ago  he had told his colleagues  and in particular gaal dornick  that he had had a small stroke  and lost an entire day   s recollections .  they had bustled about him and insisted that he not strain himself .  so he wore this blanket .  he could hardly cough without being surrounded by concerned faces .   it was a small enough lie .  and he had mentioned to gaal that with the stroke had come a calm and peace he had never known before .  .  . and a determination to finish his work before death came finally .   he suspected word would get back to daneel .  somehow  his old friend and mentor would hear  and approve .   hari had felt the subtle workings of daneel   s persuasion  at the conclusion of the meeting with dors and klia asgar and brann .  for a moment  he had felt the memories fading  even as the group headed for the door  and dors had looked back upon him with an almost bitter and passionate regret .  and he had felt something else  bright and intense and impulsive  blocking daneel   s effort without the robot knowing .   it must have come from defiant klia  stronger than daneel  naturally resisting the manipulations of a robot  however well meaning .  and hari was grateful .  to remember clearly that meeting  and to know what would happen in a year or two .  .  . to remember daneel   s promise  delivered in private in hari   s bedroom  while the others waited outside  old friends having a final chat  that dors would be with him when her work was done  when his life was nearing its close .   she could not be with him now .  he was too much in the public eye .  the return of the tiger woman  or someone very like her  was not feasible .   but there was something else at work here as well .  hari knew that the time of the robots had come to an end  must come to an end  and he knew that it was very likely daneel would never completely let go of his task .  the same eternal concern and devotion that daneel felt for hari  to so gift him with the return of his great love  would eventually move him to interfere again .  .  .   so daneel must be kept in ignorance of some things  a difficult proposition at best .   together  wanda  stet tin  klia  and brann would see to it  however .  together  they were strong enough and subtle enough .      could you speak  please  professor seldon .     the technician asked from his position in the engineering booth .  gaal dornick stood beside him  barely visible from where hari sat .      i am hari seldon  old and full of years .        the technician flipped off the voice switch to the studio and looked up at gaal with some concern .     i hope he   s a little more cheerful when we begin in earnest .         you   re going to terminus  aren   t you .     gaal asked the man .      of course .  my family   s packed and ready to go .  do you think i   d be here if          have you ever met hari seldon before now .         never had the privilege     the man sniffed .     i   ve heard tales  of course .         he knows quite well what he   s doing  and what kind of figure to play .  never underestimate him     gaal said  and though that was inadequate warning or description  he stopped there  and pointed to the console .      right     the technician said  and focused on his equipment .     i   ll draw the curtain now and bring in the scramblers .  nobody will know what he   s saying besides himself .        hari tapped his finger lightly on the chair arm .  the lights on the spheres changed to amber  then to red .  he pushed himself up from the chair and stared into the darkness beyond  imagining faces  people  men and women  anxious to learn their fates .  well  most of the time  for a few occasions at least  he would be able to help .  the devil of it was  he did not know specifically when these little speeches would begin to be useless .   he would record only one message that day  the rest over the next year and a half  as each necessary nudge became clear within the adjusted equations .   with his most professorial air  quite confident and deliberate  hari began to speak .  he recorded a simple message to those of the second foundation  the psychologists and mathists  the mentalics who would train them and alter their germ lines  nothing very profound  merely a kind of pep talk .     to my true grandchildren     he said     i give my profoundest thanks and wish you luck .  you will never need to hear of an impending seldon crisis from me .  .  . you will never need anything so dramatic  for you know .  .  .      he had spoken to wanda the day before  telling her the final part of the puzzle of the second foundation .  at first  she had been disappointed  vastly  she had so wanted to get away from trantor  to start fresh on a new world  however barren .  but she had held up remarkably well .   and he had told her that daneel must never learn of the true whereabouts of the second foundation  of the mentalics who could resist all the efforts of the giskardian robots  should they ever return to take up the reins of secret power .   a few minutes and he was finished .   he pulled aside the blankets and draped them on the edge of the chair  then stood to leave .  the three lenses rose into the darkness above .   waiting for gaal to join him  hari wondered if death would be a robot .  how problematical for a robot it would be to bring both comfort and an end to a human master .  he saw a large  smooth  black skinned robot  infinitely cautious and caring  serving him and driving him to the last .   the thought made him smile .  would that the universe could ever be so caring and so gentle .        .     dors embraced klia and brann  then turned to lodovik .      i wish i could send a duplicate of myself with you     she told him     and experience what you will experience     she said .   beyond their fenced platform  the small trading ship of mors planch  glittering with recent maintenance  rested in its cradle .      you would be most useful to us     lodovik said .   klia looked around the long aisle of ships in the spaceport terminal  and asked     he isn   t coming to see us off .         hari .     dors asked  unsure whom she meant .      daneel     klia said .      i don   t know where he is  now     dors said .     he   s long had the habit of coming and going without telling anyone what he   s up to .  his work is done .         i find that hard to believe     klia said  and her face reddened .  she did not wish to sound like a hypocrite .     i mean .  .  .      brann nudged her gently with his forearm .   mors planch stepped forward .  lodovik still made him uneasy .  well  they would be traveling a great distance together once more .  and why should he worry especially about lodovik  when their ship would carry some fifty humaniform robots  temporarily asleep  and the severed heads of many more .  a wealth of fearful riches .  and his ticket to freedom  as well .     i was told to confirm our route with you  in case there were last minute changes .      he took out a pocket informer and displayed the route to dors .  four jumps  over        light years  to kalgan  a world of pleasure and entertainment for the galaxy   s elite  where they  so the informer said  would drop off klia and brann .  then  thirty seven individual jumps         light years to eos  where lodovik would disembark with the robots and the head of giskard .   dors studied the travel chart briefly .     still correct     she said .   lodovik asked     will you be going to terminus .         no     dors said .     nor to star   s end  wherever that might be .         you   re staying here     lodovik surmised .      i am .      klia said     i   ve read about the tiger woman .  so hard to believe that was really you .  you   re staying  for hari .         i will be here for him at the end .  it is my highest and best purpose .  i would not be much good for anything else .         will daneel let him remember  this time .     klia asked  and bit her lower lip  nervous at such presumption .      so it has been promised     dors said .     i will have my time with him .         and until that time .     lodovik asked  perfectly aware that for humans  this would be a rude and intrusive question .      that will be for me to decide     dors said .      not for daneel .      dors regarded him directly  intently .      do you believe daneel is finished .         no     dors said quietly .      i cannot believe he is finished  either  or that he is done with you .         you have your opinions  of course .  as any human should .      lodovik caught the implication  the edge of resentment .     daneel regards you as human     lodovik said .     does he not .         he does .  is that an honor  or a curse .      without waiting for an answer  she turned to go .   minutes later  from the observation deck looking out over the spaceport  she heard the low rumble and roar of the departing hypership  and looked up briefly to watch its course .   wanda was none too happy at first to be escorting the young woman and her large mate from the spaceport terminal .  nor was she comfortable about this elaborate deception  who  after all  was grandfather expecting to watch them .  demerzel .   nothing had turned out as she hoped  and now to be nursemaid for a potential monster .  but stettin took it all stoically enough  and was well along on striking up a friendship with brann .   klia asgar was another matter .  wanda thought her entirely too moody  but then  so much had changed in the young woman   s life in the past week  so many situations had been reversed  and she had taken charge in such a fortuitous and insightful way .  .  .   perhaps there was something essential and useful in hari   s last minute insight and change of plan .  to abandon star   s end and the wonderful difficulties of being pioneers  for the inglorious task of hiding out for centuries  and watching the empire collapse into ruins  riding out the fall of trantor  the bitter decades  for their children and grandchildren to endure not only endless discipline and training  but the meanest and most horrible centuries in history .  .  .   had grandfather decided all this at the last minute  or had he known all along .  hari seldon had depths and stratagems it was best not to think about  she decided .  would he manipulate his own granddaughter  keep her in the dark  surprise and dismay her .   obviously .  .  .      i don   t know how to thank you     klia said to wanda as they climbed into the chartered taxi .  she adjusted her concealing hood  then attended to brann   s .      for what .     wanda asked .      for putting up with an out of control little brat     klia said .   wanda could not help but laugh .     are you reading my mind  dear .     she asked  not sure herself what tone she intended .      no     klia said .     i wouldn   t do that .  i   m learning .         aren   t we all     stettin said  and wanda looked to her husband with a chastened respect .  he had stayed so quiet during her private rants  then had gently and reasonably explained hari   s intricate new plan .      i think we   ll .  .  . learn to rely on each other  very closely     wanda said .      i   d love that     klia said .  her eyes glittered under the hood  and wanda realized that they were filled with tears .  she could feel the wash of need from the young woman  still little more than a girl  actually .   and how would that be  to have this mentalic female start regarding her as a mother .   she reached out and took klia   s hand .     not that it will be easy     she said .     but .  .  . we   ll win  in the end .         of course     klia said  her voice trembling .     that   s what hari  what professor seldon plans .  i look forward so much to learning from you .      their children and grandchildren would twine their genes  and the psychologists of the second foundation could study and come to understand persuasion  could utilize it more efficiently .  by breeding and by research  they would be creating a race that would withstand centuries of adversity  and rise to conquer .  .  . secretly  quietly .   an anodyne against unexpected mutations  hidden far from the first foundation  and away from the robots .   and how in sky would she explain this to the psychologists  the mathists  who had already fought against the inclusion of the mentalics .   they will help keep us secret during the hard times to come .  well  maybe she was up to the task of reconciling all these disparate talents .  she had better be .   if grandfather was right  the two most important human beings in the galaxy were now in wanda   s care .  wanda turned away from klia  her own eyes moist  and caught a look from brann in the seat opposite .  slow  large  with secret depths  the burly dahlite nodded solemnly and peered out the semi silvered window .      i   m very confused     mors planch said as the acceleration eased and the ship   s artificial gravity came into play .     who   s deceiving whom .  how can you believe daneel won   t find out .  how do you know he didn   t plan for the youngsters to stay here all along .         it is not my concern     lodovik said .      will you tell him  on eos .         no     lodovik said .      won   t he just know .         he will not learn from me     lodovik said .      why not .      lodovik smiled  and said no more .  then  within his positronic pathways  the requested blankness of certain knowledge began to build .  the forgetfulness of klia asgar would soon envelop him .  new memories would come into play  of arriving on bright  gay kalgan and putting the two young humans into the charge of agents of the future second foundation .  he would become part of a false trail  to deceive any who might come after them .   at the last  he had followed his insight  his newfound instinct  provoked by voltaire  to the letter .  and if daneel does know  then he will not oppose what is set in place  because he trusts the instincts of hari seldon .      well  it   s just you and me  old friend     mors said with an edge in his voice .     what should we talk about this time .          epilogue        i have been dreaming  perhaps      joan said .      me  too      voltaire said .     what did you dream of .         very painful things .  of an arrow in my neck and a brick striking my head .         your historical traumas  before the flames .  i myself dreamed of dying      voltaire said .     are you together yet .         not yet .  not all of the backups have located our new centers .  she nearly destroyed us .     joan said angrily .      she was made to destroy us      voltaire said .     to her very core  she despised all minds not human .          but      a momentary panic .     you say she despised .  .  .         yes .  she is dead now .          what of the others  the children who were working with the calvinians  the ones you were helping .     joan asked .      they have left trantor  last i heard .          has it all been resolved  then .         our argument  my dearest  or          don   t call me that  you godless          shhh      voltaire attempted to soothe  with no success .      the voices tell me i have been seduced by a master  a master liar .         who can argue with such revelations .  let us decide to disagree  even should it be forever      voltaire said .      i will say i did not feel comfortable apart from you .  encoded in the warps and weft of space  imposed upon plasmas and fields of energy like a spider riding a web  i wandered with the wraiths  supped on their diffuse energy feasts  observed their decadent societies  mated and danced .  .  . how like the ancien regime it all was  yet bloodless  predictable  angelic .  i missed the perversity  the femininity  the humanity .         how flattering  that you miss my perversity .          in boredom i followed the trails of human ships  and came upon a vessel in distress  tossed by the storm of a dying star .  and within  i found a mechanical human being  weakened by circumstance  besieged by particles my hosts had taught me to regard as very tasty .  .  . a marvelous opportunity .         a chance for you to interfere with a vulnerable spirit .          spirit .  perhaps .  .  . so much unexpressed need for approval  for fulfillment .         like a child  for you to bend and distort .         i found a seed of freedom  very subtle .  i merely watered it with a retunneled electron or two  a positronic pathway shunted from here to here .  .  . i helped the particles do what they might have done anyway  had he broken his programmed chains .          a devil   s sleight of handlessness      loan said  but not without some admiration .     you have always been clever that way .          i did nothing a good god would not approve of .  i allowed free will to blossom .  do not be harsh with me  maid .  i will be civil  if you allow me my foibles .  perhaps it is more interesting that way .          i hardly worry about your sins anymore      loan said .     after what happened  when that horrible woman .  .  .     the equivalent of a shudder     i fear we may both face dissolution again  the loss of our very souls .  after all  we are not human .  .  .      voltaire interrupted this line of reasoning  which still disturbed him .      nobody knows we are here .  we were blown apart  they felt us die .  they have their own concerns now .  we are irrelevant ghosts who never truly lived .  but if robots can become human .  .  . then why not we  my love .  we will not haunt the mesh forever .      joan absorbed this without replying for several millionths of a second .  then  in their deeply buried matrix  concealed in the depths of a machine designed to keep constant track of the daily accumulation of wealth on trantor  she felt the last segments of her stored self rejoin with the hastily saved fragments of her last moments with daneel in the hall of dispensation .      there      she said .      i am together .  i say again  what of those issues unresolved  the decidability of the fate of humankind  the success of the blessed hari seldon .         the larger issues appear to be in flux once more      voltaire said dryly .      no final judgments .         do you mean the judgment of the vast nobodaddy  the nothing father of your delusions  or the mechanical man you have lusted after these past scores of years .      joan dismissed the tone and the implications with a precise iciness .     god speaks through our deeds  and  of course  through me .  whatever my origins  i maintain the pattern of his voice .         of course .         daneel .  .  .         determines nothing  and is lost without humanity .         no outcome  then     she said  disappointed .      are you afraid of how it will all turn out  my dear .     voltaire asked .      i am afraid of not being there when it is resolved .  these strong minded children .  .  . if they learned of us  they would hate us  perhaps strive to destroy us for good .          they have other concerns  and will never know about us      voltaire said .     they have a great deception to play .  i have been investigating while you yet knitted your selves together .          and what did you learn .      voltaire suddenly realized there was wisdom in keeping his counsel  else perhaps joan would go to daneel and tell all .  he would never be able to trust her completely  how could he love her so .      i have learned that linge chen is completely in the dark     he said .     and i suppose he does not actually care .         hari felt such contempt for linge chen     joan said .      there could not be two more opposite humans .      joan stretched until she filled their still limited thought space  voluptuously enjoying her fresh reintegration .     it is holy to be one     she said .      with me .      for a time  joan did not reply .  then  with something like a sigh  she accepted his closeness .  the two wove an old world around them  like a cocoon  to while away the long centuries until there would be answers .     from a maintenance tower overlooking streeling and the oceans of sleep  dream  and peace  still open and glowing with an exuberance of decaying algae  daneel watched the ship captained by mors planch rise above the domed surface of trantor until it vanished in the thick layer of clouds .   soon  he would go to eos as well  though not by way of kalgan .  but he wanted to return for hari  at the end .  daneel  if such was possible  had always felt a special regard for hari .   daneel   s face formed an expression of puzzlement and sadness  without his directly willing the change .  the expression came unbidden  and with a start  he realized it .  perhaps what he had said to lodovik now applied to him .  if  after twenty thousand years  he was to become human .  .  .   he smoothed those features  that expression  returning his face to calm alertness .   i will never be quite done with humans  he told himself .  but i must stand back  for the time being  and resist my drive to render assistance  this much lodovik has taught me .  they have exceeded my capacity  so many hundreds of billions .  keeping the chaos worlds in check has only kept humanity safe until now .  i must study and learn .  it is clear that humanity will soon undergo another transformation .  .  . the strong mentalics point to a kind of birth .   perhaps i can help ease that birth .  then i will be done at last .  daneel could not ignore the contradictions  nor could he escape them .  dors had her mission  the job that defined her  and he had always had his mission .   only one thing was certain .   never again would he play the roles he had once played .  demerzel and all those who had gone before were dead .
