 london  charles tilt  fleet street  and mustapha syried  constantinople  mdcccxxxix  warning to the public  concerning  the loving ballad of lord bateman .   in some collection of old english ballads there is an ancient ditty which i am told bears some remote and distant resemblance to the following epic poem .  i beg to quote the emphatic language of my estimable friend  if he will allow me to call him so   the black bear in piccadilly  and to assure all to whom these presents may come  that   i  am the original .   this affecting legend is given in the following pages precisely as i have frequently heard it sung on saturday nights  outside a house of general refreshment  familiarly termed a wine vaults  at battle bridge .  the singer is a young gentleman who can scarcely have numbered nineteen summers  and who before his last visit to the treadmill  where he was erroneously incarcerated for six months as a vagrant  being unfortunately mistaken for another gentleman   had a very melodious and plaintive tone of voice  which  though it is now somewhat impaired by gruel and such a getting up stairs for so long a period  i hope shortly to find restored .  i have taken down the words from his own mouth at different periods  and have been careful to preserve his pronunciation  together with the air to which he does so much justice .  of his execution of it  however  and the intense melancholy which he communicates to such passages of the song as are most susceptible of such an expression  i am unfortunately unable to convey to the reader an adequate idea  though i may hint that the effect seems to me to be in part produced by the long and mournful drawl on the last two or three words of each verse .   i had intended to have dedicated my imperfect illustrations of this beautiful romance to the young gentleman in question .  as i cannot find  however  that he is known among his friends by any other name than  the tripe skewer   which i cannot but consider as a soubriquet  or nick name  and as i feel that it would be neither respectful nor proper to address him publicly by that title  i have been compelled to forego the pleasure .  if this should meet his eye  will he pardon my humble attempt to embellish with the pencil the sweet ideas to which he gives such feeling utterance .  and will he believe me to remain his devoted admirer   george cruikshank .   p . s .   the above is not my writing  nor the notes either  nor am i on familiar terms  but quite the contrary  with the black bear .  nevertheless i admit the accuracy of the statement relative to the public singer whose name is unknown  and concur generally in the sentiments above expressed relative to him .    illustration   signature  george cruikshank     illustration  musical score   the loving ballad of lord bateman .   i .   lord bateman vos a noble lord   a noble lord of high degree   he shipped his self all aboard of a ship   some foreign country for to see .      for the

then in passion flew   and broke his sword in splinters three      saying   i vill give half my father s land  if so be as sophia    has crossed the sea .    xix .   then up and spoke this young bride s mother   who never vos heerd to speak so free       sayin   you ll not forget my ounly darter   if so be as sophia has crossed the sea .     illustration  lord bateman  his other bride  and his favorite domestic  with all their hearts so full of glee .    xx .    o it s true i made a bride of your darter   but she s neither the better nor the vorse for me   she came to me with a horse and saddle   but she may go home in a coach and three .    xxi .   lord bateman then prepared another marriage   with both their hearts so full of glee   saying   i vill roam no more to foreign countries  now that sophia has crossed the sea .        the end .   notes .    footnote     some foreign country for to see .   the reader is here in six words artfully made acquainted with lord bateman s character and temperament .   of a roving  wandering  and unsettled spirit  his lordship left his native country  bound he knew not whither .  some foreign country he wished to see  and that was the extent of his desire  any foreign country would answer his purpose  all foreign countries were alike to him .  he was a citizen of the world  and upon the world of waters  sustained by the daring and reckless impulses of his heart  he boldly launched .  for anything  from pitch and toss upwards to manslaughter  his lordship was prepared .  lord bateman s character at this time  and his expedition  would appear to have borne a striking resemblance to those of lord byron .   his goblets brimmed with every costly wine   and all that mote to luxury invite .   without a sigh he left to cross the brine   and traverse paynim shores  and pass earth s central line .   childe harold  canto i .     footnote     this turk he had   c .   the poet has here  by that bold license which only genius can venture upon  surmounted the extreme difficulty of introducing any particular turk  by assuming a fore gone conclusion in the reader s mind  and adverting in a casual  careless way to a turk unknown  as to an old acquaintance .   this turk he had    we have heard of no turk before  and yet this familiar introduction satisfies us at once that we know him well .  he was a pirate  no doubt  of a cruel and savage disposition  entertaining a hatred of the christian race  and accustomed to garnish his trees and vines with such stray professors of christianity as happened to fall into his hands .   this turk he had    is a master stroke  a truly shakspearian touch .  there are few things like it in the language .     footnote      and every holth she drunk unto him  vos   i vish lord bateman as you vos mine .     a most affecting illustration of the sweetest simplicity  the purest artlessness  and holiest affections of woman s gentle nature .  bred up among the rough and savage crowds which thronged her father s lawless halls  and meeting with no responsive or kindred spirit among those fierce barbarians  many of whom  however  touched by her surpassing charms  though insensible to her virtues and mental endowments  had vainly sought her hand in marriage   this young creature had spent the greater part of her life in the solitude of her own apartments  or in contemplating the charms of nature arrayed in all the luxury of eastern voluptuousness .  at length she hears from an aged and garrulous attendant  her only female adviser  for her mother died when she was yet an infant   of the sorrows and sufferings of the christian captive .  urged by pity and womanly sympathy  she repairs to his prison to succour and console him .  she supports his feeble and tottering steps to her father s cellar  recruits his exhausted frame with copious draughts of sparkling wine  and when his dim eye brightens  and his pale cheek becomes flushed with the glow of returning health and animation  she  unaccustomed to disguise or concealment  and being by nature all openness and truth  gives vent to the feelings which now thrill her maiden heart for the first time  in the rich gush of unspeakable love  tenderness  and devotion    i vish lord bateman as you vos mine .     footnote      oh  in sevin long years i ll make a wow   i ll make a wow  and i ll keep it strong  .   love has converted the tender girl into a majestic heroine  she cannot only make  a wow   but she can  keep it strong   she feels all the dignity of truth and love swelling in her bosom .  with the view of possessing herself of the real state of lord bateman s affections  and with no sordid or mercenary motives  she has enquired of that nobleman what are his means of subsistence  and whether all northumberland belongs to him .  his lordship has rejoined  with a noble regard for truth  that half northumberland is his  and that he will give it freely to the fair young lady who will release him from his dungeon .  she  being thus assured of his regard and esteem  rejects all idea of pecuniary reward  and offers to be a party to a solemn wow  to be kept strong on both sides  that  if for seven years he will remain a bachelor  she  for the like period  will remain a maid .  the contract is made  and the lovers are solemnly contracted .     footnote      now sevin long years is gone and past   and fourteen days vell known to me .    in this may be recognised  though in a minor degree  the same gifted hand that portrayed the mussulman  the pirate  the father  and the bigot  in two words .  the time is gone  the historian knows it  and that is enough for the reader .  this is the dignity of history very strikingly exemplified .     footnote      avay and avay vent this proud young porter   avay and avay and avay vent he .    nothing perhaps could be more ingeniously contrived to express the vastness of lord bateman s family mansion than this remarkable passage .  the proud young porter had to thread courts  corridors  galleries  and staircases innumerable  before he could penetrate to those exquisite apartments in which lord bateman was wont to solace his leisure hours  with the most refined pleasures of his time .  we behold him hastening to the presence of his lord  the repetition of the word  avay  causes us to feel the speed with which he hastens  at length he arrives .  does he appear before the chief with indecent haste .  is he described as rushing madly into his presence to impart his message .  no .  a different atmosphere surrounds that remarkable man .  even this proud young porter is checked in his impetuous career which lasted only  until he came to lord bateman s chamber   vere he vent down on his bended knee .   lord bateman s eye is upon him  and he quails .     footnote     vot news .  vot news .  my proud young porter .   a pleasant condescension on the part of his lordship  showing that he recognised the stately youth  and no less stately pride of office which characterized his follower  and that he was acquainted with the distinguishing appellation which he appears to have borne in the family .     footnote     and broke his sword in splinters three .   exemplifying  in a highly poetical and striking manner  the force of lord bateman s love  which he would seem to have kept strong as his  wow .   we have beheld him patient in confinement  descending to no base murmurings against fortune  even when chained by the middle to a tree  with the prospect of ending his days in that ignominious and unpleasant position .  he has borne all this and a great deal more  seven years and a fortnight have elapsed  and  at last  on the mere mention of the fair young lady  he falls into a perfect phrenzy  and breaks his sword  the faithful partner and companion of his glory  into three splinters .  antiquarians differ respecting the intent and meaning of this ceremony  which has been construed and interpreted in many different ways .  the strong probability is that it was done  for luck   and yet lord bateman should have been superior to the prejudices of the vulgar .     footnote     if my own sophia .   so called doubtless from the mosque of st .  sophia  at constantinople  her father having professed the mahomedan religion .     footnote       then up and spoke this young bride s mother   who never vos heerd to speak so free .    this is an exquisite touch of nature  which most married men  whether of noble or plebeian blood  will quickly recognise .  during the whole of her daughter s courtship  the good old lady had scarcely spoken  save by expressive smiles and looks of approval .  but now that her object is gained  and her daughter fast married  as she thinks   she suddenly assumes quite a new tone   and never was heerd to speak so free .   it would be difficult for poetry to comprehend any thing more strictly true and life like than this .     footnote      with both their hearts so full of glee .   if any thing could add to the grace and beauty of the poem  it would be this most satisfactory and agreeable conclusion .  at the time of the foreign lady s arrival on the shores of england  we find lord bateman in the disagreeable dilemma of having contracted another marriage  to which step his lordship has doubtless been impelled by despair of ever recovering his lost sophia  and a natural anxiety not to die without leaving an heir to his estate .  the ceremony has been performed  the church has done its office  the bride and her mamma have taken possession of the castle  when the lost sophia suddenly presents herself .  an ordinary man would have been overwhelmed by such a complication of perplexities  not so lord bateman .  master of the human heart  he appeals to feminine ambition and love of display  and  reminding the young lady that she came to him on a saddle horse  with her revered parent following no doubt on foot behind   offers to bestow upon her a coach and three .  the young lady closes with the proposition  her august mother  having brought it about by her freedom of speech  makes no objection  lord bateman  being a nobleman of great power  and having plenty of superfluous wealth to bestow upon the church  orders another marriage  and boldly declares the first one to be a nullity .  thereupon  another marriage  is immediately prepared  and the piece closes with a picture of general happiness and hilarity .       end of the project gutenberg ebook the loving ballad of lord bateman     this file should be named       . txt or       .
