when i was little .       special thanks in the writing of this novel are due to michael d .  toman  ricia mainhardt  john betancourt  and byron preiss .            r .  hunter sat in the chair of mojave center governor  in the governor robot   s office  considering his next move .  the office was located in the underground desert city called mojave center .  hunter was the new  specially designed humaniform robot who had recently been finished and programmed according to the specifications of the governor robot oversight committee .   the scientists on the oversight committee had created hunter to find and return mojave center governor .  one of six experimental governor robots designed to run complete  self contained cities like mojave center  mojave center governor was missing .  in his absence  the city computer and individual positronic robots had taken over his responsibilities .   the other five experimental governor robots had malfunctioned at approximately the same time  suggesting a basic design flaw .  since mojave center governor was the only exception  the committee members wanted to study him as part of their investigation of the problem .  to avoid being taken apart  mc governor had fled .   each of the governor robots could divide at will into six component humaniform robots .  one of the component robots who comprised mc governor now stood motionless  shut down  in one corner of the office .  hunter and his team of three humans had brought him back from the distant past .  the other five had also chosen to hide in earlier times .   for the last several minutes  hunter had been monitoring the news through his internal receiver .      a nuclear explosion on the southern coast of jamaica yesterday continues to pile up casualties     said the announcer .     fatalities are estimated in the hundreds of thousands  and within the next few hours  tidal waves will strike the coasts of other islands throughout the caribbean .  over the coming week  these tidal waves are expected to strike heavily populated areas in haiti  puerto rico  many other islands  and the coasts of central and south america  causing incalculable destruction .  little time remains for emergency measures to prevent even more flooding and the suffering that will follow .  .  .  .      hunter shut off the reception .  the extent of the disaster was clear .  he had a lot of work ahead to prevent that explosion .   first hunter had to brief the committee on his progress through a conference call that was linked to him through the mojave center city computer .      good day     said hunter  as the four familiar human faces of the governor robot oversight committee appeared on his internal video screen .   the committee members greeted him with eager anticipation .      you have good news  i hope .     dr .  redfield  a tall  slender blonde  spoke first .     what have you learned .  have you located mc governor already .         part of him     said hunter  responding with precise accuracy .      part of him     professor post repeated thoughtfully .  he stroked his pointed  black beard .     i take this to mean  then  that mc governor divided into his component robots before your team could apprehend him .         yes  that is correct     said hunter .     however  we have apprehended mc    the first gestalt robot  and returned him safely here .         that was fast     said dr .  chin  surprised .  she was the short  pretty chinese american with long  black hair .     where did you find mc   .      hunter hesitated  at least by his fast robotic standards .  he and his team of human colleagues had followed mc   back in time to the late cretaceous period of prehistory using a modified device in mojave center .  they had found mc   in a forest full of dinosaurs .   the reality of time travel was a revolutionary discovery  hunter did not want to mention it casually  without considering the long term effects such a device might have on humans .  the other members of the team had agreed to keep the secret until he chose to reveal it .  any significant action in the past might change human history in the present  creating unimaginable harm to people .  the first law of the three laws of robotics that governed all robots    behavior said     a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .      for the present  hunter decided not to reveal the existence of the time travel device .      we found mc   in alberta  canada     hunter said simply .  his statement was true  the event just happened to have occurred many millions of years in the past .      shouldn   t you be looking for the others there  too .     dr .  chin asked .      no     said hunter .     our information is not complete  but the other component robots appear to have separated .         i don   t understand something     said dr .  khanna  in his hindi accent .     you captured mc   very quickly  considering that he was in alberta and you were assigned to the task only yesterday .  now you have returned to mojave center already .  how did you manage to work so efficiently .         i have a very capable team     said hunter cautiously .  they had returned to the present only a short time after they had left  though they had actually spent several long  difficult days in the past trying to capture mc   .  so to anyone in the present  they had not been gone from mojave center very long at all .     however  chad mora has completed his work for me .  i will need a replacement for him  this time a specialist in the history of the caribbean .         please give us a report on your first mission     said dr .  khanna .      i would prefer to give you a complete report on concluding my assignment     said hunter .      i think if we are expected to continue hiring assistants for you  we can require a report at this stage     said dr .  khanna  raising one eyebrow .      i remind you that i am not a human seeking to keep a job     said hunter .     i can work most efficiently with a team of human experts .  you may decide how much efficiency you are willing to allow me .         all right  hold it     said dr .  chin .     i think we can wait for a complete report .  the important thing is to get mc governor back in one piece .      dr .  khanna shrugged  frowning .      how is the rest of your team .     dr .  redfield asked .     everyone worked out  i assume .         yes     said hunter .     the roboticist  jane maynard  is definitely a help .  steve chang  our general assistant  has a range of pragmatic experience that i and the more highly educated specialists simply lack .  no amount of library data accessible to me can substitute for their combined contributions .  they are still here in mojave center and will continue working with me .         even so     said dr .  khanna .     i don   t understand exactly how you are conducting your search .         i don   t think it matters     said professor post .     since mc governor has divided into his components  the assignment we gave hunter is now six times as difficult .  the fact that he succeeded so quickly with the first part of it convinces me that his judgment is sound .         i agree     said dr .  redfield .     i can wait for your report too .         so can i     said professor post .      very well     said dr .  khanna .  hunter was relieved .  if they had given him direct orders  he would have had no choice but to obey them .  the second law of robotics was      a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     he also decided not to report to the committee that dr .  wayne nystrom had appeared on the scene  trying to get control of mc   before hunter could .  if the committee members knew more  they might change their minds and try to participate more directly after all .      tell you what     said dr .  redfield .     we will authorize you to make direct contact with the new assistant you need to hire  instead of giving us the list as you did last time .  have this individual contact us for financial arrangements .  is this acceptable .         yes     said hunter .     thank you .  is there anything else .         can you give us an estimated time of completion .     dr .  khanna asked .      no     said hunter .     after completing the call  hunter paused to consider what he had done .  that final answer to the committee was not entirely true .  if the time travel in all the future missions turned out as well as it had in the first mission  he could estimate completion in five days .  the team could accomplish that by returning from each mission the same day they left  no matter how long the missions took in the past .  however  a five day estimate might further trigger dr .  khanna   s curiosity .   furthermore  hunter was not sure how to give them a suitable final report without revealing the use of time travel .  at the moment  in his own mind  he was just barely able to justify not giving the committee an estimated time of completion .  he had decided that if dr .  khanna placed obstacles in his way  it would interfere with his ability to prevent harm to humans as a result of potential changes the robots might bring about in the course of history .  that interpretation of the first law could be debated  but it had allowed him to avoid giving the estimate .   hunter had the city computer use its access to employment agencies and lists of scholars to find a historian .  most of them  of course  were not technically available  the best ones were employed in schools or research centers  or pursuing independent projects of their own .  however  time travel altered the possibilities a great deal .   hunter now realized that he would in all likelihood bring his team back to the present only a few moments after they had left  just as he had last time .  that meant anyone who was willing and able to travel to mojave center and back home the same day would have enough time for the job .  the fee was considerable  especially for a task that would not take any time from their other commitments .  some danger would exist  of course  but with hunter leading the team  the first law would require him to give as much protection as a very large  powerful  state of the art robot could provide .   the immediate problem was persuading anyone of this without revealing the secret of time travel prematurely .   as soon as he had a short list of candidates  he began calling them .  within an hour  he hired a historian named rita chavez  who specialized in the history of the caribbean during the period that hunter   s team would visit  the year      .  she arranged to fly immediately from her home in miami to the landing facility on the ground above mojave center .   hunter had remained vague  however  about the details of the job .  instead  he had told her that she could still cancel her commitment after she had heard the details in person .  the argument that she would receive a substantial fee without missing much more than her travel time to and from mojave center had clearly made an impression on her .   hunter checked the time .  jane and steve had been in need of a complete dinner and a good night   s sleep after their trip back to the late cretaceous period .  he estimated that they were still asleep in their hotel rooms .  by the time they woke up  rita would probably have arrived .   as a robot  he had no need of rest as such  solar converters blended into his skin energized him when he was exposed to sunlight .  inside  of course  he could simply plug into the city   s power grid if necessary .  while he waited  he decided to gather new data and review the situation .      city computer     said hunter  through his radio link .     please locate and present all data relevant to jamaica in      .  i will review it and copy selected portions .         acknowledged     said the city computer .   hunter knew that this kind of quick research could not replace the advanced expertise rita would bring .  still  he wanted to know as much as he could .  when the information was available  he transferred it to his own memory .   the ongoing challenge in hunter   s mission  of course  was that mojave center   s component robots were motivated by the third law of robotics     a robot must protect his own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .     the component robots were afraid that when the committee had reassembled them into mojave center governor  the governor robot would be permanently dismantled and destroyed .  they were physically small in stature  but they had their robotic intelligence and humaniform shapes to help them hide among humans .   shortly before rita   s vtol jet was due to arrive  hunter received a call through his internal link .      r .  hunter .  this is the city computer calling .         acknowledged     said hunter .      i have a conference call from steve and jane for you .         patch them through .         hey  hunter .  where are you .  still in mojave center somewhere .     steve asked cheerfully .      morning  hunter     said jane .      greetings     said hunter .     i am waiting for the new member of our team .  she should arrive soon and i want to introduce you immediately .         you have completed your sleep courses in english and spanish of the     s .         si     said steve .      i   m hungry     said jane .     let   s meet in a restaurant .  bring her down .         where shall we meet .         debbie   s diner .  jane and i already decided .  it   s on a side street called foursquare .         we will meet you there     said hunter .     bye .         okay .      hunter saw that the time had come to meet rita .  normally  citizens would ride the slidewalks to travel through each level of mojave center .  hunter wanted privacy with her  however  and used his link to the city computer to commandeer a security vehicle .  a security robot brought the electric vehicle to hunter at mc governor   s office and turned it over to him .  hunter drove it up to the city terminal  in the top level of the city .   hunter met rita chavez and introduced himself .  rita  who was short  slender  and dark haired  wore a gray business suit and had a reserved  professional demeanor .  they climbed into the vehicle and hunter began the drive down to the restaurant .  he used his radio link to warn robots ahead that they were approaching as he drove .  only the presence of human pedestrians required his ringing the melodic warning tone .      when we spoke earlier     said rita     you declined to explain the entire job over the phone .  what are you paying me to do .      hunter looked around .  no one was nearby .     all right .  but i must have your agreement that you will keep this confidential .  a scientific development of grave importance is involved .         but you   re willing to trust me with it .         i require your help .         all right     said rita .     i agree not to reveal your secret .      hunter omitted the scientific details  but told her about the time travel sphere .  then he gave her a quick explanation of the previous mission and what he could predict about the next one .      i   m amazed .     rita stared at him in shock .     your entire team has already been to the time of dinosaurs .         that is right .         hunter  i have to ask you something .  i agreed to keep this secret and i will .  but several people already know  including the man who preceded me and also this dr .  nystrom you just told me about .  someone is going to start talking sooner or later .  it   s just too exciting to keep quiet forever .  what will you do then .         i must confine my focus for now     said hunter .     only reproducible evidence matters in a scientific conclusion  so a small amount of early talk will not prove anything .  i have the bohung institute secure at the moment .  no    matter how long we have to chase component robots in the past  i hope to complete the search for mc governor very soon  in real time counted from his initial disappearance .         then what will you do about keeping this secret .         i have not yet decided .  i also prefer not to discuss it further now .  the first law will govern my actions .         i see .     her tone was cool and professional  revealing little of her opinion .   hunter drove in silence for several moments .      you told me you need my expertise as a historian regarding jamaica in          said rita .     but how do you know that mc   will be in jamaica at that time .         i took the information from the device the component robots used to flee     said hunter .     but there is more .  when they fled  they miniaturized themselves to microscopic size .  the process made some of their atoms unstable .  the time travel altered that miniaturization so that it is temporary .  according to my calculations  mc   will return to normal size on a certain day in      .  we certainly cannot locate him before that  but i want to catch him as soon as possible .  otherwise  once he starts interacting with other humans  he may alter the course of history .         i know it   s theoretically possible to change history     rita said doubtfully .     but it depends on the importance of his actions .         i assume you have followed the news     said hunter .     you know that a major explosion took place on the southern coast of jamaica yesterday .         hm .  oh  yes .  wasn   t that terrible .  no one knows what it was  but the tidal waves are hitting all over the caribbean .  it   s terrible .         yes     said hunter .     that was actually mc   exploding .  the instability of the component robots    atoms causes them to explode with nuclear force when they reach the approximate time from which they originally left  give or take a day or so .         oh  no .     rita stared at him in horror .     i   m beginning to understand .     she hesitated .     they didn   t explode all at once .         no .  apparently the component robots of mc governor himself also have varied levels of instability .  since the others have not exploded yet  we will go to jamaica .  when we bring mc   back  this explosion will never have happened .     hunter spoke stiffly  almost defensively .     if i fail to retrieve him  then i will have failed the first law in allowing so much harm to so many people .         i   m sure you can get him     said rita .     after all  you got mc   .  you probably won   t even need me  except for a little help here and there .         i want you to understand that  for now  i have withheld the fact that the jamaican explosion is related to mc   from the committee     said hunter .     and certainly from the public .      she looked up at him  waiting .      i expect to eliminate the problem  in which case an explanation will be unnecessary .     he stopped the vehicle in front of debbie   s diner .     here we are .  i will introduce you to the rest of the team .           debbie   s diner was decorated in the fashion of a small missouri town from the early twentieth century .  the furniture was made of cedar  the deep red and white of the wood sealed by a clear preservative .  frilly blue and white curtains hung in all the windows .  jars of fruit preserves made by hand were for sale in the front .   steve chang had already requested a comer table in the back .  he and jane maynard were waiting there when hunter brought in rita and made introductions .  hunter looked around  appraising the room .   as he did  steve looked too .  no one was seated close to them .  humans couldn   t hear them  but of course a robot could increase his aural sensitivity .      what   s wrong .     jane asked .      we can get acquainted here     said hunter .     however  the area is extremely open  offering virtually no privacy .  i suggest we postpone our discussion of specific plans until we move to a secure location .         aw  hunter .     steve grinned .     are you kidding .         of course not     hunter said stiffly .   rita was looking back and forth between them  curiously .      hunter  you hired me for my pragmatic experience  as opposed to the formal education possessed by the rest of your team .  right .         of course .         well  take my word for it .  as long as we don   t discuss the science and technology required for our trip  then anything else we say will go completely unnoticed .  frankly  nobody believes in time travel .         i think you have a point     said jane .     they   ll think we   re going to a costume party or making a historical movie or something .         i accept your argument     said hunter  again glancing around warily .      may i ask a question  then .     rita asked .     i would like to know in more detail exactly what is expected of me .  i understand that  in general  i   m to help with information about the history and culture of jamaica in      .  .  . but what do you want  exactly .         while jane and steve were resting up from our last mission  i gathered clothing and equipment     said hunter .     i need steve to look it over for practicality and you to screen it for anachronisms .         i see     said rita .      it   ll be easier this time     said steve .     last time  we had to take nearly everything important with us .  now we   re going back to a time and place that already has human necessities .  but we   ll want vaccinations for disease .         i   ll work up a list of likely ones     said rita .     all the microbes will have evolved some over the years  but we should take the precautions we can .      as the group ordered the meals from a robot wait er  steve studied rita .  she was petite and pretty  and coolly professional .  at least she hadn   t started needling him  the way the paleontologist on the last mission  chad mora  had done from the moment they met .  steve and chad had parted friends but they had not started out that way .  rita   s reserve was a welcome change .      i   ve never heard of port royal  jamaica     said steve .     not that i   ve been to the caribbean .  but i   ve never seen it on the ads for tourists or heard it mentioned when hurricanes are in the news .  where is it .         under the water .     rita smiled nicety .     port royal was located on the southern coast of jamaica  to the east .  it was across a bay from modern kingston .  in the seventeenth century  it was the center of jamaican buccaneer activity  but a big earthquake hit it in      .  its remains have been under the water ever since .         well  that explains that .     steve grinned at jane .     no wonder i   ve never heard of it .         no wonder     jane agreed .      we should all have weapons .  i think .     said rita .     for our own protection .         i will have to protect all of you under the first law     said hunter .     i am much stronger than any human my size  and much quicker .  as long as we stay together .  i can handle this task .         we   re going to enter a very rough  violent culture     said rita .     port royal is even more violent than most areas were during the     s .         taking weapons is a problem for me     said hunter .     one of my greatest concerns is that we avoid changing history .  we should take back as few items as possible .  any material we take back beyond the bare minimum increases the chance that we will alter events in the future   that is  after      .  our own time might not be waiting here for us when we come home .  that possibility makes it a first law concern .         i don   t know how to impress upon you how dangerous port royal will be     said rita .     in particular  they will look at jane and me in a very different way from what we are used to in our own time .  you hired me for my expertise  and i believe we should all carry at least good sized knives  if not pistols and swords .         this may be too great a risk       hunter began .      i suggest a compromise     said steve .      what kind .     jane asked .     after all  hunter  keeping us safe is also part of your first law requirement .         we   ll take some money back with us     said steve .     coins from that time       or earlier .  spanish coins  english coins  whatever rita says is appropriate .  when we get there  we   ll buy what we need  then leave it behind when we come home .  that way we won   t take anything that originated after      back with us .            that would satisfy my concern     said rita .     but we   ll have to keep our wealth well hidden from the buccaneers around us .         a compromise     hunter said carefully .     rita  are coins from that time and place readily available .         well  they exist     said rita .     many of them were gold  so those are very expensive .  many are in museums and galleries now  so those aren   t available at all .  but some coins from that time can be found for a reasonable price .  i would try collectors and dealers in the caribbean .         i have a certain number of such coins already     said hunter .     i would prefer not to delay the trip while we wait for more .         you know     said rita .     they could be faked easily and cheaply .  or would that be too risky .         fakes would increase the chance of altering history     said hunter .     we would increase the local money supply .         how much do you have .     rita asked .      one kilogram of silver coin     said hunter .     the denominations vary .      rita thought a moment .     exact prices fluctuated  depending on what booty the buccaneers brought back at any given time .  barter was very common .  for our purposes  however  i think that should do if we are careful with it .         this will be a good move for more reasons than just getting weapons     steve said .     we   ll want to rent lodging and buy food  too .         we will take two way radio transmitters this time too     said hunter .      yeah .  that   ll avoid some stupid problems we had last time     said steve .      they must be disguised     said rita .     if anyone in      hears voices coming out of the air  we might be accused of sorcery of some kind and killed on the spot .  buccaneers were very superstitious  impulsive people .         i have the transmitters ready     said hunter .     in the form of lapel pins .         we should wear them out of sight     said rita .     jewelry will invite thieves .         this whole arrangement sounds good to me     said steve .     i think this mission may be safer than the last one .  food and shelter will be waiting and we won   t have to watch for tyrannosaurus rexes stampeding after us .      jane laughed .     i   m convinced .        during dinner  rita had hunter access the city computer .  in consultation with it  she gave hunter a list of vaccinations that the human members of the team would need .  he arranged to have the serums waiting at the institute .   after dinner  hunter drove the team through mojave center to the bohung institute .  rita began briefing them on what to expect in port royal  including some of the sailing terms and other historical references they might need in the language .  hunter stored it easily  of course .   as hunter listened to rita  he also eavesdropped on some of the people around them .  everyone seemed to be talking about the explosion in jamaica .  the toll of death  injuries  and destruction was still climbing .  the world community was rushing to help with emergency supplies and services .  experts around the world were speculating on the cause  but only hunter and his team knew what it was .   hunter   s sense of failure under the first law for allowing so many humans to suffer and die was increasing .  he wanted to go back into the past as soon as possible to prevent the disaster .  he was making an unusual effort to concentrate his attention on his duties .  reviewing the moves he had already made helped to distract him .   before mc governor had left  he had arranged for the city computer to coordinate the duties that were normally his .  hunter had found that the system was functioning effectively  so he had not interfered with it .  earlier that day  hunter had also arranged  through the city computer  for the entire bohung institute to be closed down .  he had cited emergency conditions that he had classified as    unexplained .     it was now guarded by a full detail of security robots .   this detail was temporarily under the authority of r .  ishihara .  he was the robot who was normally assigned to room f     where the experimental time travel unit was located .  originally designed for miniaturization  it had been modified by mc governor for this second purpose .  hunter felt that leaving an institute robot in charge was appropriate .   after dinner  hunter drove the team in the security vehicle up to the bohung institute .  by the time he pulled up at the main entrance  he had already alerted ishihara that they were coming .  hunter had also transmitted rita   s appearance  fingerprints  and voiceprint so that ishihara could add them to the screening data for members of hunter   s team .  it was just a precaution .  hunter fully expected that by the time he brought rita through the institute again on the way out  mc   would have been apprehended .   the security detail was there partly to prevent unexpected visitors from entering  since the employees had already been notified that the institute was closed .  charging the guards with the protection of the humans on hunter   s team under the first law meant that no humans could use the second law to countermand his instructions .  however  hunter   s main reason for assigning the detail was to capture dr .  wayne nystrom if at all possible .  the team had last seen him in the late cretaceous period  but he could be anywhere at any time by now .   hunter led his team into room f     where ishihara was personally stationed .  the room was very large and dominated by an opaque sphere about fifteen meters in diameter .  the rest of the room was lined with countertops filled with computers  monitors  a communications console  and miscellaneous office items that had been in use when hunter had suddenly closed down the institute .   inside  ishihara passed out the oral vaccines to the humans  who took them immediately .  then he waited by the door .  everyone turned to hunter for instructions .   hunter took them to a small stack of clothes and accessories on a counter .      steve  rita     said hunter .     these are the clothes i gathered while steve and jane were sleeping .  if they pass inspection  we can leave soon .  i hired the robot tailor from the city personnel department to design and make them based on research i did in the library .  i gave him steve   s and jane   s sizes .  rita   s clothes may need alteration  which i can have done immediately .  since we will be in the tropics  the clothes are made of cotton  not wool .  i directed that no modern synthetic materials be present in any of them .  steve and i have already agreed that we will not have to take any packs of survival gear with us .      steve picked up a loose  white shirt and knee breeches  shaking them out to take a look at them .     good enough  i   d say .  i   ll try them on in a minute .      first he examined the other clothing  which included two long brown skirts for rita and jane .     these are practical enough  i think .  these will help us blend in when we first arrive .  that   s the important part .         the clothing design is correct     said rita  taking items from steve .     but this belt buckle is an anachronism .         in what way .     hunter asked .      the buckle is made of stainless steel  a more recent development     said rita  tossing the belt to him .  she held the hem of one skirt up close to peer at it .     did you tell the tailor robot to avoid synthetic thread too .         no     said hunter .     i was thinking of fabric when i gave him instructions .         better contact him to make sure     said rita .  she quickly glanced over all the clothes  including the shoes .     everything else is acceptable .         take these     said hunter  handing each of them a communicator .  they were simple  decorative  silver buttons with a tiny speaker hole in the center  a pin on the back  and a tiny button on the side .     pin them to the underside of your lapels  out of sight .  that way  they will be close enough to speak into without attracting a lot of attention .      while the humans took turns changing their clothes in an adjacent room  hunter called the tailor robot about the thread .  he changed his own clothes at the same time .  the thread was satisfactory .      fortunately     said hunter     the tailor robot understood my meaning when i asked him to use only natural fibers of cotton .  steve  are the belts necessary .  we can save time if we do not bother to replace the buckles .         no  we can get by without them  at least at first .  we can buy some there if we need them .         good     said hunter .     rita  how are your clothes .         how do i look .     she smiled and did a little twirl in her loose blouse and full skirt .     they   re a little big  but i think good enough .  we don   t need to delay the trip to make minor alterations .     now that she was out of her business suit  her manner seemed more casual .      you look fine     said steve .     hunter  shall we go .         i believe we are about ready to go     said hunter .     everyone   s communicator is in place  i see  good .  before we go  however  i want to brief you again on the matter of altering history .         i think i   ve already heard it     steve said wryly .     jane too .         rita must hear it     said hunter .      yeah  well .     steve rolled his eyes and sat down in a chair .     all right  let   s get it over with .         i have estimated that mojave center    the robot we seek  will return to full size from his miniaturized state about the time we arrive .  that is how i chose the destination in time for our trip  since we cannot possibly find him while he is still microscopic .  the greatest danger in this mission is that before we can apprehend him  he will take actions that alter the time line of history from      to the present day .         i already know that  hunter     rita said patiently .      i have not made my point yet .         maybe you don   t have to     said rita .     hunter  as a historian  i understand the theories behind your concern  but let me give you a counterargument  all right .         go ahead     said hunter .  after all  what she had said earlier was right  he had hired her for her expertise .   steve pointedly faked a yawn and pretended to fall asleep .        actually  steve listened with amusement as rita earnestly argued with hunter .  jane seemed seriously interested in their difference of opinion .  hunter   s face  as usual  was calm and hard to read .      on the surface of it  the history in this time and place really isn   t very important     said rita .     you see  the depredations of the buccaneers from jamaica in this era were a side issue to european wars .  in fact  much of the booty that resulted from their raids never left the caribbean .         wait a minute     said steve .     i know my history isn   t great  but i remember something about this stuff .  i learned in school that the spanish were taking huge amounts of gold back to spain at that time .  sir francis drake and walter raleigh and the spanish armada   all that stuff .  and that the english kept raiding spanish ships and taking a lot of gold back to england .  what about that .         your history is correct as far as it goes  but that was a century earlier  during the     s .         oh .  sorry .         no reason to be .  that was simply a different phase of the same era .  but even more to the point  port royal itself and three thousand of its inhabitants will be wiped out in the      earthquake that i mentioned .  so this town is not even going to last very long after we   re there   only one short generation after we leave .         so you don   t feel that the events in jamaica in      are going to mean much to the overall direction of history .     jane asked thoughtfully .      no  i don   t .  i believe that history is driven by major developments in technology and economics  which in turn trigger social and political change .         i am still worried about the application of chaos theory to our missions into the past     said hunter .     you are familiar with the theory .         yes     said rita .     it   s an application of a theory from physics  applied to time and  therefore  to history .  basically  it says that any change in the past  no matter how small  will send out continuing ripple effects that will eventually change history greatly .         that is right .         as a historian  i   ve never been convinced that chaos theory truly applies to history .         i   m no scientist      said steve  grinning .     but if i understand this theory at all  then our previous trip to the dinosaur age disproved it a little .         what do you mean .     rita asked .      we made some changes .  i mean  we captured a dinosaur to ride  trampled on a lot of plants  and caused a stampede .  but when we got back  everything was pretty much the same .         the question is where the threshold of change lies     said hunter .     that is  how many changes must take place  or how important must they be  to set a course of permanent change .         i   m afraid we   ll be the ones to find out     said jane .     as the first time travelers  we may just find out the hard way  by making changes we don   t want to make .         maybe not     said rita .     look  at your trip to the late cretaceous period   one expectation might have been that minor changes from that long ago could have caused a divergent time line that would be very different by the time events reached the present   that the changes would become more extreme every second for millions of years .  but that didn   t happen .  so another theory is that so much time was involved that the sheer weight of random events neutralized the changes you caused .         that would not really be a form of chaos theory at all     said hunter .      exactly     said rita .      you mean we didn   t have to be so careful after all .     steve grinned at jane .     all that extra effort .         i disagree     said hunter firmly .     by the argument rita just presented  the time line marked from      is much more fragile .  instead of many millions of years for events to neutralize any changes we might cause  only a few centuries will pass .  that may not be enough time to absorb the effects of what we do .  we still have to be as careful as before not to make unnecessary changes .         all right     said steve  with an exaggerated sigh .     can we go now .         yes .  i shall set the controls while you three enter the sphere     said hunter .     just do not take the danger of mc       changing history lightly either .  please remember that when mc   reaches full size  his interpretation of the first law may not be centered on preserving the future at all .  yet saving a human from harm in the        when that person actually died according to history  could mean harming all the humans whose history and future are changed .  that is theoretical  however  and the immediate danger is tangible .  so we have to assume that the fugitive mc   is a real danger to the course of history  no matter what theory you believe in .         yes  i agree with that     said rita .   while hunter moved to the control panel  steve caught jane   s eye with a grin and shook his head .  sometimes hunter   s boring repetition of this theoretical stuff reminded him of being a kid in school .  still  he realized that rita   s disbelief in chaos theory was probably worrying hunter more than the robot was admitting .   ishihara still remained by the door  where he would wait to apprehend dr .  nystrom if he appeared .  hunter had told him that stopping dr .  nystrom was a first law imperative .   hunter opened the sphere so that the humans could climb into it .  the bottom was hard and curved .  designed as a laboratory instrument  it had never been intended to accommodate humans or robots .  steve huddled in the base of the curve with jane and rita  waiting for hunter to set the timer on the controls .  then hunter joined them  easing inside so as not to land on anyone  he closed the door .   steve suddenly saw the darkness in the sphere vanish .  it was replaced by the sudden brilliance of tropical sunlight .  he fell onto a soft bed of green grass .  the others tumbled around him .   for a longtime resident of the mojave desert such as steve  the lush green island life of jamaica was an abrupt change .  tall  full trees and bushes rose up all around them .  the trees and brush were full of birds  twittering and chirping at them in startled concern .  colorful flowers bloomed nearby  red and white and orange .  he gasped for breath  startled by the humidity of the air .      it   s beautiful     said jane  looking around .      it looks pretty much the same in our time     said rita  sitting up .     more developed  of course  but not really spoiled .  not yet  anyway .         it   s late afternoon     said steve  observing the position of the sun .      that is right     said hunter .     mc   will return to full size again sometime tonight  according to my calculations .         where are we .     jane asked .     out on some country road  i see .         yes     said hunter .     but not too far from port royal .  we are less than a quarter mile out of town .  i wanted to make sure we landed away from the town  to lessen the chance that someone would happen to see us arrive .         no one did  i guess     said rita .     this late in the day  the townsfolk will be hurrying to get inside the walls .  anyone who did business from the plantations along this road has probably gone home already .         we should join them     said steve  getting to his feet .     or else we   ll be stuck out here in the dark .      the team began to walk along the rough wagon and horse track .  through the trees to their right  steve could just see the blue water of the caribbean .  then he realized that sometimes through the trees to the left  he could see more water of the same color .     where are we  exactly .         okay     said rita .     i guess i should give you a quick geography lesson .  we   re on the southeastern coast of the island .  that water on our right  to the north  will someday be called kingston bay .  the city of kingston itself will be built across the bay  on the far shore .     she pointed to the water on their other side .     that   s the open sea  to the south .  we   re walking along a very narrow  long peninsula that the british called the cagway  a corruption of the spanish word caguaya .  it stretches westward  defining much of the southern enclosure of the bay .  and that   s port royal up ahead at the end of it  just coming into sight .      steve looked where she was pointing .  a few people on carts and horses were just entering the town .  steve found that in the humidity  he was already sweating freely .      mc   can masquerade the same way we are if he gets some clothes     said hunter .     assuming he does  we will have to keep a sharp lookout for someone the right size in order to find him .  he is unusually short and slender  virtually identical in build to the other component robots .  you saw mc   in mc governor   s office .      rita nodded .      rita     said jane .     what are we going to find in port royal when we get there .  is it really going to be full of pirates  or will there be ordinary townspeople there too .         both     said rita .     jamaica is a true british colony .  here   s what happened .  about       the island of tortuga became a pirate stronghold and hideaway .  tortuga isn   t far from here .  just three years ago  in       the various buccaneers and their hangers on in tortuga spilled over to jamaica  which was already ruled by the english .         simple enough     said steve .      yes  it is .  english ships are still raiding spanish ships for gold being sent from the new world  but the english are now keeping it here  not returning it to england .  france nominally rules tortuga  and lots of french buccaneers will also be present in port royal .         is there a difference between pirates and buccaneers .     jane asked .     or are they the same thing .         a perceptive question .     rita smiled indulgently .     here  they   re the same .  the word    pirate    means any pirate throughout history .     buccaneer    means specifically the pirates of the caribbean during this time .  it originally came from the native arawak tribe   s word buccan  which was a grid of green sticks used to grill strips of meat slowly over a fire .  the first french pirates in the caribbean cooked their food that way on tortuga when they moved there from haiti around      .         you sure know your stuff     said steve .      we are getting close to port royal     said hunter .     before we arrive  what can you tell us about the political climate .  what should we watch out for .         port royal is a wide open town full of impulsive  violent buccaneers     rita said firmly .     the real danger is from them  not from the government .         how much government is there .     steve asked  looking at the town ahead .  it seemed small  with its buildings crowded together against the blue sea .      there is definitely some  but relatively little .  jamaica doesn   t have much in the way of british ships or troops .  sir thomas modyford is the governor .  in the past  he granted commissions as privateers to certain pirates  who could then raid the spanish as representatives of the british crown .  for instance  a year ago  word arrived here in jamaica that the spanish in nearby cuba were assembling a fleet for a strike against jamaica .  modyford prevented that by sending sir henry morgan and a fleet of buccaneers on a preemptive strike against cuba .         what   s a privateer .     steve asked  puzzled .     some kind of buccaneer .         sort of .     rita laughed .     the line was always blurry .  basically  a government that was at war would commission pirates to fight for them against the enemy .  in peace  pirates might attack any ship they wanted .  the trouble is  the term turns on a legal technicality .  they were basically the same people  doing the same things .         pirates were the ones who ran up the skull and crossbones flag     said jane .      well  not in this time     said rita .     the jolly roger didn   t appear on the scene for another couple of decades .         too bad we can   t invent it for them     said steve .  then he turned to hunter quickly .     just a joke  hunter .  not serious  okay .         okay     said hunter soberly .     i have data about jokes stored .  was that one funny .         no     said jane .   the sun had dropped behind the trees to the west by the time they reached the gate in the town wall .  a couple of bored uniformed sentries straightened slightly  obviously spotting the team as strangers .  hunter stepped forward  towering over both of them .      what   s your business .     one sentry spoke in a strong british accent .  the other looked over hunter   s tall  solid build and did not seem pleased with the prospect of a confrontation .      we seek shelter for the night     said hunter .     we are looking for a friend .         oh  yeah .  i says you jumped ship offshore and swam here  you and your loose ladies .      steve stiffened  but jane stifled a giggle .      we only seek shelter for the night     hunter repeated  less certainly .   rita leaned close to hunter  whispering something steve couldn   t hear .  hunter slipped a hand into the leather pouch hanging from his belt and drew out a couple of coins .  he tossed one into the air to each of the sentries .  as they looked up to catch them  hunter pushed past them  then turned to make sure the rest of the team followed .  they did  the sentries were busy examining the coins for their value .   steve   s appraisal of port royal from a distance still held up once they were inside .  the streets were narrow and crooked  the buildings low and crowded together .  they were in a part of town that was relatively quiet .      where should we go .     hunter asked .      to the waterfront     said rita .     that   s where the nightlife will be in a port town .         and places to stay     steve added .      that   s right     said rita .     taverns and inns .  and real buccaneers .         jane     said hunter .     mc   could be returning to full size about now  given the range of my calculations .  where do you think he might go in a town like this .  as a roboticist  do you think he would go to the waterfront .         it   s a reasonable guess     said jane slowly .     but robotics isn   t the issue  except to the extent that he was programmed to fit in with humans .  when he returns to full size  he   ll need clothes from this period in order to blend into the crowd .  without them  he   ll have to sneak around in the dark for a while  so he   ll be out at night .  and without any money  he   ll have to steal whatever clothes he can find .         that might be easier in a part of town where everyone   s asleep     said steve .      people in the better parts of town probably protect themselves and their belongings better     said rita .     they   ll take in their wash before sundown and have guard dogs and servants .         i think he would be drawn to an area that has some activity after dark     said jane .     he will need to learn what he can about the language and culture as fast as possible  so even overhearing conversations  from hiding will be important to him .         that   s also where we can buy some knives to carry with us     said rita .      we will try the waterfront      hunter decided .        as hunter led the team down the winding streets toward the waterfront  he turned up the sensitivity in both his hearing and his vision .  every warning rita had given about the violence of buccaneer culture had sharpened his concerns under the first law .  he would have to evaluate each sight and sound for potential threats .   the strong scent of the sea came to him on the wind well before they reached the waterfront .  all along the docks  torches were burning over the doors of taverns and over open air booths  where wares of all kinds were for sale  including earthenware  knitting  and fabrics .  the smell of oily smoke was thick .  he looked through the crowd of people for someone the size of mc   .      there     said rita  pointing .      mc   .     hunter looked around .      no  hunter .     rita laughed .     just a booth where we can all arm ourselves .         hey  look at that stuff     said steve enthusiastically  hurrying over to the booth .     all kinds of knives  pistols  swords .  .  . wow .         try them out     said the proprietor  in a french accent .  he was a bony  gray haired man wearing only knee breeches and a large  gold earring .  his bare feet were calloused and black with the rich island dirt .     heft them  feel their weight .  i am henri the ironmonger .      steve picked up a flintlock pistol and turned it to one side  so that it pointed away from everyone .  he looked at it carefully  then cocked it and pulled the trigger with a satisfying click .  then he set it down on the rough wooden table and picked up something else .      this is good     said rita  picking up a long  curved dagger .     i can wear it in a sash  where people can see it .  and it   s not too heavy for me to use .         i see     said jane .  more reluctantly  she picked up a straight dagger of about the same length .     i don   t know if i could use this on anyone .         you probably won   t have to     said rita .      what .  then what   s the point .         the idea is to make some of these guys think twice about bothering us in the first place .  with hunter to protect us and these knives out where everyone can see them  we just might be left alone .         i see .      rita stepped back and made a couple of stabbing motions in the air  then swung the dagger around experimentally .      but why are you so particular  if you don   t think you   ll have to use it       jane started .      maybe we won   t have to use them     rita reminded her  with a grin .     we want something we can handle  just in case .         these are all so cruel     said hunter  examining the weapons on the table .  he felt a sense of alarm  reminded of how quickly the first law could come into effect with so many weapons around .     they are intended only for committing grave harm to other humans .         where have you been  my gigantic friend .     henri the ironmonger laughed .     taking vows in a monastery .         no     said hunter  cautiously .      try a cutlass     said rita quickly .  she raised up the handle of one of the long  curved swords .     you can handle a heavy weapon .     then she lowered her voice .     remember  you   re a buccaneer .  think of it as playacting .         and you have permission to lie as part of the playacting     said jane softly .     under the second law  i instruct you to maintain your role as a buccaneer .         acknowledged     said hunter  accepting the cutlass .  imitating rita   s earlier moves  he stepped away from the others and swung it around in the air a couple of times .  at the same time  he accessed some of his data on buccaneers  including some children   s books he had recorded .     avast  matey .      the three humans on his team laughed .      aye  a big fellow like yourself can use a big sword like that one     said henri .     no sense in a strong  strapping man wasting his time with some little frog sticker .  lost your old sword  i suppose .         yes     rita said quickly .     overboard .  it was  uh  a difficult moment .         i   ve had my share of those     said henri  nodding sympathetically .     i may not look it now  but i have .     he grinned  showing only a couple of teeth .      steve     said hunter .  he was uncomfortable with this playacting .     have you picked something .         i   m not sure     said steve .      a pistol would be good  but clumsy to load .  and these flintlocks only shoot once before you reload .         of course     said henri  puzzled .     have you ever heard of any devil gun that could shoot more than once at a time .  but it reaches out to your enemy before you enter the range of his blade .         the chance of accident is greater  too     said hunter .     please choose an edged weapon .         okay .     steve shrugged and picked up a rapier .     i   ll try this one .  how about scabbards and belts .         sorry  my friends     said henri .     i have collected these fine weapons wherever i could  but mostly they came from unfortunates who fell in courageous battle .  belts and scabbards were not close to hand .         whatever .     steve shrugged .      bargain with him     rita whispered to hunter .  hunter tried  but without knowing the going price of swords and daggers  he was at a disadvantage .  rita helped  arguing vigorously and three times walking away from the booth in feigned disgust .  finally  at her instruction  hunter bought all the weapons for less than a handful of coins .   the team walked away  satisfied .      an interesting cultural phenomenon     said hunter .     my stored information tells me that parts of the world still routinely bargain even in our time .  i had never experienced it before .  it is more psychology than economics .         that   s right     said rita .     but now we all need belts or sashes to wear  to hold up our weapons .         rita     said jane  pointing .     look at the that booth  over there .  those are sashes and scarves .         perfect     said rita .     come on  hunter .      this time  hunter bargained alone and successfully purchased four long cotton sashes  two of faded blue and two that were more or less black .  each member of the team took one .  at rita   s direction  they tied them around their waists and stuck their weapons through them at the hip .      good enough     said rita  looking around with an excited expression .     this is really special for me .  i can hardly believe i   m doing this .  i   ve spent my entire adult life studying this time and this region .  and now i   m actually here .         we are glad to have you with us     said hunter .  he looked at rita and jane .     what do you suggest now .  how can we maximize our chances of finding mc   .         well .  .  .     jane hesitated .     we   re back to what i said earlier  i guess  about looking around the waterfront .  after all  he may not have returned to full size yet  in which case we won   t find him now anyway .         i agree that we should circulate     said rita .     maybe we can meet a few people and tell them to watch for someone of his description .         ah  yes     said hunter .     in other words  create a network of people who can help us search .         that   s right     said rita .     but before we ask them for any help  we have to establish a rapport with them .  buccaneers survive partly by being suspicious of strangers .  offering a reward wouldn   t hurt .         we do not want to reveal unnecessarily that we are carrying much money     said hunter .      let   s talk to some people     said jane .     then we can decide how to handle them .         i see taverns all up and down the docks     said steve .     how are we going to pick one to start .      rita thought for a moment  gazing up the street .     we have to be careful .  buccaneer women aren   t well thought of .  let   s start in one of the open air taverns .  the clientele is more varied and we can get away more easily if we have to leave .         i hope i don   t regret this     said jane .      hunter  you should go first .  lead us into that sidewalk tavern there .     rita pointed .     some other women are there  and they seem safe so far .         all right .      hunter walked in front  with the other three close behind .  he was aware that many of the rough  dirty men looked up at him in some surprise .  hunter was  of course  unusually tall and powerful  and he knew he had attracted some attention on their earlier walk through town .  he decided that the buccaneers routinely appraised the fighting ability of those around them  either as potential opponents in a brawl or as comrades on board ship .   in front of hunter  a short  brawny buccaneer stomped forward to a bar made of three rough planks resting on a couple of barrels .  behind the makeshift bar  an overweight man in a shirt with full  baggy sleeves was dipping tankards into an open keg and setting them on the bar .  hunter watched carefully .      gimme four o    those     said the man in front  tossing down a small coin .   hunter quickly sorted through his pouch for a coin of the same size .  when his turn came  he tossed it down on the bar .     i would like four drinks  also  please .      the barkeep glanced at him in surprise  perhaps at his phrasing  but said nothing .  the man set four full tankards on the bar and scooped the coin into a pouch of his own .  hunter turned and handed out the tankards to his companions .      let   s move out of the way of the bar     said rita .  she edged through the crowd and the others followed her .   hunter took a sip of his drink .  he found the flavor too strong to be pleasant .  as his system quickly analyzed its contents  he realized that the substance was called rum .  in small amounts  it was not necessarily dangerous to humans  but its effects could be if the amount accumulated .   steve took a mouthful and grimaced before swallowing .     wow .  no wonder these guys are mean .         please be careful with the amount of alcohol you consume     said hunter .     remember  i am concerned with your health  under the first law .      rita and jane both took more cautious tastes .     our modern rum is more refined     rita said quietly .     this is rather harsh  isn   t it .      jane made a face .     i think i   ll just hold mine  to look the part .         aye  drink up     said a stranger  hoisting his tankard to hunter .     it flows freely in port royal tonight  but you never know when the river will stop .     he was tall man  only a little shorter than hunter  with bushy red hair .      good evening     said hunter .     my name is hunter .  these are steve  rita  and jane .         greetings to all .  i am leitch .  haven   t seen you before  hunter  you   re too big to forget .  sail in recently  did you .         we arrived today     said hunter .  he glanced at rita for help  concerned that he might say something that would reveal their status as ignorant strangers .      i don   t recall any ships putting in today     said another man  staggering against leitch .  he was a shorter  stocky man with a french accent .   leitch elbowed him hard and shoved him upright again .     you sleep all day again  cresson .      rita took hunter   s arm casually and leaned against him .  he realized that this was part of her playacting  but he was not sure what to do in response .  deciding to be cautious  he did nothing .      hunter     said rita .     i   ll bet these guys know a lot of people .  maybe we should tell them what your friend looks like .  i know you want to be careful  but we could ask them .         how   s that .     leitch looked at her over his tankard as he took another swig .      i am searching for a friend     said hunter .     a small  slender man  probably in clothes that  uh       he stopped uncertainly  looking at rita .      he probably scavenged them someplace     said rita .     he never has any money .         sounds like most of my friends     said leitch  grinning at cresson .      he learns fast     said steve .     but he hasn   t spent much time in this part of the world .         ah .  doesn   t know the ropes  eh .     cresson nodded .     can   t say i   ve seen anyone of that sort around lately  but if he   s on the docks  we   ll see him sooner or later .      leitch eyed steve carefully .     spanish  are you .  with a touch of moorish blood .  your english is very good .         thank you     said steve  with a shrug .   hunter saw that jane was quietly shifting behind steve .  cresson was studying her with a great deal of interest .  steve glanced at hunter .   suddenly angry shouts could be heard off to    one side  toward the docks .  hunter turned and was able to see over the heads of most of the crowd .  two buccaneers had squared off  one holding a curved dagger much like rita   s and the other grasping a belaying pin .   hunter   s first reflex was to shove forward through the crowd and stop them .  he resisted it  with effort  reminding himself that the larger first law issue in the future took precedence over the welfare of these two buccaneers .  still  he stared at them with a kind of horror .      steady  hunter     said jane softly .     if you   re having trouble  review your internal data about chaos theory .  reinforce your understanding that the first law can be served by letting these guys fight .         thank you     hunter said quietly .  he followed her instructions instantaneously .  it helped him keep his priorities clear  though his positronic brain still wanted to break up the fight .      haw .  look at that .     leitch punched cresson on the arm .     i   ll wager the next round of drinks that carlos takes him .         with a belaying pin .  you   re on     said cresson .     come on  let   s move closer .      they both pushed forward to see better .   hunter realized that nearly everyone in the crowd was laughing  yelling encouragement or insults  and wagering on the outcome of the fight .  none of them seemed to take it seriously  though both combatants held potentially lethal weapons .  their casual attitude toward such violence matched his historical data  but it made him very uncomfortable .      all right  hunter .     jane asked  taking his arm .     you aren   t freezing up  are you .         no  jane     said hunter .     i have to remain active in order to protect the three of you if the violence spreads .  i think we should leave  though  and look elsewhere for mc   .         good idea .         okay     steve said reluctantly .  he obviously wanted to watch the fight .      let   s go out this way     said rita .  she led the team away from the crowd to one side  well away from the developing fight .  other eager observers moved up to take their places .   the team followed rita up the waterfront .  hunter felt a slight sense of relief  but he realized that these first law situations were going to continue as long as he was in the past among humans .  in this respect  going back to the dinosaur age had been easier  since the only humans there had all come from the future .   jane stopped suddenly  grabbing hunter   s arm .     there   s another fight .      hunter looked .  ahead  two large men were shouting at each other in the light from a tavern doorway .  a short  slender man was trying to interfere .          all three figures in the tavern doorway were silhouettes against the torchlight from inside .  none of them could be seen clearly .  so far  they were merely scuffling with each other  the two larger men yelling insults .      is the short one mc   .     rita asked anxiously .      he   s roughly the right size     steve said in a low voice  uncertainly .     hunter  what do you think .  what do you want us to do .      striding forward quickly  hunter turned up all his senses .  the figure trying to break up the fight was not speaking  but just pushing between the two men  so hunter couldn   t judge his voice .  he was calling mc   on his internal radio link  but mc   had shut down his receiver to avoid receiving messages under the second law  mc   would probably do the same .      we have to stop him and see     hunter decided .     i will go first .  if you can help  act on your own  but don   t take any risks unnecessarily .     he jogged forward .   suddenly the two shouting men lunged at each other  grappling for a moment and trying to gain some advantage .  the smaller figure had gotten caught between them .  hunter broke into a run .      stop .     hunter shouted in a deep  authoritative voice as he drew closer .     stop .     none of the three struggling fighters seemed to hear him .   hunter reached the three and grabbed an arm of the two larger men in each hand .  neither was as tall as hunter .  he pulled them apart and shoved  pushing them off balance .  in the same moment  the smaller man ducked under one of hunter   s outstretched arms and backed away .      hey .  what   s it to you .     one of the big men glared at hunter in surprise .   the other  without a word  swung a fist toward hunter .  with his fast reflexes  he dodged it with an easy  slight movement  then pushed both men away from him again .  he was just about to speak  hoping to discourage them from further resistance  when he heard angry voices and the sound of footsteps running toward him from the tavern doorway .   hunter turned and found a crowd of drunken pirates running toward him  yelling .  he knew he could not stop them without a very hard collision  which might hurt them .  so when the first four men threw themselves at him  he allowed himself to be tackled and taken down .   a moment later  however  hunter gathered his legs under him and  with a wad of buccaneers    clothes in each hand  stood up .  the others simply fell off him  the two flailed wildly in his grip .  hunter dropped them  judging that a fall to the street would not do them any harm .  then he stepped back  warily looking around to defend himself again .   the buccaneers were muttering among themselves  but none wanted to go after hunter alone .      come on  hunter     steve called from behind him .     this guy isn   t mc    after all .      hunter stepped backward toward steve   s voice  eager to avoid any further chance of harming these violent humans .  likewise  they remained where they were on the ground  eyeing him in drunken surprise .  none of them spoke as hunter joined the rest of the team .      let   s get out of here     said rita .     hunter  you bring up the rear and see if they follow us .      the slender buccaneer whom hunter had rescued stayed with them as they jogged down the waterfront quickly  slipping through the crowd .  hunter focused both his vision and his hearing on the men they had left behind  but he detected no sign of pursuit .  instead  muttering to each other angrily  they just returned to the tavern .      we have no pursuit     hunter announced .     we can walk if you prefer .         you sure .     steve asked  but he slowed to a walk  as did the others .  he looked back over his shoulder .     i guess pirates could be pretty sneaky .         they went back inside     hunter assured him .     their motivation for another fight was lower than their motivation for more drinking .         that   s no surprise to me  mate     said their new companion  in a strong british accent .     we merely had a difference of opinion about whose turn it was to pay for the round of drinks .  nothing to get your throat slashed for  hey .      hunter studied him .  he was a young man with sun bleached blond hair and a quick smile .  now that he was out of the shadows and walking normally  hunter could see that he was almost as slender as mc    but really much taller .  his clothes were similar to those of hunter and steve  knee breeches and a loose white shirt with flowing sleeves for freedom of movement .  a belt and scabbard with a rapier in it completed the man   s attire .      i am roland burke .     he turned to rita .     and  sweet lady  you are .  .  .  .         rita     she said  startled by the way he had addressed her .   hunter introduced the rest of them .      i   m pleased to meet you all     said roland .     hunter  i thank you for your assistance .  my friends can be short tempered when the talk turns to hard coin .         your opponents in the fight were your friends .     hunter was surprised .      ah  well  does any buccaneer have true friends .     roland shrugged .   steve  saying nothing  was watching roland with curiosity .  rita was staring at him in open fascination .  roland seemed oblivious to their interest  waving to an acquaintance in the crowd .   hunter turned to jane .     is this important .     hunter asked quietly .      what do you mean .         this puzzles me     said hunter .     friends brawling with each other does not fit my data on human behavior .  as a roboticist  please inform me .         yes  this is important .     jane smiled indulgently .     and it   s reliable  at least in some circles and cultural milieus .  friendship is a complex idea .  store your new data .  i suspect that the buccaneers are going to show you a lot of new human behavior before we go home .      hunter nodded .      well  hunter .     steve looked up at him .     aren   t we going to keep looking for you know who .         yes  of course .  let us walk .        rita could hardly believe that she was actually talking to a real buccaneer .  she had always loved reading about the buccaneers when she had been young .  as an adult  she had chosen to make a career out of studying the history of the seventeenth century caribbean .  until roland had spoken to her  however  everyone had still seemed unreal .  talking to him had made her realize that she was truly in the past  as hunter led the way down the waterfront  with steve and jane behind him  rita and roland came last .      you have some pretty rough friends     she said  jerking her thumb back toward the tavern .      eh .  oh  them .     roland laughed .     no worse than i am  i fear .         oh .     rita laughed too  amused at his tone .     have you been in port royal long .         oh  coming and going  i   ve been here a few years     he said  waving his hand vaguely .      you mean sailing in and out of port .         aye .         searching for spanish ships .         privateering  rita .     he caught her eye and grinned .  that expression was almost a dare .      always .     she raised an eyebrow skeptically .      well .  .  . sometimes the governor   s commission can run out  you know  or a treaty will be signed across the sea in london .     he shrugged helplessly  still smiling .     what can a poor buccaneer do about that .         not a thing  i   m sure .     rita laughed  telling herself that getting to know a real buccaneer would advance her professional knowledge .      aye  sweet lady  not a single thing .     he winked and then threw his head back and laughed .      you ever kill anyone .     she nodded toward the rapier swinging in its scabbard at his side .      i   m still walking and talking  and not every man i   ve met on the high seas can say that .      that might have sounded grim  except for his lighthearted tone .  rita didn   t think he was bragging as much as he was laughing at himself .  she wondered if he was even better with the sword than he had admitted .   roland jerked his thumb  imitating her gesture  toward the big knife she had stuck into her sash .     you ever kill anyone .     he gave her a challenging smirk .      uh   well  i   m still walking and talking  too .     she smiled back .      so you are  rita .  so you are .      they walked in silence for a while .  every so often  roland greeted someone he knew .  hunter was easy to follow  since he towered head and shoulders above everyone else .   while hunter  steve  and jane moved ahead through the crowd  looking for mc    rita considered just how lucky she was to be here .   no historians had ever before had the chance to visit the era of human history they loved most .  only chad mora  the paleontologist who had accompanied hunter   s team to the age of dinosaurs  had been able to experience the time he had studied .  she wondered if roland had sailed on any ships she would remember studying .      roland       she stopped suddenly  not sure what she wanted to ask .  questioning a buccaneer about his adventures might be extremely unwise  and even dangerous  no matter how charming he appeared .      yes  rita .         uh   well  i   m curious about your adventures .  but i don   t want to pry into your affairs .         ah .  curious about the buccaneering life  eh .     roland grinned again .     well  no need to be shy  sweet lady  you wouldn   t be the first .         well .  .  . i didn   t think so .     she laughed  embarrassed .  since she couldn   t tell him why she was curious about him  she wasn   t sure what to say .      so tell me  rita     roland said lightly  with a wary glance at hunter in front of them .     would you like to get better acquainted  then .  and learn the buccaneer life .  see port royal as i know it .      rita knew in an instant that this was what she really wanted .  she also realized that hunter would object since he was so concerned about the first law and the danger that she might change human history if she wasn   t careful .  however  she simply did not share his belief that rather ordinary actions in this era of jamaican history would ultimately matter .  she reminded herself again that port royal would be drowned in an earthquake in just over twenty years .   she gave roland a quick nod .   roland waited until steve said something to hunter  distracting him .  rita knew  of course  that  as a robot  hunter had multiple sensors and the ability to monitor them all with his full attention if he wished .  however  he had no reason to keep track of rita at every moment and his attention was on steve   s comment .   suddenly roland grabbed her wrist and slipped sideways into the crowd  pulling her after him .  she saw that he was careful not to move too fast  or jostle anyone unnecessarily  that might attract hunter   s attention .  instead  he moved carefully and patiently  allowing them to blend into the crowd without disruption as they worked their way toward a small side street .   rita looked back over her shoulder at hunter  who was by then some distance away .  he was still walking in the same direction as before  unaware that she was no longer right behind him .  then roland pulled harder on her wrist and she hurried after him around a corner and out of hunter   s sight .      run  rita     roland called cheerily .  he began to jog  still pulling her after him .   with her free hand  she reached up to switch off the communicator pinned to her collar .  if hunter called her  it would make some sort of sound  and might attract roland   s attention .  she didn   t want to wind up drowned  hanged  or burned as a witch if a buccaneer heard voices apparently coming from nowhere .        hunter     said steve .     this is fun  but maybe we should find a place to spend the night .  like you said  if mc   is still microscopic  we can   t possibly find him yet .         a good point     said hunter  looking toward the wooden buildings lining the waterfront .     i see a number of signs for inns .  shall we try that one .     he pointed .   steve laughed  and caught jane   s eye .  shaking her head  she took hunter   s arm .      is this funny .     hunter asked .      we don   t want to stay in a waterfront inn     said jane .      too rough  hunter     said steve .      the accommodations must still be better than those in our previous trip .         it   s not the building  hunter     said steve  glancing at jane again with a suppressed smile .     it   s the company .  we need to find a place with a nicer clientele .         i understand now     said hunter .     so we should leave the waterfront and look around .     he stopped and turned .     rita  which way should we go .         yeah     steve said  also turning .     there must be a better part of town .  .  .  .     he trailed off  looking around .      rita .     jane called .      just lost in the crowd for a minute  i guess     said steve  peering at the faces of all the people who were walking past them .     rita .         no     said hunter .  he was holding his head high  standing motionless .     i do not see her anywhere nearby .  i have raised the sensitivity of my hearing  as well  and i do not hear her voice or roland   s  either .         you think he snatched her .     steve asked  still looking around in the crowd .     i should have been watching them  but this never occurred to me .         it was my failure  not yours     said hunter .     i failed my first law obligation again .  however  i doubt that she went under duress .  i would have noticed even the slightest scuffling or call for help originating right behind us .         he was a charmer  all right     said jane .     and rita seemed to like him right away .         we will have to pick up their trail     said hunter .     come on .     he started back the way they had come  his eyes scanning the crowd .      no point yelling for them     said steve .     if she sneaked away deliberately  they   ll both run harder if they know we   re looking for them .         maybe they aren   t really running     said jane .     maybe roland just stopped to introduce her to a friend .  or maybe she saw a booth where she wanted to look at something .         maybe     steve said reluctantly .     but she   s a historian  not a tourist .         that   s true     said jane .   hunter said nothing .        steve had never before seen hunter act with the precise mix of deliberation  sternness  and yet uncertainty that he exhibited after rita   s disappearance .  worried  steve leaned close to jane .     is hunter okay .  he   s talking in a monotone and walking like it   s a military march .  is he having another first law attack or something .         he   s okay so far .     said jane .     but his first law interpretation places rita   s welfare above that of the local population .  he   s vary anxious to find her .         yeah .     steve straightened again .     not to mention his fear that she   ll change history .         excuse me     hunter said politely  to a couple of young buccaneers walking nearby .     do you know a roland burke .  i am searching for him .         so .     they both laughed and moved on without breaking stride .      does anyone here know a roland burke .  has anyone seen him just now .     hunter shouted  and his booming voice attracted considerable attention .   no one responded  however .  they looked at him warily and just kept walking .      let   s go over there     said steve suddenly .  he pointed to a small knot of people .  in the center  a skinny  gray bearded man dressed only in ragged knee breeches was juggling four belaying pins .  steve led the way this time .   when the juggler had completed his performance  a few onlookers tossed coins into a scarf folded carefully at his feet .  steve stepped up quickly .  hunter and jane stayed where they were .      hold it  friends     steve called .     we   re looking for a friend named roland burke  or any other friend of his .  does anyone here know him .      most of the audience just walked away  but a couple of young men remained .      i   d say every third man on the waterfront knows roland     said one of them  a tall  burly man with curly hair .     what   s it to you .         we lost him in the crowd tonight     said steve .     just a moment ago .  where can we find him .         if he   s a friend of yours  why don   t you know that already .     the buccaneer who had spoken stepped in front of steve and glared down at him .      easy  friend     said hunter .      hunter       steve felt the big robot gently take his arm and pull him back .  as steve regained his balance  hunter moved in front of him .      i ain   t afraid of you  either     said the curly haired buccaneer .  he was nearly a head shorter than hunter  but hadn   t given any ground .   steve knew hunter didn   t want to hurt anyone  so he glanced around for a distraction .  a small circle of onlookers had formed around them .  he spied the juggler watching them  still holding his belaying pins .      how much do you want for one of those .     steve asked  nodding at the belaying pins .   the juggler grinned  showing gaps in his teeth .     nothin    .  i stole    em off my last ship .     he tossed one to steve  obviously expecting him to use it on someone as a club .   steve caught it .  the belaying pin was made of hardwood and was both heavy and sturdy .  it had a thick  oblong head and a narrower pin  long enough to hold as a handle .  on shipboard  a sailor would slip the looped end of a rope through the pin  then push the pin into one of the many holes drilled in the ship for that purpose .  that end of the rope would be held firm .  the shape made the pin perfect as a club too .   the curly haired buccaneer watched steve with caution but no fear .     you boys want a fight  you got it .         not me     said steve .     i just want to demonstrate something on my friend here .         and what would that be .         hold still  hunter     said steve .      okay     said hunter .   steve held the belaying pin as a club and reared back .  he swung it up and then down on hunter   s head as hard as he could .  the force of the blow shattered the hardwood and tore the remains from steve   s hand .  he gripped his sore hand with the other one  wincing .   hunter smiled politely at the buccaneers  who stared at him in amazement .      my friend has a hard head     said steve .   still not taking his eyes off hunter  the curly haired buccaneer reached down and picked up a chunk of the broken wood .     that   s the real thing  ain   t it .         quite heavy     hunter assured him .      would you like to take a turn .     steve asked him amiably .     our juggler friend has several more .      the curly haired pirate turned away and pushed through the crowd  followed by his companion .      thank you     said hunter .     you saved me the danger of a first law violation .         glad to help     said steve  grinning .      i never saw nothin    like it     said the juggler .     you must have the hardest head on the seven seas .         you know roland burke .     jane asked .      aye  i   ve met him .  but he ain   t passed me tonight .     the juggler shrugged apologetically .      do you know where he lives .     steve asked .      nay .  i don   t know him that well .  just to have a mug      grog now and then .         thank you     hunter said politely .      any time     said the juggler  still eyeing hunter   s head for evidence of a wound .   steve grinned at jane as they walked on .  hunter continued to lead the way  using his enhanced vision and hearing in the hope of detecting signs of roland or rita that his human companions could not possibly notice .  they followed him patiently  looking at the sights and pointing out different items of interest to each other from time to time .   they looked long into the night .  slowly  the crowd on the waterfront thinned out .  the only sounds that remained were those of the breaking surf and the drunken singing from some of the taverns .  hunter ventured down some of the side streets  always alert for danger .  jane and steve stayed close to him  but no one approached them .      hunter     jane said finally .     i know you can search all night  but i   m not sure it   s worth the effort .  we need some rest .  rita is probably just exploring with roland .      hunter looked at them both .     i know you need to sleep .  i shall also stay with you two  to make sure you are safe .  where should we go .         the town has quieted down now     said steve .     with you to protect us  i think we can get a room in an inn just off the waterfront without a problem .      they had to walk for a while longer  but finally steve and jane agreed that a place called the dover arms catered to a clientele of higher social class than the waterfront inns .  hunter paid for a sizable room .  inside  he hooked the wooden shutter closed over the window and barred the door .  then  as the two humans went to sleep in their beds  he sat down on a chair in the middle of the room  alert for any sounds of potential danger in this unfamiliar environment .     at that moment  rita sat with roland at a table in a small tavern .  no other customers remained .  her escort had given her a quick tour of the crowded waterfront and then tried his best to push several kinds of rum on her  without much success .  the tavernkeeper was wiping off the other tables with a dirty cloth .  roland studied rita   s face .      i still say  sweet lady  something is different about you that i don   t understand     said roland .      can you name what   s so different .     she smiled at him  still ignoring the tankard of rum he had bought for her some time earlier .      no     roland said  shaking his head slowly .     i cannot .  something i just can   t name .      rita hoped she hadn   t made a mistake .  she was tired  but still didn   t want to rejoin hunter yet .  this was her chance to find out what living in port royal was really like .  she idly fingered the handle of the knife in her sash .      i want a room to myself     she said  looking him in the eye .     with a bar on the door .  i can pay for it if you will find it for me .      roland smiled wryly .     i can do that for you .  now tell me why i should .      rita could feel the sweat on her palms .  if she couldn   t keep roland in a friendly mood  she could be in real trouble .  of course  she could still try to radio hunter  but he might be some distance away .      you will help me     she said carefully     because you still want to figure out somehow why i   m different .         aye .     roland grinned suddenly .     aye  you have me there .  but you   ll be my guest for breakfast in return .         fair enough .     rita gave him a confident smile  but inwardly she was very relieved .  maybe she really could handle this buccaneer .   roland accepted a couple of coins from her and spoke to the tavernkeeper .  they both escorted her upstairs  where she found a room a little larger than a closet and a plain  wooden bed with a thin mattress .  the tavernkeeper lit a short stub of candle that stood on the window sill .      it will do .     roland asked her .   she glanced behind the door and saw the bracket and wooden bar that would lock it securely .     yes  it will do .  thank you .      after they had left  she closed the door and slid the bar into place .  then she let out a long breath and smiled to herself .  she was all right so far .  weary after the excitement and tension of dealing with roland  she lay down on the bed and quickly fell asleep .     early the next morning  jane sat at an outdoor booth with hunter and steve .  the morning was still cool  with the tropical ocean breeze blowing gently through the streets .  she and steve were eating some sort of meat pastry that hunter had bought .  hunter  of course  was recharging his energy storage by letting the bright sun beat down on the solar power collectors hidden in the surface of his body .      well .     steve swallowed a big mouthful of his breakfast and turned to hunter .     so  how do you want us to look for rita today  hunter .         i am undecided     said hunter .   jane waited  expecting him to go on .  he didn   t .   jane and steve glanced at each other in surprise .  hunter was rarely undecided about something so simple and when he was  he usually wanted to discuss options .  worried  she lowered her pastry .  hunter was facing away from them  presumably searching for some sight or sound of rita or roland .      hunter     jane said quietly .     tell me under the second law .  you   re having a first law problem over rita   s disappearance  aren   t you .         affirmative     said hunter .      i instruct you to discuss it with us .  why is this worse now than it was late last night .         you know my inattention has allowed rita to leave the safety of my protection .  by now  she may have come to harm .  as you slept  i reviewed my data about port royal and the buccaneer society .  the chance of her having come to harm last night is very high .         i understand     said jane .     now listen carefully to your roboticist .         yes .         you are still dealing only in probabilities .  rita may still be perfectly well  but in potential danger .  she  and we  need you at peak efficiency .         i am clearly not at peak efficiency .  if i had been last night  i would have not have lost her .         i dispute that judgment .  none of us had any reason to think she would slip away from us of her own accord .         you humans are not obligated by the first law to look after her .         your misjudgment of her behavior is not in and of itself a first law failure .         it led to one .  after all  the first law says in part that a robot may not allow a human to come to harm through inaction .  it makes no exception for errors of judgment .         nor does it blame you for what may be happening .  until and unless you know that rita has been harmed  you don   t know that you have broken the first law .         come on  hunter     steve interrupted with forced cheer .     enough talk .  let   s find rita .         all right .     hunter still sounded uncertain  but he led them away from the booth .     we shall walk around some more .  i have continued sending out a radio signal to her communicator  but she has not responded .      jane caught steve   s eye and smiled .  sometimes his pragmatic suggestions were worth more to hunter than all of her theoretical arguments combined .  steve fell into step with her behind hunter .   they found the waterfront changed .  instead of the wild  carousing buccaneers  jane saw the ordinary people who kept the town functioning .  small fishing boats swayed on the waves out at sea  shopkeepers were just hanging out their wares .  in fact  a few of the earliest fishing boats were already returning to the docks with their morning catch .      great climate  huh .     steve spread his arms expansively .     light breeze  blue water  tropical flowers everywhere .  i never see anything like this in the mojave desert .         it   s beautiful here     jane agreed .  she was still watching hunter  but he now seemed to be acting almost normally as he looked at and listened to their surroundings .      pretty carefree life style around here  isn   t it .     steve nodded toward a woman chasing a couple of barefoot toddlers around a fruit stand .      yes  it is     jane said  amused at the scene .      hey  not you  too .  come on .  you can still enjoy the climate while we look for rita .         i have to admit  i   m worried about her .  this is a pirate town  after all .      steve nodded .     yeah  me  too .  but do you have any ideas about how to find her .         no  not really .      they continued to search for another hour without success .  even when the buccaneers who had been carousing the night before stumbled out to start their day  they were hung over .  none of them were especially belligerent  but hunter couldn   t find anyone who could tell them where to find roland .      i have a suggestion     steve said finally .     if it won   t upset your first law .         yes .     hunter stopped to look at him .      we really should split up and look through more of the town than the waterfront .         i cannot risk           separating from either of us  i know     said steve quickly .     look  we aren   t going to run out on you .  and now we each have communicators .  jane and i will go together  if we run into any kind of problem  at least one of us can call you .         i   ll stay with hunter     said jane .     in case we have to discuss the first law more .         then i   ll be fine alone     said steve .      very well     said hunter .     you will be careful .         promise     said steve .        as steve jauntily marched away down a side street  jane watched hunter carefully .      hunter     said jane .     this question of your efficiency under the first law came up during our last mission .  i know that a clear  serious failure to obey the first law can force a positronic robot to shut down .  how close are you to making that decision .         i am not approaching that point yet .         for the same reason you functioned through this doubt last time  as well .         yes .  my responsibility to take care of you and steve forces me to continue functioning longer than i might in our own time  where you could better take care of yourselves or find another robot to help you .         good     said jane .     you   re right  we need you and so does the larger mission to find mc   .  please focus on the fact that we have no one to take your place .         agreed     said hunter .     rita woke up with a surge of excitement at the first hints of dawn shining through the cracks around the closed wooden window .  she dressed quickly and unbarred the door .  pausing to take a deep breath  she walked downstairs .      good morning  sweet lady     said roland  waving to her .  he got up from the chair in which he had apparently been waiting for her .     i shall take you to breakfast .         i  urn  need a water pump to wash up and the private facilities .         outside in the back     said the tavernkeeper  who was wiping the bar .   when rita had freshened up the best she could  she joined roland again .      i shall take you to the best stall in town     said roland  turning to the left .     it   s away from the waterfront about a block .  on the docks  these drunken louts don   t always care what they eat .      rita laughed and walked with him .  she liked looking around at the sights  enjoying the feeling that she was a part of the seventeenth century .  roland couldn   t tell just how much of a stranger she was to port royal  that was the best compliment to her expertise she had ever received .   hunter could certainly find mc   without her  she had given them a lot of basic information about port royal   s history and culture already .  she told herself that hunter and his party didn   t really need her .  right now  she wouldn   t even mind if they went home without her .   after all  hunter was the one who believed that almost any small action could change all of human history in the future .  that sounded crazy to her  at least in this case .  suppose she spent the rest of her life in jamaica .  all she would have to do was be careful and stay out of port royal in       when the big earthquake would drown the town forever .  that would happen in twenty four years .  certainly she wouldn   t ever do anything that would change history .      here we are     roland said cheerily  gesturing at a crowded open air stall .     buns  sweet cakes  meat pastries  dried fish  fresh fish  and fresh fruit .  what is your pleasure .         uh .  .  . i   m not sure .  you know this place .  get me the best they have .         as you wish  of course .  are you a little hungry  or very hungry  or somewhere in between .         i   m very hungry .         ah .  i   m glad .      roland ordered two of nearly everything and carried it all on a couple of wide  green leaves to a plank table and bench .  as rita sat down  he went back to the proprietor and returned with two mugs of some kind of herbal tea .  she bit carefully into one of the buns and found it quite good .   rita ate quickly  being too hungry to indulge in conversation .  roland watched her with interest  pushing one item after another toward her .  the dried fish was very salty  of course  as was the meat in the meat pastry .  on the other hand  the bananas were exactly the same as in her own time  though a little more bruised .      i have a bit of business     roland said after a while .     you will sit and wait for me here .         i   d like to see the sights     said rita .     i   ll hurry if you can wait .         oh  i dare not take you with me this time .     roland grinned and rested one hand on his sword hilt .      uh   oh .     she looked up at him in surprise .     you mean  uh  you might           it   s probably nothing     said roland .     but i would not take you into such danger .  will you wait for me here  even after you   ve finished your breakfast .         of course i will     she said  flattered by his concern .     i   ll wait right here .  besides  this stuff is good .  um   am i safe here .         aye  you   ve been seen with me .     with another quick grin  he rose from his seat and slipped away through the growing crowd .   she watched him go  admiring his lithe  energetic walk .  he looked as though he would be a good fencer  quick and agile .  she wondered if he would get into a duel with some other buccaneer .  they could be fighting over money  of course  or something more complicated .  she also wondered if he would live .  from the viewpoint of her own time  of course  he was long dead of one cause or another .  he just didn   t know what would kill him or when it would happen .     dr .  wayne nystrom sat in the shade of an awning which extended over the front of a tavern .  it was a more expensive spot than most of the waterfront dives  catering to the wealthier customers  sometimes even nobility  who passed through port royal .  he sipped a mug of herbal tea  waiting patiently .   wayne had arrived two days before  estimating that mc   would return to his normal size about then .  since he wanted to maximize his chance of finding the fugitive robot  he did not just rely on his own personal search .  he had struck up a conversation with a friendly young buccaneer and hired him to look for several individuals .   when roland came into sight  wayne waved to him .  they had arranged to rendezvous at the tavern this morning .  roland grinned and sat down .      i bid you good morning     said roland  glancing at the comfortable surroundings .     i don   t doubt your wealth  wayne  after you paid me in hard coin a few days ago instead of bartering with me  as most buccaneers would .  but you certainly don   t dress like a rich man .         i   m wealthy enough to dress as i please .     wayne took another drink of his herbal tea  hiding behind the cup .     order as you wish  as my guest .      wayne was still wearing the casual clothes of his own time that he had been wearing when he had arrived in mojave center .  his journey into the past had been rushed and unplanned  leaving him no chance to prepare ahead of time .  he had arrived with a backpack containing a change of clothes and some personal items .  selling a brightly colored machine knit sweater to a drunken buccaneer had brought enough money to pay roland and eat at a cheap booth  with some coins left over .  he had only come to the tavern to drink tea in order to make an impression on roland .      no need     said roland .     i   ve found that group you hired me to look for .         already .  good .     wayne raised his eyebrows .     describe them to me .         big fellow named hunter  gigantic .  strong enough to throw two men around at the same time  one in each hand  but he doesn   t really like to fight .  avoided it  i think .         go on .         steve .  he   s a young man  dark like a spaniard or a moor  but not exactly .         you ever hear of cathay .     wayne was amused .  he had only glimpsed steve chang  but he knew that he was of chinese descent .  even in this age of sail  the chinese and europeans had not mixed much except for a few sailors and traders .      of course .  maybe i   ll sail there someday .     roland shrugged offhandedly .      maybe you will .  who else .         they have two women with them .  one is named jane  the other rita .         yes  that   s them .     wayne had not known about rita  but he said nothing about her .  he did not want roland to know he was surprised .  obviously  hunter had changed his team a little to fit their particular destination .      you promised me extra pay if i disrupted hunter   s party somehow .         that   s right .  what are you going to do .         it   s what i   ve already done .         yeah .  what   s that .         the lady rita seems to enjoy my company .  she sneaked off with me last night and i put her up alone in a room .  we are breakfasting together and  even now  she is waiting for me to hurry back .         excellent .     wayne smiled .     yes  yes .  very well done .     he knew that rita   s separation from hunter would trigger the robot   s first law imperative to find her .  that would interfere with his search for mc   and give wayne and roland a better chance of finding mc   first .      i rather enjoy her company myself .         good .  keep her away from hunter as long as you can .  and she likes you .  even better .         i can do that .  but  uh .  .  .     roland grinned and held out his hand .   wayne nodded and pulled a few more coins out of his pocket .  he did not have much left  but could not afford to admit that  or even look reluctant .  before he saw roland again  he would have to find some more money .  for the moment  he tossed the coins to roland casually  as though they meant nothing to him .      so     said wayne .     have you seen anyone who fits my other friend   s description .         the man you call by his initials  mc   .     roland took a careful glance at the coins before slipping them into a pocket .     i haven   t seen him  but i   ve put the word out among my friends and shipmates .  they don   t know why i want him  but they   ll tell me if they see him .  a short  slight fellow  you say  likely to be poorly dressed and a bit confused .         yes     said wayne .     for all i know  he may be desperately searching for a pair of pants .      roland laughed .     that poor  eh .  what happened to him .  press gang grab him in england and let him escape here .         something like that     said wayne .     he   ll try to blend in .  he won   t know right away that anyone is here looking for him  but he   ll run if he finds out i want to speak to him .         he knows hunter as well  i presume .         not personally  no .         even better .  well  i must be off .  rita may not wait for me forever .         good job  roland     said wayne .     the longer you can keep rita from returning to hunter  the more compensation i will have for you .         well enough .     roland gave him a brisk  cheerful wave and strode away .   wayne watched him go  wondering if he could get enough money to keep roland happy .  mc   might not return to normal size for a day or two  and even then he might escape wayne   s notice for quite some time .  wayne didn   t know how much he might eventually have to pay roland so that he would continue distracting hunter from the search for mc   .     when steve left hunter  he began improvising .  somehow  when hunter was leading the team  his inexorable robot logic stifled steve   s spontaneity .  alone  steve felt more relaxed and able to follow his intuition without having to explain everything to hunter .   steve walked up and down several side streets  staying close to the waterfront without confining himself to it .  he watched where people went and how they were dressed  gradually identifying some parts of town as more crowded and rougher than others .  he saw which streets were thoroughfares and which ones only drew people who had business there .   on one block  a particularly impressive building caught his attention .  a two story wooden structure  it boasted a new coat of brown paint and a carefully tended bed of flowers along its front wall .  an awning over the front entrance shaded some tables and chairs from the tropical sunlight .  none of the other taverns he had seen was this elaborate .  he was startled to see a man in modern clothes sitting at one of the tables  whom he suddenly recognized as dr .  wayne nystrom .   steve stopped where he was  then quickly dodged to one side  behind a large bush growing by the side of the street .  then  sure that wayne hadn   t seen him yet  he peered through the big leaves on the bush .  roland  who had been talking to wayne  was just leaving  giving wayne a quick wave as he walked away .  steve tensed  waiting to see which way roland would go  but he walked away from steve up the narrow street .   steve saw that rita was not with either one of them .  that worried him  though he would have preferred to see her with wayne  steve doubted he would hurt her .  he understood  though  that wayne was using roland to sabotage hunter   s search .  that much was obvious .   steve glanced over his shoulder and waited for a couple of passersby to move on .  wayne was still sitting at the table .  steve pressed the button on the communicator pinned to his shirt and spoke quietly .      hunter  steve here .  wayne nystrom is here and roland is working with him .  i   ve seen them together  but rita wasn   t with them .         give me your location     said hunter .     we will join you as soon as we can .         he   s getting up     steve said suddenly .     he   s walking away .  i   ll tail him  hunter  and keep talking so you can track me .  he   s turning .  .  . toward the waterfront .         what is the name of your street .     hunter asked .     we can intercept him .         uh       steve glanced around but saw no signs anywhere .     i can   t tell .  i don   t see a sign .  this place is pretty haphazard compared to a city like mojave center .         i understand .  continue speaking and i will follow your signal .  your voice will be clearer than the static and background street sounds alone .         here goes     said steve  as he moved down the street at a safe distance behind wayne .     i don   t want him to see me because that will really put him on the defensive .  i don   t know if he has rita locked up somewhere or if she   s still with roland .         when i have caught wayne     said hunter     i believe we can learn something about her .  wait for me to join you .  otherwise  i fear that he will escape you .  also  i am concerned that a real fight may attract attention and alter the behavior of the locals .  i do not want to risk their involvement .         he may get away anyhow     said steve .     i can   t follow him too closely .  this street doesn   t have enough people on it for me to hide among .  if he turns  he   ll see me .         your signal is much stronger     said hunter .     we are walking as quickly as we can without attracting a great deal of attention .         he just turned onto the waterfront .  he   s walking west and looking at stuff in the booths and shops .     steve shifted into a jog as wayne moved around a corner .   by the time steve had rounded the corner  wayne was out of sight .  steve looked around frantically  then saw him again  idly examining a clay pot that was for sale .      if it   s a choice of grabbing wayne or losing him  which should i do .         do not risk a disturbance     hunter said firmly .        rita finished her herbal tea  glancing about for both roland and hunter   s team .  since every sight was new and exciting to her  the time passed quickly .  she wondered if roland had survived his duel  or whatever he had gone to do .  then she also wondered if he had just wanted an excuse to leave her  but that didn   t make sense .  if he had tired of her company  he could have simply stayed away that morning .   when roland came striding back down the street  he was smiling as cheerfully as ever .      finished  sweet lady .         just finished .  dm  how was your .  .  . business .         easy  rita .  no problem at all .         well  that   s good .     she decided she had better not ask what he had really been doing .  a buccaneer wouldn   t like a stranger prying .      and now  will you accompany me for a walk along the docks .  in the salt spray and morning sunshine .         i   ve seen the docks     she said  thinking to herself that hunter might still be looking for her there .     how about showing me the rest of the town .      he smiled engagingly .     that  too  can be done .  but for now  will you indulge me .         sure .     she followed him  reflecting that hunter would probably catch up to her sooner or later  anyway .  besides  maybe he was focused on finding mc   and wouldn   t worry about her until later .     hunter  still listening on his internal receiver to steve   s quiet chatter  led jane quickly down the waterfront  scanning the booths .  she hurried to keep up with his long strides .  the area was crowded .      i see you  steve     hunter radioed .     look back over your left shoulder .      up ahead  steve did so and saw hunter .  he didn   t seem to be in much of a hurry .  steve stopped and waited for hunter and jane to catch up .  then he just shook his head .      sorry  hunter     steve said .     i didn   t dare get too close .  then i lost him in the crowd .         what was he doing .     jane asked .      just browsing in the booths and shops .  killing time  it seemed to me .         we will keep moving     said hunter .     now that we are together  we can apprehend him if necessary .  i will be present to see that the first law is not violated .         finding him in this crowd will be tough     said jane .     now it   s almost as dense as it was last night .      hunter nodded and once again led the way .   rita found the waterfront much more exciting on her second visit .  in the daylight  she breathed in the salt air deeply and saw the sea gulls circling and diving over the water .  best of all  though  were the tall masted ships anchored out in the bay .  those ships  even more than the buccaneers themselves  truly represented the era .      a pretty sight  is it not .     roland nodded toward the crowd of ships .      fascinating .         i hear there is a merchantman out there of two hundred eighty tons that can take you back to old england in four weeks .     he grinned .     not that i have any wish to go back  but it takes a fine ship to do that .         a month .     rita suppressed a smile  thinking of how the supersonic planes of her own time could make the jump between lunch and dinner on the same day .      the mere wink of an eye     said roland .     do you like ships  then .         they   re beautiful     said rita .      you must have traveled by ship .  that is  unless you were born and raised on jamaica .         uh   no  i   m not from jamaica .  but i don   t really know ships .         let me help you .  you see the biggest ones out there .  only two or three are in sight .         the three masted square riggers .     again  rita fought down a smile .  from her book learning  she knew more about the ships of the era than roland ever would .  on the other hand  he had actually sailed them  she had never even seen a real one before .      that   s right .     he pointed to one .     those are the finest flagships of a buccaneer fleet .  each one is big enough to slug it out with even a naval frigate .  they can also handle a long sea voyage .      rita pointed to some smaller ships that were also three masted and square rigged .     what are those  then .  they look similar .     of course  she knew very well what they were  but she wanted to keep him talking .  once he had explained the ships  she would no longer have to feign ignorance .      merchant ships  including the one i told you about a moment ago .     he winked at her .     some are here trading legally .  others were  shall we say  brought here by those of us under the governor   s commission .         what do you call the bigger of the two masted ships .     she pointed to one of them .      those are brigantines  fine and reliable workhorses .  they can take different sails  too  at different times  to suit different conditions .         what about the little ones .         ah .  my personal favorites  those .  the smaller two masted ships are schooners  perfect in these waters for their speed and shallow draft .  the smallest of all are single masted sloops  the fastest ships on the water .         why are there so many ships in the harbor .  is that normal .     she didn   t think it was  but of course the exact number would be changing day by day .      normal  is it .     roland shrugged .     ships come and go all the time .         have you sailed on some of these .     rita winked back at him  smiling .     maybe on the governor   s commission and maybe without it .      he threw back his head and laughed .     aye  that i have .  a fine brigantine out there is captained by a man named quinn .  the hungry hawk is her name .  i   ve sailed with captain quinn a number of times .  when he needs a crew  i usually hear about it .         do you always go .         if the mood strikes me  aye .  i   m not bound to him .  but he has a keen eye on the open sea .  a man can make a profit with a good captain .         roland .      at the sound of a man   s voice  they both turned .  a big  brawny man with a brown beard  wearing tattered knee breeches and nothing else  hurried toward them .  he gave rita a suspicious glance and she turned away to look at the ships again .  she was still listening carefully  but she felt she had a better chance of overhearing something interesting if the two buccaneers thought she was distracted .      what is it  ned .     roland glanced at rita  lowering his voice .     no need to attract attention .         aye  well .     he spoke lower  but rita could still hear him .     i think we found him .  that little fellow you were looking for .  want to see him .         that i do .  where is he .         baldy jim has him in a shed .  you know the one .         i know it .     roland drew a coin out of his pocket and pressed it into ned   s large hand .     we   ll meet you there in a bit .  go back and make certain baldy doesn   t lose him  all right .      ned nodded and rushed away .   roland turned and studied rita   s face .   what she had heard sounded like a kidnapping to her .  she gave him an expression that she hoped was guileless .     do you have more business to take care of .         happens that i do     said roland .     it won   t be dangerous this time  though .  care to come along .         sure .     rita was surprised .  she had expected him to tell her it was buccaneer business .     i   d love to .         all right  then .  this way .      as they walked  though  she felt that he was a little more subdued .  apparently something was on his mind .  he was still pleasant and still smiling  but he didn   t point out any more sights .   they walked briskly up the waterfront after ned .  soon they had left behind the piers and booths and reached a shipyard .  there lumber  pitch  canvas  and hemp were stored with other items that ships needed to be outfitted and repaired .   fewer people were around  but those rita could see were all working on something .  roland nodded briefly to a couple of them who glanced up .  he led her through a maze of the shipbuilding materials and broken  discarded refuse .   roland walked up to a storage shed  kicking aside some old bits of rope .  the shed was made of unfinished wood that was warped from the humidity and tropical sunlight .  he rapped twice on the door .   the door opened and ned stuck his head out .  then he pushed the door open wider  looking at rita in surprise .  he said nothing  though  and roland held the door open for rita .   the heat and humidity in the shed were stifling .  a small window was open high in the back  but little breeze came in through it .  rita saw a short  muscular man with a slick bald head standing by the window .  a very short  slender man with rather ordinary  western european features was sitting motionless on a small keg .      that   s him  ain   t he  roland .     ned nodded toward the silent figure .      must be     said roland  looking him over .     can   t be many fellows his size in port royal .  did you ask him his name .  who are you  fellow .         don   t waste your time     said ned .     he   s real obedient most times  like if you tell him to sit or walk or whistle a tune .  but if you ask him his name or where he   s been or anything personal like  he don   t make a sound .      rita tensed  suddenly looking more closely at the seated figure .      funny .  but i suppose we can make him talk if we want  now  can   t we .         we ain   t tried  jim and me     said ned .     since we nabbed him for you  we didn   t want to risk hurting him .         he   s a tough little bird     said baldy jim .     he ain   t complained once about the heat in here .  ain   t even broke out a sweat that i can see .         what   s your name .     roland asked him .   the seated figure looked up at him but said nothing .      where did you find him .     roland was still looking at the prisoner .      a couple o    fellows saw him creeping around down here last night     said baldy jim .      what was he doing .     roland asked .      well  he didn   t have no clothes and he was digging around in a rag heap .  he found an old pair of breeches there and put    em on .  that   s when our pals nabbed him and brought him to me .  we all had the word from you to be on the lookout for him .      roland nodded thoughtfully .   rita knew the seated figure was mc   .  everything she had heard and seen fit his description  he was small of stature  he had appeared without clothing  he was obedient under the second law .  yet if  instead of ordering him to provide information  they simply posed questions  he was free to ignore them .   rita had to decide what to do .  for the moment  she wanted to stay with roland .  since he seemed to be in charge of mc    she could stay with roland and keep track of mc   as well .  then  when she was ready  she could simply call hunter on her communicator and arrange for him to apprehend mc   .   she concluded that roland  despite the arguments of the group  must be looking for some man of his own time who fit mc     s description .  certainly she didn   t see how an english buccaneer in port royal could be    on the lookout     as baldy jim had said  for a robot .   roland leaned past her to look out the doorway .  she watched his face and saw that he looked all the way down the waterfront again  carefully .  he said nothing  however  and moved back inside the shed .      look  ned     said roland .     do you happen to know if any ships are heading out soon .  like maybe the hungry hawk .  captain quinn asked me to crew with him a few days ago  and he   s still in the harbor .         that   s right     said ned .     quinn is sailing on the midday tide  but he has a full crew .  baldy jim here tried to join him and they put him off .         all right     roland said quickly  tossing them both another coin .     here   s what we   ll do .  bring a dinghy around  quick .  quinn owes me a few favors .  we   re going to the rag heap  then we   ll meet you at the dock .         right o     said ned .   all the humans left the shed .  mc   remained impassively on the keg .  rita couldn   t talk to him alone  and she didn   t want the buccaneers  even roland  to know that she had special knowledge about their captive .      i   ll watch him     said roland     no need to lock it .      while the other two men went to find a dinghy  roland led rita without a word to a pile of refuse on the far side of the shed .  most of it was rags  but he pulled out a couple of torn articles of clothing that were basically still whole .  he tossed them to her .      you   re much too ladylike  sweet lady .  we   re going on board a ship .  look as ragged and dirty as you can  and like a cabin boy if possible .      a thrill of excitement hit rita all at once .  she was actually going on board a pirate ship about to set sail .  anxiously  she shook out the old clothes he tossed her .  finally she found a pair of loose  baggy pants  a tattered  patched man   s shirt  and a torn leather vest that she could wear over it .      these will fit     said rita  with a reluctant  wry smile .      change in the shed     said roland .     i   ll have our friend come out and stand with me .             soon rita was dressed in filthy  baggy clothes  carrying her others in a tight bundle .  she followed roland and mc   to the nearest dock .  ned and baldy jim were waiting there with a dinghy that tossed lightly on the waves .      get in  shorty     ned said to mc   .   mc   obeyed without speaking and found a seat in the middle .  roland helped rita climb down into the boat  then followed her .  the buccaneers pushed off and began to row .  roland also took an oar and pointed to another for mc    who took it obediently .   rita breathed in the sea air and let the spray hit her as it came over the side of the boat .  slowly but steadily  they drew nearer the big anchored ships .  she searched her memory for the political situation in the caribbean in      .   england  france  and spain were at peace with each other .  that meant the buccaneers couldn   t get legal commissions from the governor of jamaica as privateers .  so when their money ran low  they would just go out and pirate a ship on their own  as outlaws .  as long as their prey was not british  however  they had some confidence that the governor would look the other way .   soon rita saw that they were rowing for a brigantine named the hungry hawk .  it was a two masted square rigger  well weathered .  the ship had not seen fresh paint for a long time  but the sails and ropes were in good condition .  sailors on board saw them coming and began yelling to each other .      ahoy .     roland cupped his hands around his mouth .     ahoy the hungry hawk .  where   s captain quinn .      the sailors shouted for their captain  who came striding to the rail .  rita was hoping  despite her historical knowledge  that he might be a wild looking character with a villainous stare  but of course she knew better than to expect that much melodrama .  captain quinn was a man of average height and medium build with a brown beard .  he wore a plain linen shirt and knee breeches  like most of his buccaneer colleagues  but he also wore a broad brimmed hat with a blue plume .      you   re too late  roland     called captain quinn .     we have a full crew already .         i have some trouble     roland shouted back .     and a couple of friends with me .      captain quinn frowned and studied the group in the dinghy .     how many altogether .         three of us .  we need to get out of port royal for a bit .  can you help .         come on  then .     captain quinn waved for his men to throw down a rope ladder .   rita could see that roland   s need to leave town was the kind of argument that captain quinn and the other buccaneers understood easily .  she waited to see what roland wanted her to do  remembering that she was masquerading as a cabin boy if the buccaneers would buy that .  if they didn   t  she would have to hope that roland could protect her on board the ship .   roland grabbed the rope ladder and climbed up a few rungs .  then he motioned for rita to follow .  she took hold of the rough  thick rope carefully and felt the lowest rung sag slightly under her weight .  when she started climbing  though  she found it fairly easy to do .      you next     roland called down to mc   .   mc   obediently began to follow rita .  after what seemed like a very long  slow  clumsy climb  she finally reached the rail of the ship .  roland took her arm and helped her over the rail onto the deck  then did the same with mc   .      captain  these two young fellows are rye and shorty     said roland  tapping rita and mc   on the shoulder in turn .     they don   t speak much and i like it that way .  but they   ll do as i say on board .         fair enough .     captain quinn nodded to both of them .     you   ve always been a fine man to have  roland .  but tell me  now .  how serious is the trouble in town .         it   s not the governor     said roland  lowering his voice conspiratorially .     a very big  brawny fellow and his mates are out to do harm to my young friends  here .  we just need to give them time to cool off .         i understand .  you see your boys pull their own weight in the work .     he glanced over the side to ned and baldy jim  who were still waiting .     them  too  i guess .         they   re good men  with many months on the seas     said roland .     they   ve hauled in plenty of spanish gold in their time .         all right .     captain quinn turned to another man .     help them pull that dinghy aboard .     he slapped roland on the back and walked away .   rita let out a quiet sigh of relief .  roland winked at her .  mc   remained motionless .        i   m sorry i lost wayne  hunter     said steve  looking up and down the waterfront .      at least we known for sure he is nearby     said hunter .     if he has learned more about mc   than we have  then his presence is further evidence that mc   may be here too .         thanks for the nice words     said steve .     but i still feel lousy .  i shouldn   t have lost him .         every moment that goes by increases the chance that mc   is now visible at full size     said jane .     theoretically  he could be anywhere in town  or even somewhere else on the island  but i don   t take that seriously .         why not .     hunter asked  still looking over the crowd as they walked .      once he has reached full size  he will either have to avoid human society completely to be safe from the imperatives of the three laws of robotics  or else he will have to study the local culture very carefully in order to understand the customs and language .  that   s the only way he can live among humans and still obey the laws .         makes sense     said steve .     and you pointed out before that he   ll need clothes .         since the nuclear explosion in our own time was centered in the remains of port royal  he obviously didn   t go hide out in the mountains to stay     said jane .     and if he   s in town  the waterfront is the best location for displaced humans to find their way .  strangers come and go here all the time and no one thinks much of it .  many of them are destitute  too  and that will also camouflage mc   .         this is very logical     said hunter .     so we will continue looking for him here .         i wish we could do more than just walk around and look     said steve .      i have tried to call mc   directly by radio     said hunter .     i also have done that with rita  and received no response from either one .  if mc   is listening  he knows that someone with the capability of radio transmission is here and he has chosen to remain out of contact .         he has probably turned off his receiver     said jane .     for the same reason mc   did on our last mission .  as soon as he heard your first signal  he knew someone might have come to find him  so he   s avoiding the chance of hearing a human voice under the second law .         i suspect you are right     said hunter .     however  that may be just as well .  we might have a better chance to catch mc   if he cannot approximate my position from measuring the strength of my radio signal and my movements .     as he spoke  he continued to look in all directions on a regular basis .      hunter     said steve .     i   m no historian like rita  but i think i understand how this town operates .  people know a lot more than they tell strangers and they   re all suspicious of authority .  bribes and payment for information will probably work a lot better here than just walking around asking polite questions .         my data tell me that bribes are illegal and ethically objectionable     said hunter .     of course  i realize that laws and customs may be different here  but if they are wrong because humans would be harmed           think of it this way  hunter     said jane quickly .     this buccaneer society is a barely functioning anarchy .  further  it   s definitely a free port with a laissez faire economy .  you have all these terms in your stored data  i   m sure .         yes .  i understand what you mean .         good .  then you   re using these more technical terms now to access your data on human societies .         yes .         then in order to accept steve   s advice under the first law  i think all you have to understand is that this system worked to some degree in this time and place in history .  how does that strike you .         i see what you mean     said hunter .     but for the moment  bribery will not be necessary .     he stopped where he was  looking out into the bay .      what is it  hunter .     steve looked  too  but he couldn   t tell where  among all the ships out in the harbor  hunter was focusing his attention .   hunter pointed .     your unmagnified human vision cannot recognize faces from this distance  but you can see the dinghy that has rowed up to the second ship from the left .         i see it     said jane .     who   s in it .         roland  rita  and mc   are climbing from the dinghy up to the deck of the ship on a rope ladder .  two other men are holding the boat steady for them .         you   re sure it   s mc   .     jane asked .      he is identical to mc   .         they   re going on board a pirate ship .     steve was amazed .     what does she think she   s doing .         she   s on a great adventure     said jane  grimly .     and she   s the one who doesn   t believe that any actions except the most significant ones can change history  especially from this little backwater town .         at least she has the freedom of human judgment     said hunter .     i am more afraid of mc   .  he may feel that under the first law he must break up fights   i feel that impulse strongly myself .  he is more likely than she to change history  i think .         we can   t just let them go     said steve .     how are we going to follow them .        wayne stood near the far end of the docks by a stack of barrels of pitch  catching his breath after a long  frantic run in the humid midday heat .  he had seen the dinghy being rowed out into the bay with roland and mc   when it was still close enough for the passengers to be recognized .  desperately  he had tried to push his way through the crowd  shouting for them to stop .  no one in the dinghy had even turned to look  though  and he was sure they had not been able to hear him .  he had not recognized the others in the boat .      roland     wayne muttered in puzzlement .     what possible reason could you have for running off with mc   .      he was still watching in frustration as the dinghy slowly drew up to one of the ships in the harbor .  then suddenly a possibility occurred to him .  if roland had figured out that mc   always protected humans and obeyed orders  then he might want to keep him around .  mc   would make a perfect servant and bodyguard for a buccaneer .  however  if that were true  then roland had no intention now of bringing mc   back to wayne .      lousy pirate     wayne said angrily .     can   t trust him .  now i   ll have to get mc   back myself .  well .  .  .  at least i know where he is .        steve helplessly watched the dinghy being hoisted on board the ship .     we   re going to lose them  hunter  if we just stand here .         the name of the ship is the hungry hawk     said hunter .     i can read it painted on the side .  but i do not have the money to hire a ship to follow them .  nor can we expect to get it .         i have an idea     said steve .     but hear me out  okay .  you might not like it at first .         agreed     said hunter .      can   t we get enough lumber for a small  fast moving sailboat .  i can give you a modern design and you can calculate the exact specifications we   ll need .         a modern design might catch on     said hunter .     and change the course of sailing technology in history .         no .  that   s my point   when we   re finished with it  we   ll destroy it   sink it or take it apart .  we won   t leave any evidence .         what type of design do you have in mind .         a small outrigger     said steve .     it will only have to carry the three of us and some drinking water and food .  for speed  we   ll want a high mast and a deep keel to balance it .  the outrigger design can give us greater stability than we would have otherwise   that   s the part that no one here in jamaica right now is using .         i have accessed some data on sailing design     said hunter .     i believe we might have enough money to buy the lumber for such a boat .  i also see that the outrigger may well work  but i fear that someone will see the idea behind it and try to use it in the near future .  it is the concept  not the exact design  that is important and might trigger a change in history .         i wish we had our historian here     said jane .     she hasn   t been any help since she sneaked away .  but really  hunter  i doubt that the outrigger idea would be used here anyway because it isn   t necessary .         how   s that .     steve looked at her .      my study of robotics included some history of technological development .  technological change is related to need as well as to concept .  for instance  much of the sailing technology that was used by the early explorers in columbus   s generation had been in use for a century already in dutch windmills .  it only came into sailing use after the desire to explore by sea became more intense following the fall of constantinople .         in other words     said steve     you think people here won   t care about the outrigger because the ships they already have are doing what they need .         well  yes .  i guess i was a little long winded  huh .     she smiled self consciously .     what do you think  hunter .         i understand     said hunter .      shall we try it .     steve asked .      yes .  we must find a place to buy the lumber .  i will calculate our exact material requirements as we go .        rita stood with mc   by the rail  out of the way of the crew  as the ship set sail .  she watched the men in the rigging and on deck with fascination .  none of the book learning she had acquired over the years could replace actually standing on the deck with them  breathing the salt air and listening to the wood creak under the pressure of the sea and the wind .      we have a good wind .     roland strode up to them  grinning .     i helped a little just to take part  but they don   t need me .  as the captain said  they had a full crew before we came aboard .     he looked at mc   .     so  shorty .  you like going to sea .         yes     said mc   .      where are you from  friend .  old england  or one of the colonies .     roland spoke casually  but he was watching mc     s face carefully .      a colony     said mc   .      which one .         virginia .         virginia .     roland thought a moment .     that   s up on the mainland coast  isn   t it .         yes .         how long have you been in jamaica .         not long .      roland watched him a moment  then just gave him a friendly pat on the shoulder and turned to watch port royal slowly shrink behind them .   rita guessed that mc   was being careful under the third law of robotics  which required him to protect himself if he could do so without violating the other two laws .  that would explain his reluctance to converse .  she didn   t know if he had really been manufactured in virginia or not  of course  but it was possible .   she turned her back on both roland and mc   and gazed out to the open sea .         wayne knew he had very little time to follow the hungry hawk before it was lost on the open sea .  his only hope was to find someone with a ship already outfitted who was willing to sail .  he paced up and down one of the docks  squinting into the sunlight as he studied the ships .      no use     he said to himself  finally .  the distance was too great for him to see the kinds of details that would tell him if a ship out there was supplied for a voyage .  he glanced around for the nearest tavern and hurried toward it  planning what he would say as he walked .   the tavern was shadowed from the hot sun  of course  but the humid air was stale and motionless inside .  wayne blinked for a moment  waiting for his vision to adjust .  then he went to the bar and waved to the burly man behind it .      what   ll it be  mate .         i   m looking for a man with a ship ready to sail     said wayne  keeping his voice low .      what   s his name .         no  i mean  i want to find such a man .  can you help .     he leaned on the bar .      what   s in it for me .     the burly barkeeper wiped the bar idly with a damp cloth .      a cut from his end .     wayne glanced around warily  though the place was almost empty .     i have word that the hungry hawk is after a fat spanish merchant ship .         is he  now .     the barkeeper   s tone betrayed some real interest .     i did hear quinn sailed    cause he was desperate for a little hard coin .         what better time is there .  but i know which way he went and where he   s headed .     that last part wasn   t quite true  of course  but wayne knew he had to gamble .      that old quinn .  he just might do that .  he   s a tricky one .  don   t shoot his mouth off like so many men in this town .     the barkeeper was silent a moment .     i know a man who might want to speak with you .  but i   ll take my cut from both sides  thank you .     he held out his hand .   wayne knew he had no choice .     don   t waste any time .  the hungry hawk is already under sail .     he reached into his pocket and pulled out his few remaining coins .     it   s all i have left     he said  dropping them into the other man   s palm .      better than naught .  stay right here .     the barkeeper walked down to the end of the bar and spoke quietly to someone mopping the wooden floor .  with a quick nod  the other figure leaned the mop against the wall and darted out the back door .   wayne wiped sweat from his eyes and collapsed into a seat .  without any money left  he couldn   t pay for a drink at the bar or any food or lodging later .  if his plan didn   t work  he would probably have no chance to catch mc   .  in order to survive he would be forced to return to his own time and risk getting caught in some trap back at the bohung institute .   through the open doorway  he could still see the hungry hawk sailing away .  it seemed to move with painful slowness to someone accustomed to supersonic airplanes .  of course  speed was relative  a pursuing ship would be subject to the same winds .   wayne was starting to doze in the heat when he heard the sound of fast  hard footsteps clunking into the tavern .  startled  he sat up quickly .  a man   s shadow was blocking out the sunlight .      who wants me .     the shadow shouted  shifting shape slightly as he looked around in the nearly empty tavern .      what   s in it for me .     the barkeeper walked down the length of the bar toward him .      you   ll keep your throat whole .  now your man brought me over here with a story  but you   ll see no money from me until i   ve heard it all .         he   s the one     said the barkeeper  nodding toward wayne .      oh .     the man in the doorway came inside and glowered down at wayne .  he wore a broad brimmed hat with several plumes on it  under the hat  long brown hair hung to his shoulders .  his beard was full and shaggy  he wore a white linen shirt  black knee breeches and buckled shoes  and a cutlass swung at his side .     i   m captain mick tomann of the old laughing lady .         wayne nystrom  captain .  have a seat .     wayne sat up  gathering his wits .   tomann sat down  watching him suspiciously .     you know of a spanish pigeon  do you .         yes     said wayne .  he didn   t  of course  but if he could grab mc   on the high seas  he could just take him back to his own time from there .     but the hungry hawk has already gone after it .  i   m looking for a partner .         what do i need a partner for .         i can tell you where to find the prey .         quinn is headed northeast around the island  probably headed for the coast of cuba .  i saw that on my way here just now .  any fool can see that .         ah  but what if you lose him .  i know where he   s going .  and you   ll need time to get under way .      tomann frowned at him  resting one hand on his cutlass hilt .     not much time  matey .  i have some supplies already on board for a voyage i   ve already planned .  any my crew is hanging about on the waterfront  with naught to do and spoiling for a fight .         you have the ship and the crew and i have the information .     wayne jerked his thumb toward the sea .     the hungry hawk is under sail even as we speak .      tomann grinned suddenly  slammed his fist down on the table  and leaped to his feet .     aye .  let   s go .  the old laughing lady is a schooner that can outsail that fat old brig on any sea  in any weather .      wayne smiled with relief and stood up .  the barkeeper came forward .      captain     said the barkeeper .     since i brought you two together  i believe a consideration for your humble servant is in order here .      tomann whirled on him  drawing his cutlass in a wild  sweeping motion .  the barkeeper jumped back .      we shall see  my humble friend .  if the pigeon is found heavy in the water  i shall bring a trinket back home for you .  until then  back away .      the barkeeper did so .      come on  friend     tomann added to wayne .     we have a crew to gather .     he sheathed his cutlass and strode out .   wayne hurried after him .     steve grinned as he trotted after hunter .  the big robot was carrying a massive armload of lumber on one shoulder  under the front end of the planks .  he was easily able to carry the load  but steve was hustling along under the rear end of the lumber  pretending to help so that passersby wouldn   t notice just how impossibly strong hunter was .  in addition  hunter was carrying a bunch of woodworking tools in his other arm .   jane walked alongside steve  amused by the masquerade .   hunter kept walking after the docks ended .  the trio wove their way through a variety of other work areas and warehouses along the water before they finally left the occupied areas behind .  then hunter stopped and turned to look back over his shoulder  carefully checking to see that he did not strike steve or jane as he lowered his load to the sand .      i have devised a plan to work from     said hunter .     partly from my stored data and partly from observing the ships in the bay .  with these manual tools  i will be able to work much faster than either of you .         i can still do whatever you say     said steve .     even a few minutes saved will help in the long run .         agreed     said hunter .     i will give you specific tasks  since i have no way to convey the complete plan .         you could draw it in the sand     said jane .      i dare not leave any record  even in sand     said hunter .     if anyone seems to take particular notice of our actions  please inform me .         i can help  too     said jane .     i think .         i do not doubt it     said hunter .     but i fear that a woman doing such work with us might attract attention in this time  and that would be unwise .         i suppose .     jane shrugged .     then i   ll stand around and supervise .         you cannot supervise without knowing the plan     said hunter .      that   s another joke  hunter     said steve .      ah .  was it funny .         no     said steve .     now  then .  how do we start .      hunter worked through the afternoon  doing most of the labor .  he was not only faster than steve  but also more precise in his work .  jane watched for company  but few people came so far from the center of the waterfront .  those who did walk by on the beach took no notice .  steve could see that among the buccaneers  minding one   s own business was a survival trait  and woodworking was common along the docks anyway .      there   s another one     said steve  standing up from a newly sawed board to wipe sweat from his face .     this climate is great for you  hunter  because the sun beats down constantly on your solar collectors .  but i need a break .         of course     said hunter  without looking up from his chisel and hammer .     suit your own need  as you wish .         i want to dunk myself in the water     said steve  turning to jane .     walk with me .         sure .      steve wanted to talk to jane alone for a moment .  he led her to the edge of the water and they waded along the surf  away from hunter .  steve knew that if hunter wanted to monitor their conversation  he could turn up his hearing to do so  the robot could probably even filter out the sound of the breakers .  however  hunter probably wouldn   t bother .   steve put his arm around jane and leaned close to her ear .     any idea what our chances are now .         of catching mc    you mean .         yeah .  i mean  snagging mc   was a lot simpler in the dinosaur age .  no other humans lived in that time to complicate the search .  now we have all these pirates to worry about .         that   s true  but this world isn   t as complex as ours .  i think if we can catch that ship  we   ll still have a reasonable chance of finding mc   .         even with all those pirates around .     he glanced back over his shoulder .  hunter was working hard  but of course he could be listening without appearing to be .      well  it all depends on hunter right now .     jane stopped and watched the surf splash around her legs  holding her skirt up with one hand .     without his robotic abilities  we wouldn   t be able to get this little sailboat made .  if i can keep hunter focused on action  instead of on frustration over the first law  then he   ll be worth any number of buccaneers .         i don   t doubt that part .         what really makes me angry is rita   s lack of professionalism  running off like that .     her tone was hard .      i know     steve let himself fall into the cool water on his back  then spat out water and regained his footing .     i have to say  this life style seems pretty carefree .  fruit and fish everywhere  the sea and the beaches  and a feeling of adventure .         not you  too .         no  not really .  let   s start back .      by the time the sun was low in the west and the fishing boats were coming in  hunter had cut and shaped all the wood .  steve had done what little he could .  most of all  he was glad to feel the cool air of evening .      dinnertime     said steve .     tonight i wish jane and i could just get what we need from the sunlight  but it won   t work for us .      hunter looked up at both of them .      we can leave you here to keep working     said jane .      no     said hunter .     the waterfront is too violent at night .  i will come with you .         i had a hunch you would     said steve .     rita stretched out on the deck of the hungry hawk after dark like the rest of the buccaneers  except for those on duty .  the masts and sails rose high above her  their tops now beyond the reach of the torchlight on deck .  dinner had been fairly good  a sort of stew .  on their first night out of port  the fresh meat and produce were still good .  she knew that in such a warm climate  the fare would quickly turn to salted fish and pork  and hard biscuits .   roland had picked out a spot in a corner of the deck toward the stern for the three of them .  they were right under the rail  wadding up some empty burlap bags he had brought to use as pillows .  mc   lay down near rita  still imitating the behavior of the humans around him .  roland sat down on her other side .      faring well  sweet lady .     roland whispered .      well enough .     she looked out over the water  where the moon was rising .      a fair night .         yes  it is .     she decided to ask him some of the questions she had been considering  hoping that this would be a good time .  still looking away from him  she spoke casually .     tell me about your travels .         my travels .     he sounded surprised .      that   s right .         well  i was born to a london waterfront family .  nothing to speak of there  except the ships were always coming and going .  so i grew up wanting to get out  and the sea was the way to go .     he shrugged .      how old were you .         i was an eleven year old cabin boy on a trader to holland and back first .  later  i came out this way .         when did you  uh .  .  .         join the buccaneers .     he grinned .     i jumped ship off a brig in tortuga a few years ago .  liked the climate and the freedom .  then i came to port royal with some shipmates just last year .  it was too crowded in tortuga .     he shrugged .     it   s a better life than i ever had in old england .      rita didn   t dare look at him .  instead  she watched the bright moon in the dark sky .  it looked the same as it did in her own time .   she was telling herself not to ask any more about his life .  he must have killed people  of course .  his was a violent time and a violent life .  he was a creature of his time and he had survived so far .   uncomfortably  she reminded herself again that from the vantage point of her life and time  he had been dead for centuries .  that was her professionalism coming to the  ore again .  after all  she repeated to herself  she was here first as a historian .  she was merely doing field research  the same way anthropologists  zoologists  and other scientists had always done .      is something wrong .     roland slipped his arm around her shoulders .   rita stiffened  startled though not exactly surprised .  roland was exciting but his action scared her .  she tried to push his hand away  but he held on .      ah  rita  speak to me .  what   s on your mind .         let go .     suddenly more afraid  despite his calm manner  she struggled to get free .   instead  roland grabbed her arm with his other hand .     what is it .  all of a sudden  you   re       he stopped abruptly .   rita saw that mc   had sat up and taken hold of one of roland   s wrists in a smooth  quick motion .  mc   slowly but firmly pulled roland   s hand away from rita .      go back to sleep     roland ordered .     or go away .  take a walk  shorty .      instead  mc   pushed roland   s other hand off rita   s shoulders .      hey  what   s wrong  shorty .     roland moved up into a crouch  ready to fight if necessary .     you   ve been taking orders up to now without a complaint .  gone sweet on the lady  eh .      rita scooted out from between them .  she got to her feet and moved to the rail .  her heart was pounding .      you have quite a grip  there  shorty .     roland stood up  eyeing mc   cautiously and rubbing one wrist .   mc   remained seated on the deck  watching roland .   rita  now relieved  suppressed a smile .  mc   was far stronger than any human  even with his small size .  if he was really forced to prove that  of course  he would no longer be able to get lost in the crowd of buccaneers .  for now  though  roland didn   t seem inclined to fight with him .      think i   ll take a stroll about the deck     said roland .  he nodded to rita and walked away  glancing back once to make sure that mc   was remaining where he was .   rita sat down next to mc   again .  she felt safe now  but was still wide awake .  still  she was also glad to know that mc   would keep her from harm if he could .         dr .  wayne nystrom  robotics researcher and inventor  was not comfortable .  he stood in the shadows on the deck of the old laughing lady  watching three different drunken brawls among members of the crew .  every man in the crew had started drinking rum from the moment the ship was under sail  not the least of them captain mick tomann himself .      stand away .  stand away  lads .     tomann was swaggering about the deck with a tankard in his left hand and a flintlock pistol in the other .  as wayne watched  the captain sighted drunkenly up into the rigging and fired .  the ball chipped a piece of wood off a yardarm .     ha .  got it .     he stuck that pistol into his belt and drew another .   the sound of scraping metal rose from one of the brawls .  the fight between two men had grown more serious  cutlasses had been drawn and wayne could see the yellowish light from a swaying ship   s lantern shining on them .  curious  but still careful  he moved up a little to watch .      hold .  hold there  i say .     tomann somehow staggered toward the impending sword fight on the moving deck  brandishing his second pistol .   the crowd of buccaneers surrounding the fighters opened the way for him .      drop    em .     tomann heaved the rum out of his tankard into one man   s face  then flung the tankard itself at the other .     fight all you want  but save the cutting for the spanish .  we have gold to win tomorrow .      drunken cheers rose from the crew .  a couple of men took the cutlasses away from their companions and gave them more rum instead .  distracted  they drank up .  tomann stumbled away in search of more rum .   wayne sighed with relief and stepped back into the shadows .  then he looked out across the moonlit sea .  the hungry hawk was hidden by the darkness  but tomann had managed to get his crew together and set sail before it had been out of sight for long .  wayne had pointed out the way and  as tomann had promised  the old laughing lady was a faster ship .  shortly before sundown  the hungry hawk had come into sight again in the distance .     steve stood with jane on the dock  watching their small sailboat bob on the water  tied securely .  hunter had finished it near midnight .  as steve had suggested  one tall mast rose from a short  sharply pointed hull .  now that it was in the water  with the keel out of sight  it looked unbalanced  but the keel was big enough to help stabilize the little boat .  two long poles extended from the starboard side  holding a thick  smoothly polished log .  the outrigging would make the craft even more stable .  hunter had stretched a canvas tarpaulin across part of the hull to provide some shelter for the humans when they crawled under it .      looks good so far     said steve .      let us load it     said hunter .     steve  if you will stand inside  i will hand the containers to you .         all right .     carefully  he moved from the dock into the sailboat .  it swayed  then steadied .     hunter  don   t wooden boats normally have to season in the water .  so the wood will expand from absorbing the water and fill the cracks between the boards .         usually  yes     said hunter  handing him a keg of fresh drinking water .     i included this problem in my calculations .  the hull was already watertight as i constructed it .         handy     steve muttered to himself  impressed .   earlier  right after dinner  hunter had accompanied steve and jane to buy and carry some food and water for their trip .  after they had loaded the supplies and steve and jane had taken seats in the boat  hunter cast off the lines and stood on the dock  still holding the bowline .      we have a moderate onshore wind     he said .     however  this boat is very maneuverable .  i do not expect a problem .     he stepped into the boat with a robotic sense of balance that hardly made the boat sway at all .      we should name this craft     said steve .     and break a bottle over its bow .         why .     hunter looked at him .     that would waste valuable drinking water .         it   s another joke  hunter     said jane  grinning at steve .      oh .  was this one funny .         not any more     said steve  smiling back at jane .     here .     he reached down into the water and splashed water up against the hull .     i hereby christen her the jamaica jane .      jane rolled her eyes  laughing .   in one smooth motion  hunter hoisted the sail and sat down at the tiller  holding it firmly as the wind filled the sail with a jerk .  steve flailed for a handhold and got a fistful of jane   s hair .  she jumped in surprise  then laughed as they both braced themselves against kegs of water .   hunter took the jamaica jane away from the dock in a firm  sure tack against the wind .  the boat tilted hard to starboard  driving the outrigger under the surface of the water .  it held  however  preventing the sailboat from taking too extreme an angle .   steve squinted against the breeze  feeling the cold spray hit his face .  the night was cool but not cold  even over the water .  he felt a surge of excitement .      hunter .     jane turned around awkwardly to face him .     can we really move fast enough to catch up .         yes .  we have an excellent ratio of sail to water resistance .  also  i have made careful calculations of the wind and currents .     he leaned over the side and reached out with his long arm to dip one hand into the water .     as we go  i will continue to feel the currents .  this will help me calculate the best angle at which to sail .         can you really do that .  feel the currents by sticking your hand into the water while we   re moving .     jane looked at the dark water doubtfully .     i know your robotic sensors are good  but does the water tell you that much .         yes     said hunter .     my data on sailing include some information about ancient polynesians doing this .  they could even calculate where unknown islands would be  from miles away  according to how the water moved around them .         no kidding     said steve .     really .         yes .  we do not need to follow the hungry hawk precisely  or to use only line of sight to find it .  since i know the direction it took  the winds and currents it has had available to use  and the level of technology on the ship  i should be able to intercept it by sometime tomorrow .         sounds like we   re all set     said steve .      we have one serious vulnerability     said hunter .     this craft will not take high waves well .  i will keep my sensors carefully trained on changes in ions  humidity  and temperature to predict the weather .         i won   t complain about that     said steve  grinning .  he felt a surge of excitement as the wind whipped his hair and the boat rose and fell with the waves .      good idea  hunter     said jane .   steve leaned toward her .     exciting  isn   t it .  chasing a pirate ship across the caribbean .      she nodded  more nervous than excited .     what   s wrong .         i   ve been thinking about these pirate ships .  and the danger to mc   .  he   s heavier than water .         you mean if he goes overboard during an attack .         yes .  he can swim .  .  . if he   s close enough to land  he can get back .  but if it   s too far           he   ll sink to the bottom .         actually  he doesn   t need oxygen .  he could sink and walk to shore .  but again  he has to be close enough not to use up all his energy first .  and walking through water would drain his energy much faster than ordinary walking .         if he   s lost on the bottom  we   d never find him .         no .  but when the right time comes  he   ll still explode with the same force  wherever he is on the seafloor .        the next morning after a rather spare breakfast  rita again stood by the rail with mc    staying out of the way of the buccaneers .  everyone was excited .  as dawn had broken over the sea  they had spotted a spanish merchant ship on the horizon .  rita watched it all morning  realizing for the first time how painfully slow the race between the ships would be .      this feels like it will take forever     said rita .  then she wondered if she could engage mc   in conversation while roland was up in the rigging helping to sail the ship .      tell me why these two ships sail at different speeds .      under the second law  mc   did not hesitate .      both ships are using the same wind for power out in the open sea .  the only difference in their speed comes from the design of the ships and the weight they carry .  occasionally  one ship might move into a fast moving current before the other  also giving it an advantage .         thank you .     rita smiled  pleased that getting the robot to talk was so simple .     your eyesight must be better than mine .  tell me what you can see about that ship up there .         by the name on its side  it is the cadiz .  that name suggests that it is spanish .  it is riding low in the water  obviously full of cargo .  also  from the shape of the ship i can see above the waterline  i infer that the shape of the hull below the water is wide and bulky .  this creates more resistance against the water  slowing it down .      rita knew he was correct .     is there any chance it can get away .         by its own actions  i do not believe so .  however  the sailors on our ship could conceivably make a mistake in their handling of the rigging or their calculation of the changes in the wind .  also  of course  the sails and rope on this ship are in various conditions .  any unexpected problem  such as broken rigging or torn sails  could affect the accuracy of my prediction .         or a change in the weather .         i detect no atmospheric alterations that signal a coming change     said mc   .     but in principle of course  even a small storm could separate the ships .         realistically  then  we   re going to catch the cadiz     said rita .      yes .         how long will it take  under present conditions .         approximately six hours .         six hours .     rita watched mc   for a moment before looking out across the sea again toward the spanish ship .  of course  from the perspective of her own time  the hungry hawk had either caught the cadiz on this voyage or it had not  everything the buccaneers did  at least without the influence of the time travelers  was already decided .  that left her wondering what mc   would do when the pirates attacked the spanish .   even a robot  acting alone  could not possibly stop all those humans from harming each other .  rita was no roboticist  of course  but any human of her time knew something of robots and the three laws .  she decided to instruct him outright to tell her what he would do  even though doing so would reveal her as a human from his time .      tell me if the first law will force you to try to stop the fight .     rita glanced at the buccaneers nearest them .  none was paying attention to them .  they wouldn   t understand the entire question  of course  but they wouldn   t like to hear that anyone might want to stop the coming fight .      i did not know a fight was certain     said mc   .     but of course  if you know the laws  you must have pursued me here .  have you come to take me back .         i certainly should     she said carefully .     you are not to leave my company .  that   s an instruction under the second law .  understood .         yes .         then tell me what i asked .         i suspected a fight would occur  but the buccaneers have talked specifically of taking the ship and the cargo  not of harming humans .  i am hoping that the spanish will surrender without resistance .         i wouldn   t count on that     said rita .      then you must know that the first law requires that i prevent harm to humans .         changing history could harm them     said rita .     though i   m not sure this little isolated voyage is going to change much of anything .         i am not certain what i will have to do     said mc   .     i cannot forcibly stop two entire crews of humans from fighting each other .         if your interpretation of the first law will allow it  i instruct you to prioritize protecting roland and me .  will that be acceptable .         i believe so     said mc   .     all that day  wayne sat on a keg by the rail of the old laughing lady  watching the two ships sailing in front of it .  one was the hungry hawk  of course  he couldn   t read the name of its prey  but he was very relieved it was there .  he had been gambling when he had told captain tomann that captain quinn knew of a merchant ship .  now he had been vindicated .   late in the afternoon  the hungry hawk closed in on one side of the merchant ship just as the old laughing lady drew near on the other side .  both ships fired their cannon .  huge splinters of wood flew into the air from the sides of the quarry .  gaping holes through the sails of their prey revealed blue sky beyond them .  the merchant ship fired back  but it had few cannons and poor aim  plumes of spray rose where its cannonballs struck the water .   by that time  of course  all three crews were armed and anxious .  captain tomann was striding up and down the deck shouting threats at the spaniards  waving his cutlass angrily .  most of his crew had massed on one side .  the front line eagerly waited with grappling hooks on ropes as the helmsman steered the ship into position alongside the cadiz .  the rest were armed with boarding pikes  cutlasses  rapiers  and flintlock pistols or muskets .   wayne stayed where he was as the shouting buccaneers on each pirate ship grappled with the spanish ship only moments apart .  shouts roared on all sides as the buccaneer crews leaped onto the merchant ship  waving their weapons .  the snapping of muskets and pistols threw puffs of smoke into the air .  as some men screamed and fell into the water  wayne gripped the rail  searching the crew of the hungry hawk for mc   .   the spanish crew  outnumbered and surrounded by buccaneers  did not put up much of a fight .  they were quickly disarmed and hustled to one side  under guard .  in only moments  however  the two buccaneer crews were facing off  yelling at each other and threatening to fight .   amidships  captain tomann was bellowing at captain quinn  slashing at the air with his cutlass .  captain quinn  holding his own bloody cutlass  was shouting back at him .  their men were not preparing to fight behind them  however  they were too busy looting the ship and getting into individual fights .   finally  through the confusion aboard the cadiz  wayne saw mc   on the far side  still on the hungry hawk .  he was standing protectively near a young buccaneer  they had apparently not left the hungry hawk to join the fight at all .  wayne leaped up and ran to the nearest spot

at the beach .  when a buccaneer takes rita hostage  r .  hunter is caught between his need to complete his mission  his need to preserve human life  and his inability to injure humans .  moral complexities have always been a stumbling point for robots  and r .  hunter is no exception .       beyond the hunter class robots .  following the success of    hunter    class robots     seeker    robots were invented .     seeker    class robots  example shown above  have all the features of    hunter    class robots in a body roughly two thirds as large .  there are numerous small improvements  their eyes see farther into the infra red spectrum  and their hands and feet feature an extra sensitive sensor array for minute detail work .  they are also fully functional in the vacuum of space .         wayne picked his way quickly through the debris and knots of arguing  yelling  whooping buccaneers on the cadiz .  as quickly as he could  he dodged a couple of sword fights and one wrestling match to reach the other side .  as he drew closer to mc   and the buccaneer with him at the rail of the adjoining ship  he reached inside his shirt for the control device that would carry him and anyone within a meter or so back to his own time .  he would have to get mc   away from the others for just a moment .      you .     wayne pointed at mc   as he shouted  still running forward toward the rail of the cadiz .     come over here .  to this ship .  under the second law  do what i say .         don   t move .     the buccaneer next to mc   grabbed his arm and held him .     remember your priority .      wayne realized from the voice  suddenly  that the buccaneer was a woman .     mc    i   m wayne nystrom  your creator .     he could see indecision in the robot   s face .      roland .  help .     the woman waved her arms frantically  looking behind wayne .   just as wayne whirled around  roland swung toward him on a rope dangling from the rigging overhead .  his booted feet struck wayne on the chest with a painful thud and threw him backward onto the deck  hard .  with the wind knocked out of him  but otherwise not hurt  wayne lay motionless  gasping for breath .  he waited helplessly  half expecting the buccaneer to finish him off  but instead roland leaped back aboard the hungry hawk .   on the cadiz  the buccaneers continued to loot and celebrate .     as the little jamaica jane whipped across the waves toward the three ships grappled together in the distance  hunter could hear the sounds of men fighting hand to hand .  he sat up straight  magnifying his vision to the maximum .  however  he could not see any details that his hearing had not already identified .      what is it .     jane also peered at the distant ships  but of course he knew she could see even less .     what   s wrong .         the fighting has begun     said hunter .     i am worried that mc   will interfere with the fight and change the course of history .  his presence and perhaps rita   s could alter the behavior of the buccaneers .         we knew a fight was coming     said steve .     weren   t you ready for this .         i anticipated it  of course .         listen  hunter     said jane .     are we proceeding as quickly as possible .         yes .  i have the tack and the tiller at the optimum angles for speed under current conditions .     he quickly reappraised the direction of the wind to double check .      then you are doing everything the laws of robotics require at the moment .  acknowledge your agreement .         acknowledged .         and if you experience indecision or if you shut down  steve and i will suffer even greater harm .  right .         right .     somewhat reassured  hunter turned his attention back to the three ships ahead .     twilight was falling by the time the jamaica jane drew near the three ships .  even steve could hear the singing and shouting of a drunken celebration .  the ships were still grappled together  swaying on the open sea  with their sails furled .  none of the buccaneers noticed the small craft as hunter sailed up to the stern of the cadiz .      what do you want to do .     steve turned to hunter .      i must climb up to take a look at the crowd     said hunter .     however  i dare not leave you two alone in this little sailboat  so you must come with me .      steve looked up at the steep sides of the big ships .     we have to climb up there .         not exactly .  i will tie us to the hull of the cadiz and climb up myself with one of our ropes .  before i go  i will tie a fixed loop in this end to fit around you .  then i will lift you up when i have reached a safe place .         okay     said steve .   hunter tied the boat by the bowline and unfastened the longest rope from the rigging .  he tied a fixed loop and gave it to steve  taking the other end with him as he climbed up the hull of the spanish ship .  below him  steve and jane watched anxiously  as the ship swayed over the waves .   the hull of the cadiz was damp and slick with slime on the lower levels .  still  hunter   s precise analysis of the surface and his immensely strong fingers and toes allowed him to make maximum use of whatever slight holds he could find .  patiently  he rose little by little until he reached the windows of the captain   s chamber .  all of them were open .   steve didn   t think that hunter could move his large body into any of them  but he was wrong .  as he watched  he remembered that hunter had the ability to alter his dimensions if he wanted .  now  hunter used that ability to narrow his shoulders just enough to ease through one of the open windows .   he worked his way through headfirst  squirming .  at last his legs slithered inside .  he disappeared for a moment  then leaned his upper body back outside with his end of the rope tied around his torso .   hunter pointed to jane .  steve nodded  understanding that hunter did not want to risk shouting from up there for fear of attracting attention .  he helped slide the fixed loop under jane   s arms .      it   ll be uncomfortable     said steve .     hang onto the rope with your hands and brace your feet against the hull so you don   t swing against it too hard .         got it     said jane .   steve waved to hunter  who began pulling her up .  he watched  tense  as she swayed above him .  the ships were still tossing on the waves  and she began to swing back and forth  though she did keep her feet out in front of her to kick away from the hull when necessary .  her long skirt swirled in the wind .  finally  hunter had her at the window and he reached out to pull her in safely .   a moment later  hunter tossed the loop back down to steve  who fitted it under his arms and waved .  then the rope grew taut and he was lifted off his feet .  he  too  kept his feet against the hull so he wouldn   t slam against it with his body  but otherwise he was completely helpless .  the wind almost spun him around once  and he didn   t dare look down to see how far above the water he was .  he was dizzy and losing his bearings by the time he felt hunter   s strong hands grasp him under the arms and pull him inside the ship .      it   s hot in here     said steve quietly  dizzily collapsing into a chair .      that must be why no one is here     said hunter .     everyone is on deck  out in the breeze .     he coiled the rope neatly and laid it down .     i have been listening carefully to the voices .  the buccaneers are all up on deck and i think they have had enough rum to cloud their judgment .         what about it .     steve asked .      the spanish crew is imprisoned in the hold where the cargo used to be .  i am going to find some men   s clothing for jane .  then we will sneak up on deck and look around .  except for some lamps  it will be dark up there .  if we are fortunate  everyone up there will assume we belong to the other ship   s crew .      steve nodded  relieved that he would have a moment to get over his dizziness .  jane was clinging to a corner of a table  looking dizzy herself .  the captain   s quarters had been looted  leaving clothing  charts  and bedcovers scattered on the floor .  hunter quickly and quietly searched for clothing that would suit jane .  after a few moments  he tossed jane some knee breeches  a loose  baggy linen shirt  and a vest .   steve turned his back while jane changed .  when she had finished  hunter gave her a large  red and white scarf .  she tied it over her hair  in the style many of the buccaneers used .  the clothing was loose and baggy on her .      well .     she looked back and forth between them .      you   re too pretty to fool anybody     said steve .     but it   s dark up there .         well  i   ll hide behind you two .         good     said hunter .     i will lead the way .  only whisper after we leave this chamber .  and only if necessary .      steve nodded and got to his feet .      this time  jane goes last     hunter added .  he opened the door to the darkened passageway and stepped outside .   steve followed him  glancing back over his shoulder repeatedly to make sure jane was close behind .  hunter opened an outer door and the three of them moved up a steep staircase to the deck .  drunken buccaneers were singing in groups  or stumbling around laughing and joking  wooden chests had been brought up from below and broken open to reveal gold coin  silver coin  furs  and rolls of tobacco .  many of the pirates were already asleep on deck with their tankards still in their hands .   hunter stepped up on deck and moved quietly to his right  into an empty corner .  steve followed him and saw that jane came right behind them .  hunter pointed upward  to some voices he had apparently been tracking .   now even steve and jane could hear two men talking on the level above them .  steve supposed it was another deck .  hunter signaled for silence .  all three remained motionless on the creaking  swaying ship .      you got out here in short order  tomann     said one man .     not that i begrudge your coming .  we   ve made a good haul here for every man .         aye  quinn .  and once we agreed on an even split  the men stored most of it on our own ships quick enough .  come morning  they   ll clean up what   s left on deck here .         you know     said captain quinn .     one of my men asked a spaniard why their ship was all alone so near jamaica .         had to scare the truth out of him  i dare say .         aye  well  the answer has possibilities .         eh .         the cadiz wasn   t alone .  she was in a convoy protected by a spanish warship  but a storm separated them a few days ago .         i say .  that means some other fat chickens are nearby without a protector  just waiting for the likes of us .         but if we go on searching  then we   ll have to decide what to do with the cadiz     said captain quinn .     we know she should bring a fine price from someone should we take her back to port royal with us .         aye .     captain tomann sighed .     better to take home the prize we have first  as we   ve already agreed .  a skeleton crew will be enough to take the cadiz on the short trip home .         well spoken  tomann .  i guess we both know that our buccaneer friends all know each other .         aye  and their loyalty is to hard gold  not to you or me .     tomann laughed harshly .     so long as we lead them to fat prizes  they   ll let us have the captain   s double share and take our orders grudgingly enough .  but take them on one dry voyage  and they   ll slit our throats as fast as any pigeon   s .         well  we   ve kept our heads one more day  tomann .     captain quinn laughed  too  and clanked tankards with his companion .  then their footsteps clunked on the wooden boards as they strolled away .   steve nudged hunter .     you sail back on the hungry hawk     he whispered .     jane and i will join the skeleton crew on the cadiz .  that way  we   ll have someone on two out of the three ships to watch for mc   .         i cannot allow this     hunter said firmly .     the increased danger to you is too great .         listen  hunter     jane whispered urgently .     you have to shift your first law priorities .  at this point  the danger of losing mc   completely is greater than ever .  steve and i can stick together and help each other .  on the cadiz  all the other crew members will think we came from the other ship .         that   s right     said steve .     besides  one of the reasons you hired me is that i   m used to improvising .  this is the kind of situation you hired me to handle .         we can function most safely as a team     said hunter .     that was also my plan .         hunter  listen carefully     said jane .     what i mean is  you may have to prioritize your first law imperatives .  steve and i may have to be sacrificed in order to maintain the future as it should be for everyone else .         allow two humans to come to harm in order to save millions     steve added .      respond  hunter     said jane .      that should not be necessary     said hunter .      look  we aren   t giving up     said steve .     we fully expect to rejoin you later .  but we agree that the risk of splitting up to find mc   is worth it .      hunter was silent for a moment  an unusually long time for a robot .  then he nodded .     all right .         i want to leave you with one more thought while you   re on your own     said jane .     your independent action is crucial to pursuing this first law problem about the future .  do not allow instructions from other humans under the second law to distract you from your larger task  as you allowed wayne nystrom to do on our last mission .         understood     said hunter .     now before we split up  i want to find you two a safe place to sleep for the night on the cadiz .  then i will move to the hungry hawk .  if anyone asks why i am on the wrong ship  i will tell them i had too much rum tonight and got mixed up .      steve grinned .     you   re playacting better all the time .        as the night deepened  wayne remained alone and awake on the old laughing lady .  gradually  the celebration on board the cadiz wound down and most of the crew of the old laughing lady returned  except for those who would help sail the cadiz home .  he was not sure what to do next .  ordinarily  he would simply pursue mc   directly  but he was afraid of roland .   after some reflection  he had guessed that the woman buccaneer might be rita  the woman roland had mentioned as part of hunter   s team .  for now  he decided to bide his time and wait for another opportunity to approach mc   alone somehow .  he was certainly not going to risk another fight with roland .   captain tomann stumbled back aboard last of all  his cutlass in its scabbard again .  now he carried an empty tankard in one hand  idling knocking it against doorknobs  brass handles  and other items as he passed them .  wayne suddenly realized that he could use a buccaneer ally  someone to counter roland .  he hurried after the pirate captain .      that   s quite a haul     he called out .      eh .  oh  aye  it is .     captain tomann nodded  looking at him sleepily .     still awake  are you .         yes .  i mean  aye .  wide awake .  shall we visit  captain .  maybe we can get better acquainted .         i   m awake  myself .     captain tomann looked into his empty tankard .     well  then .  come along to my quarters .  i have a private cupboard of rum for just such an emergency .        steve and jane huddled out of the wind on the deck of the cadiz .  hunter had already moved to the hungry hawk  telling them that he would scuttle the jamaica jane before daylight so no one on board the larger ships would see it .      we   re on a real adventure now     said steve .     alone together on a ship full of pirates .         you don   t need to remind me     jane muttered .      hey  what   s wrong .  i thought you agreed this was a good idea .         it is .  but i   m not used to being away from robots and their dedication to the first law .  i work in an office and a lab  in a society where robots are common and none of them can allow harm to humans if they can prevent it .         i know i can   t fight like hunter could     said steve .     but i think we can avoid a fight .  these pirates will just want to go home with their loot now  i think .         yeah .     jane nodded .     i guess you   re right .      they slept out on the open deck with most of the buccaneers  under the peaceful caribbean sky .         the next morning  steve and jane awoke as the buccaneers on board threw off all the grappling hooks and set sail on all three ships for port royal .  since the weather was clear with a stiff breeze  the work was simple .  steve looked for tasks that were obvious  where he could help others without revealing his ignorance of sailing .  he joined another buccaneer rolling a fresh keg of drinking water across the deck and pried open a crate of salted fish .  jane stayed with him and tossed hard biscuits to hungry buccaneers .   once the ships were under sail  breakfast on the cadiz also included some kind of gruel from a large pot .  steve and jane learned as they ate that the ship was now captained by a buccaneer named jacques duveau .  the eastern coast of jamaica came into sight by midday  though of course they would have to sail around the southeastern corner of the island to reach port royal on the southern coast .   steve and jane moved toward the bow  away from the others  when they could .  they didn   t want any of the buccaneers getting a good look at jane in their free moments .  so far  however  all had gone well except that they had seen no sign of mc    rita  or roland on board .      we gambled wrong     steve said finally .     rita  roland  and mc   are on one of the other ships .         maybe hunter lucked out     said jane .     i don   t doubt that he can find them  but i wonder what he   ll do .  i don   t think he   ll take mc   back home without us .         good .         but as a robot  he can   t use the second law to order mc   to cooperate .  i don   t know if he   ll be able to hold onto him forcibly or not .         at least if he gets mc   into custody  that will be a start .  we can all join up in port royal .         yes  that shouldn   t be long .  i hope indecision doesn   t hit him too hard .  if he   s paralyzed by indecision because he feels he isn   t following the laws of robotics  we   ll have a bigger problem than ever .         he seemed okay last night  didn   t he .      i think so  or i wouldn   t have agreed to split up .     jane shrugged .     but he still has doubts about his competence .  i hope he   ll be okay without me to help him interpret the laws in a constructive way .         ahoy .  ship ahoy .      steve looked up .  the man in the crow   s nest  up on the highest mast  was waving and shouting to the crew below .  everyone on the ship looked up at him .   captain jacques duveau  a tall  lanky man with a black beard  looked out to sea  then yelled back up to the lookout .     what flag .         no flag .  can   t see the make of her yet .      steve could see that everyone was excited and curious  wanting to know what nationality and type of ship they had found .  he suspected they would flee from a spanish warship  which would have them outgunned .  so far  he couldn   t see the other ship at all .   for some time  the crew waited anxiously to learn what ship lay ahead .  finally  the lookout turned to call again .     spanish  by the look of her .  another merchant  captain  and riding low in the water .      cheers rose up from the crew .  captain duveau jumped up on a rolled sail lying on the deck .  steve grinned  anticipating what he would say .      all right  men .  what say you .  shall we pluck this fat bird or not .      another roar of cheers sounded .  the crew raced around  preparing for another attack when they drew close enough .  in a moment  captain duveau had raised the captured spanish flag .  they wanted to lull their prey into believing the original spanish crew was still in control .      it must be another ship from the same convoy as the cadiz     steve said quietly  leaning on the rail .     i guess it was blown off course here in the storm that separated all the ships in that convoy .         can they take it .  with only a skeleton crew on board .     jane stood next to him  the breeze tossing her hair .      sure .  with the spanish flag flying  they can probably come right up alongside .         we   d be better off just getting back to port royal     jane said doubtfully .   at the same time  hunter was on board the hungry hawk .  early that morning  he had finally seen mc    rita  and roland .  he had also realized that the first law would not allow him to return rita and mc   home and leave steve and jane on board the cadiz .  if rita saw him  however  she might flee again and take mc   with her .   for the first time  hunter had    used his ability to alter his appearance .  since he had only the clothes he was already wearing  he did not significantly change his height or his build .  however  he altered the blond  blue eyed  square jawed appearance he had been given at manufacture .  now he assumed brown hair  a deeply tanned look as though he had spent years in the caribbean  and a short  brown beard .  most important  he narrowed and lengthened his face .   since making that change  hunter had spent all day moving among the crew  sharing in breakfast and helping with the rigging when he saw a need .  he stayed relatively close to rita and mc   when he could  always appearing to ignore them while eavesdropping with his enhanced robotic hearing .  for the moment  he only planned to remain nearby and look for an opportunity to make a move .   the hungry hawk was just a short distance behind the cadiz .  when the lookout on the cadiz reported another target  hunter was the only one aboard the hungry hawk who could hear him .  within moments  however  the lookout on the hungry hawk made the same report .  captain quinn and his crew enthusiastically chose to join the attack on the new spanish ship .   hunter understood immediately that he would have to find a way to witness the fight without interfering .  finally he decided to stay close to mc   and rita .  he could make protecting them a priority and leave the buccaneers to do whatever they must .     rita watched with rising excitement as the sea chase continued .  mc   stood on one side of her .  roland joined them  smiling broadly .      ah  sweet lady .  we shall have easy picking this day .  do you see what is happening .         well  we   re chasing another ship     said rita .     is that what you mean .         nothing so simple .  you see  as the cadiz sails toward her sister ship  the one in front assumes we two buccaneers are still chasing the cadiz .  at first  the new ship just wanted to flee .  but now  as we draw closer  it appears that the cadiz cannot possibly escape .         what does that mean .         if you look closely  you can see that they have altered their tack .         what for .         i believe they have some misguided notion about helping .  even these spanish merchants mount a few cannon on board .  most of them don   t have the courage of that captain  though   or his recklessness .         he doesn   t realize that three buccaneer ships are after him  then .         no  he doesn   t .     roland grinned and gave her a wink .     not yet .      still at the rail  steve and jane watched anxiously as the cadiz finally drew close to the sidonia  the spanish ship just ahead .  the buccaneers were still flying the spanish flag .  many of them were hiding up in the rigging  while others lay flat on deck  all trying to stay out of sight .   the hungry hawk and the old laughing lady were both bearing down hard  as well .  always faster than the merchant ships  they had caught up during the course of the day .  the buccaneers had already taken their places  holding their weapons ready for the attack .   steve took a couple of belaying pins from their holes in the rail .  thick and heavy  they were not holding ropes at the moment .  he handed one to jane .      we should stay right here     he said .     if anyone gives you trouble  hit him with that .  and don   t be shy about it .  these guys are tough .         all right     said jane  looking at it doubtfully .     i never had one of these in my office job .  i wanted one occasionally  but i never had one .     she smiled weakly .      if we   re lucky  in the confusion nobody will notice that we aren   t really participating .      the cadiz had drawn close to the sidonia .  at the same time  the sidonia was coming about to fire its few cannon broadside at the two ships to the rear .  suddenly captain duveau pointed to the man at his helm .      bring us around .     captain duveau shouted .     fire at will .      the buccaneer at the helm spun the wheel and held it hard .  the cadiz changed direction to match the tack of the sidonia and slowly came up alongside it .  as the first cannons came into position  the individual crews began to fire .   cries of shock and alarm rose from the sidonia  as its crew suddenly realized that they had been fooled .  before their ship could change direction  however  the buccaneers were flinging grappling hooks over the side of their ship .  when the hooks had caught  the buccaneers on deck threw gangplanks forward between the ships and began to run across them .  at the same time  the buccaneers hiding in the rigging began to swing across to the other ship on ropes .   steve crouched  putting a hand on jane   s shoulder to bring her down too .  the rail protected them on one side and a couple of barrels were in front of them .  on the far side of the sidonia  the hungry hawk was coming into position to grapple it .  the old laughing lady was coming up last  toward the sidonia   s stern .   steve and jane remained where they were .  the crew of the sidonia were outnumbered  of course  but they had fight in them .  this was not going to be over quickly .   suddenly a tall  brawny  laughing buccaneer now on the sidonia leaped up on the gangplank near steve and jane .      ahoy .  stop your cowerin    there  you two .  come out and fight with the rest of us .     he laughed and whacked jane on the back of her head with the flat of his cutlass .      hey .     steve stood up  holding his belaying pin ready for a fight .      i   m on your side  remember .     the big buccaneer laughed .     come and join old ned  now .  come on .     he stood over them  clearly not intending to go without them .      all right .     steve climbed up on the gangplank with him .     let   s go .         you  too     said ned  grinning down at jane .     hurry it up there .      jane got up on the gangplank behind steve .  he hurried across and jumped down to the deck  then turned to wait for jane .  she hopped down next to him  still holding her belaying pin  and shrugged .      go get    em .     ned leaped down to the deck with a thump and ran toward a couple of brawling sailors and buccaneers .  he had apparently lost interest in steve and jane .   steve glanced around .     let   s just stay here as long as we can .  it should be over soon .         it   s okay with me     said jane .     with growing anxiety  hunter had been watching the coming fight from the deck of the hungry hawk .  he was successfully resisting his first law imperative to stop the entire attack .  his enhanced vision and hearing gave him a comprehensive picture of events on all sides .   suddenly hunter heard steve   s voice in the crowd .  he quickly tracked his location and saw a large buccaneer herding steve and jane over the gangplank to the sidonia .  instantly  the first law took over his thinking .   hunter glanced upward for the fastest route not only to the sidonia  but to its far side .  he spotted a long rope that was not in current use  it was fastened high on one mast .  then he picked out a climbing sequence to reach it .  almost as fast as he saw where to go  he began to shinny up a mast .   as the buccaneers shouted and fired their flintlocks on board the sidonia  hunter reached a spot on the mast about nine meters above the deck .  then he reached up to grasp a hanging net .  on it  he climbed another seven meters to where he could grab the dangling end of the long rope .   he tied the rope loosely to one wrist to keep his hands free and moved up to a yardarm .  there  at last  he checked the knot on the high end of the rope .  it was tight and would hold his weight .   next  hunter untied the loose end from his wrist .  all the ships were far below him on the tossing sea .  he took a careful look at the rigging of the sidonia  to pick his destination .  then  taking a firm hold on the rope  he jumped  swinging hard .   using his robotic calculations of the physics involved  he released the rope at the top of his swing .  he sailed through the air high above the decks but quickly grabbed a rope on the sidonia .  once his hold was secure  he quickly climbed hand under hand down the rope to the deck .   hunter found himself in the middle of a wild melee  fought with pistols  belaying pins  boarding pikes  and swords .  he looked around quickly and found steve and jane standing in a corner  avoiding the worst of the action .  even as he saw them  however  a determined spanish sailor snatched up a fallen cutlass and swung it at steve .   grimacing  steve blocked it with a belaying pin  and the blade glanced off the scarred  hard wood .  he had a determined but desperate look on his face .  the sailor advanced on him again .   hunter frantically worked his way through the crowd toward them .   a spanish sailor jumped in front of him  brandishing a rapier .  hunter  bare handed  waited for him to make the first move .  as soon as the sailor began a feint  hunter judged his motion and anticipated the sailor   s complete motion and weight shift .   too fast for a human to match  hunter leaned slightly to his right and grabbed the man   s wrist in one firm hand .  with his other hand  he took hold of the sword by its hilt and flung it away to clatter on deck .  then he pushed the sailor down flat on his back and hurried past him .   instantly  another spanish sailor leaped on him  grabbing his shoulders .  the human was much smaller than hunter  but his angle and momentum pulled hunter around .  hunter regained his balance  shoving the man away .  when the man swung a fist at his head  he only ducked  then lifted the sailor under his arms and tossed him onto a rolled sail lying on the deck .   ahead of hunter in the crowd  steve now held his belaying pin in both hands .  he swung it wildly  each time blocking a sword stroke from the spanish sailor   s cutlass .  the impact of each blow forced him back another step  chunks of wood had been chopped out of his dwindling weapon .  jane was shuffling behind him uncertainly  also holding a belaying pin but not sure what to do .   hunter had to stop abruptly .  two men  wrestling with each other  fell to the deck in front of him and rolled .  he stepped over them and ran toward steve and jane .  as the sailor swung his cutlass back and forth at steve  hunter judged the arc of his swing  intending to wrench the cutlass from his hand as soon as it came within reach .   suddenly jane stepped out from behind steve .  while hunter was concentrating his attention on the sailor fighting steve  jane raised her belaying pin .  she swung high  clubbing hunter over the head hard enough to snap the wooden belaying pin in half with a loud crack .         hunter was not physically damaged  but the shock profoundly upset him .  confused  he dared not fight any more for fear of making a serious error .  he collapsed into a sitting position on deck  staring at jane  mystified .   even on the original mission to find mc    back in the age of dinosaurs  hunter had suffered from various doubts about his ability to follow the first law successfully .  after being hit  he worried that these doubts had impaired his judgment .  burdened by additional doubts  he slowed down all his processes and lay back on the deck  motionless .  he was certain that he must have done something seriously wrong for jane to have struck him over the head like that .   steve was frantically blocking the sword blows of the sailor in front of him with his belaying pin .  to one side  he had seen a tall  bearded buccaneer run up and reach forward .  the stranger was huge  and steve had hoped for a moment that hunter would show up at the last second to stop him .  instead  jane had stepped out from behind steve and clobbered the big buccaneer .   the sailor who was fighting steve had been distracted for just a moment .  steve swung his belaying pin down on the sailor   s head with a clunk .  the sailor collapsed onto the deck .      traitor .  traitor .     a man   s voice shouted at them from the crowd .   steve looked around .  it was ned  the buccaneer who had chased them from the cadiz across to the sidonia a few minutes ago .  he was almost as tall as the stranger jane had just clubbed  though not as brawny .   in an instant  steve understood .  ned had seen the two of them hanging back from the fight  and now he had seen jane hit one of the buccaneers from behind .  he had concluded that they were perpetrating some sort of betrayal  probably to take more than their share of loot .      oh  no     said jane  looking down at her fallen opponent .     he   s dressed like a pirate  isn   t he .  i thought he was charging at us .         look out .     steve saw that ned was running toward them angrily .  he stooped down to pick up the cutlass the spanish sailor had dropped .   ned swung his cutlass at jane   s head .  she ducked under it and steve slashed at ned with his cutlass .  ned blocked it easily and steve was forced backward by the force of the collision .      jane  run .     steve yelled .  out of the comer of his eye  he saw her slip away .  at the same time  he was still blocking ned   s sword strokes  slowly backing away .   steve was scared  and felt trapped  he couldn   t possibly win a sword fight with an experienced buccaneer  especially one with a big advantage in height and reach .  still  he also felt exhilarated .  he could hardly believe he was fighting a real pirate on a spanish ship in the caribbean .   steve was inexorably driven back against the rail .  ned swung with hard  regular sword strokes  glaring at steve angrily .  steve knew he couldn   t fight his way out of the confined space .  finally  desperate  he jumped up on the rail itself .      ha .     ned laughed and moved forward .   steve threw his sword at ned  turned  and jumped feet first into the sea far below .   the blue waves came up fast  and he hit the water hard  plunging deep below the surface .  he kicked and stroked to break his descent and finally began to swim upward .  it seemed like a longer way up than he had expected  and he held his breath desperately .  finally  he broke through the surface of the salt water  gasping .      steve .     jane was shouting and waving anxiously .  she stood at the rail far above him  but well away from the place where he had left ned .   from his present position  steve could only see the steep side of the hull  the rail  and the rigging stretching high above the deck .  jane was the only person close enough to the rail for him to see .  he waved to reassure her  but he realized that he had no way to get back on board .   then  as he watched  jane ran to a hanging dinghy swaying horizontally over the edge of the ship .  it was suspended from wooden arms by rope .  she fumbled with a knotted rope for a moment  then jumped back as the rope came free .  the heavy dinghy fell all the way to the water with a tremendous splash .   steve struck out for the boat  swimming clumsily in his clothes  but he kept his head above water    that he could see .  ahead of him  jane took a deep breath and jumped feet first into the water near the boat .  when she surfaced  she swam to the boat and pulled herself up and over the edge .   as steve neared the boat  jane extended an oar for him to grab .  he took it with relief  finding that he was exhausted from the effort of fighting and swimming .  after pulling himself hand over hand along the oar  he grabbed the edge of the boat and rolled over the edge to fall inside .      you okay .     jane took his hand and helped pull him up into a sitting position .      yeah .     steve looked up toward the deck of the ship .  he couldn   t see much from the dinghy  but the sounds of the fight were continuing .     anybody notice .         if they did  they didn   t care .  besides  as soon as we went over the rail  we were out of sight .     she looked at him .     now what .         well .  .  .     steve pointed to the green coast of jamaica .     i think we   d better row for shore .  it   s not too far .  and i think the current will help us .         okay .      they sat next to each other on the center bench  each taking an oar .  at first they had trouble coordinating their strokes  and the dinghy banged against the side of the ship several times .  finally they got into a steady rhythm and slowly began to move toward the shore .     rita stayed with mc   at the rail of the hungry hawk as it approached the sidonia from the side opposite the cadiz .  roland had joined the buccaneer attack while rita and mc   watched from safety .  mc    however  was becoming more agitated as he watched .      don   t interfere     said rita .     these buccaneers belong to this time .  take care of me  and of roland if you can .         you are safe here     said mc   .   rita strained to follow roland   s movements as he darted about on the sidonia .  sails  masts  and the crowd of fighting men all obscured her vision .  mc   watched intently  however  with his robotic concentration .  suddenly he jumped on the rail and ran across the gangplank .      hey  wait .  mc   .  stop .     rita shouted in surprise .  when the robot ignored her instructions  she realized that the first law was requiring mc   to act .  she watched him as long as she could  but soon he  too  was lost in the crowd on board the other ship .   even on the sidelines  rita was thrilled .  nothing could match seeing the history she had studied for so long being made right in front of her .  the clanging of the swords and occasional bang of flintlock pistols scared her a little  but she reminded herself that this was the buccaneer life style .     wayne was standing by the helm of the old laughing lady with captain tomann  watching the other two ships attack their prey up ahead .  they were drawing very close now .  the previous night  wayne had begun to make friends with the short tempered buccaneer captain .  he had not yet sought his help .  first he had wanted to establish some rapport .   he had also known that he would have to tell captain tomann some kind of phony story .  thinking of one had taken a little time .  now  however  he decided the time to approach the captain had arrived .      captain     said wayne .     i have another business proposition for you .         eh .  now .  what would that be .         it appears to me that we are arriving a little late this time .  that is  we might not get a full share of the booty .  don   t you agree .      captain tomann glowered  resting one hand on his sword hilt .     if we board before the fighting ends  we   ll take our share in any way we must .         of course .  but  uh .  .  .     wayne glanced around suspiciously and motioned for the captain to step away from the man at the helm .     maybe you and i can make a special profit from all this  if you   re willing .         well  now .  what   s all this  then .         a short  slender man is on board the hungry hawk .  i want him .         to kill him .         no  no .  as my prisoner .         what   s in it for me  then .         ransom     said wayne .      ransom .     captain tomann looked at him sharply  truly interested for the first time .      you and i can split it evenly .  no need to inform anyone else  though  is there .         who is he .         his name is mc    but don   t say it aloud .  someone else might overhear and figure out who he is .         goes by his initials  eh .  so that   s his name   but who is he  that someone   s going to pay ransom to get him back .         the younger son of a colonial  up on the mainland .         a rich man   s son  is he .  who   s his father .         no  no .  if i tell you everything  then you don   t need me anymore .      captain tomann grinned at him  showing broken teeth .     aye  you   re a sharper fellow than you look .  well  then  how much ransom can we get for this fellow .      wayne thought quickly .  he decided to err on the side of generosity .     what would you say to one full chest of gold coin .         i would say  two are better .         we   ll get it .         ah .  so what   s the proposition  exactly .         you help me snatch him and hold him .  in the meantime  i   ll arrange the ransom .         i think you need me more than i need you .  i   ll take more than half the share .         well .  .  .     wayne shrugged .      i can find out who his father is when i get my hands on him .  but without me  you have no way to catch him and no place to keep him .         that   s right     said wayne .   captain tomann  who had expected an argument  blinked at him in surprise .     you agree .         sure .  you take two shares to my one  whatever the ransom turns out to be .         why .     captain tomann scowled and leaned his wild eyed face close to wayne   s .     why would you give up so much of the ransom so easy .         call it a .  .  . grudge     wayne said quickly .      eh .     captain tomann cocked his head and grinned slowly .     a grudge  you say .         that   s right     said wayne  seeing that his companion accepted the explanation .      a personal matter .         aye  a personal matter .  now  that i can understand .  all right  mate .  we have a bargain  then .     he pounded wayne on the back .      and like i said before  there   s no need to tell anyone else  right .         right you are  mate .  it wouldn   t do for my crew to know i was getting more than my normal captain   s share .  now let   s find this fellow .  we   re almost in position .     he turned and waved toward the man at the helm .     hard to port  there .  hard to port .      the buccaneer at the helm suddenly turned the wheel .  he strained to hold it in position .  slowly  the ship began to turn .   the prow of the old laughing lady came up closely on the three grappled ships .  some buccaneers were ready with grappling hooks .  others were hanging in the ropes above them with their weapons .  the ship angled carefully toward the free side of the hungry hawk  opposite where it was grappled to the sidonia .  when the old laughing lady came alongside  the buccaneers grappled the hungry hawk .      come on  then .     captain tomann punched wayne in the arm and strode forward .   wayne followed carefully .  he was concerned about getting into the fight  but was a little more confident now that he had an ally in the fierce buccaneer captain .  besides  this might be his best chance just to grab mc   and go home with him .   ahead  the buccaneers in the rigging swung for ward on ropes to the sidonia  the others hoisted gangplanks and ran across them .   the hungry hawk was nearly empty  since its crew was fighting on the sidonia .  the buccaneers from the old laughing lady made their way across it quickly  anxious to earn their shares of the loot by joining in the taking of the sidonia .  captain tomann ran across the gangplank  his cutlass in one hand and his pistol in the other .  he jumped down to the deck  looking around .   wayne climbed up carefully on the gangplank  which shifted back and forth as the two ships under it swayed on the waves .  he nearly lost his balance and pitched into the narrow space between the ships .  finally  his heart pounding  he ran across after captain tomann and caught up with him .   captain tomann pointed to a lone figure with his cutlass .     who   s that little fellow  standing by the rail .      wayne recognized rita and shook his head .     that   s not him  but it   s a friend of his .         a friend .         a friend who can help us     said wayne .  he decided that mc   must have been forced by the first law to interfere with the fighting .     well  come on .      wayne followed him  worried that captain tomann might hurt her .  the buccaneer captain ran up behind rita and grabbed her arm .  she jumped and tried to pull away .      i say  mate .     captain tomann still held her  but straightened in surprise as he looked at her carefully .     she   s no buccaneer .  it   s a woman .  you know that .         easy     said wayne to captain tomann .     let   s get her back to the ship .  i can talk to her there .         so be it  then .         i   m wayne nystrom .  your name is rita .         that   s right .         we need to talk .      she just looked at him  warily .      come on .      wayne and captain tomann each took one of her arms and led her back to the old laughing lady .  she said nothing  but did not seem particularly scared .  wayne wondered why she was being so cooperative .     steve strained against the oar in the dinghy .  n ext to him on the middle bench  jane was also working hard .  as they rowed for the coast of jamaica  they were facing away from the ships .  swaying on the gentle waves  each ship sent its masts angling high against the blue sky . at such a great distance  the few buccaneers steve could see on deck were mere specks .  none of them had taken any notice of the dinghy .      it   s just as well we   re getting away     said steve  breathlessly .      what do you mean .         we told hunter we could take care of ourselves with the pirates  but we didn   t really do too well .  since we don   t know where either one of the robots is  we don   t have their protection any more .  we   ll be safer on dry land again than in the middle of a bunch of pirates during a fight .         i think we handled ourselves just fine for a couple of people from our time .         well  i guess .     steve shrugged .  after that  they used their energy only for rowing .  jamaica wasn   t too far  but their progress was slow .         every so often  steve glanced over his shoulder to make sure they were heading in the right direction .  finally  after a long time  he realized that they didn   t have to keep rowing to reach the shore .  he let out a deep breath of relief and shipped his oar .      we can take a break .         what .  we can .     gratefully  jane shipped hers     too .     are we there .     she turned around to look .      not yet     said steve .     but the current and the tide have taken us .  we couldn   t row our way back out now if we wanted to .  so we might as well take it easy .         i know people must have seen us go overboard  but i guess nobody saw us rowaway .         no one who cared  anyway     said steve .  he looked back at the big ships .  the first two pirate ships were still grappled to their prey .  however  the old laughing lady had pushed off again and was under sail  leaving the other ships behind .  on its present course  it would pass them some distance away on its trip back to port royal .   he turned around on the bench  to face forward toward jamaica .      what   s our next plan of action .     she turned on the bench also  bumping him with one shoulder .      it looks like we   ll have quite a hike back into port royal  so that   s going to take up the rest of the day  i think .     steve looked down the coastline as far as he could .      are we going to land near the spot where we first c appeared  do you think .  along the cagway .         i   m afraid we   ll have a much longer walk than that .  we   re going to land outside the cagway  which means we   ll have to walk the entire length of the peninsula .  or maybe we can get a ride on a farmer   s cart or something .     he looked up at the sun in the west .      what   s wrong .         i doubt we have enough daylight left to reach port royal .         we might have to camp out on the way .      jane glanced at him .     camp out .  just .  .  . out in the woods .         i don   t know if we   ll have any choice .      she was silent for a moment .     well  it   ll be warm enough .  but i guess we should contact hunter with the transmitters at some point .  since his receiver is internal  it won   t matter if buccaneers are with him  they can   t hear it .         yeah .     steve grinned .     i forgot about those in all the excitement .  but let   s wait until we land  so he can home in on a fixed location .         he won   t have a way to reach us here  unless he steals a boat or swims .         he won   t have to     said steve .     we   ll arrange to meet him on the docks .         sounds good to me .      they relaxed a little and let the water carry them in toward the shore .  steve finally felt a release of tension .  they were about to land safely .      you know     steve said .     i feel pretty good  really .  i actually survived a sword fight with a real pirate  even if i did have to jump overboard to get away .     he laughed .     not exactly a success  but i   m still here .         i   d say it was a success     said jane  smiling at him .     thank you for stepping up and facing him .  i .  .  .  never went through anything like that before .         you   re very welcome .  and thank you for dropping this boat down to rescue me .         and you   re welcome in return .      steve grinned at her .  he wanted to put his arm around her  but he didn   t know if that was a good idea or not .  after surviving the attack on shipboard  he felt closer to her than ever .  still  he wasn   t sure how she would take such an action  and they had to work together for a long time yet .  instead  he just looked ahead to the shore  which was growing closer all the time .   finally the dinghy ran aground in shallow water .  steve and jane jumped out into the surf  throwing spray on themselves  and pulled on the bowline .  steve   s feet sank into soft sand and he struggled for traction .  the dinghy  freed of their weight  came farther forward .  their clothes  which had finally dried out in the sunlight  became drenched all over again .  then the dinghy got stuck once more .   they waded out of the water  up onto an empty beach .  for a moment  neither of them spoke while they caught their breath .  by then the sun was low over the water in the west .  the breeze was cooler than before .   steve reached for his communicator .  he didn   t feel it .  worried  he looked down where it should have been .      what   s wrong .     jane asked .      my communicator   s gone .  it must have come off when i hit the water .         uh oh .     jane checked for hers quickly  then looked up at him .     mine   s gone  too .         that must be it  then     said steve .     it   s a long jump from the deck of that ship .  we hit the water hard .         hunter won   t have any idea where we are     said jane .      he may have seen us in the boat     said steve .     otherwise  all we can do is get back to port royal and head for the docks .  he   ll probably get there first .         yeah .     jane nodded .     shall we go .  we have a long walk ahead .        hunter lay motionless on the deck of the sidonia .  around him  the fighting had finally stopped as the spanish crew surrendered .  then the combined crews of all three ships examined their new booty .  as night fell  they lit torches and celebrated again .  hunter  concerned that any further action he might take would violate the laws of robotics in ways he did not comprehend  did not move  though all of his senses were still operating .   around him  the buccaneers drank more rum  whooped and fired pistols into the air  and staggered around the deck singing .      hey  mate     said a drunken buccaneer .  he leaned over hunter  his head and shoulders a dark shadow against the stars in the clear sky above them .     you hurt bad  are ya .         no     said hunter .      well  here .      hunter felt the buccaneer and a couple of his companions lift him under his arms and pull him up into a sitting position against a rolled sail .  then  hoisting tankards of rum  they wandered away .  hunter remained where he was  gazing across the deck to the dark  open sea beyond it .   the three ships were ungrappled again and under sail for port royal .  the night weather was so good that little work was required .  hunter could see the torches burning on the decks of the other ships in the distance .  all three buccaneer crews were celebrating their excellent fortune  even the man at the helm of the sidonia had a tankard in one hand .   even in his uncertainty  hunter was still alert for mc   or rita on board the ship .  as usual in the dark  he was using voiceprint  heartbeat  footsteps  and even breathing patterns to identify the humans within in his hearing .  these supplemented his infrared vision  which was only useful for detecting people in his line of sight .   hunter was burdened by a new contradiction  but this time it was self induced .  he felt certain that he had to have made some sort of error that had caused jane to hit him .  it had to be an error of a magnitude he estimated to be very unlikely in a positronic robot  especially a robot of his new and highly specialized design .  until he solved that puzzle  he was afraid to take any action for fear of compounding the error .   he was certain that the error had resulted from the stress he had already felt concerning his efficiency in obeying the first law .  such stress had always been known to affect robots adversely  it was a side effect of the ultimate priority of the first law .  figuring out what his error had been was now a prerequisite to normal action  without his identifying and correcting it  the first law would not let him risk harm to humans by taking any chance of repeating it .   on the other hand  the fact that he had made an important error at all told him that his thinking was faulty .  so he really did not know if he was capable of figuring out what his error was .  that contradiction kept him sitting right where the buccaneers had left him .   other buccaneers staggered past from time to time  taking a look at him .  since he was not visibly injured  they left him alone .  hunter heard one of them comment that he was obviously drunk  and deservedly so .   as hunter remained almost in a stunned state on the deck  he was also uncertain as to what he should do next even if he could summon the will to do anything .  he wanted to get his group in one place again  at the very least  the first law would be easier to obey if all the humans on his team were with him .  however  he was not sure if he was worthy of continuing his mission .  the first law might require that he simply return with the team  leaving mc   behind  and advise the oversight committee to find a replacement for hunter .   hunter recounted his various failures to himself .  the first had been allowing dr .  nystrom to escape his custody during the first mission .  wayne had eluded them in the late cretaceous period and also at the bohung institute afterward .  then he had hired rita  whose priorities were clearly not directed toward fulfilling her duties on this mission .  then  of course  he had failed to save steve and jane in their fight on deck .  all along the way  any number of small historical changes had taken place .  some of them might lead to significant changes that would alter the future  as chaos theory suggested .   at last the buccaneers wanted to sleep  and anchored their ships for the night .  most of the buccaneers found places to sleep on deck .  hunter could hear the distant creaking of the other two ships as they  too  sailed down the east coast of jamaica and rounded the southern corner of the island toward port royal .     the old laughing lady had an early start on the other ships as it sailed for home .  at first  captain tomann had insisted on interrogating rita right away about the individual wayne wanted to take hostage .  he and wayne took her down to a chamber that had been inhabited by a ship   s officer before the buccaneers had taken the ship .  as captain tomann shouted  blustered  and waved his cutlass around the confined space  she had winced but never spoken .   finally wayne drew the captain aside .     i think she   s too scared to speak     he said quietly .      she   d better be scared .     captain tomann bellowed  starting after her .   wayne moved to stay in front of him .     let me have a moment alone with her .         alone .  so you can learn what you need and hold out on me .  is that it .         no .  no  i still need you .         eh .         i will need your ship and your  uh  friendship to hold her here .     wayne lowered his voice .     she is afraid of your reputation as a pirate captain and the english scourge of the spanish main .  too frightened to speak .         is she  now .     captain tomann glared at her over wayne   s shoulder .      give me just a moment with her .         do as you will  then     muttered captain tomann .     do not keep me waiting long .     he stomped out and slammed the door .   wayne turned to rita  letting out a deep breath of relief .     you know who i am  i think     he said bluntly .      what do you want .     rita spoke carefully  not exactly answering his question .      you know that  too .  i want mc   .         who .         stop it     he ordered impatiently .     you   re wasting your time .  i know you came here with hunter .  if you want to leave this ship  you   ll have to help me .         all right     she said calmly  looking back at him .  she did not look scared  despite what he had told captain tomann  but she was certainly wary .      i don   t care about you     wayne said .     i don   t want to hurt you or interfere with your trip home  either .  but i   ve had to join up with captain tomann  and he   s a little .  .  . well  he   s a pirate .  as you can see for yourself .      her face tensed slightly .     what do you expect me to do .         you have a rapport with mc       said wayne .     that means you can get close to him and then  under the second law  you can order him to obey me .         why are you so anxious to get mc   yourself .     she folded her arms .      that   s my business .         if we all worked together  we could probably get him much faster .  then everyone could work together back home .  what would be wrong with that .         ha .  i   ll never get a fair shake from the oversight committee .  working with you and hunter will ruin me .     his eyes narrowed .     besides  i don   t see you exactly working with hunter .  what were you doing off by yourself like that .     he grinned  knowing that she was still unaware that he had hired roland to distract her or she would have mentioned it by now .   rita ignored his question .     what about all the changes we may be causing here  in this time .  hunter believes in the chaos theory as applied to time  which means that any small changes can set big changes in motion .         i don   t agree with him .  any changes we cause are minor and will be absorbed by the larger forces of history .      she suppressed a smile .     i agree with you .         mc   was with you .  did he join the fighting on the sidonia .      rita hesitated .     it won   t matter .  everyone is sailing back to port royal  anyway .         i guess that   s true .  but i still want to know which ship he was on when you saw him last .         yes  he joined the fight on the sidonia .  i suppose the first law took over .         that   s what i figured .     wayne studied her quietly for a moment .      well .      he shrugged  then nodded toward the bed .     all right .  you might as well get some sleep tonight .         what are you going to do with me .         for now  captain tomann will keep you here .  when we reach port royal  i   ll go look for hunter  i know he   s looking for me  too .  maybe we   ll make a deal .         a deal .         i   ll trade you for mc   and hunter   s promise not to interfere with me .     wayne moved to the door and then turned with a smile .     i believe that the first law will force hunter to place your welfare ahead of mc     s .  now  after i leave  i   ll have to bolt the door from the outside .  you bolt it from the inside  too .  you wouldn   t want a drunken captain tomann coming for a visit .        steve watched the sun go down in the west over the island as he and jane walked through the thick jamaican forest .  the sweet aroma of flowers filled the air .  they found themselves hiking by moonlight through the trees toward port royal .  then they came across a dirt road with wagon ruts and followed it .  the moon shone down on the road  but only shadows were visible on each side .      i hope this goes to port royal     said steve .     following the sun to go west was easy  but we can   t see the stars too well  with all the trees overhead .         i suppose it does     said jane .     where else would it go  this close to town .         nowhere else i know of     said steve .  he rubbed his arms .     my clothes are still wet .  are you cold .         yes .  but i   m drying out slowly .  i   ll be okay .         i   m still not used to this humidity .  in the desert  we would have dried out almost right away .         what   s that light over there .     jane pointed to their left  up ahead .   steve looked .  a small light flickered through the trees  some distance away .     it must be someone   s campfire .         aye  that it is     said a man   s voice .   as steve stopped in surprise  the dark silhouettes of people stepped out of the shadows  merely shadows themselves in the darkness .  their movements rustled the tree branches and underbrush as they came forward .  they had obviously been prepared for intruders .  some blocked the road in front of steve and jane  but others came out of the trees on each side of the road .  when steve glanced over his shoulder  he realized that some were behind them  too .  he could hardly see them .              and who might you be .     one of the men in front of steve had spoken .      steve and john     said steve  hoping jane would say nothing .  in the dark  the strangers could stand close and still not see that she was a woman .     we   re shipwrecked off the hungry hawk .     taking a deep breath  he decided to be bold .     who might you be .         i   m nick van dyne     said the man in front of him .     lately of port royal  but we haven   t done so well lately .  so it   s our fire you see .         we saw those ships from the shore this afternoon     said another man .     and we heard you coming down the road just a bit ago .         aye  we did     said nick  resting his hand on his rapier .     but we have not been welcome in port royal for some time  those of us whose gold ran out .  we haven   t had a ship to crew for some time .  i think these two might have some plunder they could share with us .         we don   t have anything     said steve .      ha .  two spanish ships were in that fight today  and they both set sail with the others back for port royal .  i say they were both fat pigeons with plenty of booty for every buccaneer who took part in the voyage .         we got thrown off the ship during the fighting     said steve  carefully eyeing the buccaneer on his left .  that man was holding his cutlass in one hand  down by his side .     no plunder had been divided yet .         we shall see     said nick  drawing his rapier .     grab them both .      steve had been ready  however .  as soon as nick had reached for his rapier  steve had whirled to the man holding the cutlass near him and punched him in the stomach .  he wrenched the cutlass away just in time to block a thrust from nick  backing up a step .  then  half expecting the other buccaneers to jump on him from all sides  he waited for nick   s next stroke .   the crowd of buccaneers laughed  however  at the way steve had caught the one man by surprise and taken his sword .  meanwhile  steve figured that he had little to lose by fighting .  these pirates were more aggressive  and probably more desperate  than those on the waterfront of port royal .  from the bullies and brawlers he had known in the desert back home  he was sure they would respect a fighter .  any attempts he made to mollify them now would be considered cowardice .      stand back .     nick laughed .     he   s a poor man with a sword  but has spirit .  let   s see what else he has .      steve kept the cutlass high in front of him as nick feinted  twirled his point in steve   s face  and lunged again .  as before  steve knocked the thrust aside with a minimal movement  he could see that a big swing of his arm would momentarily leave him wide open .  he really didn   t know what he was doing  however  and had to back up again to avoid a quick flurry of short feints from nick .      get him  nick .     the man who owned the cutlass shook his fist at steve .      he got the better o    you  all right     said someone in the crowd  and they all laughed .   steve   s opponent was quick and confident .  all steve could do was block the strokes he could and slowly back away from the others .  sooner or later  he was likely to back into a tree or trip over a rock or log and fall .      stand to  fellow     said nick  laughing .     how can we fight if you keep running away .         aye     called another man .     he probably jumped overboard and swam for shore the same way .      the buccaneers bellowed with laughter .   vaguely  as steve parried again  he heard the sounds of horses and the creaking of some vehicle on the road behind the crowd .  he didn   t dare turn to look  but a large  looming shadow blocked the moonlight in his peripheral vision .  in front of him  nick also refused to look away .   voices sounded behind the crowd .  then  suddenly  the buccaneers gave enthusiastic greetings to someone .  the crowd moved quickly away from nick and steve and jane .      it   s captain morgan     called someone loudly .     nicky .  he   s coming .      the crowd parted and a tall  burly man strode through the opening .      good evening  men     he said heartily .     so  having a little fun  are you .      nick glanced at him quickly  then lowered his rapier  still watching steve warily .     evening  captain .      steve dropped the cutlass on the ground .  he was grateful for the interruption and wanted to give nick no excuse to resume the fight .  whatever happened next  he and jane would have better luck trusting to chance than trusting his fencing .      a personal row  i suppose .     captain morgan looked back and forth between nick and steve .     i say  fellow  you   re all wet .  so is your friend .      steve peered at him in the moonlight .  he wore a broad brimmed hat with plumes  a fancy ruffled shirt  and an unbuttoned coat .  a sword and scabbard hung from a polished belt that had a pistol stuck through it .  he spoke with a british accent that was different from the ones steve had heard in port royal .      aye  captain     said steve .     we  uh  wound up in the water during the attack on a spanish ship .  my friend here lowered a dinghy and we rowed to shore .         a spanish ship  this close to the coast of jamaica .     captain morgan looked at him doubtfully .  .      we took two of them     said steve  seeing that captain morgan was interested in this subject .      a sailor on one of them said that a storm broke up their convoy and blew them off course .         ah .  good fortune for you  then .     captain morgan grinned broadly .     glad to hear it .  i would hear more of this  however .     he took another look at jane in the darkness .      we can tell you much more     said steve  eagerly .     the names of the ships and how we attacked them  all that .         excellent .  i must introduce myself .  i am henry morgan  a colonel by commission from governor modyford .         pleased to meet you     said steve .  he suddenly recognized morgan   s name vaguely from his meager history .     we are steve and john .         are you returning to port royal .         yeah   i mean  aye .         you shall be my guests     said captain morgan .     i am a little late  but on my way to port royal this evening .  please join me in my carriage .     he turned to one side  gesturing .   steve grabbed jane   s arm and pulled her along .  the buccaneers made way for them  saying nothing as they watched .  captain morgan brought up the rear .   the carriage loomed as little more than a large shadow  where a footman opened the door .  steve drew jane forward to climb in first .  he followed her and sat next to her in the forward seat  facing backward .  the seat was padded  but he could feel the hard shelf underneath the cushion .  captain morgan climbed into the opposite seat .  when the footman closed the door  captain morgan leaned out the window .      in the next few days  men     he called .     on the docks as we arranged  eh .      enthusiastic agreement from the crowd answered him .  captain morgan waved and the driver took the coach forward .  steve finally relaxed slightly for the first time since the buccaneers had confronted them .      i am coming from my plantation in rio minho valley     said captain morgan .  he smiled in the faint moonlight coming in through the windows of the carriage .     i hate to see buccaneers fighting each other when i am about to assemble new crews for my ships .  we must fight the spanish together .         sounds good to me     said steve .      i see you are both chilly     said captain morgan .     i shall buy a round of rum at my favorite tavern .  it will warm you both .         we   re looking forward to it     said steve .      as am i .     captain morgan nodded to jane .     john  i shall see that you are especially comfortable .      jane nodded  looking at steve .  if steve understood captain morgan  he was not fooled by her appearance .  yet he seemed to respect her masquerade .   as the carriage swayed and creaked down the road  pulled by a team of lively horses  steve tried to remember what he could about henry morgan .  all he could recall was that morgan had been a buccaneer captain .  according to what rita had told the team in the beginning  the commission from governor modyford meant that legally  right now  he was a privateer .  steve saw that he was wealthy  and that he was a big  barrel chested  confident man  but he was surprised to see that he was also soft  spoken and considerate .      from where to do you hail .     captain .  morgan asked .      from california     said steve  with a slight grin .     john  here  is from up the mainland coast .         california .     captain morgan eyed steve closely .     that would be a spanish possession on the far ocean  if i remember my maps rightly .  you look a bit spanish  in fact .  yet you speak english comfortably  albeit with an odd accent .         we are buccaneers     steve said firmly .      aye  that you are .  any man has a fair chance with me .  jamaica has buccaneers from every land .  so tell me about your recent voyage .      steve decided that as long as he avoided mentioning the future or robots  telling morgan their story was not likely to change history .  during the ride into port royal  he told morgan about the cadiz and the sidonia .  he briefly mentioned the hungry hawk and the old laughing lady  morgan recognized the names and knew their captains .      i told them i   d be gathering a fleet     he said grimly .     i am not pleased that they went adventuring so close to my own call for crews .  good men and ships might have been wasted .  well  i suppose the temptation was too great to pass up .  still  i will want them with me .  i hope they will be ready .      steve was sure that asking questions about morgan   s plans was not wise .   the town gate was closed when the carriage arrived .  steve noticed  however  that the driver only had to shout captain morgan   s name to the sentries in order to have it opened .  the carriage drove into the town and down to the waterfront .   steve looked out the window at the taverns and shops .  by now  some were familiar .  however  the carriage drew up at a tavern that he had not noticed before .  it was a small storefront  no different from many others .      this is not the wildest tavern in town     said captain morgan .     i would say it is not the best  either  but it   s a favorite of mine .  you will join me for that rum  eh .         of course     said steve .   jane smiled and shrugged .   the footman opened the door for them .  at captain morgan   s gesture  steve slipped out first and waited for jane .  then they followed their host into the tavern .   it was a small  cozy establishment lighted with torches on the walls and candles on the rough wooden tables .  the tavernkeeper greeted captain morgan familiarly  as did several of the buccaneers drinking at the tables .   captain morgan took a big  round table in the middle of the room .  he ordered three tankards of rum  with an amused smile at jane .  she was still not speaking  to masquerade as    john     but captain morgan seemed to consider it merely a mild joke .   the rum was served with a bottle and a plate of tropical fruit .  captain morgan raised a tankard to steve and jane .  they clanked theirs against his .      to good sailing     said captain morgan  before taking a long drink .      to good sailing     steve repeated .   jane muttered the same quietly  smiling shyly .      i say     said captain morgan  studying steve again in the light .     you have a trace of moor in you  do you .      steve laughed and decided to explain his ancestry to captain morgan the best he could .     i live in spanish california  but my family originated in  uh  cathay .  you   ve heard of it .         ah .  yes  i   ve heard tales of distant cathay  on the far side of the world .  never been there .  may hap i   ll go someday .     he took a drink of his rum .     what   s it like .         uh   i don   t know .         eh .         i was born in  uh  the new world .         ah .  i see  of course .  but i still don   t understand how your english is so good if you grew up in new spain .      jane suppressed a smile  and hid behind her tankard .      well .  .  .     steve tried to think of an answer .     captain  i suppose we have more english speakers in california than you realize .         hm .  well  it could be .  i wouldn   t know .     morgan gestured to the plate of fruit and waited until jane had taken a banana and steve had picked up a bunch of grapes .     what i do know is that spain has plenty of rich pickings in this sea  and all the way down the atlantic coast .         the spanish main     said steve  repeating a phrase he remembered .      aye  so it is .  and someday i   ll cross all of it .     captain morgan peeled a banana for himself .     it   s full of sweet little towns just waiting for a man of vision to take  just one of these days .     he took a bite of the banana .      really .     steve spoke casually  aware that captain morgan was in a mood to talk shop with them .  he also realized that he was very hungry  and saw that jane was reaching for an apple .      spain has the richest cities in the americas     said captain morgan .     and the strongest .         the strongest .     steve took another banana .      aye .  oh  any city can be taken  all right .  but it takes thought and planning and men of stout heart .     captain morgan glanced at both of them and sat up .     by the stars  i forgot my manners .  you two have had no supper  i wager .         well .  .  . you   d win your wager .     steve grinned .     but we welcome your hospitality as it is .         nonsense .     captain morgan waved to the tavernkeeper .     two beefsteaks for my friends here .  potatoes  too .     he smiled and spread his arms .     no guests of mine go hungry .         we are in your debt     said steve .         when the grilled steaks and boiled potatoes arrived on wooden platters  steve and jane ate eagerly .  steve found his steak rather tough  but he was too hungry to care much .  jane did not complain  either .  the tavernkeeper brought sea salt  black pepper  and some sort of red peppers to spice up the meal .  around them  the tavern remained nearly empty .      may hap you heard about my voyage to cuba last year     said captain morgan  before taking another swig of rum .      hm .     steve made a noncommittal noise  glad that his mouth was full .  he didn   t want to insult the captain by saying he had not heard of it  but he also didn   t want to be caught pretending to have heard of something he hadn   t .      the attack on puerto principe     said captain morgan  relaxing in his chair .     it   s in cuba  to the north of us here in jamaica .      steve nodded  glancing at jane .  she shrugged slightly  indicating that she knew nothing about the subject either .  captain morgan did not seem concerned .      you see  mates  we knew that the spanish had it mind to take jamaica back from us   after all  we took it from them not so many years back .  but i convinced governor modyford not to sit and wait like ducks in a pond .  the way to disrupt your enemy   s plans is to take the war to him .      steve nodded acknowledgment .      the governor commissioned me a colonel for the voyage     captain morgan continued with casual pride .     it required twelve ships   first to take enough men to capture the place  then to bring all the booty home .     he laughed and drank more of his rum .      a great voyage     said steve  between mouthfuls .  that was a safe comment to make .      our good king charles appreciated the share of booty that the governor and i sent him  as well .     captain morgan paused to pour more rum into all the tankards  he seemed surprised to find that the other two were still nearly full  but he said nothing about it .   steve took a taste of his rum to be polite .  he didn   t like it  but he decided not to complain .  jane was hardly touching hers either .      i   ve been lying low this past year     said captain morgan .     my raids on spanish possessions could upset the king if they complicate his politics back home .         that makes sense     said steve .      ha .     captain morgan slapped one hand down on the table  jolting it .     what does he know of the spanish main .         not much  i suppose     said steve mildly .      of course not .  how would he .  but my surprise raids against spanish towns are preventing the spanish in america from coordinating an attack on us british .  they   d like nothing better than to drive us out of the caribbean completely .      steve knew  of course  that the spanish never succeeded in doing that  even his history was good enough on that point .  he knew that hunter would not approve of his telling morgan anything like that  though .   captain morgan leaned toward steve  looking him in the eye .     you   ve no love for the spanish  i take it .         uh   no  not especially .  not me .     steve was caught off guard by the buccaneer   s sudden intensity .      and the two of you missed my voyage to cuba last year  i take it .         yeah  we missed it     said steve .      and yet the two of you are experienced buccaneers who can claim a share of this day   s bounty when your ships come back into port .         well   yes     said steve .      well  then .  i have need of your kind .  i have many ships to fill and not enough men to fill them .  you   ll join me  then  when i put out the call .      steve glanced at jane  who was still leaving all the talking to him .      eh  mates .     captain morgan looked back and forth between them  grinning .      of course     steve said quickly .  he had to keep their masquerade going .     when will it be .  you told the others you are gathering crews right away .         aye  that   s why i came into town this evening .         where do we sail this time .         ah  mate  that   s not to be discussed just yet .     captain morgan grinned and slapped him on the back .     not just with you  mind  but i   m not telling anyone .  not until we are well away at sea  where there is no chance that a word will slip .  i would not have anyone on this island tempted by money to sell our destination in some spanish port .      before long  steve and jane had both finished eating .  captain morgan drank the rest of the rum and tossed a few coins to the tavernkeeper .  then he sighed and looked out the open doorway at the moonlit sky .      well  my friends     said captain morgan .     i rose early today and i shall rise early tomorrow .  i must be off to my rooms here in town .  i have nine ships preparing to sail even now .  you will come when the call goes out for men to sail on them .         aye  aye  captain     said steve .      good .     captain morgan stood up .     i bid you both good evening then .     he strode out  his boots pounding on the wooden floor of the tavern .   after he was gone  jane leaned close to steve .     that was interesting     she whispered .     and we got a free dinner .         not to mention avoiding that sword fight     said steve .     i figured i had to accept his invitation to join his crew .  when the time comes  he   ll be too busy to notice us in the crowd .  i just didn   t want to risk making him mad .         good idea .  can we find the same inn where we stayed the first night .         yeah .  let   s go .  we want to be back on the docks in the morning when hunter comes in with the ships .        hunter spent the night sitting on the deck of the sidonia .  as dawn came up over the edge of the water  the other buccaneers began to rise from their sleep around the ship .  no one bothered him all morning .  near midday  he saw port royal ahead of them .  the old laughing lady had reached port first .  the other ships  the cadiz and the hungry hawk  were coming in just behind the sidonia .   though puzzled and uncertain  hunter had not decided to shut himself down completely .  he still was under a first law imperative to protect his human companions if he could and to return them to their own time even if he was not capable of apprehending mc   .  when the sidonia anchored in the bay  he joined the line of buccaneers who were receiving a share of the loot from the ship .  each one took his share before being lowered in a longboat to be rowed to shore .   hunter   s share was two handfuls of evenly mixed gold and silver coin .  when he stared at the coins in some surprise  a good natured buccaneer handed him a scarf to bundle them up .  without a word  hunter tied his bundle firmly to his sword belt and climbed into the next longboat .   as the other buccaneers ran cheering and whooping for the taverns with their booty  hunter walked along the docks  unsure of himself .  he was nearly in robotic shock and very tentative about making any decision .  without jane   s earlier reminders that his human team still needed him  he might have shut down completely .  as it was  he was having trouble focusing on his goals and choosing decisive action .      lack of focus is only one step away from complete incompetence     hunter said to himself .  putting his concerns into words helped him narrow his attention .     i must concentrate in order to remain functional .  prioritize my goals .  what is most urgent .  first  reconstruct the team .  that requires locating and communicating with steve  jane  and rita .     he activated his internal communicator .     r .  hunter calling steve  jane  and rita .  i am on the waterfront again and will await you here .      hunter was concerned about facing steve and jane again .  he expected that whatever he had done on board ship to cause jane to hit him was no longer relevant .  still  he would not enjoy learning that he had done something extremely serious or  worst of all  violated one of the laws without realizing it .   he began repeating the message at sixty second intervals  and looked back at the ships now anchored in the bay .  none were out of the range of his communicator .  since radio would not be developed for another couple of centuries  he did not have to worry about jamming  codes  regulations  or identification problems .  yet   heard no response .   hunter remained standing where he was  on the waterfront in the morning sunlight .  more buccaneers ran past him  shouting and singing .  he discontinued his message  suddenly concerned that the buccaneers near steve and jane might overhear the sound  chastising himself for forgetting that possibility .   that was another sign that his efficiency was dropping .  in addition  he was growing more anxious as minutes passed without a response .  he should never have left steve and jane .      hey  mate .  come on .     a heavy hand pounded hunter on the back  startling him .   hunter turned in surprise to look .  the buccaneer was almost as big as he was .     yes .  where are you going .         to the taverns  mate .     he had not actually stopped  but turned to face hunter as he backpedaled .     come on  fellow .  i   m ned .  i know you   re one of us   i saw you on board both those spanish pigeons .  so what   s your name  eh .         hunter .         come on  then .      hunter recalled jane   s admonition to maintain his masquerade as a buccaneer .  that  too  gave him some direction .  he followed ned and the other buccaneers  who were scattering to the different taverns  cheering and whooping .   in the tavern  hunter carefully imitated some of the other buccaneers .  he smiled the way they smiled  bought the same bottle and tankard of rum  and sat with ned and his cronies at a big  round table .  this behavior required very little of his attention  however  and the rowdiness of his new companions did not alter his mood in the slightest .   hunter observed that the buccaneers    behavior gradually changed as they consumed greater amounts of rum .  he accessed his data on that substance and studied the effects of drunkenness on humans .  in some ways he found drunkenness to be a very close parallel to his own failing efficiency .  on the other hand  while the pirates became more drunk with each round  his condition did not change .   the tavern was full of loud  raucous buccaneers  at some tables  they were singing .  then two familiar faces caught hunter   s attention .  roland was entering the tavern with mc   .  instantly  hunter focused his attention on both of them .  many of his doubts about his ability were forgotten as he considered the new situation .   deliberately  hunter reviewed his data .  roland and mc   must have returned to port royal on the hungry hawk .  rita  however  should be with them .   hunter remained where he was  observing roland with mc   .  they stood at the bar  roland led the way through the crowd and mc   stayed close to him .  hunter altered his aural sensitivity to prioritize roland   s voice pattern .      two tankards of rum     roland called to the tavernkeeper .     pay the man out of your share  shorty .      mc   paid for the rum .      hey  roland     said a bearded buccaneer at the bar .     why don   t you pay for your own drink .         what do you care .     roland grinned broadly .  then he punched the other man in the stomach suddenly  without any warning .   the other man doubled up .   hunter felt a contradiction churning inside his system  as the first law told him to prevent any further violence and his own judgment told him to let the locals of this time conduct their affairs without his interference .   the man who had been punched lunged for roland   s throat .     roland stepped back in the same moment and mc   slipped in front of him .  as the bearded buccaneer came forward  mc   picked him up under his arms and lifted him into the air .      hey .  hey  you .  this ain   t your fight .     the bearded man kicked and swung his fists helplessly in the air .   the crowd roared with laughter .      he   s a funny fellow     said roland  laughing .     he doesn   t say much  but he hates having anyone try to hurt me .         put me down .         not yet     roland ordered .      does he do everything you tell him .     the first man squirmed but could not get free .      nay     said roland .     i told him to hit a spaniard for me and he wouldn   t do it .  but he   ll do most anything i say .  put him down  shorty .      mc   gently set the buccaneer back on his feet .  the bearded man turned and shoved his way through the crowd .  mc   stood quietly .   hunter decided to make his presence known to mc   .  he could not allow roland to control mc    even if roland did not know why mc   would obey his instructions .  hunter transmitted an internal message to him .      i am r .  hunter  a humaniform robot from your time     said hunter .     acknowledge .      mc   did not respond .      i have followed you from mojave center  under a second law instruction to bring you back to our time .  i am in the room observing you  so your masquerade is no longer effective .  the first law requires that you cooperate with me because your very presence at human size in this time threatens to alter history and harm the humans of the future .  you must acknowledge this first law problem .      mc   did not react outwardly  but he radioed back .     your first law imperative is not fully convincing to me .  until i am fully persuaded that your assessment of my presence is correct  i am not bound by your opinion .         tell me where the woman named rita is .  the first law clearly governs her welfare .         i do not know .         where did you last see her .         she was present at the attack on the ship sidonia .  i know nothing of her whereabouts since that time .      hunter   s worry about rita deepened .   suddenly a roar of shouts came from the doorway .  the bearded buccaneer was back  charging into the tavern at the head of a mob of other drunken buccaneers .  most of them leaped at random on their brethren drinking in the tavern  but their bearded leader ran straight for roland  followed by a knot of bellowing comrades .   roland just had time to fling his tankard at the bearded buccaneer  who dodged it  it banged against the head of a man behind him .  then mc   again blocked the way to roland  but this time the sheer weight of the mob knocked him down .  as mc   hit the floor  many of the men stumbled over him .  they went down in a heap .   roland  who was clearly no coward  leaped into the fray himself .   allover the tavern  onlookers were either joining in or roaring with approval  cheering on one friend or another .  hunter  suddenly moving with more decisiveness and urgency than he had felt since jane had clubbed him  jumped up and ran toward the fight .  hunter now had his best chance ever to grab mc   .         hunter did not speak as he took the shoulders of various buccaneers and flung them aside .  most of what he heard everyone yelling was either insult or encouragement  neither of which seemed desirable to him .  he worked his way through most of the crowd  but people kept jumping on him and hitting him .  none of the punches did any damage  but the necessity to avoid harming any humans delayed him .  he could only push them out of the way  and they kept coming right back .   after several moments  hunter realized that he was not making much progress .  ahead of him  mc   was struggling with four drunken humans in what appeared to be a stalemate .  roland  on the other hand  was taking a beating .   hunter radioed to mc   .     i am going to take roland out the front door .  since he is the cause of this fight  it may solve the problem .  under the first law  to stop all the harm the humans are doing to each other  you must help me .         agreed     mc   radioed back .     i will distract as many of the humans as i can simultaneously .      with a new focus  hunter changed direction .  he shoved aside a couple of buccaneers  then lifted a fairly short fellow and gently but firmly handed him to a surprised larger man  who collapsed under the sudden weight .  when he reached roland  he did not join the fight around him .  instead  hunter grabbed roland around the waist and lifted him up  away from the bearded man and his companions .      whoa .  ahoy .  what   s this .     roland demanded in surprise  kicking and flailing in the air .      i am helping you     said hunter .  he shifted his grip and raised roland high over his head .  then he began a long  difficult walk through the brawling crowd .   mc    now free of the specific chore of protecting roland  got in the way of the buccaneers who were still going after roland .  maneuvering became easier for both robots because most of the buccaneers seemed to think hunter was fighting with roland  and shouted encouragement to hunter to fling roland across the room .   hunter worked his way to the door patiently  still holding roland high .  finally  turning sideways  he burst outside into the tropical sunlight and quickly strode away from the tavern .  he did not hesitate  but walked quickly to the corner of the block and hurried up an alley .  by that time  his hearing told him that none of the humans were following them .      i am in an alley     hunter radioed to mc   .     out the door and to the right .  home in on my signal and join me .     then he spoke aloud to roland .     are you harmed .     hunter carefully bent down and set roland on his feet .      not to speak of .  thanks  mate .     roland looked at him curiously .     i don   t think i know you .  why the rescue  then .  not that i mind  you understand .         i want to know where the woman named rita chavez is .         rita .  i don   t believe i know anyone           lying to me is not wise .  you went on board the hungry hawk with her .  where is she .         uh   well  i do owe you a favor .  sure  i know her a little .  but i lost track of her during the fight on shipboard .  i haven   t seen her since then .      hunter was watching roland   s face carefully and listening to the tone of his voice as he spoke .  from his data about human behavior  he concluded that roland was telling the truth .  he nodded his acceptance .      uh  look  mate   thanks for the lift  so to speak  but i think a few of those blokes may still be under full sail back there .  i ought to make myself scarce for a bit .         yes  i agree .         all right  then .  so long .     roland jogged away from hunter  up the alley .   hunter then realized that mc   should have already joined him .  he walked back down to the main thoroughfare .     mc    respond .  are you in trouble .      on the waterfront  he looked around in all directions .  mc   was not in sight .  the sounds of struggle from the tavern had ended  some buccaneers were singing again .      mc    respond .      when hunter received no answer  he hurried back to the doorway of the tavern .  one of two possibilities had occurred  either mc   had been damaged and trapped in the tavern  or he had run away .  in the doorway  hunter   s enhanced sight and hearing told him instantly that mc   was no longer inside .   hunter stopped where he was .  he realized that he had misjudged the power his first law interpretation had over mc   .  apparently mc   had decided that once roland was safely outside in hunter   s care  the first law imperative on mc   was no longer in effect .  so mc   had taken the opportunity to flee from hunter under the third law while hunter was in the alley with roland .   if mc   had passed the mouth of the alley where hunter had been  hunter would have heard him .  that meant mc   had gone in the opposite direction when he had first left the tavern  on the waterfront  there were only two possible directions from this doorway .  hunter walked quickly after mc    running through the new situation in his mind .      i know that he is nearby     hunter said to himself .     i know he is aware of my presence .  roland knows that mc   will follow his orders  short of harming humans  though he apparently has no idea why  roland does not seem to know that i must do the same .      with mc   so close  hunter felt a resurgence of his efficiency .  a residual effect of his earlier malaise might have accounted for his misjudgment about mc     s response to the first law imperative concerning roland .  still  he knew what to do next .   first he sent out his radio signal to steve  jane  and rita again .  maybe he could finally get an explanation of why jane had clubbed him over the head .  then he began a systematic search of the waterfront and the side streets leading inland .  he turned up his hearing and vision and began to move at a light run .     before wayne took one of the longboats from the old laughing lady back to the docks  he checked on rita .  he found her well  though cautious with him .  she reported that captain tomann had not tried her door .  wayne was convinced that he would not bother rita as long as he believed she was worth a ransom .  then wayne had to wait for the longboat to be rowed back since he had missed the first wave of departures .   finally on the waterfront again by midmorning  wayne looked around for hunter .  he could hear the singing and shouting of celebration from the nearest taverns .  other buccaneers were wandering up and down the waterfront laughing and talking  or shopping at the small booths .  wayne wanted to find hunter to talk business  but of course hunter could find him more easily than he could find hunter .      well     wayne muttered aloud to himself .     might as well enjoy it a little .     he decided to have breakfast .  his pockets were heavy now with coins he had received as his share of the loot from the brief voyage .   wayne went to a booth right across from the docks .  he would be in plain sight there if hunter came walking along the waterfront .  wayne bought a couple of rolls  a small smoked fish  and some fresh  cool water .  then he sat down on a nearby rock to eat .   just as wayne was finishing his first roll  someone slipped quietly behind him and sat down on another rock .      good morning to you     roland said softly  glancing around .     fine day  isn   t it .         what   roland .  come around beside me .     wayne was startled  but tried to cover it .  wayne decided to stay calm and find out what roland wanted .      no  sorry .  i had a spot of trouble a while back .  i   ll just keep my head down and sit behind you .         oh .  something serious .         nay .     roland laughed lightly .     not at all  mate .  too much rum early in the morning and a bit of celebration was all .  i doubt anyone   s carrying a grudge  but i   ll watch out for myself a little longer .         here .     wayne handed him a roll  phrasing his next question carefully .     have you learned anything about the people i paid you to find .         that little guy you   re looking for     said roland  taking a bite out of the roll .     he   s real strong for his size and basically does what people tell him .         that   s right .  so you   ve seen him .         aye .     roland nodded .     but he got away from me again .  he   s here on the waterfront  though  or at least he was not very long ago .         good work .  if you can grab him again  will you bring him to me .  i   m staying out on the old laughing lady .         ah .  you   re on the crew with the wild man  eh .     roland grinned .     don   t make tomann mad  now .  i   d hate to lose you as a source of employment  even with my share of booty from the last voyage .         we   re getting along just fine .         you know .  .  .     roland trailed off  looking at wayne .     that is  could there be another one of these blokes .         another one .  of the same stature .         no  no .  just the opposite .  i got myself into a brawl  see  and the little fellow stopped someone from hitting me .  then a minute later this gigantic man rose up from a table and charged into the group .         gigantic  you say .  maybe about  oh  six and a half feet tall .  brawny .         you got it  mate .  he picked me up like i was a little shaver and carried me out of the tavern over his head .         blond hair  square jaw  clean shaven good looking man .         well  no .  maybe i have the wrong fellow .  this one has brown hair and a beard  and a narrow face .         did he say anything .         well   yes .  he asked me about rita .         rita .         that   s right .         it must be hunter     said wayne .     the same  uh  man but in disguise .  what did you tell him .         i told him i couldn   t help him .         very good .  all right  i tell you what .  for now  forget about looking for rita and distracting her .         as you please .  is there anything you would like me to do   that is  anything worth a bit of coin .         yes .     wayne leaned to one side to stick his hand in his pocket .  he pulled out some more coins .     take this .  stay on the lookout for mc   and bring him to tomann   s ship if you can .      roland took the coins .     he   s important to you  all right  i can see that .  but what   s it all about .         sorry     said wayne .     i can   t explain it .  but it   s very important   more important than you can imagine .  i have to get my hands on him .      roland glanced around quickly and drew away .     i   ll remember that .        steve and jane had spent the previous night at the same inn as before .  it had seemed odd without hunter  but the night passed without incident .  they ate breakfast on the waterfront while they watched the ships sailing into port .  when the longboats began rowing the crews to shore  steve had found a spot at one end of the docks where they could look down the length of the waterfront .  they were searching for hunter most of all  but roland  rita  or mc   would do for a start .   at one point  steve had pointed to a very tall  brawny figure standing uncertainly on the docks after climbing out of a longboat .     hey  there   s hunter .         no  wait     jane had said .     see the beard .  and the brown hair .  i think that   s the guy who was coming after you when you were sword fighting .  he   s the one i clubbed with a belaying pin .  and he might remember me .      they had continued to watch the waterfront until most of the buccaneers were in the taverns  drinking and singing .  then  having nothing better to do  they had begun to walk around again  hoping either to see or be seen by someone they wanted to find .   by midday  they had not seen any of the people or robots they sought  but the buccaneers began wandering out of the taverns again  looking for more excitement .  many were at the booths  crowding the waterfront and making any search more difficult .      look     said jane .     a lot of people seem to be heading for that one tavern up ahead .         isn   t that where morgan bought us dinner last night .         i think you   re right .  it looks different in the daytime .  do you think he   s back there .         one way to find out     said steve .     maybe he   s signing up those crews he mentioned .         watch out for that guy named nick     said jane .     he might want to finish that fight with you .      steve and jane worked their way through the crowds to the tavern .  the doorway was jammed with onlookers  but steve stopped to peer through a window .  inside  captain morgan was seated at the same big  round table he had taken the previous night .  a number of other buccaneers were sitting with him  talking .      what is it .     jane asked  coming up next to steve .      i   m sure he   s planning that voyage .  but i don   t see anyone we   re looking for .         i guess we might as well keep going .         yeah .      they turned away from the window and walked on up the waterfront .     late in the day  wayne sat down at a small outdoor booth for a tankard of ale .  it was on one of the side streets leading away from the waterfront shortly after roland had left him  he had seen steve and jane walking around  obviously looking for someone  and he had spent the afternoon avoiding them as well as searching for mc   .      good day  friend     roland said quietly behind him .   startled  wayne turned and found roland at the head of a small group of buccaneers .  roland was smirking  the others had suspicious  wary expressions .  as wayne looked at them  the group formed a semicircle around him  trapping him against the booth .      good day  roland     said wayne cautiously .      your friend is well     said roland .     my mates found him for me  after i put out the word .         well .  that   s great .  you had a real advantage over me  knowing so many people .         aye  that i did .  and we have your short friend in a place of our own .         let   s go see him     wayne said with forced cheer  sliding off his stool .   roland moved sideways to block his way .     not just yet .  you have my pay .         i will pay on delivery     said wayne .      indeed  you will     said roland .     we will accept his weight in evenly mixed gold and silver coin in exchange for him .         what .     wayne stared at him .     i don   t have anything like that much .         get it    roland turned away .      that   s crazy .     wayne started to reach for roland   s arm .   in response to the motion  five of the nearest buccaneers all tensed .  two reached for their swords and another drew a pistol from his sash .  wayne froze  his heart pounding .   roland glanced back over his shoulder and laughed .  then  shaking his head  he walked away without deigning to turn .  his companions followed him  first walking backward to watch wayne before finally turning and hurrying away .   wayne let out a quivering breath and relaxed .  at least he had a lead on mc     s whereabouts .  roland probably had him imprisoned on the hungry hawk .  however  wayne saw no reasonable way that he could acquire the ransom the buccaneers wanted .   he remained where he was for a few minutes longer  then started walking in the opposite direction from the one roland had taken .  as he thought over his new problem  he saw two possibilities .  he could either try to team up with hunter and almost certainly lose mc   to him permanently  or he could enlist captain tomann   s help .   captain tomann was his first choice  but of course he was still on board his ship .  wayne would have to visit the taverns and find some crew members who would row him back out to the old laughing lady as soon as he could arrange it .  he headed down the waterfront one more time .     steve and jane sat on a couple of empty  discarded kegs at the shore end of a pier as the sun turned red in the west .  they had spent the entire day searching for a familiar face from their own time and had not seen one .  their task had become more difficult as the day wore on  because of the increasing activity up and down the entire waterfront .   all day  buccaneers had brought supplies out of warehouses .  rope  pitch  and canvas were easy to identify as they were  tacked on every pier .  steve knew from his one previous voyage that food  fresh water  gunpowder  and cannon shot had to be in the barrels men rolled down the street and in the crates he saw loaded onto wagons .  even so late in the day  the men doing the work jammed the waterfront  shouting and cursing as they worked .  other buccaneers filled their longboats with supplies and rowed them out to their ships  then returned for another load .      i count the nine ships captain morgan told us about     said steve .     i think that   s a very big voyage for a town this size .  and i think he may have ordered them to be ready to sail by dawn .         why didn   t they plan ahead .  they could have loaded the ships in advance .         remember how important secrecy was to him .  he probably wants to get under way before word starts to spread to other ports .         say  is that    no  never mind .     jane shook her head .     i thought i saw hunter  but it   s a false alarm .         where .         it   s that guy i hit over the head .         him again .  we   ve been avoiding him all day .  he might not even remember you .     steve looked at the figure moving through the crowd  towering head and shoulders over the people around him .     there aren   t many guys that big  are there .      suddenly jane gasped .     steve  look .         where .         at that guy .  he just came through the crowd into an open space .  you can see all of him .         what about him .         i think it is hunter .         how can he be hunter .         ignore his face for a minute .  look at the rest of him   his build  the way he moves  his walk .     she shook her head .     steve  in the excitement of the fight on board ship  i forgot   he can change his appearance .         he can .         yes  that   s one of his more sophisticated abilities .         you mean he can actually alter the shape of his face like that .         yes  that   s what i mean .  within limits  he can alter his body shape as well .  and i clubbed him .  come on .     she jumped up and ran .              hunter .  hunter .     jane ran toward him  shouting and waving .   caught by surprise  steve got up and followed her .  up ahead  the tall buccaneer had instantly turned at the sound of jane   s voice .  then he waved back and moved to meet her .      hunter .  so it is you .     jane smiled with relief as she caught up to him .      yes  of course     said hunter stiffly  in a flat monotone .     i have tried to reach you both through the communicators i gave you .         we lost them     said steve .     we   ll tell you about it later .         i have an urgent question to ask jane     said hunter .     what did i do wrong .         what do you mean .         why did you strike me .         on shipboard  you mean .     jane   s eyes widened in surprise .     hunter  i didn   t recognize you .      hunter   s hesitation was barely perceptible to steve  but that meant it was very long by robotic standards .      i made a careless mistake     said hunter .     i altered my appearance so that i would not alert wayne nystrom or rita that i was nearby on board ship .         and then you forgot .     jane looked at him skeptically .     robots don   t just forget .  what happened .         my efficiency had dropped below normal even before that moment     said hunter .  his voice was no longer a monotone  though he still spoke in a tentative  stilted fashion .     when the fighting began  i was focused tightly on sorting out which first law imperatives to pursue  such as protecting you  and which ones i had to ignore  such as allowing buccaneers to fight each other so that i would not alter the course of history .         you came up to help me fight that spaniard     steve said suddenly .     i thought you were coming after me .         so did i     said jane .     that   s why i clobbered you .         i have no excuse     said hunter .     if my efficiency had been at a normal level  i would have remembered at all times that humans recognize each other primarily by appearance .         don   t you .     steve asked .      not necessarily .  i can make a positive identification by voice pattern as well .  other traits  such as footsteps and heartbeat  can be equally definitive in some cases .         i made the same kind of mistake     said jane .     if i had seen you just walking down the street the first time  i might have guessed it was you  just like i did a few minutes ago .  but in the excitement of the fighting  i got careless too .     she studied him for a moment .     so you thought i was punishing you for something you did .         not punishing me     said hunter .     i thought i was making a serious mistake that you had to prevent  one so urgent that you did not have time to discuss it .  i nearly shut myself down because of it .         your misinterpretation was a minor mistake     jane said quickly .     no harm has been done .  don   t let it raise your doubts about your adequacy for this mission again .         understood     said hunter .     but i think i will change my appearance back to the way it was .      steve glanced at the crowd of men working around them  even though the sun had begun to sink below the horizon .     better duck out of sight first .  otherwise  these guys are going to see you and think it   s witchcraft or something .         let   s all move over to a side street     said jane quickly .     come on .      as soon as they left the waterfront  the streets were much less crowded .  hunter simply turned toward a tree trunk and bent low to hide his face from any passersby .  he remained motionless for less than a minute .  when he turned around again  he had returned to his original appearance .      wow     said steve .      have you made any progress on our search .     hunter asked .  his voice was almost normal now .      not really     said steve .     i went overboard during the fight on board ship .  jane lowered a boat and jumped in the water too .     he grinned at her .      we lost our communicators in the water     said jane .     but we rowed back to shore safely .  we   ll tell you about captain morgan later .         i communicated briefly with mc    but he got away     said hunter .     he and roland are in the area again  however .         i have this feeling that maybe rita and roland are just hiding out somewhere     said steve .     suppose they really fell for each other .  they could stay out of sight for a long time .         that is not the impression i got     said hunter .     i spoke to him too .         we need to brief each other     said steve .     and i   m hungry .  let   s do it over dinner .         i   m all for that     said jane .     hunter was deeply relieved to learn that he had not made a mistake serious enough to force jane to hit him .  he did note that in the maze of first law questions which arose on board the ship  he had failed to communicate his new appearance to his team  that was clearly a serious failure .  since jane had shared the responsibility for the confusion  however  he was able to allay some of his doubts .   steve found a small tavern out by the end of the waterfront where they had built the jamaica jane .  it was nearly deserted .  hunter  steve  and jane sat at a corner table and recounted their actions since they had split up  completing the stories as they set aside their dishes at the end of the meal .      and so     hunter finished     i have continued to radio mc   occasionally  but he has not responded again .  he clearly has decided that my interpretation of the first law imperative regarding the future is too uncertain to override his third law imperative to keep himself away from us .         have you radioed any details about the application of chaos theory to history .     jane asked .     maybe he would have to take the argument more seriously if it was developed .         yes  i tried that this afternoon from time to time     said hunter .     i suspect he shut off his receiver again as soon as he fled  to avoid that kind of argument .         this place is still empty     said steve  looking around the tavern .     when we first came in  i thought we had just beaten the dinner rush .  but no one   s coming in at all .         i guess the loading is still going on     said jane .     but   s it   s dark now .      steve nodded .     i can see men carrying torches pass by from time to time .  and there is some moonlight .         i suppose we need a new plan of action     said jane .     maybe we can discuss what to do tonight  get some rest  and put it into practice tomorrow .         sure     said steve  with forced cheer .     well   at least we don   t have to worry about being run down by a dinosaur stampede .      jane laughed .   hunter suddenly received a call on his internal receiver .      rita calling hunter .  are you there .     her voice was low and hurried .      hunter here     he radioed back .     where are you .         i   m a prisoner on a ship called the old laughing lady .  i need help .  wayne nystrom has this captain tomann guy working with him .  they   re keeping me here .         i saw the ship in the harbor today .  you are in port royal .  we are not far .         but we   re leaving .         you are .         wayne just told me we   re about to set sail .  i   m in one of the officer   s quarters .         are you in danger of immediate harm .         uh   no  except for being taken out of port .  i would have called earlier today  but i was sure they would take me ashore again .         i want to remain in radio contact with you .  how often are you alone .         well  i was alone most of today  but we were anchored .  i don   t know what will happen now .         all right .  as you know  i cannot risk exposing captain tomann or other buccaneers to radio .  please contact me every hour if you can .  i will not call you .  we will follow you  however  if we can .         hunter .         yes .         i .  .  . apologize .  i made a big mistake .         accepted .  hunter out .         what is it  hunter .     jane was looking closely at him .     for a minute there  i thought you were freezing up or something .         rita just contacted me by radio     said hunter  rising from his chair .     she is wayne nystrom   s prisoner on board the old laughing lady   and the fleet is setting sail .         wow .     steve leaped up .     we have to join them somehow .         come .     hunter walked briskly out of the tavern  leaving payment for dinner on the bar without breaking stride .  steve and jane hurried after him .   outside  hunter crossed the wide thoroughfare to walk down one of the long piers .  now  for the first time that day  all the docks were empty of barrels and crates  enabling him to see clearly in all directions .  on each side  the surf broke with a steady  rhythmic crashing .  in the harbor  many of the ships showed small  yellowish lights on deck and sometimes in the windows of the officers    quarters astern .      can we sign on the old laughing lady  too .     jane wondered .     or would that be a mistake .         maybe we can try     said hunter .  he looked out across the harbor  enhancing his vision to make the most of the pale moonlight .  many of the ships were of the same type and design  but no two were exactly alike  especially in their rigging .  by accessing his memory of the old laughing lady  hunter was able to pick it out now in the distance .     it is a long way out into the harbor .  by the time we find a longboat to reach it  i expect it will have set sail .         where   s the hungry hawk .     steve asked .     maybe we can sign on with captain quinn .  i bet he   s going  too .         we have the same problem with him     said hunter .     captain quinn also anchored well away from shore .  we may have to build another version of the jamaica jane to follow them .         oh  no     said steve .     i hope not .     he looked around frantically  and pointed to another ship  showing some lights nearby .     that ship hasn   t weighed anchor yet .  and it   s a lot closer to the docks .  i can even spot some of the guys on board   you see them  when they walk within the range of lamps on the deck .         maybe it   s not part of the fleet     said jane .      it is riding low in the water     said hunter .     it was probably loaded today for the voyage  like so many others .         steve     jane said anxiously .     i think that   s captain morgan .     she pointed .     look next to that lamp right by the rail  in the big plumed hat .         yes .     steve took a deep breath and shouted .     captain morgan .  captain morgan .      hunter watched the man in the plumed hat .  he showed no sign of hearing steve .     the breaking of the surf is drowning you out .  i could shout loud enough for him to hear  but it would be humanly impossible and someone might notice .      steve turned to look up and down the waterfront .     there .     he pointed and ran back down the length of the dock .   hunter jogged after him  trying to figure out what steve had seen .  jane ran with him .  at the end of the pier  steve turned to his left and kept running .      you there .  you guys .     steve was yelling and waving as he ran .   hunter saw a couple of buccaneers sitting on the near end of another pier  leaning against a discarded pile of rotted canvas as they drank out of tankards .  a dinghy tied to the pier swayed gently on the waves near them .  the two buccaneers looked up over their tankards in surprise at steve .      is that your boat .     steve demanded  slowing down .      who wants to know .     one buccaneer  sporting a large  gold hoop earring  grinned at him with broken teeth  then took another drink .      i   ll buy it from you .     steve pulled up in front of them  breathing hard .      he wants to buy it from us     said the other buccaneer mockingly  closing one eye to look at steve .  he tugged thoughtfully on a thin  scraggly beard .   hunter slowed down as he came up behind steve .  jane stopped with him .  the two buccaneers glanced at them cautiously .      how much do you want for the dinghy .     steve asked .      a handful of gold coin     said the man with broken teeth belligerently .     if you want it so bad .         we   ll give you one gold coin for it     said steve .     and it   s not worth that much .         nay  nothing doing     said the buccaneer .     prices went up all over town when that spanish treasure came into port this morning .  and you sound awful anxious .         aren   t you missing your ship .     steve jerked a thumb toward the harbor .     you   re being left behind too .         maybe we don   t care .  or maybe we just don   t plan to go to sea tonight .         all right .  two gold pieces .  you can buy a lot of rum for that .         i got this feeling that your ship is about to weigh anchor too .  maybe you three are the ones in a hurry  eh .      steve glanced out toward captain morgan   s ship .  then he turned to hunter .     he has a point .  what do you think .      hunter untied the scarf holding his share of loot and poured a modest handful of coins into his palm .  then he walked over to the buccaneer who had done most of the talking and looked down at him .  the buccaneer   s eyes widened as he looked up at hunter   s immense body towering over him .      is this enough .     hunter spoke in a cold  firm  authoritative voice as he dropped the coins into the buccaneer   s tankard  where they splashed into his rum .      aye     said the buccaneer hoarsely  his throat suddenly gone dry .      hurry     hunter said to steve and jane  moving quickly toward the dinghy .  he untied the line and held it as they carefully climbed down and sat in the stem .  then he joined them in the boat and pushed off  hard .  as the dinghy angled away from the dock  hunter took the center seat facing the stem and grabbed two oars .  he positioned them carefully and then began to row .      say .  look at the fellow on the oars     said the bearded buccaneer behind them  in surprise .     he can really move that boat .         aw  so what .     his friend snickered .     we did all right  for a boat that wasn   t ours anyhow .         do you want us to take an oar .     steve asked .     jane and i could each take an oar .  i see another set of oarlocks behind you .         no     said hunter .     i can maintain our desired speed and direction more consistently this way .     he looked around to see if captain morgan   s ship had moved .  it was not yet under way .   hunter concentrated on the flexibility of the oars as he stroked  he was strong enough to row harder  but risked snapping off the oars if he did so  no one spoke .   the dinghy moved through the waves steadily  with agonizing slowness .  at least the waves were moderate and the wind was low .  facing him in the stern  steve and jane looked into the distance ahead anxiously .  at last  hunter could hear the creaking of the sailing ship growing closer .      captain morgan .  ahoy .     steve shouted .     ahoy the ship .         ahoy the boat .  who   s there .     the voice was gruff and suspicious .   hunter turned to look up .  he adjusted his rowing to maintain the position of the dinghy .  if they got too close to the hull of the ship  they would have trouble seeing the men who were up on deck .      steve and   and john  from last night     called steve .     where   s captain morgan .         not so fast     said the buccaneer .  he disappeared from sight .  a moment later he reappeared .     the captain says all right .     he threw a long rope ladder down the side of the hull .   steve laughed with relief .      i guess we made it     said jane .   hunter maneuvered the dinghy against the hull and held its position .  steve started up the rope first  then jane .  hunter remained in the boat until they had both climbed all the way over the rail .  meanwhile  the buccaneers above cranked down a couple of lines on a winch for hunter to tie to the dinghy .  after he had secured the lines  he ascended the rope ladder .  by the time he was climbing over the rail  the buccaneers had already begun raising the dinghy .      always glad to have experienced buccaneers along     captain morgan was saying to steve and jane .     and this is your friend .  you are .  .  .  .         i am hunter  captain .         well met  hunter  all right .     captain morgan turned and glanced around .     we   re almost ready .  you three give a hand where you see the need .     he hurried away  calling to someone across the deck .   some buccaneers were carrying crates of food below .  others were belaying kegs on deck with rope .  hunter saw a couple of men lifting a rolled sail and quickly joined them .  steve and jane hurried to his side .  soon they were just part of the crew  working to get the ship under way .         wayne had returned to the old laughing lady before sundown .  he had not yet told captain tomann that roland was holding mc   hostage .  the captain had been busy all evening directing preparations for the upcoming voyage  so wayne had easily avoided him .  in the moonlight  wayne stood on deck watching the hungry hawk a short distance away .  he was sure that roland had mc   on board there .      a fine night for sailing  eh .     captain tomann came up next to him .      huh .  oh   it sure is  captain .  when do we leave .         we follow captain morgan out of port .  the lookout is watching his ship .         so  where are we going this time .         i wish i knew .  that crafty old morgan won   t even tell his own crew  let alone the other captains .         and you   re following him anyway .         aye  he   s always done well by us .  i   m trusting him to raid some fat sleepy spanish town   like his raid on puerto principe in cuba last year .      wayne nodded .      so what about our valuable friend .  did you get any leads on him in town .         no     said wayne .     that is  not for sure .  but i wonder if he is on one of the other ships on this voyage .         ah .  now that would be a boon .  may hap we can grab him somewhere along the way  eh .     captain tomann laughed raucously and pounded him on the back before walking away .   wayne was not sure why he had said what he had .  he would probably need captain tomann   s help to get mc    but he wanted to be cautious .  roland had betrayed his trust and he was certain that captain tomann was not above doing so as well .   rita posed another problem .  wayne   s earlier plan of trading rita to hunter for mc   was on hold for the moment   but if hunter managed to get mc   before wayne did  then it would still work .  he saw that captain tomann was occupied elsewhere and quietly went below to see rita .   her quarters were still bolted on the outside .  wayne unbolted the door and knocked politely .      who is it .     rita demanded .      wayne .      she unbolted the door from her side and opened it .  she folded her arms .     how long are you going to hold onto me .         well   i don   t know .  but i should come in .      she moved back and he closed the door .  then she walked all the way to the rear of the chamber  facing one of the small open windows .  through it  he could see the waterfront in the distance .      exactly what do you want  anyway .     she turned back to him again .     you really don   t care about me one way or another  do you .         no  not really .         then what am i doing here .         look  i don   t want to hurt you or anyone else .  i just want my robot back .            your    robot   mc   .         that   s right .         i know you invented the governor robots  but that doesn   t make him yours .         i think that   s my business        i repeat  what do you want with me .         i   m not exactly sure .  but i can   t have you interfering with me .  so for now  you   ll have to stay here .         well  then  why are we still in port .  i thought you said earlier that we were sailing soon .         we   re ready .  apparently we have to wait for a captain morgan to lead us out of port .      her eyebrows went up .     captain henry morgan .         i don   t know his first name .  i guess so .         i knew he was here somewhere  of course     said rita .     well .  .  . let   s see .  summer       .  of course   it   s his famous raid on portobelo .         where .         no  no .     she shook her head .     our destination is a secret .  i can   t let it get out .  if it does  and the raid is foiled somehow  then we   ll change history .         i guess i don   t have to know .  i don   t want to change history either .         what did you come to see me about .      wayne paused .     i don   t know .  maybe i wanted to make sure you were okay .         to make sure your prisoner couldn   t escape  you mean .     she turned away  looking out the window again .      well .  .  . like i said  i don   t want to hurt you .  i just want my robot back .        captain morgan   s ship led the fleet of nine from the harbor .  steve stood by the rail with jane and hunter  watching the lights of port royal shrink in the distance and the lamps of the other ships follow them .  when the fleet was safely out to sea and sailing south  most of captain morgan   s crew went to sleep  leaving only the customary skeleton crew on night watch .      hunter     said steve .     can you pick out the hungry hawk .      hunter looked across the moonlit water at the other ships .     yes  i see it .         is there any way you could sneak over there tonight and bring rita back .         it is not impossible for me to swim that distance     said hunter .     the hungry hawk is one of the ships closest to us .  however  the risk and difficulty are too high .  i will wait until we are anchored  preferably closer .      steve nodded .     i guess   knew that .  i just wanted to make sure .         i also have to feel that you two are safe     said hunter .     after what happened the last time we separated  i do not want to leave you unless i feel we can reunite without difficulty  especially now that the communicators are gone .         what will you do if rita is not fully cooperative when you find her .         she radioed me for help     said hunter .     i believe she wants to rejoin us .         i hope you   re right     said jane .     but i   m asking you as a roboticist .  can you bring her back against her will .         normally  i could not     said hunter .     she would give me instructions that i would have to obey .  however  in the current circumstances  i can interpret the potential harm she may cause to our future as a first law imperative .         what if she puts up a real fight .     steve asked .     and makes enough noise to bring trouble .         you mean  if she alerts her captors .         that   s right .         in that event  i would have to judge whether or not an even more immediate first law imperative exists .  this contingency is too complex to predict .         in other words  you   ll have to improvise .         yes .         i wonder how long it will be before we anchor .     steve looked up at the stars .     we   re still going south  maybe a little to the southwest .  i wonder where we   re going .         i do not have enough detailed history to know     said hunter .     the data i stored from the city library focused on jamaica and did not include this voyage .  i hired rita to provide this kind of historical data  which i could not foresee needing .  i made a poor choice .         she failed to keep to her agreement     said jane .     that   s her responsibility  not yours .      steve gazed out at the other ships again .  they were a silent  peaceful sight on a calm  warm night .  for now he could see nothing to do but wait .   as before  hunter remained awake next to steve and jane as they stretched out for the night .   at dawn  steve rose to find that the ships were still sailing in a good wind .  on the captain   s orders  some of the buccaneers broke open crates and barrels of bread  cheese  rum  and fresh water and passed them out .  steve and jane took their shares and moved away from the crowd  as usual .      ah .  good morning to you  steve and john .     captain morgan came up to them .     where   s hunter .      steve grinned and pointed upward .     he   s up in the crow   s nest .  he volunteered to take a turn up there .         really .     captain morgan craned his neck to look .     aye  i see him .  i hope it   s strong enough to hold him .  he   s a very big fellow .         and his eyesight is surprisingly good .     steve grinned and took a bite out of his hunk of cheese .      i don   t expect he   ll have much to see for a couple of days     said captain morgan .     but we must have someone up there  just in case .         so     steve said casually  looking at the other ships in the fleet .     where are we headed  captain .      captain morgan laughed .     not yet  my friend .  not yet .  in a couple of days  granted fair weather  i shall call all the captains together in council .  then i will reveal our destination  but not before .         i see the hungry hawk over there     said steve  pointing to it with his tankard of drinking water .     we   d like to greet captain quinn again  if we get the chance .  he sailed on that last voyage of ours .         the time will come .     captain morgan shrugged and moved on  calling to someone else .      why did you say that .     jane asked .      i wanted to remind him that we   re buccaneers   that we belong .         i wouldn   t let him know we   re interested in the hungry hawk .     jane paused to munch on a piece of bread .     we don   t want him to know that we have our own agenda .         you   re right .     steve smiled  and nudged her playfully with his elbow .     you   re learning more all the time .         about what .         how to improvise .        alone in her chamber  rita paced anxiously .  she wondered if hunter and his team were anywhere nearby .  for the first time  she was considering that she might really get herself killed in the seventeenth century .  at the windows  she looked out at some of the other ships in the fleet .   so far  captain tomann had left her alone .  she liked roland and supposed that he was with the fleet somewhere .  maybe he would save her if he learned she was locked up .   rita decided it was time to call hunter again   if he was still in range of her communicator .  first she went to the door and listened for footsteps .  she might make excuses about talking to herself if someone heard her voice  but she would not be able to explain if they heard hunter   s .  then  just to make sure  she moved back to the rear of the room .      hunter .  rita calling .         hunter here .  are you well  rita .         yes   but where are you .  are you close .         steve  jane  and i are on board captain morgan   s flagship .  i will have to wait until we anchor before i can attempt taking you off the old laughing lady  under present circumstances .  however  if an emergency arises earlier  call me .         we won   t anchor for days     said rita .      how long will this leg of the voyage take .         i don   t remember exactly .  let me think .  at top speed in perfect wind  three or four days .  realistically  i would guess a week at the soonest  maybe longer   if the wind is a big problem  much longer .  when we do anchor  it will only be for a short time .  we   ll stop first off the coast of costa rica .         you know where we   re going then .  what will happen at costa rica .         not very much .  captain morgan will send longboat crews to shore for fresh water and any food they can find .  he   ll be meeting with his captains to give them our true destination .  we   re going to attack a city in panama called portobelo  near the modern city of colon .         thank you  rita .  we will help you as soon as we can .  hunter out .      rita sighed  wishing that he could help her right away .  still  knowing the team was nearby was reassuring .  she gazed out the window again  watching the other ships .     hunter passed the information he had learned from rita to steve and jane as soon as he could .  as rita had predicted  the ships sailed for over a week .  jane avoided the buccaneers  still worried that they would discover she was a woman .  hunter and steve usually found chores the three of them could do by themselves .  anyone who began to work on a job was allowed to continue  as the assignments on the pirate ship were haphazard .  they kept to themselves and the rest of the crew mostly left them alone .  even under the influence of their nightly rum  none of the buccaneers wanted trouble with someone who could lift  carry  and climb the way hunter could .   on the eighth day out of port  the lookout shouted that land was visible to the south .  as the buccaneers ran to the side to look  hunter used the map in his stored data and correlated it with the duration  speed  and direction of their voyage .  this confirmed to him that they had arrived off the shore of costa rica .      the captains will meet after we anchor     hunter said quietly to steve and jane .     but longboats will be sent ashore for supplies .  it will be a good time for me to attempt reaching the old laughing lady from here and i will feel more secure under the first law if you two remain safely on board ship .  so we should avoid being assigned to the longboats .         we won   t be close enough to drop anchor for most of the day     said steve .     but when the time comes  let   s go below .  i doubt anyone will care  but if anyone comes down  we   ll look busy .  we   ll move crates around in the hold or something .         good .      at midafternoon  the fleet finally drew near enough to drop anchor offshore .  hunter glanced at captain morgan  who was eyeing the jungle covered coast through a spyglass .  then hunter turned to steve and jane .      it is time  i think .  into the hold  quickly .      no one else was below .  the three of them sat quietly on crates in the hot  dank air while the buccaneers on deck shouted and cheered .  they were all anxious to get a break from the routine by rowing to land .   hunter could tell what was happening by the sounds he heard .  first the longboats were released from every ship on long lines  each one dropping into the sea with a splash .  then the buccaneers climbed down rope ladders  shouting to each other to hurry .  soon he could hear the oars splashing into the water as the longboats pulled away .  for several minutes  he heard only the footsteps of the skeleton crew that remained on board .      captain morgan is probably going to summon the captains to join him here now for his conference .         how can he summon them .     jane asked .      with flags     said steve .     but  look   the longboats are gone  so we can go up on deck again .         all right     said hunter .     but i cannot risk swimming to the old laughing lady while the other captains are being rowed to this ship .  i shall have to wait until they have arrived .         that   s right     said steve .     we   ll go up and wait .      no one on deck took any special notice of them when they emerged from the hold .  the buccaneers who were still on board were standing by the rail  gazing at the shore .  captain morgan stood with them  talking and pointing .   hunter turned toward the other eight ships .  several longboats were already coming toward morgan   s ship first  on their way to the shore .  that told hunter the signaling had been completed already .   he moved to the seaward side of the ship and occupied his time by checking the firmness of belayed ropes and the tightness of knots .  steve and jane did the same .  until the longboats left  they would simply pass the time quietly .         as hunter pretended to work  he kept count of the other ship captains who came on board .  when all eight had arrived  captain morgan took them below to his quarters .  their longboats then headed across the gentle blue waves toward the shore .      time for me to go     he said quietly to steve .   steve looked around the deck .     no one is watching .  but just in case they turn around  let   s see .  .  .  jane  stand next to me and help me pull on this rope .      jane and steve pulled on a loose rope dangling from a pulley in the rigging above .  all the rope did was slide through the pulley  but hunter used their bodies as a screen as he moved to the rail .  as silently as possible  he climbed over it and started down the side of the ship .  his hearing told him that none of the buccaneers had noticed his departure .   using tiny irregularities in the wood on the side of the ship as handholds and footholds  hunter worked his way down the side just as he had climbed up the side of the cadiz .  hunter worked his way to the waterline and slipped into the sea without a splash .  the old laughing lady was roughly fifty meters away  with some variation as the ships drifted on the radius of their anchor lines .  in the moderate waves  a good human swimmer could make it easily .  for hunter  it would take virtually no effort at all .   hunter swam the distance half a meter under the surface of the water .  if anyone happened to look in his direction  he would be no more than a shadow of the sort that a large fish or a shark might make .  at the same time  he was close enough to the surface for the tropical sunlight to beat down on him as he swam  replenishing his energy through the microscopic solar collectors on his skin where his clothing left it exposed .  he arrived at the waterline of the old laughing lady with only a little less energy than he had possessed when he had started his swim .   when he broke the surface of the water  he heard no sound of human activity on the ship .  cautiously  he began to climb up the hull .  he hesitated at the rail  looking and listening again .  some buccaneers were dozing on the deck .  a few others were gazing toward the shore .  none noticed him .   moving slowly and silently  hunter moved up on deck  always behind crates  kegs  or rolled sails in order to stay hidden .      rita  hunter calling     he radioed .      hunter .     she radioed back .     is that you .         yes .  i am on deck  staying out of sight of crew members .  where are you .         i   m in one of the officer   s quarters .      hunter worked his way below  still alert for buccaneers  but encountered none .  in the narrow hall  he saw that only one door was bolted from the outside .  he unlocked it and heard another bolt move inside the door .   rita opened it  smiling with relief .     hunter  i can   t tell you how embarrassed i am .  i had no idea i was going to cause this much trouble .  when i left  i just wanted to get a feel for the times and experience some of this history .      hunter nodded noncommittally .     we should get away from here promptly .         hunter  i   m trying to apologize .         i accept your apology     hunter said blandly .     please help the tam from this point .         of course           come on .     hunter was not angry at her in the human sense  but he was not sure how much he could trust her .  at the very least  her judgment was flawed .  for now  he simply wanted to reunite his entire team .   hunter carefully led rita up on deck  to the side of the ship that was away from the shore .  hunter could see a few buccaneers on some f the other ships walking around on deck  but none was paying any attention to the old laughing lady .  the buccaneers on the lady were still either napping or watching the shore .  over their heads  signal flags snapped in the breeze  creating enough sound to camouflage hunter   s voice .      can you swim fifty meters .     hunter whispered .      yes .  but my clothes will weigh me down and i can   t discard anything .  i   ll need them all when i get to the other ship .  so i won   t be able to keep up with you .         i will stay right with you  of course     said hunter .     if you tire  i will carry you back .         i see a little dinghy still on board here     said rita .     we could row .         we must avoid notice if possible     hunter .     we will swim .         what about  uh  sharks .         i saw none .  do you trust my judgment regarding the first law of robotics .         yes .         then we should swim .         all right .        steve sat on a crate next to jane  who was sitting on a keg .  while they had been waiting  they had stacked up some empty crates to block the buccaneers    view of the rail where hunter would come aboard  placing them near a rope ladder attached to the side with belaying pins .  then they watched hunter swim toward them on his back while holding rita in the lifeguard   s across chest carry .  some of the buccaneers on board were napping in the shade of the sails  others were still watching the shoreline from the opposite rail .  none were looking toward hunter  nor were they concerned with steve and jane .   when hunter and rita reached the ship  steve quietly let down the rope ladder .  he moved it hand over hand  making sure that the slight thumping of the ladder against the side of the ship attracted no attention .  rita came up first  breathing hard from exertion  and gave him a self conscious smile .  he nodded coolly and held up a hand for her to wait .   jane looked around to see if anyone was watching .  then she motioned for rita to come over the rail .  steve helped her .      squat down out of sight for a moment and get your breath back     said steve .   rita ducked down by the pile of crates .   hunter climbed over the rail  slowly and silently  and joined them .  he kept his voice low .     did anyone miss me .         no     said jane .     they   re all too busy waiting to see if their friends come back with fresh water and good food .         the sun and wind will dry our clothes quickly     said hunter .     rita  we will keep you close to us and hidden from the others as much as possible .      rita nodded .      someone is going to notice her sooner or later     said steve .     we should say that she came back from shore on the wrong longboat .  i don   t think anybody will care .  these buccaneers just want everyone to take a turn at the chores and to divide the loot fairly after a raid .         that is reasonable     said hunter .     rita  what do you think of that .         it sounds plausible .  but they better not see me till these clinging clothes dry out and get baggy again .      the ship captains came up on deck  holding rolled maps in their hands .  they were talking and laughing among themselves .  steve stood up to watch .  the napping buccaneers woke up  and those at the rail also turned .      gather    round  mates     called captain morgan  waving to everyone .     we   re off for portobelo in panama  the richest city in new spain .      the buccaneers looked at each other in surprise and cheered  but steve felt they were less than truly enthusiastic .  captain morgan began telling them all about the wealth to be found there .  steve knelt next to rita .      what   s wrong with everybody .  why aren   t they more excited about all the booty in portobelo .         the trouble is  portobelo is also the most strongly fortified and defended city in the americas right now     said rita .      really .  what   s it like .         it   s situated on a river  a short distance inland from the river mouth .  every man in the fleet has probably heard about it .         strongly fortified .  in what way .         the harbor to portobelo is guarded by three forts  one on each side of the entrance and one on a cliff overlooking the city .  any ships that sail within range of their cannons to attack will get smashed to pieces long before they can land         quiet     said jane .     they   re coming this way .         have a look  mates     called captain morgan  striding across the deck to the shoreward side of the ship .  his captains and the buccaneers followed him .     look down the coast to the south from here .  portobelo lies less than two days    sail from here .  when the men return from foraging this evening  we   ll have a fine supper .  then we   ll sail .      another chorus of cheers rose up  no stronger than before .  captain morgan dismissed the captains  who boarded their longboats again to return to their ships .  then he saw steve  jane  and hunter watching him .  rita had slipped around to the other side of the crates .      so  hunter     said captain morgan with a challenging grin .     are you as fainthearted as my other men .         i have every confidence in you     said hunter .      ah .  that   s what i like to hear .  steve  what about you  then .  what do you say .         i say that you know more about this than any other man afloat     steve said carefully .     but portobelo will be tough to crack  won   t it .         not so tough  mate .  well  i   ve told my captains what we   ll do  so it   s no secret now .  we   re going to sail down to a creek i know of about twenty miles south of portobelo .  we   ll anchor our ships there  and sneak up on portobelo inland .      steve glanced at rita around the corner of the crates  out of captain morgan   s sight .  she gave him a slight nod .  he turned back to captain morgan .      inland  huh .     steve said .      aye  mate .  we   ll visit their back door .     captain morgan winked and strolled away .   rita moved again  to remain out of his sight .      rita     hunter said quietly .     do you know where mc   is now .  is he with the fleet at all .         i don   t know for sure     said rita .     but wayne said i was a hostage .  i asked him what he wanted with me and he said he would trade me to you in exchange for mc   and a promise not to interfere with him .  he kept saying he didn   t want to hurt me .  he only wanted his robot back .     she hesitated .     you know  when he and captain tomann first locked me up  wayne was very forceful   he seemed to know what he was doing .  the last time he talked to me  i got the feeling he wasn   t too sure anymore .      steve looked at hunter .     so wayne doesn   t have mc   yet .  but mc   could be anywhere .         maybe roland has him again     said hunter .     roland knows that mc   will follow his instructions .  maybe they are together on a ship in the fleet .         rita  how well does this voyage go .     steve asked .     does morgan do okay .         yes  he does very well .         i am continuing to radio mc   occasionally     said hunter .     no response  of course  or i would have told you about it .  still  we should turn our attention to the hungry hawk again .         do you want to swim over there and look for him .     steve asked .      no .  the captains will be back on their ships soon .  so will the foraging crews and i do not want to be caught sneaking around over there while you three are still on board here .  we could all row there  but we might not find mc   on the ship after all .  then we would still have to answer to the buccaneers for our presence if they found us there .         they wouldn   t take kindly to that     said rita .     treachery is common among buccaneers and they aren   t too patient when they believe they   ve found it .         i understand     said hunter .     for now  i will have to wait .  i believe that my next opportunity will arrive when we anchor south of portobelo .      the foraging crews brought back as many birds and bananas as they could carry on the longboats  along with the kegs refilled with fresh water .  on land  it would not have been a remarkable meal  but after a week on shipboard  the buccaneers considered it a welcome change .  as the sun went down  they roasted the birds on deck .  captain morgan broke out some carefully measured rations of the rum that had been kept in reserve .  they ate and drank and sang  preparing themselves for the fight that would be coming soon .   hunter  steve  and jane kept rita away from the buccaneers at first .  as twilight fell  and the buccaneers drank more  the team brought rita closer to them .  they shared quietly in the meal and none of the buccaneers took any special notice of rita .   hunter observed that captain morgan drank little himself and had served rum rations that were quite modest .  the reason became clear later that night  when the captain used signal lanterns to order the fleet to sail on the night tide .  the crew was in condition to respond  and hunter saw the lights of the other ships follow them .     the voyage remained uneventful until the fleet anchored once again  two days later .  they stopped off a jungle covered coast that was little different from that of costa rica .  as before  hunter compared his internal map with the direction and speed of the ship and confirmed that they were off the coast of panama .   the sun blazed low in the west .  captain morgan gave orders to row supplies and crew members ashore in the longboats .  some buccaneers on every ship eagerly began lowering the boats .  others ran to fetch crates of weapons or kegs of gunpowder and shot .      hunter     said steve  quietly .     what shall we do .         i am radioing mc   again  but he is still not answering .  i am not sure what to do .  rita  what will happen next .         unloading all the ships will take several hours .  then captain morgan will leave a substantial rear guard camped on shore to protect the ships from any unforeseen threat .  he will take the majority of the buccaneers north up the coast  to the mouth of a river .  portobelo is a short distance upstream on the river .         our best move will depend on mc       said hunter .     if he remains on the hungry hawk  then we will have to go there .  if he goes ashore  then we should too .  or maybe he is not with the fleet at all .         the hungry hawk is lowering its longboat     said jane  pointing .     hunter  can you make out any individuals on deck over there .      hunter looked  magnifying his vision .  most of the crew was on deck  and two of the small figures by the rail were familiar .     yes .  i can see both roland and mc   .  they are preparing to go ashore .  we will do so too .         let   s get to work  then     said steve .     i think our best chance to get mc   is coming up .      the team joined the buccaneers who were loading supplies into longboats .  as each longboat was filled  a buccaneer would sit down with each oar and begin rowing away .  by then  longboats from all the anchored ships were heading for land .   hunter and his team eventually took their turn joining buccaneers in the crew of a longboat .  hunter sat in the stern  with rita next to him and steve and jane behind them .  the waves were moderate  and the wind helped carry them as they rowed .   while hunter drew on his oar  he kept an eye on roland and mc   in the distance .  he had not yet seen wayne leave the old laughing lady .  wayne  of course  might remain on board during the entire raid on portobelo .   soon roland and mc   were also rowing toward shore as part of a longboat crew .  hunter saw that they would not arrive for several minutes after his own boat .  other buccaneers had already landed  beaching their boats and unloading them again .   when hunter felt the bottom of the boat scrape the sand  he and the others jumped out into the surf to lighten the load .  the buccaneers in the front took the bowline and pulled  hunter and his team pushed the stern until the longboat ran aground again  this time in the breaking surf .  as the water splashed all around them  they began to unload the crates and kegs .   when the longboat was empty  the crew pulled it completely out of the water and tied it securely to a tree with the others .  most of the buccaneers had broken into the kegs and were taking shares of gunpowder and shot for themselves .  hunter drew his team aside  unnoticed .      rita  i want your opinion about buccaneer values     said hunter .      what do you mean .         suppose that all four of us were to jump on mc    so that i can trigger our immediate return to our own time .  would the buccaneers join the brawl .  if so  i would not be able to return us without the danger of taking some of the buccaneers  too .  i cannot risk that .         i can   t tell     said rita .     they   re just too unpredictable .  no ship captains have come ashore yet  so they aren   t here to give orders .  and they   ve known roland longer than they   ve known any of us .         then we cannot risk rushing mc       said hunter .      hasn   t mc   seen you already .     steve asked .     won   t he just take off into the jungle when he lands .         i do not believe he has that choice     said hunter .     i am certain that roland has once again taken over control of mc   under second law instructions .  since those override the third law imperative for mc   to save himself  he has to obey roland rather than flee from us .         wait a minute     said jane .     what if roland hasn   t told him he can   t run away .         if he runs  i can catch him     said hunter .     it may be best for us if he does .  in that event  you three should follow us as best you can .  i do not expect a problem with your safety if you do not participate in assaulting roland  in any event  i will be very close .  rita  turn on your lapel pin now so that i can hear whatever takes place around you .  i will return if the first law requires it .         all right     said steve .     suppose you chase mc   into the trees and catch him .  then we have to catch up before the others do .         yes .  if we can accomplish this  then i will take all of us back to our time before the buccaneers come within the range of the belt device .         roland just saw us all     said rita  switching on her pin .     he looked over this way .      hunter turned to look .  roland and mc   were now helping push their longboat through the surf to beach it .  they were landing about twenty yards down the shore  on the other end of the growing line of longboats .      we cannot surprise him now     said hunter .     maybe i can distract roland     said rita .     with your permission  hunter .         come on  hunter     said steve .     let   s go confront them .              steve plunged first through the crowd of buccaneers who were preparing their weapons for the attack on portobelo .  a few of them glanced up  but paid no real attention to him as he passed .  he didn   t know exactly what he was going to do  but he had worked with hunter long enough to know that hunter preferred to operate with a fixed plan  and they didn   t have one .  steve didn   t want to miss the chance to get mc   somehow .   steve stopped on the edge of the water just in front of the longboat that was being pulled up .  he stood with his hands on his hips  striking as belligerent a pose as he could .  roland looked up at him .      stay close     roland said to mc   .  he left the longboat  followed by mc    and waded toward steve .  the rest of the crew stopped struggling with the longboat to watch .      steve  what are you doing .     jane whispered  coming up behind him .      i   m not sure .     steve spoke without taking his eyes off roland .     just tell hunter to focus on mc   .         i heard you     hunter said quietly  on steve   s left .     you are not in danger .         you   ll be close  if i am     said steve .     just get mc    will you .  first things first .         and what do you gentlemen want .     roland demanded .  he waded out of the surf and stopped a short distance from steve .  behind him  the rest of the longboat crew remained in the water  watching warily .     something from me  may hap .      steve couldn   t think of anything to say .      roland     said rita  stepping forward .     we   ve been friends .  let   s talk about this .      hunter walked slowly around roland  toward mc    who was still standing in the breaking surf .      this is between us and your friend  there     steve said finally .     we aren   t concerned with you .         i happen to like shorty  here     said roland  with a mocking grin .     he   s quite a friend .  very loyal and uncommonly strong for his size .  funny   he just loves doing whatever i tell him .  now what   s your business with him .      steve watched as hunter suddenly leaped into the surf toward mc   and took hold of his arm .  roland saw the move belatedly and jumped away  toward rita .  before steve could react  roland slipped an arm around her throat and whipped a dagger out of his sash with his other hand .      none of you make a move .     roland backed to one side  so that he could see hunter as well as steve .      stand back  hunter .     steve drew his sword .     the first law says you can   t risk making him mad .      hunter hesitated  studying roland carefully .   in the same moment  however  the other buccaneers from roland   s longboat shouted and ran forward  drawing their swords or daggers .  hunter released mc    but both flung themselves at the buccaneers  they clearly had to save steve and rita from immediate harm  ignoring all other considerations .      roland .     rita struggled to get free .     how can you do this to me .         face me  coward     steve yelled .     stop hiding behind her .     as he had hoped  roland flung rita aside  dropped his dagger  and drew his rapier .  behind roland  hunter and mc   had managed to trip or wrestle the buccaneers into the crashing surf  delaying them all without harming any of them .  they had their hands full  however  steve could not expect any help from them .      hah .  avast  then .     roland sneered angrily  twirling his blade toward steve .   the buccaneers from the other longboats had stopped their preparations to watch  but did not interfere .   fighting down panic  steve raised his own blade .  he blocked a couple of feints from roland  backing up with each stroke .  roland was quick and fluid .      stand and fight  yourself .     roland laughed  feinting and slashing the air playfully .   steve parried and backed up again .  he was nowhere near roland   s equal at fencing .      jane   now .     rita yelled suddenly .  she and jane ran toward roland from behind and simply tackled him .  all three hit the soft ground .   steve leaped forward and snatched away roland   s sword with his free hand .  then  as rita and jane sat on his back  steve placed the point of his sword against roland   s nose .     don   t move .  hunter .  can you get back here .      hunter rose from the water  holding a buccaneer in each hand by the waistbands of their knee breeches .  he tossed them both down onto the rest of the crowd of buccaneers in the water  where they all rolled and tumbled in the breakers .  then he pulled out mc   by one arm .     coming  steve .     he strode out of the surf  pulling mc   after him .      let him up     steve said to rita and jane .  they got up quickly .  roland glared at steve  not moving .  hunter ran up to them with mc   .      into the forest  out of their sight     hunter said on the run  passing them .      get up and back away     steve said to roland  walking backward .     don   t follow us .      roland hesitated  watching hunter  clearly more afraid of hunter than of steve .  the buccaneers who had been thrown into the surf by hunter were stumbling out to collapse on the ground  sputtering and coughing .  they had little fight left in them after being rolled in the breakers repeatedly .   hunter rushed mc   into the dense tropical forest  glancing back over his shoulder to make sure that steve was still in control of the situation .  when rita and jane had run after hunter  steve finally turned and ran too .  the trees and brush were so heavy that  in a few moments  the buccaneers were no longer in sight .      remain with us     jane said to mc    between hard breaths .     make no attempt to interfere with our plans or escape from us .  acknowledge .         acknowledged     said mc   .      we have to hurry     said steve .      jane  steve  rita     said hunter .     please drop anything you have that you acquired in this time .     he untied his sash and let it fall with the cutlass it held .      what about the communicators we lost in the sea .     steve asked  tossing aside the two swords in his hands .     we certainly can   t retrieve them .  are they going to be a problem .         anything can be     said hunter .     however  they are unlikely to cause a problem .  they lie off the coast of jamaica and the salt and water pressure have probably destroyed them already .  if they ever wash ashore  they will be nonfunctional debris .      steve nodded .      i hear the others coming through the brush now     said hunter .     roland has regained his courage .  is everyone ready .      steve gave him a quick nod .  jane and rita had discarded their sashes and daggers .  hunter triggered the device that would return them to their own time .     steve instantly found himself sitting in the same dark  confined sphere from which they had left  huddled against hunter and jane .  they were back in room f     of the bohung institute in mojave center .  hunter opened the unit and helped each of them climb out .   mc   got out and stood motionless next to hunter  waiting for further instructions .   ishihara was still standing in the room .     welcome back  hunter .  you were successful  i see .      yes .  dr .  nystrom is not here .         no .         you were instructed to stop him .         he has not come here during the two minutes since you left     said ishihara .      really .     steve looked at hunter .     maybe he   s timing his return for quite a while later .         he may have guessed i would have someone waiting here now     said hunter .     but this could be a problem .         let   s get mc   safely joined up with mc   in your office     said steve .     then we can worry about wayne nystrom .         good idea     said hunter .      we   ll change out of our period costumes first     said jane .   as before  they changed clothes in turn in the other room .  hunter called for a security detail to drive them to mc governor   s office .  the trip was uneventful .  hunter closed the office door behind them and then turned to mc   .      you know mc   of course     said hunter .      of course .         jane  please give them second law instructions to control them .         you will both do as hunter says     said jane .      acknowledged     said mc   .      stand with mc   .      mc   did so .      well  that   s two of them     said steve .     now what .         i   d like to say something     said rita .      go ahead     said hunter .      i apologize for running off and fouling up everything .  i wanted to see the sights and i didn   t think i would cause any trouble .  but i romanticized my history   as a historian  i should never have done that .  i was so excited about being back in that time and place that i .  .  . forgot myself .  and i fell for roland  i must admit .  but in the end  he reminded me  he was just another cutthroat buccaneer  the product of a nasty  violent life .  i guess my history has really come alive .  books can   t really do that .  i thought they could  but they can   t .     she sighed  then shrugged helplessly .      you still helped     said jane .      that is true     said hunter .     and we were ultimately successful .         you and jane saved me from roland   s sword     said steve .     don   t forget about that .  thanks   to both of you .         well   you   re welcome .     rita smiled awkwardly .     i think my role here is finished  isn   t it .         yes     said hunter .     thank you .  your fee will be paid in full .         now  wait   i   m not sure i deserve it .         i will arrange it     said hunter .     if you and jane had not saved steve  we might all be back there even now .         well   thanks .  goodbye .     rita slipped out  closing the door behind her .      hunter     said jane .     have you accessed the news again  like you did after our first mission .  what happened to the nuclear explosion in jamaica that occurred shortly before we left .         i have been monitoring the news     said hunter .     no mention has been made of any such event .         ha .  we did it .     steve grinned .      we have a new problem  however     hunter said soberly .      what is it .     jane looked at him in alarm .     another one .         in the fifteen minutes since we returned  i have picked up preliminary reports of a nuclear explosion in germany .         oh  no     said jane .      i have the coordinates that were used by all the component robots still at large     said hunter .     however  i feel we should take the german mission next .  explosions at other sites have not occurred yet .         is this one in germany more important .     steve asked skeptically .      all such explosions are very important  of course     said hunter .     however  the trouble may spread very quickly from this one .  it has taken place in western germany  just east of the rhine  in a heavily populated area with advanced industry .  over the past centuries  a great deal of international animosity developed there  much of it leading to war .  right now  a few news analysts are concerned that terrorists may be attempting to disrupt world peace .         and because of the destruction  the first law is pressuring you to handle this one now     said jane .      yes     said hunter .     as before  however  i must search for a historian familiar with the culture we will visit .  in the meantime  i suggest that you two have a good dinner and a good night   s sleep .         good idea     said jane .     back in       it was evening .  that   s why i   m ready for dinner .         me  too     said steve .     but drop the suspense  hunter  and tell us   where do we go next .  and when .         a place called teutoburger forest     said hunter .     in a . d .     during the golden age of the roman empire .
