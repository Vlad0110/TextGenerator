hidden centuries     the closing circle     the beginning of infinity        technician    andrew harlan stepped into the kettle .  its sides were perfectly round and it fit snugly inside a vertical shaft composed of widely spaced rods that shimmered into an unseeable haze six feet above harlan s head .  harlan set the controls and moved the smoothly working starting lever .   the kettle did not move .   harlan did not expect it to .  he expected no movement  neither up nor down  left nor right  forth nor back .  yet the spaces between the rods had melted into a gray blankness which was solid to the touch  though nonetheless immaterial for all that .  and there was the little stir in his stomach  the faint  psychosomatic .   touch of dizziness  that told him that all the kettle contained  including himself  was rushing upwhen through eternity .   he had boarded the kettle in the    th century  the base of operations assigned him two years earlier .  at the time the    th had been the farthest upwhen he had ever traveled .  now he was moving upwhen to the     th century .   under ordinary circumstances he might have felt a little lost at the prospect .  his native century was in the far downwhen  the   th century  to be exact .  the   th was a century stiffly restrictive of atomic power  faintly rustic  fond of natural wood as a structural material  exporters of certain types of distilled potables to nearly everywhen and importers of clover seed .  although harlan had not been in the   th since he entered special training and became a cub at the age of fifteen  there was always that feeling of loss when one moved outwhen from  home .   at the     th he would be nearly two hundred forty millennia from his birthwhen and that is a sizable distance even for a hardened eternal .   under ordinary circumstances all this would be so .   but right now harlan was in poor mood to think of anything but the fact that his documents were heavy in his pocket and his plan heavy on his heart .  he was a little frightened  a little tense  a little confused .   it was his hands acting by themselves that brought the kettle to the proper halt at the proper century .   strange that a technician should feel tense or nervous about anything .  what was it that educator yarrow had once said    above all  a technician must be dispassionate .  the reality change he initiates may affect the lives of as many as fifty billion people .  a million or more of these may be so drastically affected as to be considered new individuals .  under these conditions  an emotional make up is a distinct handicap .    harlan put the memory of his teacher s dry voice out of his mind with an almost savage shake of his head .  in those days he had never imagined that he himself would have the peculiar talent for that very position .  but emotion had come upon him after all .  not for fifty billion people .  what in time did he care for fifty billion people .  there was just one .  one person .   he became aware that the kettle was stationary and with the merest pause to pull his thoughts together  put himself into the cold  impersonal frame of mind a technician must have  he stepped out .  the kettle he left  of course  was not the same as the one he had boarded  in the sense that it was not composed of the same atoms .  he did not worry about that any more than any eternal would .  to concern oneself with the  mystique  of time travel  rather than with the simple fact of it  was the mark of the cub and newcomer to eternity .   he paused again at the infinitely thin curtain of non space and nontime which separated him from eternity in one way and from ordinary time in another .   this would be a completely new section of eternity for him .  he knew about it in a rough way  of course  having checked upon it in the  temporal handbook  .  still  there was no substitute for actual appearance and he steeled himself for the initial shock of adjustment .   he adjusted the controls  a simple matter in passing into eternity  and a very complicated one in passing into time  a type of passage which was correspondingly less frequent  .  he stepped through the curtain and found himself squinting at the brilliance .  automatically he threw up his hand to shield his eyes .   only one man faced him .  at first harlan could see him only blurrily .   the man said   i am sociologist kantor voy .  i imagine you are technician harlan .    harlan nodded and said   father time .  isn t this sort of ornamentation adjustable .    voy looked about and said tolerantly   you mean the molecular films .     i certainly do   said harlan .  the  handbook  had mentioned them  but had said nothing of  such  an insane riot of light reflection .   harlan felt his annoyance to be quite reasonable .  the     th century was matter oriented  as most centuries were  so he had a right to expect a basic compatibility from the very beginning .  it would have none of the utter confusion  for anyone born matter oriented  of the energy vortices of the     s  or the field dynamics of the     s .  in the     th  to the average eternal s comfort  matter was used for everything from walls to tacks .   to be sure  there was matter and matter .  a member of an energyoriented century might not realize that .  to him all matter might seem minor variations on a theme that was gross  heavy  and barbaric .  to matter oriented harlan  however  there was wood  metal  subdivisions  heavy and light   plastic  silicates  concrete  leather  and so on .   but matter consisting entirely of mirrors .   that was his first impression of the     th .  every surface reflected and glinted light .  everywhere was the illusion of complete smoothness  the effect of a molecular film .  and in the ever repeated reflection of himself  of sociologist voy  of everything he could see  in scraps and wholes  in all angles  there was confusion .  garish confusion and nausea .    i m sorry   said voy   it s the custom of the century  and the section assigned to it finds it good practice to adopt the customs where practical .  you get used to it after a time .    voy walked rapidly upon the moving feet of another voy  upside down beneath the floor  who matched him stride for stride .  he reached to move a hair contact indicator down a spiral scale to point of origin .   the reflections died  extraneous light faded .  harlan felt his world settle .    if you ll come with me now   said voy .   harlan followed through empty corridors that  harlan knew  must moments ago have been a riot of made light and reflection  up a ramp  through an anteroom  into an office .   in all the short journey no human being had been visible .  harlan was so used to that  took it so for granted  that he would have been surprised  almost shocked  if a glimpse of a human figure hurrying away had caught his eyes .  no doubt the news had spread that a technician was coming through .  even voy kept his distance and when  accidentally  harlan s hand had brushed voy s sleeve  voy shrank away with a visible start .   harlan was faintly surprised at the touch of bitterness he felt at all this .  he had thought the shell he had grown about his soul was thicker  more efficiently insensitive than that .  if he was wrong  if his shell had worn thinner  there could only be one reason for that .   noys .       sociologist kantor voy leaned forward toward the technician in what seemed a friendly enough fashion  but harlan noted automatically that they were seated on opposite sides of the long axis of a fairly large table .   voy said   i am pleased to have a technician of your reputation interest himself in our little problem here .     yes   said harlan with the cold impersonality people would expect of him .   it has its points of interest .    was he impersonal enough .  surely his real motives must be apparent  his guilt be spelled out in beads of sweat on his forehead .    he removed from an inner pocket the foiled summary of the projected reality change .  it was the very copy which had been sent to the allwhen council a month earlier .  through his relationship with senior computer twissell   the  twissell  himself  harlan had had little trouble in getting his hands on it .   before unrolling the foil  letting it peel off onto the table top where it would be held by a soft paramagnetic field  harlan paused a split moment .   the molecular film that covered the table was subdued but was not zero .  the motion of his arm fixed his eye and for an instant the reflection of his own face seemed to stare somberly up at him from the table top .  he was thirty two  but he looked older .  he needed no one to tell him that .  it might be partly his long face and dark eyebrows over darker eyes that gave him the lowering expression and cold glare associated with the caricature of the technician in the minds of all eternals .  it might be just his own realization that he was a technician .   but then he flicked the foil out across the table and turned to the matter at hand .    i am not a sociologist  sir .    voy smiled .   that sounds formidable .  when one begins by expressing lack of competence in a given field  it usually implies that a flat opinion in that field will follow almost immediately .     no   said harlan   not an opinion .  just a request .  i wonder if you won t look over this summary and see if you haven t made a small mistake somewhere here .    voy looked instantly grave .   i hope not   he said .   harlan kept one arm across the back of his chair  the other in his lap .  he must let neither hand drum restless fingers .  he must not bite his lips .  he must not show his feelings in any way .   ever since the whole orientation of his life had so changed itself  he had been watching the summaries of projected reality changes as they passed through the grinding administrative gears of the allwhen council .  as senior computer twissell s personally assigned technician  he could arrange that by a slight bending of professional ethics .  particularly with twissell s attention caught ever more tightly in his own overwhelming project .   harlan s nostrils flared .  he knew now a little of the nature of that project .    harlan had had no assurance that he would ever find what he was looking for in a reasonable time .  when he had first glanced over projected reality change             serial number v    he was half inclined to believe his reasoning powers were warped by wishing .  for a full day he had checked and rechecked equations and relationships in a rattling uncertainty  mixed with growing excitement and a bitter gratitude that he had been taught at least elementary psycho mathematics .   now voy went over those same puncture patterns with a half puzzled  half worried eye .   he said   it seems to me  i say  it  seems  to me that this is all perfectly in order .    harlan said   i refer you particularly to the matter of the courtship characteristics of the society of the current reality of this century .  that s sociology and your responsibility  i believe .  it s why i arranged to see you when i arrived  rather than someone else .    voy was now frowning .  he was still polite  but with an icy touch now .  he said   the observers assigned to our section are highly competent .  i have every certainty that those assigned to this project have given accurate data .  have you evidence to the contrary .     not at all  sociologist voy .  i accept their data .  it is the development of the data i question .  do you not have an alternate tensorcomplex at this point  if the courtship data is taken properly into consideration .    voy stared  and then a look of relief washed over him visibly .   of course  technician  of course  but it resolves itself into an identity .  there is a loop of small dimensions with no tributaries on either side .  i hope you ll forgive me for using picturesque language rather than precise mathematical expressions .     i appreciate it   said harlan dryly .   i am no more a computer than a sociologist .     very good  then .  the alternate tensor complex you refer to  or the forking of the road  as we might say  is non significant .  the forks join up again and it is a single road .  there was not even any need to mention it in our recommendations .     if you say so  sir  i will defer to your better judgment .  however  there is still the matter of the m . n . c .    the sociologist winced at the initials as harlan knew he would .  m . n . c .   minitnum necessary change .  there the technician was master .  a sociologist might consider himself above criticism by lesser beings in anything involving the mathematical analysis of the infinite possible realities in time  but in matters of m . n . c .  the technician stood supreme .   mechanical computing would not do .  the largest computaplex ever built  manned by the cleverest and most experienced senior computer ever born  could do no better than to indicate the ranges in which the m . n . c .  might be found .  it was then the technician  glancing over the data  who decided on an exact point within that range .  a good technician was rarely wrong .  a top technician was never wrong .   harlan was never wrong .    now the m . n . c .  recommended   said harlan  he spoke coolly  evenly  pronouncing the standard intertemporal language in precise syllables    by your section involves induction of an accident in space and the immediate death by fairly horrible means of a dozen or more men .     unavoidable   said voy  shrugging .    on the other hand   said harlan   i suggest that the m . n . c .  can be reduced to the mere displacement of a container from one shelf to another .  here .   his long finger pointed .  his white  well cared for index nail made the faintest mark along one set of perforations .   voy considered matters with a painful but silent intensity .   harlan said   doesn t that alter the situation with regard to your unconsidered fork .  doesn t it take advantage of the fork of lesser probability  changing it to near certainty  and does that not then lead to          to virtually the m . d . r .   whispered voy .    to  exactly  the maximum desired response   said harlan .   voy looked up  his dark face struggling somewhere between chagrin and anger .  harlan noted absently that there was a space between the man s large upper incisors which gave him a rabbity look quite at odds with the restrained force of his words .   voy said   i suppose i will be hearing from the allwhen council .     i don t think so .  as far as i know  the allwhen council does not know of this .  at least  the projected reality change was passed over to me without comment .   he did not explain the word  passed   nor did voy question it .    you discovered this error  then .     yes .     and you did not report it to the allwhen council .     no  i did not .    relief first  then a hardening of countenance .   why not .     very few people could have avoided this error .  i felt i could correct it before damage was done .  i have done so .  why go any further .     well  thank you  technician harlan .  you have been a friend .  the section s error which  as you say  was practically unavoidable  would have looked unjustifiably bad in the record .    he went on after a moment s pause .   of course  in view of the alterations in personality to be induced by this reality change  the death of a few men as preliminary is of little importance .    harlan thought  detachedly  he doesn t sound really grateful .  he probably resents it .  if he stops to think  he ll resent it even more  this being saved a downstroke in rating by a technician .  if i were a sociologist  he would shake my hand  but he won t shake the hand of a technician .  he defends condemning a dozen people to asphyxiation  but he won t touch a technician .   and because waiting to let resentment grow would be fatal  harlan said without waiting   i hope your gratitude will extend to having your section perform a slight chore for me .     a chore .     a matter of life plotting .  i have the data necessary here with me .  i have also the data for a suggested reality change in the    nd .  i want to know the effect of the change on the probability pattern of a certain individual .     i am not quite sure   said the sociologist slowly   that i understand you .  surely you have the facilities for doing this in your own section .     i have .  nevertheless  what i am engaged in is a personal research which i don t wish to appear in the records just yet .  it would be difficult to have this carried out in my own section without      he gestured an uncertain conclusion to the unfinished sentence .   voy said   then you want this done  not  through official channels .     i want it done confidentially .  i want a confidential answer .     well  now  that s very irregular .  i can t agree to it .    harlan frowned .   no more irregular than my failure to report your error to the allwhen council .  you raised no objection to that .  if we re going to be strictly regular in one case  we must be as strict and as regular in the other .  you follow me  i think .    the look on voy s face was proof positive of that .  he held out his hand .   may i see the documents .    harlan relaxed a bit .  the main hurdle had been passed .  he watched eagerly as the sociologist s head bent over the foils he had brought .   only once did the sociologist speak .   by time  this is a small reality change .    harlan seized his opportunity and improvised .   it is .  too small  i think .  it s what the argument is about .  it s below critical difference  and i ve picked an individual as a test case .  naturally  it would be undiplomatic to use our own section s facilities until i was certain of being right .    voy was unresponsive and harlan stopped .  no use running this past the point of safety .   voy stood up .   i ll pass this along to one of my life plotters .  we ll keep this private .  you understand  though  that this is not to be taken as establishing a precedent .     of course not .     and if you don t mind  i d like to watch the reality change take place .  i trust you will honor us by conducting the m . n . c .  personally .    harlan nodded .   i will take full responsibility .        two of the screens in the viewing chamber were in operation when they entered .  the engineers had focused them already to the exact co ordinates in space and time and then had left .  harlan and voy were alone in the glittering room .   the molecular film arrangement was perceptible and even a bit more than perceptible  but harlan was looking at the screens .    both views were motionless .  they might have been scenes of the dead  since they pictured mathematical instants of time .   one view was in sharp  natural color  the engine room of what harlan knew to be an experimental space ship .  a door was closing  and a glistening shoe of a red  semi transparent material was just visible through the space that remained .  it did not move .  nothing moved .  if the picture could have been made sharp enough to picture the dust motes in the air   they  would not have moved .   voy said   for two hours and thirty six minutes after the viewed instant  that engine room will remain empty .  in the current reality  that is .     i know   murmured harlan .  he was putting on his gloves and already his quick eyes were memorizing the position of the critical container on its shelf  measuring the steps to it  estimating the best position into which to transfer it .  he cast one quick look at the other screen .   if the engine room  being in the range described as  present  with respect to that section of eternity in which they now stood  was clear and in natural color  the other scene  being some twenty five centuries in the  future   carried the blue luster all views of the  future  must .   it was a space port .  a deep blue sky  blue tinged buildings of naked metal on blue green ground .  a blue cylinder of odd design  bulgebottomed  stood in the foreground .  two others like it were in the background .  all three pointed cleft noses upward  the cleavage biting deeply into the vitals of the ship .   harlan frowned .   they re queer ones .     electro gravitic   said voy .   the     st is the only century to develop electro gravitic space travel .  no propellants  no nucleonics .  it s an aesthetically pleasing device .  it s a pity we must change away from it .  a pity .   his eyes fixed themselves on harlan with distinct disapproval .   harlan s lips compressed .  disapproval of course .  why not .  he was the technician .   to be sure  it had been some observer who had brought in the details of drug addiction .  it had been some statistician who had demonstrated that recent changes had increased the addiction rate until now it was the highest in all the current reality of man .  some sociologist  probably voy himself  had interpreted that into the psychiatric profile of a society .  finally  some computer had worked out the reality change necessary to decrease addiction to a safe level and found that  as a side effect  electro gravitic space travel must suffer .  a dozen  a hundred men of every rating in eternity had had a hand in this .   but then  at the end  a technician such as himself must step in .  following the directions all the others had combined to give him  he must be the one to initiate the actual reality change .  and then all the others would stare in haughty accusation at him .  their stares would say   you   not we  have destroyed this beautiful thing .   and for that  they would condemn and avoid him .  they would shift their own guilt to his shoulders and scorn him .   harlan said harshly   ships aren t what count .  we re concerned with those things .    the  things  were people  dwarfed by the space ship  as earth and earth s society is always dwarfed by the physical dimensions of spaceflight .   they were little puppets in clusters  these people .  their tiny arms and legs were in raised  artificial looking positions  caught in the frozen instant of time .   voy shrugged .   harlan was adjusting the small field generator about his left wrist .   let s get this job done .     one minute .  i want to get in touch with the life plotter and find out how long his job for you will take .  i want to get that job done  too .    his hands worked cleverly at a little movable contact and his ear listened astutely to the pattern of clicks that came back .   another characteristic of this section of eternity  thought harlan  sound codes in clicks .  clever  but affected  like the molecular films .     he says it won t take more than three hours   said voy at length .   also  by the way  he admires the name of the person involved .  noys lambent .  it is a female  isn t it .    there was a dryness in harlan s throat .   yes .    voy s lips curled into a slow smile .   sounds interesting .  i d like to meet her  sight unseen .  haven t had any women in this section for months .    harlan didn t trust himself to answer .  he stared a moment at the sociologist and turned abruptly .   if there was a flaw in eternity  it involved women .  he had known the flaw for what it was from almost his first entrance into eternity  but he felt it personally only that day he had first met noys .  from that moment it had been an easy path to this one  in which he stood false to his oath as an eternal and to everything in which he had believed .   for what .   for noys .   and he was not ashamed .  it was that which really rocked him .  he was not ashamed .  he felt no guilt for the crescendo of crimes he had committed  to which this latest addition of the unethical use of confidential life plotting could rank only as a peccadillo .   he would do worse than his worst if he had to .   for the first time the specific and express thought came to him .  and though he pushed it away in horror  he knew that  having once come  it would return .   the thought was simply this  that he would ruin eternity  if he had to .   the worst of it was that he knew he had the power to do it .         observer    harlan stood at the gateway to time and thought of himself in new ways .  it had been very simple once .  there were such things as ideals  or at least catchwords  to live by and for .  every stage of an eternal s life had a reason .  how did  basic principles  start .    the life of an eternal may be divided into four parts  .   .   .    it all worked out neatly  yet it had all changed for him  and what was broken could not be made whole again .   yet he had gone faithfully through each of the four parts of an eternal s life .  first  there was the period of fifteen years in which he was not an eternal at all  but only an inhabitant of time .  only a human being out of time  a timer  could become an eternal  no one could be born into the position .   at the age of fifteen he was chosen by a careful process of elimination and winnowing  the nature of which he had no conception . of at the time .  he was taken beyond the veil of eternity after a last agonized farewell to his family .   even then it was made clear to him that whatever else happened he would never return .  the true reason for that he was not to learn till long afterward .    once within eternity  he spent ten years in school as a cub  and then graduated to enter his third period as observer .  it was only after that that he became a specialist and a true eternal .  the fourth and last part of the eternal s life  timer  cub  observer and specialist .   he  harlan  had gone through it all so neatly .  he might say  successfully .   he could remember  so clearly  the moment that cubhood was done  the moment they became independent members of eternity  the moment when  even though un specialized  they still rated the legal title of  eternal .    he could remember it .  school done  cubhood over  he was standing with the five who completed training with him  hands clasped in the small of his back  legs a trifle apart  eyes front  listening .   educator yarrow was at a desk talking to them .  harlan could remember yarrow well  a small  intense man  with ruddy hair in disarray  freckled forearms  and a look of loss in his eyes .   it wasn t uncommon  this look of loss in the eyes of an eternal  the loss of home and roots  the unadmitted and unadmittable longing for the one century he could never see .    harlan could not remember yarrow s exact words  of course  but the substance of it remained sharp .   yarrow said  in substance   you will be observers now .  it isn t a highly regarded position .  specialists look upon it as a boy s job .  maybe you eternals   he deliberately paused after that word to give each man a chance to straighten his back and brighten at the glory of it   think so too .  if so  you are fools who don t deserve to be observers .    the computers would have no computing to do  life plotters no lives to plot  sociologists no societies to profile  none of the specialists would have anything to do  if it weren t for the observer .  i know you ve heard this said before  but i want you to be very firm and clear in your mind about it .    it will be you youngsters who will go out into time  under the most strenuous conditions  to bring back facts .  cold  objective facts uncolored by your own opinions and likings  you understand .  facts accurate enough to be fed into computing machines .  facts definite enough to make the social equations stand up .  facts honest enough to form a basis for reality changes .    and remember this  too .  your period as observer is not something to get through with as quickly and as unobtrusively as possible .  it is as an observer that you will make your mark .  not what you did in school  but what you will do as an observer will determine your specialty and how high you will rise in it .  this will be your post graduate course  eternals  and failure in it  even small failure  will put you into maintenance no matter how brilliant your potentialities now seem .  that is all .    he shook hands with each of them  and harlan  grave  dedicated  proud in his belief that the privileges of being an eternal contained its greatest privilege in the assumption of responsibility for the happiness of all the human beings who were or ever would be within the reach of eternity  was deep in self awe .   harlan s first assignments were small and under close direction  but he sharpened his ability on the honing strap of experience in a dozen centuries through a dozen reality changes .   in his fifth year as observer he was given a senior s rating in the field and assigned to the    nd .  for the first time he would be working unsupervised  and knowledge of that fact robbed him of some of his self assurance when he first reported to the computer in charge of the section .   that was assistant computer hobbe finge  whose pursed  suspicious mouth and frowning eyes seemed ludicrous in such a face as his .  he had a round button of a nose  two larger buttons of cheeks .  he needed only a touch of red and a fringe of white hair to be converted into the picture of the primitive myth of st .  nicholas .      or santa claus or kriss kringle .  harlan knew all three names .  he doubted if one eternal out of a hundred thousand had heard of any one of them .  harlan took a secret  shamefaced pride in this sort of arcane knowledge .  from his earliest days in school he had ridden the hobbyhorse of primitive history  and educator yarrow had encouraged it .  harlan had grown actually fond of those odd  perverted centuries that lay  not only before the beginning of eternity in the   th  but even before the invention of the temporal field  itself  in the   th .  he had used old books and periodicals in his studies .  he had even traveled far downwhen to the earliest centuries of eternity  when he could get permission  to consult better sources .  for over fifteen years he had managed to collect a remarkable library of his own  almost all in print on paper .  there was a volume by a man called h .  g .  wells  another by a man named w .  shakespeare  some tattered histories .  best of all there was a complete set of bound volumes of a primitive news weekly that took up inordinate space but that he could not  out of sentiment  bear to reduce to micro film .   occasionally he would lose himself in a world where life was life and death  death  where a man made his decisions irrevocably  where evil could not be prevented  nor good promoted  and the battle of waterloo  having been lost  was really lost for good and all .  there was even a scrap of poetry he treasured which stated that a moving finger having once written could never be lured back to unwrite .   and then it was difficult  almost a shock  to return his thoughts to eternity  and to a universe where reality was something flexible and evanescent  something men such as himself could hold in the palms of their hands and shake into better shape .    the illusion of st .  nicholas shattered when hobbe finge spoke to him in a brisk  matter of fact way .   you can start in tomorrow with a routine screening of current .  reality .  i want it good  thorough  and to the point .  there will be xio slackness permitted .  your first spatio temporal chart will be ready for you tomorrow morning .  got it .     yes  computer   said harlan .  he decided as early as that that he and assistant computer hobbe finge would not get along  and he regretted it .   the next morning harlan got his chart in intricately punched patterns as they emerged from the computaplex .  he used a pocket decoder to translate them into standard intertemporal in his anxiety to make not even the smallest mistake at the very beginning .  of course  he had reached the stage where he could read the perforations direct .   the chart told him where and when in the world of the    nd century he might go and where he might not  what he could do and what be could not  what he must avoid at all costs .  his presence must impinge only upon those places and times where it would not endanger reality .   the    nd was not a comfortable century for him .  it was not like his own austere and conformist homewhen .  it was an era without ethics or principles  as he was accustomed to think of such .  it was hedonistic  materialistic  more than a little matriarchal .  it was the only era  he checked this in the records in the most painstaking way  in which ectogenic birth flourished and  at its peak     per cent of its women gave eventual birth by merely contributing a fertilized ovum to the ovaria .  marriage was made and unmade by mutual consent and was not recognized legally as anything more than a personal agreement without binding force .  union for the sake of childbearing was  of course  carefully differentiated from the social functions of marriage and was arranged on purely eugenic principles .   in a hundred ways harlan thought the society sick and therefore hungered for a reality change .  more than once it occurred to him that his own presence in the century  as a man not of that time  could fork its history .  if his disturbing presence could only be made disturbing enough at some key point  a different branch of possibility would become real  a branch in which millions of pleasure seeking women would find themselves transformed into true  pure hearted mothers .  they would be in another reality with all the memories that belonged with it  unable to tell  dream  or fancy that they had ever been anything else .   unfortunately  to do that  he would have to step outside the bounds of the spatio temporal chart and that was unthinkable .  even if it weren t  to step outside the bounds at random could change reality in many possible ways .  it could be made worse .  only careful analysis and computing could properly pin point the nature of a reality change .   outwardly  whatever his private opinions  harlan remained an observer  and the ideal observer was merely a set of sense perceptive nerve patches attached to a report writing mechanism .  between perception and report there must be no intervention of emotion .   harlan s reports were perfection itself in that respect .   assistant computer finge called him in after his second weekly report .    i congratulate you  observer   he said in a voice without warmth   on the organization and clarity of your reports .  but what do you really think .    harlan sought refuge in an expression as blank as though chipped painstakingly out of native   th century wood .  he said   i have no thoughts of my own in the matter .     oh  come .  you re from the   th and we both know what that means .  surely this century disturbs you .    harlan shrugged .   does anything in my reports lead you to think that i am disturbed .    it was near to impudence and the drumming of finge s blunt nails upon his desk showed it .  finge said   answer my question .    harlan said   sociologically  many facets of the century represent an extreme .  the last three reality changes in the aboutwhen have accentuated that .  eventually  i suppose the matter should be rectified .  extremes are never healthy .     then you took the trouble to check the past realities of the century .     as an observer  i must check all pertinent facts .    it was a standoff .  harlan  of course  did have the right and the duty to check those facts .  finge must know that .  every century was continually being shaken by reality changes .  no observations  however painstaking  could ever stand for long without rechecking .  it was standard procedure in eternity to have every century in a chronic state of being observed .  and to observe properly  you must be able to present  not only the facts of the current reality  but also of their relationship to those of previous realities .   yet it seemed obvious to harlan that this was not merely unpleasantness on finge s part  this probing of the observer s opinions .  finge seemed definitely hostile .   at another time finge said to harlan  having invaded the latter s small office to bring the news    your reports are creating a very favorable impression with the allwhen council .    harlan paused  uncertain  then mumbled   thank you .     all agree that you show an uncommon degree of penetration .     i do my best .    finge asked suddenly   have you ever met senior computer twissell .     computer twissell .   harlan s eyes widened .   no  sir .  why do you ask .     he seems particularly interested in your reports .   finge s round cheeks drew downward sulkily and he changed the subject .   to me it seems that you have worked out a philosophy of your own  a viewpoint of history .    temptation tugged hard at harlan .  vanity and caution battled and the former won .   i ve studied primitive history  sir .      primitive  history .  at school .     not exactly  computer .  on my own .  it s my  hobby .  it s like watching history standing still  frozen .  it can be studied in detail whereas the centuries of eternity are always changing .   he warmed up a trifle at the thought of it .   it s as though we were to take a series of stills from a book film and study each painstakingly .  we would see a great deal we would miss if we just scanned the film as it went past .  i think that helps me a great deal with my work .    finge stared at him in amazement  widened his eyes a little  and left with no further remark .   occasionally  thereafter  he brought up the subject of primitive history and accepted harlan s reluctant comments with no decisive expression on his own plump face .   harlan was not sure whether to regret the whole matter or to regard it as a possible way of speeding his own advancement .   he decided on the first alternative when  passing him one day in corridor a  finge said abruptly and in the hearing of others   great time  harlan  don t you  ever  smile .    the thought came  shockingly  to harlan that finge hated him .  his own feeling for finge approached something like detestation thereafter .       three months of raking through the    nd had exhausted most of its worth while meat and when harlan received a sudden call to finge s office  he was not surprised .  he was expecting a change in assignment .  his final summary had been prepared days before .  the    nd was anxious to export more cellulose base textiles to centuries which were deforested  such as the     th  but were unwilling to accept smoked fish in return .  a long list of such items was contained in due order and with due analysis .   he took the draft of the summary with him .   but no mention of the    nd was made .  instead finge introduced him to a withered and wrinkled little man  with sparse white hair and a gnomelike face that throughout the interview was stamped with a perpetual smile .  it varied between extremes of anxiety and joviality but never quite disappeared .  between two of his yellow stained fingers lay a burning cigarette .   it was the first cigarette harlan had ever seen  otherwise he would have paid more attention to the man  less to the smoking cylinder  and been better prepared for finge s introduction .   finge said   senior computer twissell  this is observer andrew harlan .    harlan s eyes shifted in shock from the little man s cigarette to his face .   senior computer twissell said in a high pitched voice   how do you do .  so this is the young man who writes those excellent reports .    harlan found no voice .  laban twissell was a legend  a living myth .  laban twissell was a man he should have recognized at once .  he was the outstanding computer in eternity  which was another way of saying he was the most eminent eternal alive .  he was the dean of the allwhen council .  he had directed more reality changes than any man in the history of eternity .  he was     he had      harlan s mind failed him altogether .  he nodded his head with a doltish grin and said nothing .   twissell put his cigarette to his lips  puffed quickly  and took it away .   leave us  finge .  i want to talk to the boy .    finge rose  murmured something  and left .   twissell said   you seem nervous  boy .  there is nothing to be nervous about .    but meeting twissell like that was a shock .  it is always disconcerting to find that someone you have thought of as a giant is actually less than five and a half feet tall .  could the brain of a genius actually fit behind the retreating  bald smooth forehead .  was it sharp intelligence or only good humor that beamed out of the little eyes that screwed up into a thousand wrinkles .   harlan didn t know what to think .  the cigarette seemed to obscure what small scrabble of intelligence he could collect .  he flinched visibly as a puff of smoke reached him .   twissell s eyes narrowed as though he were trying to peer through the smoke haze and he said in horribly accented tenth millennial dialect   will you petter feel if i in your yourself dialect should speech  poy .    harlan  brought to the sudden brink of hysterical laughter  said carefully   i speak standard intertemporal quite well  sir .   he said it in the intertemporal he and all other eternals in his presence had used ever since his first months in eternity .    nonsense   said twissell imperiously .   i do not bother of intertemporal .  my speech of ten millennial is over than perfect .    harlan guessed that it had been some forty years since twissell had had to make use of localwhen dialects .   but having made his point to his own satisfaction  apparently  he shifted to intertemporal and remained there .  he said   i would offer you a cigarette  but i am certain you don t smoke .  smoking is approved of hardly anywhen in history .  in fact  good cigarettes are made only in the   nd and mine have to be specially imported from there .  i give you that hint in case you ever become a smoker .  it is all very sad .  last week  i was stuck in the    rd for two days .  no smoking .  i mean  even in the section of eternity devoted to the    rd .  the eternals there have picked up the  mores  .  if i had lit a cigarette it would have been like the sky collapsing .  sometimes i think i should like to calculate one great reality change and wipe out all the no smoking taboos in all the centuries  except that any reality change like that would make for wars in the   th or a slave society in the     th .  always something .    harlan was first confused  then anxious .  surely these rattling irrelevancies must be hiding something .   his throat felt a little constricted .  he said   may i ask why you ve arranged to see me  sir .     i like your reports  boy .    there was a veiled glimmer of joy in harlan s eyes  but he did not smile .   thank you  sir .     it has a touch of the artist .  you are intuitive .  you feel strongly .  i think i know your proper position in eternity and i have come to offer it to you .    harlan thought  i can t believe this .   he held all triumph out of his voice .   you do me great honor  sir   he said .   whereupon senior computer twissell  having come to the end of his cigarette  produced another in his left hand by some unnoted feat of legerdemain and lit it .  he said between puffs   for time s sake  boy  you talk as though you rehearsed lines .  great honor  bah .  piffle .  trash .  say what you feel in plain language .  you re glad  hey .     yes  sir   said harlan cautiously .    all right .  you should be .  how would you like to be a technician .     a technician .   cried harlan  leaping from his seat .    sit down .  sit down .  you seem surprised .     i hadn t expected to be a technician  computer twissell .     no   said twissell dryly   somehow no one ever does .  they expect anything but that .  yet technicians are hard to find  and are always in demand .  not a section in eternity has what it considers enough .     i don t think i m suited .     you mean you re not suited to take a job with trouble in it .  by time  if you are devoted to eternity  as i believe you are  you won t mind that .  so the fools will avoid you and you will feel ostracized .  you will grow used to that .  and you will have the satisfaction of knowing you are needed  and needed badly .  by  me  .     by you  sir .  by you particularly .     yes .   an element of shrewdness entered the old man s smile .   you are not to be just a technician .  you will be my personal technician .  you will have special status .  how does that sound now .    harlan said   i don t know  sir .  i may not qualify .    twissell shook his head firmly .   i need you .  i need just you .  your reports assure me you have what i need up here .   he tapped his forehead quickly with a ridge nailed forefinger .   your record as cub is good  the sections for which you have observed reported favorably .  finally  finge s report was most suitable of all .    harlan was honestly startled .   computer finge s report was favorable .     you didn t expect that .     i  don t know .     well  boy  i didn t say it was favorable .  i said it was suitable .  as a matter of fact  finge s report was  not  favorable .  he recommended that you be removed from all duties connected with reality changes .  he suggested it wasn t safe to keep you anywhere but in maintenance .    harlan reddened .   what were his reasons for saying so  sir .     it seems you have a hobby  boy .  you are interested in primitive history  eh .   he gestured expansively with his cigarette and harlan  forgetting in his anger to control his breathing  inhaled a cloud of smoke and coughed helplessly .   twissell regarded the young observer s coughing spell benignly and said   isn t that so .    harlan began   computer finge had no right      now  now .  i told you what was in the report because it hinges on the purpose i need you most for .  actually  the report was confidential and you are to forget i told you what was in it .  permanently  boy .     but what s wrong with being interested in primitive history .     finge thinks your interest in it shows a strong wish to time .  you understand me  boy .    harlan did .  it was impossible to avoid picking up psychiatric lingo .  that phrase above all .  every member of eternity was supposed to have a strong drive  the stronger for being officially suppressed in all its manifestations  to return  not necessarily to his own time  but at least to some one definite time  to become part of a century  rather than to remain a wanderer through them all .  of course in most eternals the drive remained safely hidden in the unconscious .    i don t think that s the case   said harlan .    nor i .  in fact  i think your hobby is interesting and valuable .  as i said  it s why i want you .  i want you to teach a cub i shall bring to you all you know and all you can learn about primitive history .  in between  you will also be my personal technician .  you ll start in a few days .  is that agreeable .    agreeable .  to have official permission to learn all he could about the days before eternity .  to be personally associated with the greatest eternal of them all .  even the nasty fact of technician s status seemed bearable under those conditions .   his caution  however  did not entirely fail him .  he said   if it s necessary for the good of eternity  sir        for the  good  of eternity .   cried the gnomish computer in sudden excitement .  he threw his cigarette butt from him with such energy that it hit the far wall and bounced off in a shower of sparks .   i need you for the  existence  of eternity .          cub    harlan had been in the    th for weeks before he met brinsley sheridan cooper .  he had time to grow used to his new quarters and to the antisepsis of glass and porcelain .  he learned to wear the technician s mark with only moderate shrinking and to refrain from making things worse by standing so that the insigne was hidden against a wall or was covered by the interposition of some object he was carrying .   others smiled disdainfully when that was done and turned colder as though they suspected an attempt to invade their friendship on false pretenses .   senior computer twissell brought him problems daily .  harlan studied them and wrote his analyses in drafts that were four times rewritten  the last version being handed in reluctantly even so .   twissell would appraise them and nod and say   good  good .   then his old blue eyes would dart quickly at harlan and his smile would narrow a bit as he said   i ll test this guess on the computaplex .    he always called the analysis a  guess .   he never told harlan the result of the computaplex check  and harlan dared not ask .  he was despondent over the fact that he was never asked to put any of his own analyses into action .  did that mean that the computaplex was not checking him  that he had been choosing the wrong item for the induction of a reality change  that he did not have the knack of seeing the minimum necessary change in an indicated range .   it was not until later that he grew sufficiently sophisticated to have the phrase come rolling off his tongue as m . n . c .        one day twissell came in with an abashed individual who seemed scarcely to dare raise his eyes to meet harlan s .   twissell said   technician harlan  this is cub b .  s .  cooper .    automatically harlan said   hello   weighed the man s appearance  and was unimpressed .  the fellow was on the shortish side  with dark hair parted in the middle .  his chin was narrow  his eyes an indefinite light brown  his ears a little large  and his fingernails bitten .   twissell said   this is the boy to whom you will be teaching primitive history .     great time   said harlan with suddenly increased interest .    hello .    he had almost forgotten .   twissell said   arrange a schedule with him that will suit you  harlan .  if you can manage two afternoons a week  i think that would be fine .  use your own method of teaching him .  i ll leave that to you .  if you should need book films or old documents  tell me  and if they exist in eternity or in any part of time that can be reached  we ll get them .  eh  boy .    he plucked a lit cigarette out of nowhere  as it always seemed  and the air reeked with smoke .  harlan coughed and from the twisting of the cub s mouth it was quite obvious that the latter would have done the same had he dared .   after twissell left  harlan said   well  sit down   he hesitated a moment  then added determinedly   son .  sit down  son .  my office isn t much  but it s yours whenever we re together .    harlan was almost flooded with eagerness .  this project was  his .   primitive history was something that was all his own .   the cub raised his eyes  for the first time  really  and said stumblingly   you  are  a technician .    a considerable part of harlan s excitement and warmth died .   what of it .     nothing   said the cub .   i just        you heard computer twissell address me as technician  didn t you .     yes  sir .     did you think it was a slip of the tongue .  something too bad to be true .      no   sir .     what s wrong with your speech .   harlan asked brutally  and even as he did so  he felt shame nudge him .   cooper blushed painfully .   i m not very good at standard intertemporal .     why not .  how long have you been a cub .     less than one year  sir .     one year .  how old are you  for time s sake .     twenty four physioyears  sir .    harlan stared .   are you trying to tell me that they took you into eternity at twenty three .     yes  sir .    harlan sat down and rubbed his hands together .  that just wasn t done .  fifteen to sixteen was the age of entrance into eternity .  what was this .  a new kind of testing of himself on the part of twissell .   he said   sit down and let s get started .  your name in full and your homewhen .    the cub stammered   brinsley sheridan cooper of the   th  sir .    harlan almost softened .  that was close .  it was only seventeen centuries downwhen from his own homewhen .  almost a temporal neighbor .   he said   are you interested in primitive history .     computer twissell asked me to learn .  i don t know much about it .     what else are you learning .     mathematics .  temporal engineering .  i m just getting the fundamentals so far .  back in the   th  i was a speedy vac repairman .    there was no point in asking the nature of a speedy vac .  it might be a suction cleaner  a computing machine  a type of spray painter .  anything .  harlan wasn t particularly interested .   he said   do you know anything about history .  any kind of history .     i studied european history .     your particular political unit  i take it .     i was born in europe .  yes .  mostly  of course  they taught us modern history .  after the revolutions of            that is .     all right .  first thing you do is to forget it .  it doesn t mean anything .  the history they try to teach timers changes with every reality change .  not that they realize that .  in each reality  their history is the only history .  that s what s so different about primitive history .  that s the beauty of it .  no matter what any of us does  it exists precisely as it has always existed .  columbus and washington  mussolini and hereford  they all exist .    cooper smiled feebly .  he brushed his little finger across his upper lip and for the first time harlan noticed a trace of bristle there as though the cub were cultivating a mustache .   cooper said   i can t quite  get used to it  all the time i ve been here .     get used to what .     being five hundred centuries away from homewhen .     i m nearly that myself .  i m   th .     that s another thing .  you re older than i am and yet i m seventeen centuries older than you in another way .  i can be your great great great and so on grandfather .     what s the difference .  suppose you are .     well  it takes getting used to .   there was a trace of rebellion in the cub s voice .    it does for all of us   said harlan callously  and began talking about the primitives .  by the time three hours had passed  he was deep in an explanation concerning the reasons why there were centuries before the ist century .     but isn t the  st century  first .    cooper had asked plaintively .    harlan ended by giving the cub a book  not a good one  really  but one that would serve as a beginning .   i ll get you better stuff as we go along   he said .       by the end of a week cooper s mustache had become a pronounced dark bristle that made him look ten years older and accentuated the narrowness of his chin .  on the whole  harlan decided  it would not be an improvement  that mustache .   cooper said   i ve finished your book .     what did you think of it .     in a way      there was a long pause .  cooper began over again .   parts of the later primitive was something like the   th .  it made me think of home  you know .  twice  i dreamed about my wife .    harlan exploded .   your  wife .      i was married before i came here .     great time .  did they bring your wife across too .    cooper shook his head .   i don t even know if she s been changed in the last year .  if she has  i suppose she s not really my wife now .    harlan recovered .  of course  if the cub were twenty three years old when he was taken into eternity  it was quite possible that he might have been married .  one thing unprecedented led to another .   what was going on .  once modifications were introduced into the rules  it wouldn t be a long step to the point where everything would decline into a mass of incoherency .  eternity was too finely balanced an arrangement to endure modification .   it was his anger on behalf of eternity  perhaps  that put an unintended harshness into harlan s next words .   i hope you re not planning on going back to the   th to check on her .    the cub lifted his head and his eyes were firm and steady .   no .    harlan shifted uneasily   good .  you have no family .  nothing .  you re an eternal and don t ever think of anyone you knew in time .    cooper s lips thinned  and his accent stood out sharply in his quick words .   you re speaking like a technician .    harlan s fists clenched along the sides of his desk .  he said hoarsely   what do you imply .  i m a technician so i make the changes .  so i defend them and demand that you accept them .  look  kid  you haven t been here a year  you can t speak intertemporal  you re all misgeared on time and reality  but you think you know all about technicians and how to kick them in the teeth .     i m sorry   said cooper quickly   i didn t mean to offend you .     no  no  who offends a technician .  you just hear everyone else talking  is that it .  they say   cold as a technician s heart   don t they .  they say   a trillion personalities changed  just a technician s yawn .   maybe a few other things .  what s the answer  mr .  cooper .  does it make you feel sophisticated to join in .  it makes you a big man .  a big wheel in eternity .     i said i m sorry .     all right .  i just want you to know i ve been a technician for less than a month and i personally have never induced a reality change .  now let s get on with business .        senior computer twissell called andrew harlan to his office the next day .   he said   how would you like to go out on an m . n . c .   boy .    it was almost too apposite .  all that morning harlan had been regretting his cowardly disclaimer of personal involvement in the technician s work  his childish cry of  i haven t done anything wrong yet  so don t blame me .   it amounted to an admission that there was something wrong about a technician s work  and that he himself was blameless only because he was too new at the game to have had time to be a criminal .   he welcomed the chance to kill that excuse now .  it would be almost a penance .  he could say to cooper  yes  because of something i have done  this many millions of people are new personalities  but it was necessary and i am proud to have been the cause .   so harlan said joyfully   i m ready  sir .     good .  good .  you ll be glad to know  boy    a puff  and the cigarette tip glowed brilliantly   that every one of your analyses checked out with high order accuracy .     thank you  sir .    they were analyses now  thought harlan  not guesses .     you ve got a talent .  quite a touch  boy .  i look for great things .  and we can begin with this one     rd .  your statement that a jammed vehicle clutch would supply the necessary fork without undesirable side effects is perfectly correct .  will you jam it .     yes  sir .    that was harlan s true initiation into technicianhood .  after that he was more than just a man with a rose red badge .  he had handled reality .  he had tampered with a mechanism during a quick few minutes taken out of the    rd and  as a result  a young man did not reach a lecture on mechanics he had meant to attend .  he never went in for solar engineering  consequently  and a perfectly simple device was delayed in its development a crucial ten years .  a war in the    th  amazingly enough  was moved out of reality as a result .   wasn t  that  good .  what if personalities were changed .  the new personalities were as human as the old and as deserving of life .  if some lives were shortened  more were lengthened and made happier .  a great work of literature  a monument of man s intellect and feeling  was never written in the new reality  but several copies were preserved in eternity s libraries  were they not .  and new creative works had come into existence  had they not .   yet that night harlan spent hours in a hot agony of wakefulness  and when he finally drowsed groggily  he did something he hadn t done in years .   he dreamed of his mother .       despite the weakness of such a beginning a physioyear was sufficient to make harlan known throughout eternity as  twissell s technician   and  with more than a trace of ill humor as  the wonder boy  and  the never wrong .    his contact with cooper became almost comfortable .  they never grew completely friendly .   if cooper could have brought himself to make advances  harlan might not have known how to respond .   nevertheless they worked well together  and cooper s interest in primitive history grew to the point where it nearly rivaled harlan s .   one day harlan said to cooper   look  cooper  would you mind coming in tomorrow instead .  i ve got to get up to the      s sometime this week to check on an observation and the man i want to see is free this afternoon .    cooper s eyes lit up hungrily   why can t i come .     do you want to .     sure .  i ve never been in a kettle except when they brought me here from the   th and i didn t know what was happening at the time .    harlan was accustomed to using the kettle in shaft c  which was  by unwritten custom  reserved for technicians along its entire immeasurable length through the centuries .  cooper showed no embarrassment at being led there .  he stepped into the kettle without hesitation and took his seat on the curved molding that completely circled it .   when harlan  however  had activated the field  and kicked the kettle into upwhen motion  cooper s face screwed up into an almost comic expression of surprise .    i don t feel a thing   he said .   is anything wrong .     nothing s wrong .  you re not feeling anything because you re not really moving .  you re being kicked along the temporal extension of the kettle .  in fact   harlan said  growing didactic   at the moment  you and i aren t matter  really  in spite of appearances .  a hundred men could be using this same kettle  moving  if you can call it that  at various velocities in either time direction  passing through one another and so on .  the laws of the ordinary universe just don t apply to the kettle shafts .    cooper s mouth quirked a bit and harlan thought uneasily  the kid s taking temporal engineering and knows more about this than i do .  why don t i shut up and stop making a fool of myself .   he retreated into silence  and stared somberly at cooper .  the younger man s mustache had been full grown for months .  it drooped  framing his mouth in what eternals called a mallansohn hairline  because the only photograph known to be authentic of the temporal field inventor  and that a poor one and out of focus  showed him with just such a mustache .  for that reason it maintained a certain popularity among eternals even though it did few of them justice .   cooper s eyes were fixed on the shifting numbers that marked the passing of the centuries with respect to themselves .  he said   how far upwhen does the kettle shaft go .     haven t they taught you that .     they ve hardly mentioned the kettles .    harlan shrugged .   there s no end to eternity .  the shaft goes on forever .     how far upwhen have you gone .     this will be the uppest .  dr .  twissell has been up to the        s .     great time .   whispered cooper .    that s still nothing .  some eternals have been up past the        th century .     what s  that  like .     like nothing at all   said harlan morosely .   lots of life but none of it human .  man is gone .     dead .  wiped out .     i don t know that anyone exactly knows .     can t something be done to change that .     well  from the        s on      began harlan  then ended abruptly .   oh  to time with it .  change the subject .    if there was one subject about which eternals were almost superstitious  it was the  hidden centuries   the time between the       th and the        th .  it was a subject that was rarely mentioned .  it was only harlan s close association with twissell that accounted for his own small knowledge of the era .  what it amounted to was that eternals couldn t pass into time in all those thousands of centuries .  the doors between eternity and time were impenetrable .  why .  no one knew .   harlan imagined  from some casual remarks of twissell s  that attempts had been made to change the reality in the centuries just downwhen from the       th  but without adequate observation beyond the       th not much could be done .   twissell had laughed a bit one time and said   we ll get through someday .  meanwhile         centuries is quite enough to take care of .    it did not sound wholly convincing .    what happens to eternity after the        th .   asked cooper .   harlan sighed .  the subject  apparently  was not to be changed .   nothing   he said .   the sections are there but there are no eternals in it anywhere after the       th .  the sections keep on going for millions of centuries till all life is gone and past that  too  till the sun becomes a nova  and past that  too .  there isn t any end to eternity .  that s why it s called eternity .     the sun  does  become a nova  then .     it certainly does .  eternity couldn t exist if that weren t so .  nova sol is our power supply .  listen  do you know how much power is required to set up a temporal field .  mallansohn s first field was two seconds from extreme downwhen to extreme upwhen and big enough to hold not more than a match head and that took a nuclear power plant s complete output for one day .  it took nearly a hundred years to set up a hair thin temporal field far enough upwhen to be able to tap the radiant power of the nova so that a field could be built big enough to hold a man .    cooper sighed .   i wish they would get to the point where they stopped making me learn equations and field mechanics and start telling me some of the interesting stuff .  now if i had lived in mallansohn s time        you would have learned nothing .  he lived in the   th  but eternity didn t start till late in the   th .  inventing the field isn t the same as constructing eternity  you know  and the rest of the   th didn t have the slightest inkling of what mallansohn s invention signified .     he was ahead of his generation  then .     very much so .  he not only invented the temporal field  but he described the basic relationships that made eternity possible and predicted almost every aspect of it except for the reality change .  quite closely  too  but i think we re pulling to a halt  cooper .  after you .    they stepped out .       harlan had never seen senior computer laban twissell angry before .  people always said that he was incapable of any emotion  that he was an unsouled fixture of eternity to the point where he had forgotten the exact number of his homewhen century .  people said that at an early age his heart had atrophied and that a hand computer similar to the model he carried always in his trouser pocket had taken its place .   twissell did nothing to deny these rumors .  in fact most people guessed that he believed them himself .   so even while harlan bent before the force of the angry blast that struck him  he had room in his mind to be amazed at the fact that twissell could display anger .  he wondered if twissell would be mortified in some calmer aftermath to realize that his hand computer heart had betrayed him by exposing itself as only a poor thing of muscle and valves subject to the twists of emotion .   twissell said  in part  his old voice creaking   father time  boy  are you on the allwhen council .  do you give the orders around here .  do you tell me what to do or do i tell you what to do .  are you making arrangements for all kettle trips this section .  do we all come to you for permission now .    he interrupted himself with occasional exclamations of  answer me   then continued pouring more questions into the boiling interrogative caldron .   he said finally   if you ever get above yourself this way again  i ll have you on plumbing repair and for good .  do you understand me .    harlan  pale with his own gathering embarrassment  said   i was never told that cub cooper was not to be taken on the kettle .    the explanation did not act as an emollient .   what kind of an excuse is a double negative  boy .  you were never told not to get him drunk .  you were never told not to shave him bald .  you were never told not to skewer him with a fine edged tav curve .  father time  boy  what  were  you told to do with him .     i was told to teach him primitive history .     then do so .  do nothing more than that .   twissell dropped his cigarette and ground it savagely underfoot as though it were the face of a lifelong enemy .    i d like to point out  computer   said harlan   that many centuries under the current reality somewhat resemble specific eras of primitive history in one or more respects .  it had been my intention to take him out to those times  under careful spatio temporal charting  of course  as a form of field trip .     what .  listen  you chucklehead  don t you ever intend to ask my permission for  anything .   that s out .  just teach him primitive history .  no field trips .  no laboratory experiments  either .  next you ll be changing reality just to show him how .    harlan licked his dry lips with a dry tongue  muttered a resentful acquiescence  and  eventually  was allowed to leave .   it took weeks for his hurt feelings to heal over somewhat .         computer    harlan had been two years a technician when he re entered the    nd for the first time since leaving with twissell .  he found it almost unrecognizable .   it had not changed .  he had .   two years of technicianhood had meant a number of things .  in one sense it had increased his feeling of stability .  he had no longer to learn a new language  get used to new styles of clothing and new ways of life with every new observation project .  on the other hand  it had resulted in a withdrawal on his own part .  he had almost forgotten now the camaraderie that united all the rest of the specialists in eternity .   most of all  he had developed the feeling of the  power  of being a technician .  he held the fate of millions in his finger tips  and if one must walk lonely because of it  one could also walk proudly .   so he could stare coldly at the communications man behind the entry desk of the    nd and announce himself in clipped syllables   andrew harlan  technician  reporting to computer finge for temporary assignment to the    nd   disregarding the quick glance from the middle aged man he faced .   it was what some people called the  technician glance   a quick  involuntary sidelong peek at the rose red shoulder emblem of the technician  then an elaborate attempt not to look at it again .   harlan stared at the other s shoulder emblem .  it was not the yellow of the computer  the green of the life plotter  the blue of the sociologist  or the white of the observer .  it was not the specialist s solid color at all .  it was simply a blue bar on white .  the man was communications  a subbranch of maintenance  not a specialist at all .   and  he  gave the  technician glance  too .   harlan said a little sadly   well .    communications said quickly   i m ringing computer finge  sir .        harlan remembered the    nd as solid and massive  but now it seemed almost squalid .   harlan had grown used to the glass and porcelain of the    th  to its fetish of cleanliness .  he had grown accustomed to a world of whiteness and clarity  broken by sparse patches of light pastel .   the heavy plaster swirls of the    nd  its splashy pigments  its areas of painted metal were almost repulsive .   even finge seemed different  less than life size  somewhat .  two years earlier  to observer harlan  finge s every gesture had seemed sinister and powerful .   now  from the lofty and isolated heights of technicianhood  the man seemed pathetic and lost .  harlan watched him as he leafed through a sheaf of foils and got ready to look up  with the air of someone who is beginning to think he has made his visitor wait the duly required amount of time .   finge was from an energy centered century in the     s .  twissell had told him that and it explained a good deal .  finge s flashes of illtemper could easily be the result of the natural insecurity of a heavy man used to the firmness of field forces and unhappy to be dealing with nothing more than flimsy matter .  his tiptoeing walk  harlan remembered finge s catlike tread well  often he would look up from his desk  see finge standing there staring at him  his approach having been unheard  was no longer something sly and sneaking  but rather the fearful and reluctant tread of one who lives in the constant  if unconscious  fear that the flooring would break under his weight .   harlan thought  with a pleasant condescension  the man is poorly adjusted to the section .  reassignment is probably the only thing that would help him .   finge said   greetings  technician harlan .     greetings  computer   said harlan .   finge said   it seems that in the two years since        two physioyears   said harlan .   finge looked up in surprise .   two physioyears  of course .    in eternity there was no time as one ordinarily thought of time in the universe outside  but men s bodies grew older and that was the unavoidable measure of time even in the absence of meaningful physical phenomena .  physiologically time passed  and in a physioyear within eternity a man grew as much older as he would have in an ordinary year in time .   yet even the most pedantic eternal remembered the distinction only rarely .  it was too convenient to say   see you tomorrow   or  i missed you yesterday   or  i will see you next week   as though there were a tomorrow or a yesterday or a last week in any but a physiological sense .  and the instincts of humanity were catered to by having the activities of eternity tailored to an arbitrary twenty four  physiohour  day  with a solemn assumption of day and night  today and tomorrow .   finge said   in the two  physioyears  since you left  a crisis has gradually gathered about the    nd .  a rather peculiar one .  a delicate one .  almost unprecedented .  we need accurate observation now as we never have needed it before .     and you want me to observe .     yes .  in a way  it s a waste of talent to ask a technician to do a job of observation  but your previous observations  for clarity and insight  were perfect .  we need that again .  now i ll just sketch in a few details .   .   .   .    what those details were harlan was not to find out just then .  finge spoke  but the door opened  and harlan did not hear him .   he stared at the person who entered .   it was not that harlan had never seen a girl in eternity before .  never was too strong a word .  rarely  yes  but not never .   but a girl such as  this .   and in  eternity .    harlan had seen many women in his passages through time  but in time they were only objects to him  like walls and balls  barrows and harrows  kittens and mittens .  they were facts to be observed .   in eternity a girl was a different matter .  and one like  this .    she was dressed in the style of the upper classes of the    nd  which meant transparent sheathing and not very much else above the waist  and flimsy  knee length trousers below .  the latter  while opaque enough  hinted delicately at gluteal curves .   her hair was glossily dark and shoulder length  her lips redly penciled thin above and full below in an exaggerated pout .  her upper eyelids and her ear lobes were tinted a pale rose and the rest of her youthful  almost girlish  face was a startlingly milky white .  jeweled pendants descended forward from mid shoulder to tinkle now this side  now that of the graceful breasts to which they drew attention .   she took her seat at a desk in the corner of finge s office  lifting her eyelashes only once to sweep her dark glance across harlan s face .   when harlan heard finge s voice again  the computer was saying   you ll get all this in an official report and meanwhile you can have your old office and sleeping quarters .    harlan found himself outside finge s office without quite remembering the details of his leaving .  presumably he had walked out .   the emotion within him that was easiest to recognize was anger .   by time   finge ought not to be allowed to do this .  it was bad for morale .  it made a mockery      he stopped himself  unclenched his fist  unclamped his jaw .  let s see  now .  his footsteps sounded sharply in his own ear as he strode firmly toward the communications man behind the desk .   communications looked up  without quite meeting his eye  and said cautiously   yes  sir .    harlan said   there s a woman at a desk in computer finge s office .  is she new here .    he had meant to ask it casually .  he had meant to make it a bored  indifferent question .  it rang out  instead  like a pair of cymbals clashing .   but it roused communications .  the look in his eye became something that made all men kin .  it even embraced the technician  drew him in as a fellow .  communications said   you mean the babe .  wow .  isn t she built like a force field latrine  though .    harlan stammered a bit .   just answer my question .    communications stared and some of his steam evaporated .  he said   she s new .  she s a timer .     what s her job .    a slow smile crept over communications  face and grew into a leer .   she s supposed to be the boss s secretary .  her name is noys lambent .     all right .   harlan turned on his heel and left .   harlan s first observation trip into the    nd came the next day  but it lasted for thirty minutes only .  it was obviously only an orientation trip  intended to get him into the feel of things .  he entered it for an hour and a half the next day and not at all on the third .   he occupied his time in working his way through his original reports  relearning his own knowledge  brushing up on the language system of the time  accustoming himself to the local costumes again .   one reality change had hit the    nd  but it was very minor .  a political clique that had been in was now out  but there seemed no change in the society otherwise .   without quite realizing it he slipped into the habit of searching his old reports for information on the aristocracy .  surely he had made observations .   he had  but they were impersonal  from a distance .  his data concerned them as a class  not as individuals .   of course his spatio temporal charts had never demanded or even permitted him to observe the aristocracy from within .  what the reasons for that might have been was beyond the purview of an observer .  he was impatient with himself at feeling curiosity concerning that now .   during those three days he had caught glimpses of the girl  noys lambent  four times .  at first he had been aware only of her clothes and her ornaments .  now he noticed that she was five feet six in height  half a head shorter than himself  yet slim enough and with a carriage erect and graceful enough to give an impression of height .  she was older than she first seemed  approaching thirty perhaps  certainly over twenty five .   she was quiet and reserved  smiled at him once when he passed her in the corridor  then lowered her eyes .  harlan drew aside to avoid touching her  then walked on feeling angry .   by the close of the third day harlan was beginning to feel that his duty as an eternal left him only one course of action .  doubtless her position was a comfortable one for herself .  doubtless finge was within the letter of the law .  yet finge s indiscretion in the matter  his carelessness certainly went against the spirit of the law  and something should be done about it .   harlan decided that  after all  there wasn t a man in eternity he disliked quite as much as finge .  the excuses he had found for the man only a few days before vanished .   on the morning of the fourth day harlan asked for and received permission to see finge privately .  he walked in with a determined step and  to his own surprise  made his point instantly .   computer finge  i suggest that miss lambent be returned to time .    finge s eyes narrowed .  he nodded toward a chair  placed clasped hands under his soft  round chin  and showed some of his teeth .   well  sit down .  sit down .  you find miss lambert incompetent .  unsuitable .     as to her incompetence and unsuitability  computer  i cannot say .  it depends on the uses to which she is put  and i have put her to none .  but you must realize that she is bad for the morale of this section .    finge stared at him distantly as though his computer s mind were weighing abstractions beyond the reach of an ordinary eternal .   in what way is she hurting morale  technician .     there s no real necessity for you to ask   said harlan  his anger deepening .   her costume is exhibitionistic .  her        wait  wait .  now wait a while  harlan .  you ve been an observer in this era .  you know her clothes are standard costume for the    nd .     in her own surroundings  in her own cultural milieu  i would have no fault to find  though i ll say right now that her costume is extreme even for the    nd .  you ll allow me to be the judge of that .  here in eternity  a person such as she is certainly out of place .    finge nodded his head slowly .  he actually seemed to be enjoying himself .  harlan stiffened .   finge said   she is here for a deliberate purpose .  she is performing an essential function .  it is only temporary .  try to endure her meanwhile .    harlan s jaw quivered .  he had protested and was being fobbed off .  to hell with caution .  he would speak his mind .  he said   i can imagine what the woman s  essential function  is .  to keep her so openly will not be allowed to pass .    he turned stiffly  walked to the door .  finge s voice stopped him .    technician   finge said   your relationship with twissell may have given you a distorted notion about your own importance .  correct that .  and meanwhile tell me  technician  have you ever had a   he hesitated  seeming to pick among words   girl friend .    with painstaking and insulting accuracy  back still turned  harlan quoted   in the interest of avoiding emotional entanglements with time  an eternal may not marry .  in the interest of avoiding emotional entanglements with family  an eternal may not have children .    the computer said gravely   i didn t ask about marriage or children .    harlan quoted further   temporary liaisons may be made with timers only after application with the central charting board of the allwhen council for an appropriate life plot of the timer concerned .  liaisons may be conducted thereafter only according to the requirements of specific spatio temporal charting .     quite true .  have you ever applied for temporary liaison  technician .     no  computer .     do you intend to .     no  computer .     perhaps you ought to .  it would give you a greater breadth of view .  you would become less concerned about the details of a woman s costume  less disturbed about her possible personal relations with other eternals .    harlan left  speechless with rage .       he found it almost impossible to perform his near daily trek into the    nd  the longest continuous period remaining something under two hours .    he was upset  and he knew why .  finge .  finge  and his coarse advice concerning liaisons with timers .   liaisons existed .  everyone knew that .  eternity had always been aware of the necessity for compromising with human appetites  to harlan the phrase carried a quivery repulsion   but the restrictions involved in choosing mistresses made the compromise anything but lax  anything but generous .  and those who were lucky enough to qualify for such an arrangement were expected to be most discreet about it  out of common decency and consideration for the majority .   among the lower classes of eternals  particularly among maintenance  there were always the rumors  half hopeful  half resentful  of women imported on a more or less permanent basis for the obvious reasons .  always rumor pointed to the computers and life plotters as the benefiting groups .  they and only they could decide which women could be abstracted from time without danger of significant reality change .   less sensational  and therefore less tongue worthy  were the stories concerning the timer employees that every section engaged temporarily  when spatio temporal analysis permitted  to perform the tedious tasks of cooking  cleaning  and heavy labor .   but a timer  and  such  a timer  employed as  secretary   could only mean that finge was thumbing a nose at the ideals that made eternity what it was .   regardless of the facts of life to which the practical men of eternity made a perfunctory obeisance it remained true that the ideal eternal was a dedicated man living for the mission he had to perform  for the betterment of reality and the improvement of the sum of human happiness .  harlan liked to think that eternity was like the rnonasteries of primitive times .   he dreamed that night that he spoke to twissell about the matter  and that twissell  the ideal eternal  shared his horror .  he dreamed of a broken finge  stripped of rank .  he dreamed of himself with the yellow computer s insigne  instituting a new regime in the    nd  ordering finge grandly to a new position in maintenance .  twissell sat next to him  smiling with admiration  as he drew up a new organizational chart  neat  orderly  consistent  and asked noys lambent to distribute copies .   but noys lambent was nude  and harlan woke up  trembling and ashamed .       he met the girl in a corridor one day and stood aside  eyes averted  to let her pass .   but she remained standing  looking at him  until he had to look up and meet her eyes .  she was all color and life and harlan was conscious of a faint perfume about her .   she said   you re technician harlan  aren t you .    his impulse was to snub her  to force his way past  but  after all  he told himself  all this wasn t her fault .  besides  to move past her now would mean touching her .   so he nodded briefly .   yes .     i m told you re quite an expert on our time .     i have been in it .     i would love to talk to you about it someday .     i am busy .  i wouldn t have time .     but mr .  harlan  surely you could  find  time someday .    she smiled at him .   harlan said in a desperate whisper   will you pass  please .  or will you stand aside to let me pass .  please .    she moved by with a slow swing of her hips that brought blood tingling to his embarrassed cheeks .   he was angry at her for embarrassing him  angry at himself for being embarrassed  and angry  most of all  for some obscure reason  at finge .       finge called him in at the end of two weeks .  on his desk was a sheet of perforated flimsy the length and intricacy of which told harlan at once that this concerned no half hour excursion into time .   finge said   would you sit down  harlan  and scan this thing right now .  no  not by eye .  use the machine .    harlan lifted indifferent eyebrows  and inserted the sheet carefully between the lips of the scanner on finge s desk .  slowly it passed into the intestines of the machine and  as it did so  the perforation pattern was translated into words that appeared on the cloudy white rectangle that was the visual attachment .   somewhere about midpoint  harlan s hand shot out and disconnected the scanner .  he yanked the flimsy out with a force that tore its tough cellulite structure .   finge said calmly   i have another copy .    but harlan was holding the remnants between thumb and forefinger as though it might explode .   computer finge  there is some mistake .  surely i am not to be expected to use the home of this woman as base for a near week stay in time .    the computer pursed his lips .   why not  if the spatio temporal requirements are such .  if there is a personal problem involved between yourself and miss lam        no personal problem at all   interposed harlan hotly .    some kind of problem  certainly .  in the circumstances  i will go as far as to explain certain aspects of the observational problem .  this is not to be taken as a precedent  of course .    harlan sat motionless .  he was thinking hard and fast .  ordinarily professional pride would have forced harlan to disdain explanation .  an observer  or technician  for that matter  did his job without question .  and ordinarily a computer would never dream of offering explanation .   here  however  was something unusual .  harlan had complained concerning the girl  the so called secretary .  finge was afraid the complaint might go further .    the guilty fleeth when no man pursueth   thought harlan with grim satisfaction and tried to remember where he had read that phrase .    finge s strategy was obvious  therefore .  by stationing harlan in the woman s dwelling place he would be ready to make counteraccusations if matters went far enough .  harlan s value as a witness against him would be destroyed .   and  of course  he would have to have some specious explanation for placing harlan in such a place  and this would be it .  harlan listened with barely hidden contempt .   finge said   as you know  the various centuries are aware of the existence of eternity .  they know that we supervise intertemporal trade .  they consider that to be our chief function  which is good .  they have a dim knowledge that we are also here to prevent catastrophe from striking mankind .  that is more a superstition than anything else  but it is more or less correct  and good  too .  we supply the generations with a mass father image and a certain feeling of security .  you see all that  don t you .    harlan thought  does the man think i m still a cub .   but he nodded briefly .   finge went on .   there are some things  however  they must not know .  prime among them  of course  is the manner in which we alter reality when necessary .  the insecurity such knowledge would arouse would be most harmful .  it is always necessary to breed out of reality any factors that might lead to such knowledge and we have never been troubled with it .    however  there are always other undesirable beliefs about eternity which spring up from time to time in one century or another .  usually  the dangerous beliefs are those which concentrate particularly in the ruling classes of an era  the classes that have most contact with us and  at the same time  carry the important weight of what is called public opinion .    finge paused as though he expected harlan to offer some comment or ask some question .  harlan did neither .   finge continued .   ever since the reality change          serial number f    which took place about a year  a physioyear ago  there has been evidence of the bringing into reality of such an undesirable belief .  i have come to certain conclusions about the nature of that belief and have presented them to the allwhen council .  the council is reluctant to accept them since they depend upon the realization of an alternate in the computing pattern of an extremely low probability .    before acting on my recommendation  they insist on confirmation by direct observation .  it s a most delicate job  which is why i recalled you  and why computer twissell allowed you to be recalled .  another thing i did was to locate a member of the current aristocracy  who thought it would be thrilling or exciting to work in eternity .  i placed her in this office and kept her under close observation to see if she were suitable for our purpose       harlan thought  close observation .  yes .   again his anger focused itself on finge rather than upon the woman .   finge was still speaking .   by all standards  she is suitable .  we will now return her to her time .  using her dwelling as a base  you will be able to study the social life of her circle .  do you understand now the reason i had the girl here and the reason i want you in her house .    harlan said with an almost open irony   i understand quite well  i assure you .     then you will accept this mission .    harlan left with the fire of battle burning inside his chest .  finge was  not  going to outsmart him .  he was  not  going to make a fool of him .   surely it was that fire of battle  the determination to outwit finge  that caused him to experience an eagerness  almost an exhilaration  at the thought of this next excursion into the    nd .   surely it was nothing else .         timer    noys lambent s estate was fairly isolated  yet within easy reach of one of the larger cities of the century .  harlan knew that city well  he knew it better than any of its inhabitants could .  in his exploratory observations into this reality he had visited every quarter of the city and every decade within the purview of the section .   he knew the city both in space and time .  he could piece it together  view it as an organism  living and growing  with its catastrophes and recoveries  its gaieties and troubles .  now he was in a given week of time in that city  in a moment of suspended animation of its slow life of steel and concrete .   more than that  his preliminary explorations had centered themselves more and more closely about the  perioeci   the inhabitants who were the most important of the city  yet who lived outside the city  in room and relative isolation .   the    nd was one of the many centuries in which wealth was unevenly distributed .  the sociologists had an equation for the phenomenon  which harlan had seen in print  but which he understood only vaguely  .  it worked itself out for any given century to three relationships  and for the    nd those relationships stood near the limits of what could be permitted .  sociologists shook their heads over it and harlan had heard one say at one time that any further deterioration with new reality changes would require  the closest observation .    yet there was this to be said for unfavorable relationships in the wealth distribution equation .  it meant the existence of a leisure class and the development of an attractive way of life which  at its best  encouraged culture and grace .  as long as the other end of the scale was not too badly off  as long as the leisure classes did not entirely forget their responsibilities while enjoying their privileges  as long as their culture took no obviously unhealthy turn  there was always the tendency in eternity to forgive the departure from the ideal wealth distribution pattern and to search for other  less attractive maladjustments .   against his will harlan began to understand this .  ordinarily his overnight stays in time involved hotels in the poorer sections  where a man might easily stay anonymous  where strangers were ignored  where one presence more or less was nothing and therefore did not cause the fabric of reality to do more than tremble .  when even that was unsafe  when there was a good chance that the trembling might pass the critical point and bring down a significant part of the card house of reality  it was not unusual to have to sleep under a particular hedge in the countryside .   and it was usual to survey various hedges to see which would be least disturbed by farmers  tramps  even stray dogs  during the night .   but now harlan  at the other end of the scale  slept in a bed with a surface of field permeated matter  a peculiar welding of matter and energy that entered only the highest economic levels of this society .  throughout time it was less common than pure matter but more common than pure energy .  in any case it molded itself to his body as he lay down  firm when he lay still  yielding when he moved or turned .   reluctantly he confessed the attraction of such things  and he accepted the wisdom which caused each section of eternity to live on the  median  scale of its century rather than at its most comfortable level .  in that way it could maintain contact with the problems and  feel  of the century  without succumbing to too close an identification with a sociological extreme .   it is easy  thought harlan  that first evening  to live with aristocrats .   and just before he fell asleep  he thought of noys .   he dreamed he was on the allwhen council  fingers clasped austerely before him .  he was looking down on a small  a very small  finge  listening in terror to the sentence that was casting him out of eternity to perpetual observation of one of the unknown centuries of the far  far upwhen .  the somber words of exile were coming from harlan s own mouth  and immediately to his right sat noys lambent .   he hadn t noticed her at first  but his eyes kept sliding to his right  and his words faltered .   did no one else see her .  the rest of the members of the council looked steadily forward  except for twissell .  he turned to smile at harlan  looking through the girl as though she weren t there .   harlan wanted to order her away  but words were no longer coming out of his mouth .  he tried to beat at the girl  but his arm moved sluggishly and she did not move .  her flesh was cold .   finge was laughing  louder   louder      and it was noys lambent laughing .   harlan opened his eyes to bright sunlight and stared at the girl in horror for a moment before he remembered where she was and where he was .   she said   you were moaning and beating the pillow .  were you having a bad dream .    harlan did not answer .   she said   your bath is ready .  so are your clothes .  i ve arranged to have you join the gathering tonight .  it felt queer to step back into my ordinary life after being in eternity so long .    harlan felt acutely disturbed at her easy flow of words .  he said   you didn t tell them who i was  i hope .     of  course  not .    of  course  not .  finge would have taken care of that little matter by having her lightly psychoed under narcosis  if he felt that necessary .  he might not have thought it necessary  however .  after all  he had given her  close observation .    the thought annoyed him .  he said   i d prefer to be left to myself as much as possible .    she looked at him uncertainly a moment or two and left .   harlan went through the morning ritual of washing and dressing glumly .  he had no great hopes of an exciting evening .  he would have to say as little as possible  do as little as possible  be a part of the wall as much as possible .  his true function was that of a pair of ears and a pair of eyes .  connecting those senses with the final report was his mind  which  ideally  had no other function .   ordinarily it did not disturb him that  as an observer  he did not know what he was looking for .  an observer  he had been taught as a cub  must not have preconceived notions as to what data is desired or what conclusions are expected .  the knowledge  it was said  would automatically distort his view  however conscientious he tried to be .   but under the circumstances ignorance was irritating .  harlan suspected strongly that there was nothing to look for  that he was playing finge s game in some way .  between that and noys .   he stared savagely at the image of himself cast in three dimensional accuracy two feet in front of him by the reflector .  the clinging garments of the    nd  seamless and bright in coloring  made him  he thought  look ridiculous .       noys lambent came running to him just after he had finished a solitary breakfast brought to him by a mekkano .   she said breathlessly   it s june  technician harlan .    he said harshly   do not use the title here .  what if it is june .     but it was february when i joined   she paused doubtfully   that place  and that was only a month ago .    harlan frowned .   what year is it now .     oh  it s the right year .     are you sure .     i m quite positive .  has there been a mistake .   she had a disturbing habit of standing quite close to him as they talked and her slight lisp  a trait of the century rather than of herself personally  gave her the sound of a young and rather helpless child .  harlan was not fooled by that .  he drew away .    no mistake .  you ve been put here because it s more suitable .  actually  in time  you have been here all along .     but how could i .   she looked more frightened still .   i don t remember anything about it .  are there two me s .    harlan was far more irritated than the cause warranted .  how could he explain to her the existence of micro changes induced by every interference with time which could alter individual lives without appreciable effect on the century as a whole .  even eternals sometimes forgot the difference between micro changes  small  c   and changes  large  c   which significantly altered reality .   he said   eternity knows what it s doing .  don t ask questions .   he said it proudly  as though he  himself  were a senior computer and had personally decided that june was the proper moment in time and that the micro change induced by skipping three months could not develop into a change .   she said   but then i ve lost three months of my life .    he sighed .   your movements through time have nothing to do with your physiological age .     well  have i or haven t i .     have or haven t what .     lost three months .     by time  woman  i m telling you as plainly as i can .  you haven t lost any time out of your life .  you can t lose any .    she stepped backward at his shout and then  suddenly  giggled .  she said   you have the funniest accent .  especially when you get angry .    he frowned at her retreating back .  what accent .  he spoke fiftymillennial as well as anyone in the section .  better probably .   stupid girl .   he found himself back at the reflector staring at his image  which stared back at him  vertical furrows deep between its eyes .   he smoothed them out and thought  i m not handsome .  my eyes are too small and my ears stick out and my chin is too big .   he had never particularly thought about the matter before  but now it occurred to him  quite suddenly  that it would be pleasant to be handsome .       late at night harlan added his notes to the conversations he had gathered  while it was all fresh in his mind .   as always in such cases he made use of a molecular recorder of   th century manufacture .  in shape it was a featureless thin cylinder about four inches long by half an inch in diameter .  it was colored a deep but noncommittal brown .  it could be easily held in cuff  pocket  or lining  depending on the style of clothing  or  for that matter  suspended from belt  button  or wristband .   however held  wherever kept  it had the capacity of recording some twenty million words on each of three molecular energy levels .  with one end of the cylinder connected to a transliterator  resonating efficiently with harlan s earpiece  and the other end connected field wise to the small mike at his lips  harlan could listen and speak simultaneously .   every sound made during the hours of the  gathering  repeated itself now in his ear  and as he listened  he spoke words that recorded themselves on a second level  co ordinate with but different from the primary level on which the gathering had been recorded .  on this second level he described his own impressions  he ascribed significance  pointed out correlations .  eventually  when he made use of the molecular recorder to write a report  he would have  not simply a sound forsound recording  but an annotated reconstruction .   noys lambent entered .  she did  not  signal her entrance in any way .   annoyed  harlan removed lip piece and earpiece  clipped them to the molecular recorder  placed the whole into its kit  and clasped that shut .    why do you act so angry with me .   asked noys .  her arms and shoulders were bare and her long legs shimmered in faintly luminescent foamite .   he said   i am not angry .  i have no feeling for you at all .   at the moment he felt the statement to be rigidly true .   she said   are you still working .  surely  you must be tired .     i can t work if you re here   he replied peevishly .    you  are  angry with me .  you did not say a word to me all evening .     i said as little as i could to anybody .  i wasn t there to speak .   he waited for her to leave .   but she said   i brought you another drink .  you seemed to enjoy one at the gathering and one isn t enough .  especially if you re going to be working .    he noticed the small mekkano behind her  gliding in on a smooth force field .   he had eaten sparingly that evening  picking lightly at dishes concerning which he had reported in full in past observations but which  except for fact searching nibbles  he had thus far refrained from eating .  against his will  he had liked them .  against his will  he had enjoyed the foaming  light green  peppermint flavored drink  not quite alcoholic  something else  rather  that was currently fashionable .  it had not existed in the century two physioyears earlier  prior to the latest reality change .   he took the second drink from the mekkano with an austere nod of thanks to noys .   now why had a reality change which had had virtually no physical effect on the century brought a new drink into existence .  well  he wasn t a computer  so there was no use asking himself that question .  besides  even the most detailed possible computations could never eliminate all uncertainty  all random effects .  if that weren t so  there would be no need for observers .   they were alone together in the house  noys and himself .  mekkanos were at the height of their popularity these two decades past and would remain so for nearly a decade more in this reality  so there were no human servants about .   of course  with the female of the species as economically independent as the male  and able to attain motherhood  if she so wished  without the necessities of physical childbearing  there could be nothing  improper  in their being together alone in the eyes of the    nd  at least .   yet harlan felt compromised .   the girl was stretched out on her elbow on a sofa opposite .  its patterned covering sank beneath her as though avid to embrace her .  she had kicked off the transparent shoes she had been wearing and her toes curled and uncurled within the flexible foamite  like the soft paws of a luxuriant cat .   she shook her head and whatever it was that had kept her hair arranged upward away from her ears in intricate intertwinings was suddenly loosened .  the hair tumbled about her neck and her bare shoulders became more creamily lovely at the contrast with the black of the hair .   she murmured   how old are you .    that he certainly should not have answered .  it was a personal question and the answer was none of her business .  what he should have said at that point with polite firmness was  may i be left to my work .  instead what he heard himself saying was   thirty two years .   he meant physioyears  of course .   she said   i m younger than you .  i m twenty seven .  but i suppose i won t always look younger than you .  i suppose you ll be like this when i m an old woman .  what made you decide to be thirty two .  can you change if you wish .  wouldn t you want to be younger .     what are you talking about .   harlan rubbed his forehead to clear his mind .   she said softly   you live forever .  you re an eternal .    was it a question or a statement .   he said   you re mad .  we grow old and die like anyone else .    she said   you can tell me .   her voice was low and cajoling .  the fifty millennial language  which he had always thought harsh and unpleasant  seemed euphonious after all .  or was it merely that a full stomach and the scented air had dulled his ears .   she said   you can see all times  visit all places .  i so wanted to work in eternity .  i waited the longest time for them to let me .  i thought maybe they d make me an eternal  and then i found there were only men there .  some of them wouldn t even talk to me because i was a woman .   you  wouldn t talk to me .     we re all busy   mumbled harlan  fighting to keep off something that could only be described as a numb content .   i was very busy .     but why aren t there more women eternals .    harlan couldn t trust himself to speak .  what could he say .  that members of eternity were chosen with infinite care since two conditions had to be met .  first  they must be equipped for the job  second  their withdrawal from time must have no deleterious effect upon reality .   reality .  that was the word he must not mention under any circumstances .  he felt the spinning sensation in his head grow stronger and he closed his eyes for a moment to stop it .   how many excellent prospects had been left untouched in time because their removal into eternity would have meant the non birth of children  the non death of women and men  non marriage  non happenings  non circumstance that would have twisted reality in directions the allwhen council could not permit .   could he tell her any of this .  of course not .  could he tell her that women almost never qualified for eternity because  for some reason he did not understand  computers might  but he himself certainly did not   their abstraction from time was from ten to a hundred times as likely to distort reality as was the abstraction of a man .    all the thoughts jumbled together in his head  lost and whirling  joined to one another in a free association that produced odd  almost grotesque  but not entirely unpleasant  results .  noys was closer to him now  smiling .    he heard her voice like a drifting wind .   oh  you eternals .  you are so secretive .  you won t share at all .  make me an eternal .    her voice was a sound now that didn t coalesce into separate words  just a delicately modulated sound that insinuated itself into his mind .   he wanted  he longed to tell her  there s no fun in eternity  lady .  we work .  we work to plot out all the details of everywhen from the beginning of eternity to where earth is empty  and we try to plot out all the infinite possibilities of all the might have beens and pick out a might have been that is better than what is and decide where in time we can make a tiny little change to twist the is to the might be and we have a new is and look for a new might be  forever  and forever  and that is how it has been since vikkor mallansohn discovered the temporal field in the   th  way back in the primitive   th and then it was possible to start eternity in the   th  the mysterious mallansohn whom no man knows and who started eternity  really  and the new might be  forever and forever and forever and  .   .   .   he shook his head  but the whirligig of thought went on and on in stranger and more jagged breaks and leaps until it jumped into a sudden flash of illumination that persisted for a brilliant second  then died .   that moment steadied him .  he grasped for it  but it was gone .   the peppermint drink .   noys was still closer  her face not quite clear in his gaze .  he could feel her hair against his cheek  the warm  light pressure of her breath .  he ought to draw away  but  strangely  strangely  he found he did not want to .    if i were made an eternal  .   .   .   she breathed  almost in his ear  though the words were scarcely heard above the beating of his heart .  her lips were moist and parted .   wouldn t you like to .    he did not know what she meant  but suddenly he didn t care .  he seemed in flames .  he put out his arms clumsily  gropingly .  she did not resist  but melted and coalesced with him .   it all happened dreamily  as though it were happening to someone else .   it wasn t nearly as repulsive as he had always imagined it must be .  it came as a shock to him  a revelation  that it wasn t repulsive at all .   even afterward  when she leaned against him with her eyes all soft and smiling a little  he found he had to reach out and stroke her damp hair with slow and trembling delight .   she was entirely different in his eyes now .  she was not a woman  not an individual at all .  she was suddenly an aspect of himself .  she was  in a strange and unexpected way  a part of himself .   the spatio temporal chart said nothing of this  yet harlan felt no guilt .  it was only the thought of finge that aroused strong emotion in harlan s breast .  and that wasn t guilt .  not at all .   it was satisfaction  even triumph .       in bed harlan could not sleep .  the lightheadedness had worn off now  but there was still the unusual fact that for the first time in his adult life a grown woman shared his bed .   he could hear her soft breathing and in the ultra dim glow to which the internal light of the walls and ceiling had been reduced he could see her body as the merest shadow next to his .   he had only to move his hand to feel the warmth and softness of her flesh  and he dared not do that  lest he wake her out of whatever dreaming she might have .  it was as though she were dreaming for the two of them  dreaming herself and himself and all that had happened  and as though her waking would drive it all from existence .   it was a thought that seemed a piece of those other queer  unusual thoughts he had experienced just before  .   .   .   those had been strange thoughts  coming to him at a moment between sense and nonsense .  he tried to recapture them and could not .  yet suddenly it was very important that he recapture them .  for although he could not remember the details  he could remember that  for just an instant  he had understood something .   he was not certain what that something was  but there had been the unearthly clarity of the half asleep  when more than mortal eye and mind seems suddenly to come to life .   his anxiety grew .  why couldn t he remember .  so much had been in his grasp .   for the moment even the sleeping girl beside him receded into the hinterland of his thoughts .   he thought  if i follow the thread  .   .   .  i was thinking of reality and eternity  .   .   .  yes  and mallansohn and the cub .   he stopped there .  why the cub .  why cooper .  he  hadn t  thought of him .   but if he hadn t  then why should he think of brinsley sheridan cooper now .   he frowned .  what was the truth that connected all this .  what was it he was trying to find .  what made him so sure there was something to find .   harlan felt chilled  for with these questions a distant glow of that earlier illumination seemed to break upon the horizons of his mind and he almost knew .   he held his breath  did not press for it .  let it come .   let it come .   and in the quiet of that night  a night already so uniquely significant in his life  an explanation and interpretation of events came to him that at any saner  more normal time he would not have entertained for a moment .   he let the thought bud and flower  let it grow until he could see it explain a hundred odd points that otherwise simply remained  odd .   he would have to investigate this  check this  back in eternity  but in his heart he was already convinced that he knew a terrible secret he was not meant to know .   a secret that embraced all eternity .         life plotter    a month of physiotime had passed since that night in the    nd  when he grew acquainted with many things .  now  if one calculated by ordinary time  he was nearly      centuries in noys lambent s future  attempting by a mixture of bribery and cajolery to learn what lay in store for her in a new reality .   it was worse than unethical  but he was past caring .  in the physiomonth just gone he had  in his own eyes  become a criminal .  there was no way of glossing over that fact .  he would be no more a criminal by compounding his crime and he had a great deal to gain by doing so .   now  as part of his felonious maneuvering  he made no effort to choose a milder phrase  he stood at the barrier before the     th .  entry into time was much more complicated than mere passage between eternity and the kettle shafts .  in order to enter time the coordinates fixing the desired region on earth s surface had painstakingly to be adjusted and the desired moment of time pin pointed within the century .  yet despite inner tension harlan handled the controls with the ease and quick confidence of a man with much experience and a great talent .   harlan found himself in the engine room he had seen first on the viewing screen within eternity .  at this physiomoment sociologist voy would be sitting safely before that screen watching for the technician s touch that was to come .   harlan felt no hurry .  the room would remain empty for the next     minutes .  to be sure  the spatio temporal chart allowed him only     minutes  leaving the remaining    as the customary    per cent  margin .   margin was there in case of necessity  but a technician was not expected to have to use it .  a  margin eater  did not remain a specialist long .   harlan  however  expected to use no more than   minutes of the iio .  wearing his wrist borne field generator so that he was surrounded by an aura of physiotime  an effluvium  so to speak  of eternity  and therefore protected from any of the effects of reality change  he took one step toward the wall  lifted a small container from its position on a shelf  and placed it in a carefully adjusted spot on the shelf below .   having done that  he re entered eternity in a way that seemed as prosaic to himself as passage through any door might be .  had there been a timer watching  it would have seemed to him that harlan had simply disappeared .   the small container stayed where he put it .  it played no immediate role in world history .  a man s hand  hours later  reached for it but did not find it .  a search revealed it half an hour later still  but in the interim a force field had blanked out and a man s temper had been lost .  a decision which would have remained unmade in the previous reality was now made in anger .  a meeting did not take place  a man who would have died lived a year longer  under other circumstances  another who would have lived died somewhat sooner .   the ripples spread wider  reaching their maxium in the     st  which was twenty five centuries upwhen from the touch .  the intensity of the reality change declined thereafter .  theorists pointed out that nowhere to the infinite upwhen could the change ever become zero  but by fifty centuries upwhen from the touch the change had become too small to detect by the finest computing  and that was the practical limit .   of course no human being in time could ever possibly be aware of any reality change having taken place .  mind changed as well as matter and only eternals could stand outside it all and see the change .       sociologist voy was staring at the bluish scene in the     st  where earlier there had been all the activity of a busy space port .  he barely looked up when harlan entered .  he barely mumbled something that might have been a greeting .   a change had indeed blasted the space port .  its shininess was gone  what buildings there stood were not the grand creations they had been .  a space ship rusted .  there were no people .  there was no motion .   harlan allowed himself a small smile that flickered for a moment  then vanished .  it was m . d . r .  all right .  maximum desired response .  and it had happened at once .  the change did not necessarily take place at the precise moment of the technician s touch .  if the calculations that went into the touch were sloppy  hours or days might elapse before the change actually took place  counting  of course  by physiotime  .  it was only when all degrees of freedom vanished that the change took place .  while there was even a mathematical chance for alternate actions  the change did  not  take place .   it was harlan s pride that when  he  calculated an m . n . c .   when it was  his  hand that contrived the touch  the degrees of freedom vanished at once  and the change took place instantly .   voy said softly   it had been very beautiful .    the phrase grated harlan s ears  seeming to detract from the beauty of his own performance .   i wouldn t regret   he said   having spacetravel bred out of reality altogether .     no .   said voy .    what good is it .  it never lasts more than a millennium or two .  people get tired .  they come back home and the colonies die out .  then after another four or five millennia  or forty or fifty  they try again and it fails again .  it is a waste of human ingenuity and effort .    voy said dryly   you re quite a philosopher .    harlan flushed .  he thought  what s the use in talking to any of them .  he said  angrily  with a sharp change of subject   what about the life plotter .     what about him .     would you check with the man .  he ought to have made some progress by now .    the sociologist let a look of disapproval drift across his face  as though to say  you re the impatient one  aren t you .  aloud he said   come with me and let s see .        the name plate on the office door said neron feruque  which struck harlan s eye and mind because of its faint similarity to a pair of rulers in the mediterranean area during primitive times .   his weekly discourses with cooper had sharpened his own preoccupation with the primitive almost feverishly .    the man  however  resembled neither ruler  as harlan recalled it .  he was almost cadaverously lean  with skin stretched tightly over a high bridged nose .  his fingers were long and his wrists knobby .  as he caressed his small summator  he looked like death weighing a soul in the balance .   harlan found himself staring at the summator hungrily .  it was the heart and blood of life plotting  the skin and bones  sinew  muscle and all else .  feed into it the required data of a personal history  and the equations of the reality change  do that and it would chuckle away in obscene merriment for any length of time from a minute to a day  and then spit out the possible companion lives for the person involved  under the new reality   each neatly ticketed with a probability value .   sociologist voy introduced harlan .  feruque  having stared in open annoyance at the technician s insigne  nodded his head and let the matter go .   harlan said   is the young lady s life plot complete yet .     it is not .  i ll let you know when it is .   he was one of those who carried contempt for the technician to the point of open rudeness .   voy said   take it easy  life plotter .    feruque had eyebrows which were light almost to invisibility .  it heightened the resemblance of his face to a skull .  his eyes rolled in what should have been empty sockets as he said   killed the spaceships .    voy nodded .   cut it down a century .    feruque s lips twisted softly and formed a word .   harlan folded his arms and stared at the life plotter  who looked away in eventual discomfiture .   harlan thought  he  knows  it s his guilt too .   feruque said to voy   listen  as long as you re here  what in time am i going to do about the anti cancer serum requests .  we re not the only century with anti cancer .  why do we get all the applications .     all the other centuries are just as crowded .  you know that .     then they ve got to stop sending in applications altogether .     how do we go about making them .     easy .  let the allwhen council stop receiving them .     i have no pull with the allwhen council .     you have pull with the old man .    harlan listened to the conversation dully  without real interest .  at least it served to keep his mind on inconsequentials and away from the chuckling summator .  the  old man   he knew  would be the computer in charge of the section .    i ve talked to the old man   said the sociologist   and he s talked to the council .     nuts .  he s just sent through a routine tape strip .  he has to fight for this .  it s a matter of basic policy .     the allwhen council isn t in the mood these days to consider changes in basic policy .  you know the rumors going round .     oh  sure .  they re busy on a big deal .  whenever there s dodging to do  the word gets round that council s busy on some big deal .     if harlan could have found the heart for it  he would have smiled at that point .    feruque brooded a few moments  and then burst out   what most people don t understand is that anti cancer serum isn t a matter of tree seedlings or field motors .  i know that every sprig of spruce has to be watched for adverse effects on reality  but anti cancer always involves a human life and that s a hundred times as complicated .    consider .  think how many people a year die of cancer in each century that doesn t have anti cancer serums of one sort or another .  you can imagine how many of the patients want to die .  so the timer governments in every century are forever forwarding applications to eternity to  please  pretty please ship them seventy five thousand ampules of serum on behalf of the men critically stricken who are absolutely vital to the cultures  enclosed see biographical data .     voy nodded rapidly   i know .  i know .    but feruque was not to be denied his bitterness .   so you read the biographical data and it s every man a hero .  every man an insupportable loss to his world .  so you work it through .  you see what would happen to reality if each man lived  and for time s sake  if different  combinations  of men lived .    in the last month  i ve done     cancer requests .  seventeen  count them  seventeen life plots came out to involve no undesirable reality changes .  mind you  there wasn t one case of a possible  desirable  reality change  but the council says neutral cases get the serum .  humanity  you know .  so exactly seventeen people in assorted centuries get cured this month .    and what happens .  are the centuries happy .  not on your life .  one man gets cured and a dozen  same country  same time  don t .  everyone says  why  that  one .  maybe the guys we didn t treat are better characters  maybe they re rosy cheeked philanthropists beloved by all  while the one man we cure kicks his aged mother all around the block whenever he can spare the time from beating his kids .  they don t know about reality changes and we can t tell them .    we re just making trouble for ourselves  voy  unless the allwhen council decides to screen all applications and approve only those which result in a desirable reality change .  that s all .  either curing them does some good for humanity  or else it s out .  never mind this business of saying   well  it does no harm .     the sociologist had been listening with a look of mild pain on his face  and now he said   if it were  you  with cancer  .   .   .     that s a stupid remark  voy .  is that what we base decisions on .  in that case there d never be a reality change .  some poor sucker always gets it in the neck  doesn t he .  suppose you were that sucker  hey .    and another thing .  just remember that every time we make a reality change it s harder to find a good next one .  every physioyear  the chance that a random change is likely to be for the worse increases .  that means the proportion of guys we can cure gets smaller anyway .  it s always going to get smaller .  someday  we ll be able to cure only one guy a physioyear  even counting the neutral cases .  remember that .    harlan lost even the faintest interest .  this was the type of griping that went with the business .  the psychologists and sociologists  in their rare introvertive studies of eternity  called it identification .  men identified themselves with the century with which they were associated professionally .  its battles  all too often  became their own battles .   eternity fought the devil of identification as best it could .  no man could be assigned to any section within two centuries of his homewhen  to make identification harder .  preference was given to centuries with cultures markedly different from that of their homewhen .   harlan thought of finge and the    nd .   what was more  their assignments were shifted as often as their reactions grew suspect .   harlan wouldn t give a  oth century grafenpiece for feruque s chances of retaining this assignment longer than another physioyear at the outside .    and still men identified out of a silly yearning for a home in time  the time wish  everyone knew about it  .  for some reason this was particularly true in centuries with space travel .  it was something that should be investigated and would be but for eternity s chronic reluctance to turn its eyes inward .   a month earlier harlan might have despised feruque as a blustering sentimentalist  a petulant oaf who eased the pain of watching the electro gravitics lose intensity in a new reality by railing against those of other centuries who wanted anti cancer serum .   he might have reported him .  it would have been his duty to do so .  the man s reactions obviously could no longer be trusted .   he could not do so  now .  he even found sympathy for the man .  his own crime was so much greater .   how easy it was to slip back to thoughts of noys .       eventually he had fallen asleep that night  and he awoke in daylight  with brightness shining through translucent walls all about until it was as though he had awakened on a cloud in a misty morning sky .   noys was laughing down at him .    goodness   it was hard to wake you .    harlan s first reflexive action was a scrabble for bedclothes that weren t there .  then memory arrived and he stared at her hollowly  his face burning red .  how should he feel about this .   but then something else occurred to him and he shot to a sitting position .   it isn t past one  is it .  father time .     it s only eleven .  you ve got breakfast waiting and lots of time .     thanks   he mumbled .    the shower controls are all set and your clothes are all ready .    what could he say .   thanks   he mumbled .   he avoided her eyes during the meal .  she sat opposite him  not eating  her chin buried in the palm of one hand  her dark hair combed thickly to one side and her eyelashes preternaturally long .   she followed every gesture he made while he kept his eyes lowered and searched for the bitter shame he knew he ought to feel .   she said   where will you be going at one .     aeroball game   he muttered   i have the ticket .     that s the rubber game .  and i missed the whole season because of just skipping the time  you know .  who ll win the game  andrew .    he felt oddly weak at the sound of his first name .  he shook his head curtly and tried to look austere .   it used to have been so easy .     but surely you know .  you ve inspected this whole period  haven t you .    properly speaking  he ought to maintain a flat and cold negative  but weakly he explained   there was a lot of space and time to cover .  i wouldn t know little precise things like game scores .     oh  you just don t want to tell me .    harlan said nothing to that .  he inserted the pene prong into the small  juicy fruit and lifted it  whole  to his lips .   after a moment noys said   did you see what happened in this neighborhood before you came .     no details  n  noys .    he forced her name past his lips .    the girl said softly   didn t you see us .  didn t you know all along that     harlan stammered   no  no  i couldn t see myself . i m not in rea     i m not here till i come .  i can t explain .   he was doubly flustered .  first  that she should speak of it .  second  that he had almost been trapped into saying   reality   of all the words the most forbidden in conversation with timers .   she lifted her eyebrows and her eyes grew round and a little amazed .   are you ashamed .     what we did was not proper .     why not .   and in the    nd her question was perfectly innocent .   aren t eternals allowed to .   there was almost a joking cast to that question as though she were asking if eternals weren t allowed to eat .    don t use the word   said harlan .   as a matter of fact  we re not  in a way .     well  then  don t tell them .   i  won t .    and she walked about the table and sat down on his lap  pushing the small table out of the way with a smooth and flowing motion of her hip .   momentarily he stiffened  lifted his hands in a gesture that might have been intended to hold her off .  it didn t succeed .   she bent and kissed him on his lips  and nothing seemed shameful any more .  nothing that involved noys and himself .       he wasn t sure when first he began to do something that an observer  ethically  had no right to do .  that is  he began to speculate on the nature of the problem involving the current reality and of the reality change that would be planned .   it was not the loose morals of the century  not ectogenesis  not matriarchy  that disturbed eternity .  all of that was as it was in the previous reality and the allwhen council had viewed it with equanimity then .  finge had said it was something very subtle .   the change then would have to be very subtle and it would have to involve the group he was observing .  so much seemed obvious .   it would involve the aristocracy  the well to do  the upper classes  the beneficiaries of the system .   what bothered him was that it would most certainly involve noys .   he got through the remaining three days called for in his chart in a gathering cloud that dampened even his joy in noys s company .   she said to him   what happened .  for a while  you seemed all different from the way you were in eter  in that place .  you weren t stiff at all .  now  you seem concerned .  is it because you have to go back .    harlan said   partly .     do you have to .     i have to .     well  who would care if you were late .    harlan almost smiled at that .   they wouldn t like me to be late   he said  yet thought longingly just the same of the two day margin allowed for in his chart .   she adjusted the controls of a musical instrument that played soft and complicated strains out of its own creative bowels by striking notes and chords in a random manner  the randomness weighted in favor of pleasant combinations by intricate mathematical formulae .  the music could no more repeat itself than could snowflakes  and could no more fail of beauty .   through the hypnosis of sound harlan gazed at noys and his thoughts wound tightly about her .  what would she be in the new dispensation .  a fishwife  a factory girl  the mother of six  fat  ugly  diseased .  whatever she was  she would not remember harlan .  he would have been no part of her life in a new reality .  and whatever she would be then  she would not be noys .   he did not simply love a  girl  .   strangely  he used the word  love  in his own thoughts for the first time and did not even pause long enough to stare at the strange thing and wonder at it .   he loved a complex of factors  her choice of clothes  her walk  her manner of speech  her tricks of expression .  a quarter century of life and experience in a given reality had gone into the manufacture of all that .  she had not been his noys in the previous reality of a physioyear earlier .  she would not be his noys in the next reality .   the new noys might  conceivably  be better in some ways  but he knew one thing very definitely .  he wanted this noys here  the one he saw at this moment  the one of this reality .  if she had faults  he wanted those faults  too .   what could he do .   several things occurred to him  all illegal .  one of them was to learn the nature of the change and find out definitely how it would affect noys .  one could not  after all  be certain that  .   .   .       a dead silence wrenched harlan out of his reverie .  he was in the life plotter s office once more .  sociologist voy was watching him out of the corner of his eye .  feruque s death s head was lowering at him .   and the silence was piercing .   it took a moment for the significance to penetrate .  just a moment .  the summator had ceased its inner clucking .   harlan jumped up .   you have the answer  life plotter .    feruque looked down at the flimsies in his hand .   yeah .  sure .  sort of funny .     may i have it .   harlan held out his hand .  it was trembling visibly .    there s nothing to see .  that s what s funny .     what do you mean  nothing .   harlan stared at feruque with eyes that suddenly smarted till there was only a tall  thin blur where feruque stood .   the life plotter s matter of fact voice sounded thin .   the dame doesn t exist in the new reality .  no personality shift .  she s just out  that s all .  gone .  i ran the alternatives down to probability   .      .  she doesn t make it anywhere .  in fact   and he reached up to rub his cheek with long  spare fingers   with the combination of factors you handed me i don t quite see how she fit in the old reality .    harlan hardly heard  but  but the change was such a small one .     i know .  a funny combination of factors .  here  you want the flimsies .    harlan s hand closed over them  unfeeling .  noys gone .  noys nonexistent .  how could that be .   he felt a hand on his shoulder and voy s voice clashed on his ear .   are you ill  technician .   the hand drew away as though it already regretted its careless contact with a technician s body .   harlan swallowed and with an effort composed his features .   i m quite well .  would you take me to the kettle .    he  must not  show his feelings .  he must act as though this were what he represented it to be  a mere academic investigation .  he must disguise the fact that with noys s nonexistence in the new reality he was almost physically overwhelmed by a flood of pure elation  unbearable joy .         prelude to crime    harlan stepped into the kettle at the     th and looked backward to make certain that the barrier that separated the shaft from eternity was truly flawless  that sociologist voy was not watching .  in these last weeks it had grown to be a habit with him  an automatic twitch  there was always the quick backward glance across the shoulder to make sure no one was behind him in the kettle shafts .   and then  though already in the     th  it was for upwhen that harlan set the kettle controls .  he watched the numbers on the temporometer rise .  though they moved with blurry quickness  there would be considerable time for thought .   how the life plotter s finding changed matters .  how the very nature of his crime had changed .   and it had all hinged on finge .  the phrase caught at him with its ridiculous rhyme and its heavy beat circled dizzyingly inside his skull  it hinged on finge .  it hinged on finge  .   .   .       harlan had avoided any personal contact with finge on his return to eternity after those days with noys in the    nd .  as eternity closed in about him  so did guilt .  a broken oath of office  which seemed nothing in the    nd  was enormous in eternity .   he had sent in his report by impersonal air chute and took himself off to personal quarters .  he needed to think this out  gain time to consider and grow accustomed to the new orientation within himself .   finge did not permit it .  he was in communication with harlan less than an hour after the report had been coded for proper direction and inserted into the chute .   the computer s image stared out of the vision plate .  his voice said   i expected you to be in your office .    harlan said   i delivered the report  sir .  it doesn t matter where i wait for a new assignment .     yes .   finge scanned the roll of foil he held in his hands  holding it up  squint eyed  and peering at its perforation pattern .    it is scarcely complete   he went on .   may i visit your rooms .    harlan hesitated a moment .  the man was his superior and to refuse the self invitation at this moment would have a flavor of insubordination .  it would advertise his guilt  it seemed  and his raw  painful conscience dared not permit that .    you will be welcome  computer   he said stiffly .       finge s sleek softness introduced a jarring element of epicureanism into harlan s angular quarters .  the   th  harlan s homewhen  tended toward the spartan in house furnishings and harlan had never completely lost his taste for the style .  the tubular metal chairs had been surfaced with a dull veneer that had been artificially grained into the appearance of wood  though not very successfully  .  in one corner of the room was a small piece of furniture that represented an even wider departure from the customs of the times .   it caught finge s eye almost at once .   the computer put a pudgy finger on it  as though to test its texture .   what is this material .     wood  sir   said harlan .    the real thing .  actual wood .  amazing .  you use wood in your homewhen  i believe .     we do .     i see .  there s nothing in the rules against this  technician   he dusted the finger with which he had touched the object against the side seam of his trouser leg   but i don t know that it s advisable to allow the culture of the homewhen to affect one .  the true eternal adopts whatever culture he is surrounded by .  i doubt  for instance  if i have eaten out of an energic utensil more than twice in five years .   he sighed .   and yet to allow food to touch matter has always seemed unclean .  but i don t give in .  i don t give in .    his eyes returned to the wooden object  but now he held both hands behind his back  and said   what is it .  what is its purpose .     it s a bookcase   said harlan .  he had the impulse to ask finge how he felt now that his hands rested firmly upon the small of his back .  would he not consider it cleaner to have his clothes and his own body constructed of pure and undefiled energy fields .   finge s eyebrows lifted .   a bookcase .  then those objects resting upon the shelves are books .  is that right .     yes  sir .     authentic specimens .     entirely  computer .  i picked them up in the   th .  the few i have here date from the   th .  if  if you intend to look at them  i wish you d be careful .  the pages have been restored and impregnated  but they re not foil .  they take careful handling .     i won t touch them .  i have no intention of touching them .  original   th century dust is on them  i imagine .  actual books .   he laughed .   pages of cellulose  too .  you implied that .    harlan nodded .   cellulose modified by the impregnation treatment for longer life .  yes .   he opened his mouth for a deep breath  forcing himself to remain calm .  it was ridiculous to identify himself with these books  to feel a slur upon them to be a slur upon himself .    i dare say   said finge  still on the subject   that the whole content of those books could be placed on two meters of film and stored in a finger s end .  what do the books contain .    harlan said   they are bound volumes of a news magazine of the   th .     you read that .    harlan said proudly   these are a few volumes of the complete collection i have .  no library in eternity can duplicate it .     yes  your hobby .  i remember now you once told me about your interest in the primitive .  i m amazed your educator ever allowed you to grow interested in such a thing .  a complete waste of energy .    harlan s lips thinned .  the man  he decided  was deliberately trying to irritate him out of possession of calm reasoning faculties .  if so  he must not be allowed to succeed .   harlan said flatly   i think you ve come to see me about my report .     yes  i have .   the computer looked about  selected a chair  and sat down gingerly .   it is not complete  as i said over the communicator .     in what way  sir .    calm .  calm .    finge broke into a nervous twitch of a smile .   what happened that you didn t mention  harlan .     nothing  sir .   and though he said it firmly  he stood there  hangdog .    come  technician .  you spent several periods of time in the society of the young lady .  or you did if you followed the spatio temporal chart .  you did follow it  i suppose .    harlan s guilt riddled him to the point where he could not even rise to the bait of this open assault upon his professional competence .   he could only say   i followed it .     and what happened .  you include nothing of the private interludes with the woman .     nothing of importance happened   said harlan  dry lipped .    that is ridiculous .  at your time of life and with your experience  i don t have to tell you that it is not for an observer to judge what is important and what is not .    finge s eyes were keenly upon harlan .  they were harder and more eager than quite befitted his soft line of questioning .   harlan noted that well and was not fooled by finge s gentle voice  yet the habit of duty tugged at him .  an observer must report  everything  .  an observer was merely a sense perceptive pseudopod thrust out by eternity into time .  it tested its surroundings and was drawn back .  in the fulfillment of his function an observer had no individuality of his own  he was not really a man .   almost automatically harlan began his narration of the events he had left out of his report .  he did it with the trained memory of the observer  reciting the conversations with word for word accuracy  re constructing the tone of voice and cast of countenance .  he did it lovingly  for in the telling he lived it again  and almost forgot  in the process  that a combination of finge s probing and his own healing sense of duty was driving him into an admission of guilt .   it was only as he approached the end result of that first long conversation that he faltered and the shell of his observer s objectivity showed cracks .   he was saved from further details by the hand that finge suddenly raised and by the computer s sharp  edgy voice .   thank you .  it is enough .  you were about to say that you made love to the woman .    harlan grew angry .  what finge said was the literal truth  but finge s tone of voice made it sound lewd  coarse  and  worse than that  commonplace .  whatever else it was  or might be  it was not commonplace .   harlan had an explanation for finge s attitude  for his anxious cross examination  for his breaking off the verbal report at the moment he did .  finge was jealous .  that much harlan would have sworn was obvious .  harlan had succeeded in taking away a girl that finge had meant to have .   harlan felt the triumph in that and found it sweet .  for the first time in his life he knew an aim that meant more to him than the frigid fulfillment of eternity .  he was going to keep finge jealous  because noys lambent was to be permanently his .   in this mood of sudden exaltation he plunged into the request that originally he had planned to present only after a wait of a discreet four or five days .   he said   it is my intention to apply for permission to form a liaison with a timed individual .    finge seemed to snap out of a reverie .   with noys lambent  i presume .     yes  sir .  as computer in charge of the section  it will have to go through you .   .   .   .    harlan wanted it to go through finge .  make him suffer .  if he wanted the girl himself  let him say so and harlan could insist on allowing noys to make her choice .  he almost smiled at that .  he hoped it would come to that .  it would be the final triumph .   ordinarily  of course  a technician could not hope to push through such a matter in the face of a computer s desires  but harlan was sure he could count on twissell s backing  and finge had a long way to go before he could buck twissell .   finge  however  seemed tranquil .   it would seem   he said   that you have already taken illegal possession of the girl .    harlan flushed and was moved to a feeble defense .   the spatio temporal chart insisted on our remaining alone together .  since nothing of what happened was specifically forbidden  i feel no guilt .    which was a lie  and from finge s half amused expression one could feel that he knew it to be a lie .   he said   there will be a reality change .    harlan said   if so  i will amend my application to request liaison with miss lambent in the new reality .     i don t think that would be wise .  how can you be sure in advance .  in the new reality  she may be married  she may be deformed .  in fact i can tell you this .  in the new reality  she will not want you .  she will  not  want you .    harlan quivered .   you know nothing about it .     oh .  you think this great love of yours is a matter of soul to soul contact .  that it will survive all external changes .  have you been reading novels out of time .    harlan was goaded into indiscretion .   for one thing  i don t believe you .     finge said coldly   i beg pardon .     you re lying .   harlan didn t care what he said now .   you re jealous .  it s all it amounts to .  you re jealous .  you had your own plans for noys but she chose me .    finge said   do you realize      i realize a great deal .  i m no fool .  i may not be a computer  but neither am i an ignoramus .  you say she won t want me in the new reality .  how do you know .  you don t even know yet what the new reality will be .  you don t know if there must be a new reality at all .  you just received my report .  it must be analyzed before a reality change can be computed  let alone submitted for approval .  so when you affect to know the nature of the change  you are lying .    there were a number of ways in which finge might have made response .  harlan s heated mind was aware of many .  he did not try to choose among them .  finge might stalk out in affected dudgeon  he might call in a member of security and have harlan taken into custody for insubordination  he might shout back  yelling as angrily as harlan  he might put in an immediate call to twissell  lodging a formal complaint  he might  he might  .   .   .   finge did none of this .   he said gently   sit down  harlan .  let s talk about this .    and because that response was completely unexpected  harlan s jaw sagged and he sat down in confusion .  his resolution faltered .  what was this .    you remember  of course   said finge   that i told you that our problem with the    nd involved an undesirable attitude on the  part of the timers of the current reality toward eternity .  you do remember that  don t you .   he spoke with the mild urging of a schoolmaster toward a somewhat backward student  yet harlan thought he could detect a kind of hard glitter in his eye .   harlan said   of course .     you remember  too  that i told you that the allwhen council was reluctant to accept my analysis of the situation without specific confirming observations .  doesn t that imply to you that i had already computed the necessary reality change .     but my own observations represent the confirmation  don t they .     they do .     and it would take time to analyze them properly .     nonsense .  your report means nothing .  the confirmation lay in what you told me orally moments ago .     i don t understand you .     look  harlan  let me tell you what is wrong with the    nd .  among the upper classes of this century  particularly among the women  there has grown up the notion that eternals are really eternal  literally so  that they live forever .   .   .   .  great time  man  noys lambent told you as much .  you repeated her statements to me not twenty minutes ago .    harlan stared blankly at finge .  he was remembering noys s soft  caressing voice as she leaned toward him and caught at his eyes with her own lovely  dark glance   you live forever .  you re an eternal  .   finge went on   now a belief like that is bad  but  in itself  not too bad .  it can lead to inconveniences  increase difficulties for the section  but computation would show that only in a minority of cases would change be necessary .  still  if a change  is  desirable  isn t it obvious to you that the inhabitants of the century who must  above all  change maximally with the change  be those who are subject to the superstition .  in other words  the female aristocracy .  noys .     it may be  but i ll take my chance   said harlan .    you have no chance at all .  do you think your fascinations and charm persuaded the soft aristocrat to fall into the arms of an unimportant technician .  come  harlan  be realistic about this .    harlan s lips grew stubborn .  he said nothing .   finge said   can t you guess the additional superstition which these people have added to their belief in the actual eternal life of the eternals .  great time  harlan .  most of the women believe that intimacy with an eternal will enable a mortal woman  as they think of themselves  to live forever .    harlan swayed .  he could hear noys s voice again so clearly   if i were made an eternal   .   .   .   and then her kisses .   finge went on .   the existence of such a superstition was hard to believe  harlan .  it was unprecedented .  it lay within the region of random error so that a search through the computations for the previous change yielded no information respecting it one way or the other .  the allwhen council wanted firm evidence  direct substantiation .  i chose miss lambent as a good example of her class .  i chose you as the other subject       harlan struggled to his feet .   you chose  me .   as a  subject .      i m sorry   said finge stiffly   but it was necessary .  you made a very good subject .    harlan stared at him .   finge had the grace to squirm a bit under that wordless stare .  he said   don t you see .  no  you still don t .  look  harlan  you re a coldfish product of eternity .  you won t look at a woman .  you consider women and all that concerns t . hem unethical .  no  there s a better word .  you consider them  sinful  .  that attitude shows all over you  and to any woman you d have all the sex appeal of a month dead mackerel .  yet here we have a woman  a beautiful pampered product of a hedonistic culture  who ardently seduces you on your first evening together  virtually begging for your embrace .  don t you understand that that is ridiculous  impossible  unless  well  unless it is the confirmation we were looking for .    harlan struggled for words .   you say she sold herself        why that expression .  there is no shame attached to sex in this century .  the only strange thing is that she chose you as partner  and  that  she did for the sake of eternal life .  it s plain .    and harlan  arms raised  hands claw bent  with no rational thought in his mind  or any irrational one other than to choke and throttle finge  sprang forward .   finge stepped back hastily .  he brought out a blaster with a quick  trembling gesture .   don t touch me .  back .    harlan had just enough sanity to halt his rush .  his hair was matted .  his shirt was stained with perspiration .  his breath whistled through pinched white nostrils .   finge said shakily   i know you very well  you see  and i thought your reaction might be violent .  now i ll shoot if i have to .    harlan said   get out .     i will .  but first you ll listen .  for attacking a computer  you can be declassified  but we ll let that go .  you will understand  however  that i did not lie .  the noys lambent of the new reality  whatever else may be or not be  will lack this superstition .  the whole purpose of the change will be to wipe out the superstition .  and without it  harlan    his voice was almost a snarl   how could a woman like noys want a man like you .    the pudgy computer backed toward the door of harlan s personal quarters  blaster still leveled .   he paused to say  with a sort of grim gaiety   of course  if you had her now  harlan  if you had her now  you could enjoy her .  you could keep your liaison and make it formal .  that is  if you had her now .  but the change will come soon  harlan  and after that  you will not have her .  what a pity  the now does not last  even in eternity  eh  harlan .    harlan no longer looked at him .  finge had won after all and was leaving in clear and leering possession of the field .  harlan stared unseeingly at his own toes  and when he looked up finge was gone   whether five seconds earlier or fifteen minutes harlan could not have said .       hours had passed nightmarishly and harlan felt trapped in the prison of his mind .  all that finge had said was so true  so transparently true .  harlan s observer mind could look back upon the relationship of himself and noys  that short  unusual relationship  and it took on a different texture .   it wasn t a case of instant infatuation .  how could he have believed it was .  infatuation for a man like himself .   of course not .  tears stung his eyes and he felt ashamed .  how obvious it was that the affair was a case of cool calculation .  the girl had certain undeniable physical assets and no ethical principles to keep her from using them .  so she used them and that had nothing to do with andrew harlan as a person .  he simply represented her distorted view of eternity and what it meant .   automatically harlan s long fingers caressed the volumes in his small bookshelf .  he took one out and  unseeingly  opened it .   the print blurred .  the faded colors of the illustrations were ugly  meaningless blotches .   why had finge troubled to tell him all this .  in the strictest sense he ought not to have .  an observer  or anyone acting as observer  ought never to know the ends attained by his observation .  it removed him by so much from the ideal position of the objective non human tool .   it was to crush him  of course  to take a mean and jealous revenge .   harlan fingered the open page of the magazine .  he found himself staring at a duplication  in startling red  of a ground vehicle  similar to vehicles characteristic of the   th     nd     th  and    th centuries  as well as of late primitive times .  it was a very common sort of affair with an internal combustion motor .  in the primitive era natural petroleum fractions were the source of power and natural rubber cushioned the wheels .  that was true of none of the later centuries  of course .   harlan had pointed that out to cooper .  he had made quite a point of it  and now his mind  as though longing to turn away from the unhappy present  drifted back to that moment .  sharp  irrelevant images filled the ache within harlan .    these advertisements   he had said   tell us more of primitive times than the so called news articles in the same magazine .  the news articles assume a basic knowledge of the world it deals with .  it uses terms it feels no necessity of explaining .  what is a  golf ball   for instance .    cooper had professed his ignorance readily .   harlan went on in the didactic tone he could scarcely avoid on occasions such as this .   we could deduce that it was a small pellet of some sort from the nature of the casual mentions it receives .  we know that it is used in a game  if only because it is mentioned in an item under the heading  sport .   we can even make further deductions that it is hit by a long rod of some sort and that the object of the game is to drive the ball into a hole in the ground .  but why bother with deduction and reasoning .  observe this advertisement .  the object of it is only to induce readers to buy the ball  but in so doing we are presented with an excellent close range portrait of one  with a section cut into it to show its construction .    cooper  coming from an era in which advertisement was not as wildly proliferative as it was in the later centuries of primitive times  found all this difficult to appreciate .  he said   isn t it rather disgusting the way these people blow their own horn .  who would be fool enough to believe a person s boastings about his own products .  would he admit defects .  is he likely to stop at any exaggeration .    harlan  whose homewhen was middling fruitful in advertisement  raised tolerant eyebrows and merely said   you ll have to accept that .  it s their way and we never quarrel with the ways of any culture as long as it does not seriously harm mankind as a whole .    but now harlan s mind snapped back to his present situation and he was back in the present  staring at the loudmouthed  brassy advertisements in the news magazine .  he asked himself in sudden excitement  were the thoughts he had just experienced really irrelevant .  or was he tortuously finding a way out of the blackness and back to noys .   advertisement .  a device for forcing the unwilling into line .  did it matter to a ground vehicle manufacturer whether a given individual felt an original or spontaneous desire for his product .  if the prospect  that was the word  could be artificially persuaded or cajoled into feeling that desire and acting upon it  would that not be just as well .   then what did it matter if noys loved him out of passion or out of calculation .  let them but be together long enough and she would grow to love him .  he would  make  her love him and  in the end  love and not its motivation was what counted .  he wished now he had read some of the novels out of time that finge had mentioned scornfully .   harlan s fists clenched at a sudden thought .  if noys had come to  him   to  harlan   for immortality  it could only mean that she had not yet fulfilled the requirement for that gift .  she could have made love to no eternal previously .  that meant that her relationship to finge had been nothing more than that of secretary and employer .  otherwise what need would she have had for harlan .   yet finge surely must have tried  must have attempted .   .   .   harlan could not complete the thought even in the secrecy of his own mind .   finge could have proved the superstition s existence on his own person .  surely he could not have missed the thought with noys an everpresent temptation .  then she must have refused him .   he had had to use harlan and harlan had succeeded .  it was for that reason that finge had been driven into the jealous revenge of torturing harlan with the knowledge that noys s motivation had been a practical one  and that he could never have her .   yet noys had refused finge even with eternal life at stake and  had  accepted harlan .  she had that much of a choice and she had made it in harlan s favor .   so it wasn t calculation entirely .  emotion played a part .   harlan s thoughts were wild and jumbled  and grew more heated with every moment .   he  must  have her  and  now  .  before any reality change .  what was it finge had said to him  jeering   the now does not last  even in eternity  .   doesn t it  though .  doesn t it .   harlan had known exactly what he must do .  finge s angry taunting had goaded him into a frame of mind where he was ready for crime and finge s final sneer had  at least  inspired him with the nature of the deed he must commit .   he had not wasted a moment after that .  it was with excitement and even joy that he left his quarters  at all but a run  to commit a major crime against eternity .         crime    no one had questioned him .  no one had stopped him .  there was that advantage  anyway  in the social isolation of a technician .  he went via the kettle channels to a door to time and set its controls .  there was the chance  of course  that someone would happen along on a legitimate errand and wonder why the door was in use .  he hesitated  and then decided to stamp his seal on the marker .  a sealed door would draw little attention .  an unsealed door in active use would be a nine day wonder .   of course  it might be finge who stumbled upon the door .  he would have to chance that .   noys was still standing as he had left her .  wretched hours  physiohours  had passed since harlan had left the    nd for a lonely eternity  but he returned now to the same time  within a matter of seconds  that he had left .  not a hair on noys s head had stirred .   she looked startled .   did you forget something  andrew .    harlan stared at her hungrily  but made no move to touch her .  he remembered finge s words  and he dared not risk a repulse .  he said stiffly   you ve got to do as i say .    she said   but is something wrong  then .  you just left .  you just this minute left .     don t worry   said harlan .  it was all he could do to keep from taking her hand  from trying to soothe her .  instead he spoke harshly .  it was as though some demon were forcing him to do all the wrong things .  why had he come back at the first available moment .  he was only disturbing her by his almost instantaneous return after leaving .    he knew the answer to that  really .  he had a two day margin of grace allowed by the spatio temporal chart .  the earlier portions of that period of grace were safer and yielded least chance of discovery .  it was a natural tendency to crowd it as far downwhen as he could .  a foolish risk  too  though .  he might easily have miscalculated and entered time before he had left it physiohours earlier .  what then .  it was one of the first rules he had learned as an observer  one person occupying two points in the same time of the same reality runs a risk of meeting himself .   somehow that was something to be avoided .  why .  harlan knew he didn t want to meet himself .  he didn t want to be staring into the eyes of another and earlier  or later  harlan .  beyond that it would be a paradox  and what was it twissell was fond of saying .   there are no paradoxes in time  but only because time deliberately avoids paradoxes .     all the time harlan thought dizzily of all this noys stared at him with large  luminous eyes .   then she came to him and put cool hands on either burning cheek and said softly   you re in trouble .    to harlan her glance seemed kindly  loving .  yet how could that be .  she had what she wanted .  what else was there .  he seized her wrists and said huskily   will you come with me .  now .  without asking any questions .  doing exactly as i say .     must i .   she asked .    you must  noys .  it s very important .     then i ll come .   she said it matter of factly  as though such a request came to her each day and was always accepted .       at the lip of the kettle noys hesitated a moment  then stepped in .   harlan said   we re going upwhen  noys .     that means the future  doesn t it .    the kettle was already faintly humming as she entered it and she was scarcely seated when harlan unobtrusively moved the contact at his elbow .   she showed no signs of nausea at the beginnings of that indescribable sensation of  motion  through time .  he was afraid she might .   she sat there quietly  so beautiful and so at ease that he ached  looking at her  and gave not the particle of a damn that  by bringing a timer  unauthorized  into eternity  he had committed a felony .   she said   does that dial show the numbers of the years  andrew .     the centuries .     you mean we re a thousand years in the future .  already .     that s right .     it doesn t feel like it .     i know .    she looked about .   but how are we moving .     i don t know  noys .     you  don t .      there are many things about eternity that are hard to understand .    the numbers on the temporometer  marched  .  faster and faster they moved till they were a blur .  with his elbow harlan had nudged the speed stick to high .  the power drain might cause some surprise in the power plants  but he doubted it .  no one had been waiting for him in eternity when he returned with noys  and that was nine tenths the battle .  now it was only necessary to get her to a safe place .   again harlan looked at her .   eternals don t know everything .     and i m not an eternal   she murmured .   i know so little .    harlan s pulse quickened .   still  not an eternal .  but finge said  .   .   .   leave it at that  he pleaded with himself .  leave it at that .  she s coming with you .  she smiles at you .  what more do you want .   but he spoke anyway .  he said   you think an eternal lives forever  don t you .     well  they call them etemals  you know  and everyone says they do .   she smiled at him brightly .   but they don t  do they .     you don t think so  then .     after i was in eternity a while  i didn t .  people didn t talk as though they lived forever  and there were old men there .     yet you told me i lived forever  that night .    she moved closer to him along the seat  still smiling .   i thought  who knows .    he said  without being quite able to keep the strain out of his voice   how does a timer go about becoming an eternal .    her smile vanished and was it his imagination or was there a trace of heightened color in her cheek .  she said   why do you ask that .     to find out .     it s silly   she said .   i d rather not talk about it .   she stared down at her graceful fingers  edged with nails that glittered colorlessly in the muted light of the kettle shaft .  harlan thought abstractedly and quite apropos of nothing that at an evening gathering  with a touch of mild ultraviolet in the wall illumination  those nails would glow a soft apple green or a brooding crimson  depending on the angle she held her hands .  a clever girl  one like noys  could produce half a dozen shades out of them  and make it seem as though the colors were reflecting her moods .  blue for innocence  bright yellow for laughter  violet for sorrow  and scarlet for passion .   he said   why did you make love to me .    she shook her hair back and looked at him out of a pale  grave face .  she said   if you must know  part of the reason was the theory that a girl can become an eternal that way .  i wouldn t mind living forever .     i thought you said you didn t believe that .     i didn t  but it couldn t hurt a girl to take the chance .  especially       he was staring at her sternly  finding refuge from hurt and disappointment in a frozen look of disapproval from the heights of the morality of his homewhen .   well .     especially since i wanted to  anyway .     wanted to make love to me .     yes .     why me .     because i liked you .  because i thought you were funny .      funny .      well  odd  if you like that better .  you always worked so hard not to look at me  but you always looked at me anyway .  you tried to hate me and i could see you wanted me .  i was sorry for you a little  i think .     what were you sorry about .   ue felt his cheeks burning .    that you should have such trouble about wanting me .  it s such a simple thing .  you just ask a girl .  it s so easy to be friendly .  why suffer .    harlan nodded .  the morality of the    nd .   just ask a girl   he muttered .   so simple .  nothing more necessary .     the girl has to be willing  of course .  mostly she is  if she s not otherwise engaged .  why not .  it s simple enough .    it was harlan s turn to drop his eyes .  of course  it was simple enough .  and nothing wrong with it  either .  not in the    nd .  who in eternity should know this better .  he would be a fool  an utter and unspeakable fool  to ask her now about earlier affairs .  he might as well ask a girl of his own homewhen if she had ever eaten in the presence of a man and how dared she .   instead he said humbly   and what do you think of me now .     that you are very nice   she said softly   and that if you ever relaxed   won t you smile .     there s nothing to smile about  noys .      please  .  i want to see if your cheeks can crease right .  let s see .   she put her fingers to the corners of his mouth and pressed them backward .  he jerked his head back in surprise and couldn t avoid smiling .    see .  your cheeks didn t even crack .  you re almost handsome .  with enough practice  standing in front of a mirror and smiling and getting a twinkle in your eye  i ll bet you could be really handsome .    but the smile  fragile enough to begin with  vanished .   noys said   we  are  in trouble  aren t we .     yes  we are  noys .  great trouble .     because of what we did .  you and i .  that evening .     not really .     that was my fault  you know .  i ll tell them so  if you wish .     never    said harlan with energy .   don t take on any fault in this .  you ve done nothing   nothing   to be guilty for .  it s something else .    noys looked uneasily at the temporometer .   where are we .  i can t even see the numbers .      when  are we .   harlan corrected her automatically .  he slowed the velocity and the centuries came into view .   her beautiful eyes widened and the lashes stood out against the whiteness of her skin .   is that  right .     harlan looked at the indicator casually .  it was in the        s .   i m sure it is .     but where are we going .     to  when  are we going .  to the far upwhen   he said  grimly .   good and far .  where they won t find you .    and in silence they watched the numbers mount .  in silence harlan told himself over and over that the girl was innocent of finge s charge .  she had owned up frankly to its partial truth and she had admitted  just as frankly  the presence of a more personal attraction .   he looked up  then  as noys shifted position .  she had moved to his side of the kettle and  with a resolute gesture  brought the kettle to a halt at a most uncomfortable temporal deceleration .   harlan gulped and closed his eyes to let the nausea pass .  he said   what s the matter .    she looked ashen and for a moment made no reply .  then she said   i don t want to go any further .  the numbers are so high .    the temporometer read          .   he said   far enough .    then he held out his hand gravely   come  noys .  this will be your home for a while .        they wandered through the corridors like children  hand in hand .  the lights along the mainways were on  and the darkened rooms blazed at the touch of a contact .  the air was fresh and had a liveliness about it which  without sensible draft  yet indicated the presence of ventilation .   noys whispered   is there no one here .     no one   said harlan .  he tried to say it firmly and loudly .  he wanted to break the spell of being in a  hidden century   but he said it in only a whisper after all .   he did not even know how to refer to anything so far upwhen .  to call it the one one one three ninety fourth was ridiculous .  one would have to say simply and indefinitely   the hundred thousands .    it was a foolish problem to be concerned with  but now that the exaltation of actual flight was done with  he found himself alone in a region of eternity where no human footsteps had wandered and he did not like it .  he was ashamed  doubly ashamed since noys was witness  at the fact that the faint chill within him was the faint chill of a faint fear .   noys said   it s so clean .  there s no dust .     self cleaning   said harlan .  with an effort that seemed to tear at his vocal cords he raised his voice to near normal level .   but no one s here  upwhen or downwhen for thousands and thousands of centuries .    noys seemed to accept that .   and everything is fixed up so .  we passed food stores and a viewing film library .  did you see that .     i saw that .  oh  it s fully equipped .  they re all fully equipped .  every section .     but why  if no one ever comes here .     it s logical   said harlan .  talking about it took away some of the eeriness .  saying out loud what he already knew in the abstract would pin point the matter  bring it down to the level of the prosaic .  he said   early in the history of eternity  one of the centuries in the     s came up with a mass duplicator .  do you know what i mean .  by setting up a resonating field  energy could be converted to matter with subatomic particles taking up precisely the same pattern of positions  within the uncertainty requirements  as those in the model being used .  the result is an exact copy .    we in eternity commandeered the instrument for our own purposes .  at that time  there were only about six or seven hundred sections built up .  we had plans for expansion  of course .   ten new sections a physioyear  was one of the slogans of the time .  the mass duplicator made that all unnecessary .  we built one new section complete with food  power supply  water supply  all the best automatic features  set up the machine and duplicated the section once each century all along eternity .  i don t know how long they kept it going  millions of centuries  probably .     all like this  andrew .     all exactly like this .  and as eternity expands  we just fill in  adapting the construction to whatever fashion turns out to be current in the century .  the only troubles come when we hit an energy centered century .  we  we haven t reached this section yet .    no use telling her that the eternals couldn t penetrate into time here in the hidden centuries .  what difference did that make .    he glanced at her and she seemed troubled .  he said hastily   there s no waste involved in building the sections .  it took energy  nothing more  and with the nova to draw on     she interrupted .   no .  i just don t remember .     remember what .     you said the duplicator was invented in the     s .  we don t have it in the    nd .  i don t remember viewing anything about it in history .    harlan grew thoughtful .  although she was within two inches of being as tall as himself  he suddenly felt giant size by comparison .  she was a child  an infant  and he was a demigod of eternity who must teach her and lead her carefully to the truth .   he said   noys  dear  let s find a place to sit down and  and i ll have to explain something .        the concept of a variable reality  a reality that was not fixed and eternal and immutable was not one that could be faced casually by anyone .   in the dead of the sleep period  sometimes  harlan would remember the early days of his cubhood and recall the wrenching attempts to divorce himself from his century and from time .   it took six months for the average cub to learn all the truth  to discover that he could never go home again in a very literal way .  it wasn t eternity s law  alone  that stopped him  but the frigid fact that home as he knew it might very well no longer exist  might  in a sense  never have existed .   it affected cubs differently .  harlan remembered bonky latourette s face turning white and gaunt the day instructor yarrow had finally made it unmistakably clear about reality .   none of the cubs ate that night .  they huddled together in search of a kind of psychic warmth  all except latourette  who had disappeared .  there was a lot of false laughter and miserably poor joking .   someone said with a voice that was tremulous and uncertain   i suppose i never had a mother .  if i go back into the   th  they d say   who are you .  we don t know you .  we don t have any records of you .  you don t exist .     they smiled weakly and nodded their heads  lonely boys with nothing left but eternity .   they found latourette at bedtime  sleeping deeply and breathing shallowly .  there was the slight reddening of a spray injection in the hollow of his left elbow and fortunately that was noted too .   yarrow was called and for a while it looked as though one cub would be out of the course  but he was brought around eventually .  a week later he was back in his seat .  yet the mark of that evil night was on his personality for as long as harlan knew him thereafter .   and now harlan had to explain reality to noys lambent  a girl not much older than those cubs  and explain it at once and in full .  he had to .  there was no choice about that .  she must learn exactly what faced them and exactly what she would have to do .   he told her .  they ate canned meats  chilled fruits  and milk at a long conference table designed to hold twelve  and there he told her .   he did it as gently as possible  but he scarcely found need for gentleness .  she snapped quickly at every concept and before he was half through it was borne in upon him  to his great amazement  that she wasn t reacting badly .  she wasn t afraid .  she showed no sense of loss .  she only seemed angry .   the anger reached her face and turned it a glowing pink while her dark eyes seemed somehow the darker for it .    but that s criminal   she said .   who are the eternals to do this .     it s done for humanity s good   said harlan .  of course  she couldn t really understand that .  he felt sorry for the time bound thinking of a timer .    is it .  i suppose that s how the mass duplicator was wiped out .     we have copies still .  don t worry about that .  we ve preserved it .      you ve  preserved it .  but what about us .  we of the    nd might have had it .   she gestured with little movements of two clenched fists .    it wouldn t have done you good .  look  don t be excited  dear  and listen .   with an almost convulsive gesture  he would have to learn how to touch her naturally  without making the movement seem a sheepish invitation to a repulse  he took her hands in his and held them tightly .   for a moment she tried to free them  and then she relaxed .  she even laughed a bit .   oh  go ahead  silly  and don t look so solemn .  i m not blaming you .     you mustn t blame anyone .  there is no blame necessary .  we do what must be done .  that mass duplicator is a classic case .  i studied it in school .  when you duplicate mass  you can duplicate persons  too .  the problems that arise are very complicated .     isn t it up to the society to solve its own problems .     it is  but we studied that society throughout time and it doesn t solve the problem satisfactorily .  remember that its failure to do so affects not only itself but all its descendant societies .  in fact  there is no satisfactory solution to the mass duplicator problem .  it s one of those things like atomic wars and dreamies that just can t be allowed .  developments are never satisfactory .     what makes you so sure .     we have our computing machines  noys  computaplexes far more accurate than any ever developed in any single reality .  these compute the possible realities and grade the desirabilities of each over a summation of thousands and thousands of variables .     machines .   she said it with scorn .   harlan frowned  then relented hastily .   now don t be like that .  naturally  you resent learning that life is not as solid as you thought .  you and the world you lived in might have been only a probability shadow a year ago  but what s the difference .  you have all your memories  whether they re of probability shadows or not  haven t you .  you remember your childhood and your parents  don t you .     of course .     then it s just as if you lived it  isn t it .  isn t it .  i mean  whether you did or not .     i don t know .  i ll have to think about it .  what if tomorrow it s a dream world again  or a shadow  or whatever you call it .     then there would be a new reality and a new you with new memories .  it would be just as though nothing had happened  except that the sum of human happiness would have been increased again .     i don t find that satisfying  somehow .     besides   said harlan hastily   nothing will happen to you now .  there  will  be a new reality but you re in eternity .  you won t be changed .     but you say it makes no difference   said noys gloomily .   why go to all the trouble .    with sudden ardor harlan said   because i want you as you are .  exactly as you are .  i don t want you changed .  not in anyway .    he came within a hair of blurting out the truth  that without the advantage of the superstition about eternals and eternal life she would never have inclined toward him .   she said  looking about with a slight frown   will i have to stay here forever  then .  it would be  lonely .     no  no .  don t think it   he said wildly  gripping her hands so tight that she winced .   i ll find out what you will be in the new reality of the    nd  and you ll go back in disguise  so to speak .  i ll take care of you .  i ll apply for permission for formal liaison and see to it that you remain safely through future changes .  i m a technician and a good one and i know about changes .   he added grimly   and i know a few other things as well   and stopped there .   noys said   is all this allowed .  i mean  can you take people into eternity and keep them from changing .  it doesn t sound right  somehow  from the things you ve told me .    for a moment harlan felt shrunken and cold in the large emptiness of the thousands of centuries that surrounded him upwhen and down .  for a moment he felt cut off even from the eternity that was his only home and only faith  doubly cast out from time and eternity  and only the woman for whom he had forsaken it all left at his side .   he said  and he meant it deeply   no  it is a crime .  it is a very great crime  and i am bitterly ashamed .  but i would do it again  if i had to  and any number of times  if i had to .     for me  andrew .  for me .    he did not raise his eyes to hers .   no  noys  for myself .  i could not bear to lose you .    she said   and if we are caught  .   .   .    harlan knew the answer to that .  he knew the answer since that moment of insight in bed in the    nd  with noys sleeping at his side .  but  even yet  he dared not think of the wild truth .   he said   i am not afraid of anyone .  i have ways of protecting myself .  they don t imagine how much i know .          interlude    it was  looking back at it  an idyllic period that followed .  a hundred things took place in those physioweeks  and all confused itself inextricably in harlan s memory  later  making the period seem to have lasted much longer than it did .  the one idyllic thing about it was  of course  the hours he could spend with noys  and that cast a glow over everything else .   item one  at the    nd he slowly packed his personal effects  his clothing and films  most of all his beloved and tenderly handled newsmagazine volumes out of the primitive .  anxiously he supervised their return to his permanent station in the    th .   finge was at his elbow as the last of it was lifted into the freight kettle by maintenance men .   finge said  choosing his words with unerring triteness   leaving us  i see .   his smile was broad  but his lips were carefully held together so that only the barest trace of teeth showed .  he kept his hands clasped behind his back and his pudgy body teetered forward on the balls of his feet .   harlan did not look at his superior .  he muttered a monotoned  yes  sir .    finge said   i will report to senior computer twissell concerning the entirely satisfactory manner in which you performed your observational duties in the    nd .    harlan could not bring himself to utter even a sullen word of thanks .  he remained silent .   finge went on  in a suddenly much lower voice   i will not report  for the present  your recent attempt at violence against me .   and although his smile remained and his glance remained mild  there was a relish of cruel satisfaction about him .   harlan looked up sharply and said   as you wish  computer .        item two  he re established himself at the    th .   he met twissell almost at once .  he found himself happy to see that little body  topped by that lined and gnomelike face .  he was even happy to see the white cylinder nestling smokily between two stained fingers and being lifted rapidly toward twissell s lips .   harlan said   computer .    twissell  emerging from his office  looked for a moment unseeingly and unrecognizingly at harlan .  his face was haggard and his eyes squinted with weariness .   he said   ah  technician harlan .  you are done with your work in the    nd .     yes  sir .    twissell s comment was strange .  he looked at his watch  which  like any watch in eternity  was geared to physiotime  giving the day number as well as the time of day  and said   on the nose  my boy  on the nose .  wonderful .  wonderful .    harlan felt his heart give a small bound .  when he had last seen twissell he would not have been able to make sense of that remark .  now he thought he did .  twissell was tired  or he would not have spoken so close to the core of things  perhaps .  or the computer might have felt the remark to be so cryptic as to feel safe despite its closeness to the core .   harlan said  speaking ascasually as he could to avoid letting it seem that his remark had any connection at all with what twissell had just said   how s my cub .     fine  fine   said twissell  with only half his mind  apparently  on his words .  he took a quick puff at the shortening tube of tobacco  indulged in a quick nod of dismissal  and hurried off .       item three  the cub .   he seemed older .  there seemed to be a greater feeling of maturity to him as he held out his hand and said   glad to see you back  harlan .    or was it merely that  where earlier harlan had been conscious of cooper only as a pupil  he now seemed more than a cub .  he now seemed a gigantic instrument in the hands of the eternals .  naturally he could not help but attain a new stature in harlan s eyes .   harlan tried not to show that .  they were in harlan s own quarters  and the technician basked in the creamy porcelain surfaces about him  glad to be out of the ornate splash of the    nd .  try as he might to associate the wild baroque of the    nd with noys  he only succeeded in associating it with finge .  with noys he associated a pink  satiny twilight and  strangely  the bare austerity of the sections of the hidden centuries .   he spoke hastily  almost as though he were anxious to hide his dangerous thoughts .   well  cooper  what have they been doing with you while i was away .    cooper laughed  brushed his drooping mustache self consciously with one finger and said   more math .  always math .     yes .  pretty advanced stuff by now  i guess .     pretty advanced .     how s it coming .     so far it s bearable .  it comes pretty easy  you know .  i like it .  but now they re really loading it on .    harlan nodded and felt a certain satisfaction .  he said   temporal field matrices and all that .    but cooper  his color a little high  turned toward the stacked volumes in the bookshelves  and said   let s get back to the primitives .  i ve got some questions .     about what .     city life in the   rd .  los angeles  especially .     why los angeles .     it s an interesting city .  don t you think so .     it is  but let s hit it in the   st  then .  it was at its peak in the   st .     oh  let s try the   rd .    harlan said   well  why not .    his face was impassive  but if the impassiveness could have been peeled off  there would have been a grimness about him .  his grand  intuitional guess was more than a guess .  everything was checking neatly .       item four  research .  twofold research .   for himself  first .  each day  with ferreting eyes  he went through the reports on twissell s desk .  the reports concerned the various reality changes being scheduled or suggested .  copies went to twissell routinely since he was a member of the allwhen council  and harlan knew he would not miss one .  he looked first for the coming change in the    nd .  secondly he looked for other changes  any other changes  that might have a flaw  an imperfection  some deviation from maximum excellence that might be visible to his own trained and talented technician s eyes .   in the strictest sense of the word the reports were not for his study  but twissell was rarely in his office these days  and no one else saw fit to interfere with twissell s personal technician .   that was one part of his research .  the other took place in the    th section branch of the library .   for the first time he ventured out of those portions of the library which  ordinarily  monopolized his attention .  in the past he had haunted the section on primitive history  very poor indeed  so that most of his references and source materials had to be derived from the far downwhen of the  rd millennium  as was only natural  of course  .  to an even greater extent he had ransacked the shelves devoted to reality change  its theory  technique  and history  an excellent collection  best in eternity outside the central branch itself  thanks to twissell  of which he had made himself full master .   now he wandered curiously among the other film racks .  for the first time he observed  in the capital o sense  the racks devoted to the    th itself  its geographies  which varied little from reality to reality  its histories  which varied more  and its sociologies  which varied still more .  these were not the books or reports written about the century by observing and computing eternals  with those he was familiar   but by the timers themselves .   there were the works of literature of the    th and these stirred memories of tremendous arguments he had heard of concerning the values of alternate changes .  would this masterpiece be altered or not .  if so  how .  how did past changes affect works of art .   for that matter  could there ever be general agreement about art .  could it ever be reduced to quantitative terms amenable to mechanical evaluation by the computing machines .   a computer named august sennor was twissell s chief opponent in these matters .  harlan  stirred by twissell s feverish denunciations of the man and his views  had read some of sennor s papers and found them startling .   sennor asked publicly and  to harlan  disconcertingly  whether a new reality might not contain a personality within itself analogous to that of a man who had been withdrawn into eternity in a previous reality .  he analyzed then the possibility of an eternal meeting his analogue in time  either with or without knowing it  and speculated on the results in each case .   that came fairly close to one of eternity s most potent fears  and harlan shivered and hastened uneasily through the discussion .   and  of course  he discussed at length the fate of literature and art in various types and classifications of reality changes .   but twissell would have none of the last .   if the values of art can t be computed   he would shout at harlan   then what s the use of arguing about it .    and twissell s views  harlan knew  were shared by the large majority of the allwhen council .   yet now harlan stood at the shelves devoted to the novels of eric linkollew  usually described as the outstanding writer of the    th  and wondered .  he counted fifteen different  complete works  collections  each  undoubtedly  taken out of a different reality .  each was somewhat different  he was sure .  one set was noticeably smaller than all the others  for instance .  a hundred sociologists  he imagined  must have written analyses of the differences between the sets in terms of the sociological background of each reality  and earned status thereby .   harlan passed on to the wing of the library which was devoted to the devices and instrumentation of the various    th s .  many of these last  harlan knew  had been eliminated in time and remained intact  as a product of human ingenuity  only in eternity .  man had to be protected from his own too flourishing technical mind .  that more than anything else .  not a physioyear passed but that somewhere in time nuclear technology veered too close to the dangerous and had to be steered away .   he returned to the library proper and to the shelves on mathematics and mathematical histories .  his fingers skimmed across individual titles  and after some thought he took half a dozen from the shelves and signed them out .       item five  noys .   that was the really important part of the interlude  and all the idyllic part .   in his off hours  when cooper was gone  when he might ordinarily have been eating in solitude  reading in solitude  sleeping in solitude  waiting in solitude for the next day  he took to the kettles .   with all his heart he was grateful for the technician s position in society .  he was thankful  as he had never dreamed he could be  for the manner in which he was avoided .   no one questioned his right to be in a kettle  nor cared whether he aimed it upwhen or down .  no curious eyes followed him  no willing hands offered to help him  no chattering mouths discussed it with him .   he could go where and when he pleased .   noys said   you ve changed  andrew .  heavens  you ve changed .    he looked at her and smiled .   in what way  noys .     you re smiling  aren t you .  that s one of the ways .  don t you ever look in a mirror and see yourself smiling .     i m afraid to .  i d say   i can t be that happy .  i m sick .  i m delirious .  i m confined in an asylum  living in daydreams  and unaware of it .     noys leaned close to pinch him .   feel anything .    he drew her head toward him  felt bathed in her soft  black hair .   when they separated  she said breathlessly   you ve changed there  too .  you ve become very good at it .     i ve got a good teacher   began harlan  and stopped abruptly  fearing that would imply displeasure at the thought of the many who might have had the making of such a good teacher .   but her laugh seemed untroubled by such a thought .  they had eaten and she looked silky smooth and warmly soft in the clothing he had brought her .   she followed his eyes and fingered the skirt gently  lifting it loose from its soft embrace of her thigh .  she said   i wish you wouldn t  andrew .  i really wish you wouldn t .     there s no danger   he said carelessly .    there  is  danger .  now don t be foolish .  i can get along with what s here  until  until you make arrangements .     why shouldn t you have your own clothes and doodads .     because they re not worth your going to my house in time and being caught .  and what if they make the change while you re there .    he evaded that uneasily .   it won t catch me .   then  brightening   besides my wrist generator keeps me in physiotime so that a change can t affect me  you see .    noys sighed .   i don t see .  i don t think i ll ever understand it all .     there s nothing to it .   and harlan explained and explained with great animation and noys listened with sparkling eyes that never quite revealed whether she was entirely interested  or amused  or  perhaps  a little of both .   it was a great addition to harlan s life .  there was someone to talk to  someone with whom to discuss his life  his deeds  and thoughts .  it was as though she were a portion of himself  but a portion sufficiently separate to require speech in communication rather than thought .  she was a portion sufficiently separate to be able to answer unpredictably out of independent thought processes .  strange  harlan thought  how one might observe a social phenomenon such as matrimony and yet miss so vital a truth about it .  could he have predicted in advance  for instance  that it would be the passionate interludes that he would later least often associate with the idyl .   she snuggled into the crook of his arm and said   how is your mathematics coming along .    harlan said   want to look at a piece of it .     don t tell me you carry it around with you .         why not .  the kettle trip takes time .  no use wasting it  you know .    he disengaged himself  took a small viewer from his pocket  inserted the film  and smiled fondly as she put it to her eyes .   she returned the viewer to him with a shake of her head .   i never saw so many squiggles .  i wish i could read your standard intertemporal .     actually   said harlan   most of the squiggles you mention aren t intertemporal really  just mathematical notation .     you understand it  though  don t you .    harlan hated to do anything to disillusion the frank admiration in her eyes  but he was forced to say   not as much as i d like to .  still  i have been picking up enough math to get what i want .  i don t have to understand everything to be able to see a hole in a wall big enough to push a freight kettle through .    he tossed the viewer into the air  caught it with a flick of his hand  and put it on a small end table .   noys s eyes followed it hungrily and sudden insight flashed on harlan .   he said   father time .  you can t read intertemporal  at that .     no .  of course not .     then the section library here is useless to you .  i never thought of that .  you ought to have your own films from the    nd .    she said quickly   no .  i don t want any .    he said   you ll have them .     honestly  i don t want them .  it s silly to risk        you ll have them .   he said .       for the last time he stood at the immaterial boundary separating eternity from noys s house in the    nd .  he had intended the time before to be the last time .  the change was nearly upon them now  a fact he had not told noys out of the decent respect he would have had for anyone s feelings  let alone those of his love .   yet it wasn t a difficult decision to make  this one additional trip .  partly it was bravado  to shine before noys  bring her the book films from out the lion s mouth  partly it was a hot desire  what was the primitive phrase .    to singe the beard of the king of spain   if he might refer to the smooth checked finge so .   then  too  he would have the chance once again of savoring the weirdly attractive atmosphere about a doomed house .   he had felt it before  when entering it carefully during the period of grace allowed by the spatio temporal charts .  he had felt it as he wandered through its rooms  collecting clothing  small  objets d art   strange containers  and instruments from noys s vanity table .   there was the somber silence of a doomed reality that was past merely the physical absence of noise .  there was no way for harlan to predict its analogue in a new reality .  it might be a small suburban cottage or a tenement in a city street .  it might be zero with untamed scrubland replacing the parklike terrain on which it now stood .  it might  conceivably  be almost unchanged .  and  harlan touched on this thought gingerly  it might be inhabited by the analogue of noys or  of course  it might not .   to harlan the house was already a ghost  a premature specter that had begun its hauntings before it had actually died .  and because the house  as it was  meant a great deal to him  he found he resented its passing and mourned it .   once  only  in five trips had there been any sound to break the stillness during his prowlings .  he was in the pantry  then  thankful that the technology of that reality and century had made servants unfashionable and removed a problem .  he had  he recalled  chosen among the cans of prepared foods  and was just deciding that he had enough for one trip  and that noys would be pleased indeed to intersperse the hearty but uncolorful basic diet provided in the empty section with some of her own dietary .  he even laughed aloud to think that not long before he had thought her diet decadent .   it was in the middle of the laugh that he heard a distinct clapping noise .  he froze .   the sound had come from somewhere behind him  and in the startled moment during which he had not moved the lesser danger that it was a housebreaker occurred to him first and the greater danger of its being an investigating eternal occurred second .   it  couldn t  be a housebreaker .  the entire period of the spatio temporal chart  grace period and all  had been painstakingly cleared and chosen out of other similar periods of time because of the lack of complicating factors .  on the other hand  he had introduced a micro change  perhaps not so micro at that  by abstracting noys .   heart pounding  he forced himself to turn .  it seemed to him that the door behind him had just closed  moving the last millimeter required to bring it flush with the wall .   he repressed the impulse to open that door  to search the house .  with noys s delicacies in tow he returned to eternity and waited two full days for repercussions before venturing into the far upwhen .  there were none and eventually he forgot the incident .   but now  as he adjusted the controls to enter time this one last time  he thought of it again .  or perhaps it was the thought of the change  nearly upon him now  that preyed on him .  looking back on the moment later on  he felt that it was one or the other that caused him to misadjust the controls .  he could think of no other excuse .   the misadjustment was not immediately apparent .  it pin pointed the proper room and harlan stepped directly into noys s library .   he had become enough of a decadent himself  now  to be not altogether repelled by the workmanship that went into the design of the film cases .  the lettering of the titles blended in with the intricate filigree until they were attractive but nearly unreadable .  it was a triumph of aesthetics over utility .   harlan took a few from the shelves at random and was surprised .  the title of one was  social and economic history of our times  .   somehow it was a side of noys to which he had given little thought .  she was certainly not stupid and yet it never occurred to him that she might be interested in weighty things .  he had the impulse to scan a bit of the  social and economic history   but fought it down .  he would find it in the section library of the    nd  if he ever wanted it .  finge had undoubtedly rifled the libraries of this reality for eternity s records months earlier .   he put that film to one side  ran through the rest  selected the fiction and some of what seemed light non fiction .  those and two pocket viewers .  he stowed them carefully into a knapsack .   it was at that point that  once more  he heard a sound in the house .  there was no mistake this time .  it was not a short sound of indeterminate origin .  it was a langh  a man s laugh .  he was  not  alone in the house .   he was unaware that he had dropped the knapsack .  for one dizzy second he could think only that he was trapped .          trapped .     all at once it had seemed inevitable .  it was the rawest dramatic irony .  he had entered time one last time  tweaked finge s nose one last time  brought the pitcher to the well one last time .  it had to be then that he was caught .   was it finge who laughed .   who else would track him down  lie in wait  stay a room away  and burst into mirth .   well  then  was all lost .  and because in that sickening moment he was sure all was lost it did not occur to him to run again or to attempt flight into eternity once more .  he would face finge .   he would kill him  if necessary .   harlan stepped to the door from behind which the laugh had sounded  stepped to it with the soft  firm step of the premeditated murderer .  he flicked loose the automatic door signal and opened it by hand .  two inches .  three .  it moved without sound .   the man in the next room had his back turned .  the figure seemed too tall to be finge and that fact penetrated harlan s simmering mind and kept him from advancing further .   then  as though the paralysis that seemed to hold both men in rigor was slowly lifting  the other turned  inch by inch .   harlan never witnessed the completion of that turn .  the other s profile had not yet come into view when harlan  holding back a sudden gust of terror with a last fragment of moral strength  flung himself back out the door .  its mechanism  not harlan  closed it soundlessly .   harlan fell back blindly .  he could breathe only by struggling violently with the atmosphere  fighting air in and pushing it out  while his heart beat madly as though in an effort to escape his body .   finge  twissell  all the council together could not have disconcerted him so much .  it was the fear of nothing physical that had unmanned him .  rather it was an almost instinctive loathing for the nature of the accident that had befallen him .   he gathered the stack of book films to himself in a formless lump and managed  after two futile tries  to re establish the door to eternity .  he stepped through  his legs operating mechanically .  somehow he made his way to the    th  and then to personal quarters .  his technicianhood  newly valued  newly appreciated  saved him once again .  the few eternals he met turned automatically to one side and looked steadfastly over his head as they did so .   that was fortunate  for he lacked any ability to smooth his face out of the death s head grimace he felt he was wearing  or any power to put the blood back into it .  but they didn t look  and he thanked time and eternity and whatever blind thing wove destiny for that .   he had not truly recognized the other man in noys s house by his appearance  yet he knew his identity with a dreadful certainty .   the first time harlan had heard a noise in the house he  harlan  had been laughing and the sound that interrupted his laugh was of something weighty dropping in the next room .  the second time someone had laughed in the next room and he  harlan  had dropped a knapsack of book films .  the first time he  harlan  had turned and caught sight of a door closing .  the second time he  harlan  closed a door as a stranger turned .   he had met himself .   in the same time and nearly in the same place he and his earlier self by several physiodays had nearly stood face to face .  he had misadjusted the controls  set if for an instant in time which he had already used and he  harlan  had seen him  harlan .       he had gone about his work with the shadow of horror upon him for days thereafter .  he cursed himself for a coward  but that did not help .   indeed from that moment matters took a downward trend .  he could put his finger on the great divide .  the key moment was the instant in which he had adjusted the door controls for his entry into the    nd for one last time and somehow had adjusted it wrongly .  since then things went badly  badly .   the reality change in the    nd went through during that period of despondency and accentuated it .  in the past two weeks he had picked up three proposed reality changes which contained minor flaws  and now he chose among them  yet could do nothing to move himself to action .   he chose reality change            v   for a number of reasons .  of the three  it was farthest upwhen  the most distant .  the error was minute  but was significant in terms of human life .  it needed  then  only a quick trip to the     th to find out the nature of noys s analogue in the new reality  by use of a little blackmailing pressure .   but the unmanning of his recent experience betrayed him .  it seemed to him no longer a simple thing  this gentle application of threatened exposure .  and once he found the nature of noys s analogue  what then .  put noys in her place as charwoman  seamstress  laborer  or whatever .  certainly .  but what  then  was to be done with the analogue herself .  with any husband the analogue might have .  family .  children .   he had thought of none of this earlier .  he had avoided the thought .   sufficient unto the day  .   .   .    but now he could think of nothing else .   so he lay skulking in his room  hating himself  when twissell called him  his tired voice questioning and a little puzzled .    harlan  are you ill .  cooper tells me you ve skipped several discussion periods .    harlan tried to smooth the trouble out of his face .   no  computer twissell .  i m a little tired .     well  that s forgivable  at any rate  boy .   and then the smile on his face came about as close as it ever did to vanishing entirely .   have you heard that the    nd has been changed .     yes   said harlan shortly .    finge called me   said twissell   and asked that you be told that the change was entirely successful .    harlan shrugged  then grew aware of twissell s eyes staring out of the communiplate and hard upon him .  he grew uneasy and said   yes  computer .     nothing   said twissell  and perhaps it was the cloak of age weighing down upon his shoulders  but his voice was unaccountably sad .   i thought you were about to speak .     no   said harlan .   i had nothing to say .     well  then  i ll see you tomorrow at opening in the computing room  boy .  i have a great deal to say .     yes  sir   said harlan .  he stared for long minutes at the plate after it went dark .   that had almost sounded like a threat .  finge had called twissell  had he .  what had he said that twissell did not report .   but an outside threat was what he needed .  battling a sickness of the spirit was like standing in a quicksand and beating it with a stick .  battling finge was another thing altogether .  harlan had remembered the weapon at his disposal and for the first time in days felt a fraction of self confidence return .       it was as though a door had closed and another had opened .  harlan grew as feverishly active as previously he had been catatonic .  he traveled to the     th and bludgeoned sociologist voy to his own exact will .   he did it perfectly .  he got the information he sought .   and more than he sought .  much more .   confidence is rewarded  apparently .  there was a homewhen proverb that went   grip the nettle firmly and it will become a stick with which to beat your enemy .    in short  noys had no analogue in the new reality .  no analogue at all .  she could take her position in the new society in the most inconspicuous and convenient manner possible  or she could stay in eternity .  there could be no reason to deny him liaison except for the highly theoretical fact that he had broken the law  and he knew very well how to counter that argument .   so he went racing upwhen to tell noys the great news  to bathe in undreamed of success after a few days horrible with apparent failure .   and at this moment the kettle came to a halt .   it did not slow  it simply halted .  if the motion had been one along any of the three dimensions of space  a halt that sudden would have smashed the kettle  brought its metal to a dull red heat  turned harlan into a thing of broken bone and wet  crushed flesh .   as it was  it merely doubled him with nausea and cracked him with inner pain .   when he could see  he fumbled to the temporometer and stared at it with fuzzy vision .  it read         .   somehow that frightened him .  it was too round a number .   he turned feverishly to the controls .  what had gone wrong .   that frightened him too  for he could see nothing wrong .  nothing had tripped the drive lever .  it remained firmly geared into the upwhen drive .  there was no short circuit .  all the indicator dials were in the black safety range .  there was no power failure .  the tiny needle that marked the steady consumption of meg megcoulombs of power calmly insisted that power was being consumed at the usual rate .   what  then  had stopped the kettle .   slowly  and with considerable reluctance  harlan touched the drivelever  curled his hand about it .  he pushed it to neutral  and the needle on the power gauge declined to zero .   he twisted the drive lever back in the other direction .  up went the power gauge again  and this time the temporometer flicked downwhen along the line of centuries .   downwhen  downwhen                            again harlan shifted the lever .  upwhen again .  slowly .  very slowly .   then                                                    smash .  nothing past         .  the power of nova sol was silently being consumed  at an incredible rate  to no purpose .   he went downwhen again  farther .  he roared upwhen .  smash .   his teeth were clenched  his lips drawn back  his breath rasping .  he felt like a prisoner hurling himself bloodily against the bars of a prison .   when he stopped  a dozen smashes later  the kettle rested firmly at         .  thus far  and no farther .   he would change kettles .   but there was not much hope in that thought .    in the empty silence of the        th century  andrew harlan stepped out of one kettle and chose another kettle shaft at random .   a minute later  with the drive lever in his hand  he stared at the marking of         and knew that here  too  he could not pass .   he raged .  now .  at this time .  when things so unexpectedly had broken in his favor  to come to so sudden a disaster .  the curse of that moment of misjudgment in entering the    nd was still on him .   savagely he spun the lever downwhen  pressing it hard at maximum and keeping it there .  at least in one way he was free now  free to do anything he wanted .  with noys cut off behind a barrier and out of his reach  what more could they do to him .  what more had he to fear .   he carried himself to the    th and sprang from the kettle with a reckless disregard for his surroundings that he had never felt before .  he made his way to the section library  speaking to no one  regarding no one .  he took what he wanted without glancing about to see if he were observed .  what did he care .   back to the kettle and downwhen again .  he knew exactly what he would do .  he looked at the large clock as he passed  measuring off standard physiotime  numbering the days and marking off the three coequal work shifts of the physioday .  finge would be at his private quarters now  and that was so much the better .   harlan felt as though he were running a temperature when he arrived at the    nd .  his mouth was dry and cottony .  his chest hurt .  but he felt the hard shape of the weapon under his shirt as he held it firmly against his side with one elbow and that was the only sensation that counted .       assistant computer hobbe finge looked up at harlan  and the surprise in his eyes slowly gave way to concern .   harlan watched him silently for a while  letting the concern grow and waiting for it to change to fear .  he circled slowly  getting between finge and the communiplate .   finge was partly undressed  bare to the waist .  his chest was sparsely haired  his breasts puffy and almost womanish .  his tubby abdomen lapped over his waistband .   he looks undignified  thought harlan with satisfaction  undignified and unsavory .  so much the better .   he put his right hand inside his shirt and closed it firmly on the grip of his weapon .   harlan said   no one saw me  finge  so don t look toward the door .  no one s coming here .  you ve got to realize  finge  that you re dealing with a technician .  do you know what that means .    his voice was hollow .  he felt angry that fear wasn t entering finge s eyes  only concern .  finge even reached for his shirt and  without a word  began to put it on .   harlan went on   do you know the privilege of being a technician  finge .  you ve never been one  so you can t appreciate it .  it means no one watches where you go or what you do .  they all look the other way and work so hard at not seeing you that they really succeed at it .  i could  for instance  go to the section library  finge  and help myself to any curious thing while the librarian busily concerns himself with his records and sees nothing .  i can walk down the residential corridors of the    nd and anyone passing turns out of my way and will swear later on he saw no one .  it s that automatic .  so you see  i can do what i want to do  go where i want to go .  i can walk into the private apartments of the assistant computer of a section and force him to tell the truth at weapon point and there ll be no one to stop me .    finge spoke for the first time .   what are you holding .     a weapon   said harlan  and brought it out .   do you recognize it .   its muzzle flared slightly and ended in a smooth metallic bulge .    if you kill me .   .   .   began finge .    i won t kill you   said harlan .   at a recent meeting you had a blaster .  this is not a blaster .  it is an invention of one of the past realities of the    th .  perhaps you are not acquainted with it .  it was bred out of reality .  too nasty .  it can kill  but at low power it activates the pain centers of the nerve system and paralyzes as well .  it is called  or was called  a neuronic whip .  it works .  this one is fully charged .  i tested it on a finger .   he held up his left hand with its stiffened little finger .   it was very unpleasant .    finge stirred restlessly .   what is all this about  for time s sake .     there is some sort of a block across the kettle shafts at the        th .  i want it removed .     a block across the shafts .     let s not work away at being surprised .  yesterday you spoke to twissell .  today there is the block .  i want to know what you said to twissell .  i want to know what s been done and what will be done .  by time  computer  if you don t tell me  i ll use the whip .  try me  if you doubt my word .     now listen   finge s words slurred a bit and the first edge of fear made its appearance  and also a kind of desperate anger   if you want the truth  it s this .  we know about you and noys .    harlan s eyes flickered .   what about myself and noys .    finge said   did you think you were getting away with anything .   the computer kept his eyes fixed on the neuronic whip and his forehead was beginning to glisten .   by time  with the emotion you showed after your period of observation  with what you did during the period of observation  did you think we wouldn t observe you .  i would deserve to be broken as computer if i had missed that .  we know you brought noys into eternity .  we knew it from the first .  you wanted the truth .  there it is .    at that moment harlan despised his own stupidity .   you knew .     yes .  we knew you had brought her to the hidden centuries .  we knew every time you entered the    nd to supply her with appropriate luxuries  playing the fool  with your eternal s oath completely forgotten .     then why didn t you stop me .   harlan was tasting the very dregs of his own humiliation .    do you still want the truth .   finge flashed back  and seemed to gain courage in proportion as harlan sank into frustration .    go on .     then let me tell you that i didn t consider you a proper eternal from the start .  a flashy observer  perhaps  and a technician who went through the motions .  but no eternal .  when i brought you here on this last job  it was to prove as much to twissell  who values you for some obscure reason .  i wasn t just testing the society in the person of the girl  noys .  i was testing you  too  and you failed as i thought you would fail .  now put away that weapon  that whip  whatever it is  and get out of here .     and you came to my personal quarters once   said harlan breathlessly  working hard to keep his dignity and feeling it slip from him as though his mind and spirit were as stiff and unfeeling as the whiplashed little finger on his left hand   to goad me into doing what i did .     yes  of course .  if you want the phrase exactly  i tempted you .  i told you the exact truth  that you could keep noys only in the thenpresent reality .  you chose to act  not as an eternal  but as a sniveler .  i expected you to .     i would do it again now   said harlan gruffly   and since it s all known  you can see i have nothing to lose .   he thrust his whip outward toward finge s plump waistline and spoke through pale lips and clenched teeth .   what has happened to noys .     i have no idea .     don t tell me that .  what has happened to noys .     i tell you i don t know .    harlan s fist tightened on the whip  his voice was low .   your leg first .  this will hurt .     for time s sake  listen .  wait .     all right .  what has happened to her .     no  listen .  so far it s just a breach of discipline .  reality wasn t affected .  i made checks on that .  loss of rating is all you ll get .  if you kill me  though  or hurt me with intent to kill  you ve attacked a superior .  there s the death penalty for that .    harlan smiled at the futility of the threat .  in the face of what had already happened death would offer a way out that in finality and simplicity had no equal .   finge obviously misunderstood the reasons for the smile .  he said hurriedly   don t think there s no death penalty in eternity because you ve never come across one .  we know of them  we computers .  what s more  executions have taken place  too .  it s simple .  in any reality  there are numbers of fatal accidents in which bodies are not recovered .  rockets explode in mid air  aeroliners sink in mid ocean or crash to powder in mountains .  a murderer can be put on one of those vessels minutes  or seconds  before the fatal results .  is this worth that to you .    harlan stirred and said   if you re stalling for rescue  it won t work .  let me tell you this  i m not afraid of punishment .  furthermore  i intend to have noys .  i want her now .  she does not exist in the current reality .  she has no analogue .  there is no reason why we cannot establish formal liaison .     it is against regulations for a technician        we will let the allwhen council decide   said harlan  and his pride broke through at last .   i am not afraid of an adverse decision  either  any more than i am afraid of killing you .  i am no ordinary technician .     because you are twissell s technician .   and there was a strange look on finge s round  sweating face that might have been hatred or triumph or part of each .   harlan said   for reasons much more important than that .  and now  .   .   .    with grim determination he touched finger to the weapon s activator .   finge screamed   then go to the council .  the allwhen council   they  know .  if you are that important      he ended  gasping .   for a moment harlan s finger hovered irresolutely .   what .     do you think i would take unilateral action in a case like this .  i reported this whole incident to the council  timing it with the reality change .  here .  here are the duplicates .     hold on  don t move .    but finge disregarded that order .  with a speed as from the spur of a possessing fiend finge was at his files .  the finger of one hand located the code combination of the record he wanted  the fingers of the other punched it into the file .  a silvery tongue of tape slithered out of the desk  its pattern of dots just visible to the naked eye .    do you want it sounded .   asked finge  and without waiting threaded it into the sounder .   harlan listened  frozen .  it was clear enough .  finge had reported in full .  he had detailed every motion of harlan s in the kettle shafts .  he hadn t missed one that harlan could remember up to the point of making the report .   finge shouted when the report was done   now  then  go to the council .  i ve put no block in time .  i wouldn t know how .  and don t think they re unconcerned about the matter .  you said i spoke to twissell yesterday .  you re right .  but i didn t call him  he called me .  so go  ask twissell .  tell them what an important technician you are .  and if you want to shoot me first  shoot and to time with you .    harlan could not miss the actual exultation in the computer s voice .  at that moment he obviously felt enough the victor to believe that even a neuronic whipping would leave him on the profit side of the ledger .   why .  was the breaking of harlan so dear to his heart .  was his jealousy over noys so all consuming a passion .   harlan did scarcely more than formulate the questions in his mind  and then the whole matter  finge and all  seemed suddenly meaningless to him .   he pocketed his weapon  whirled out the door  and toward the nearest kettle shaft .   it was the council  then  or twissell  at the very least .  he was afraid of none of them  nor of all put together .   with each passing day of the last unbelievable month he had grown more convinced of his own indispensability .  the council  even the allwhen council itself  would have no choice but to come to terms when it was a choice of bartering one girl for the existence of all of eternity .          full circle    it was with a dull surprise that technician andrew harlan  on bursting into the    th  found himself in the night shift .  the passing of the physiohours had gone unnoticed during his wild streaks along the kettle shafts .  he stared hollowly at the dimmed corridors  the occasional evidence of the thinned out night force at work .   but in the continued grip of his rage harlan did not pause long to watch uselessly .  he turned toward personal quarters .  he would find twissell s room on computer level as he had found finge s and he had as little fear of being noticed or stopped .   the neuronic whip was still hard against his elbow as he stopped before twissell s door  the name plate upon it advertising the fact in clear  inlaid lettering  .   harlan activated the door signal brashly on the buzzer level .  he shorted the contact with a damp palm and let the sound become continuous .  he could hear it dimly .   a step sounded lightly behind him and he ignored it in the sure knowledge that the man  whoever he was  would ignore him .   oh  rose red technician s patch .    but the sound of steps halted and a voice said   technician harlan .    harlan whirled .  it was a junior computer  relatively new to the section .  harlan raged inwardly .  this was not quite the    nd .  here he was not merely a technician  he was twissell s technician  and the younger computers  in their anxiety to ingratiate themselves with the great twissell  would extend a minimum civility to his technician .   the computer said   do you wish to see senior computer twissell .    harlan fidgeted and said   yes  sir .    the fool .  what did he think anyone would be standing signaling at a man s door for .  to catch a kettle .     i m afraid you can t   said the computer .    this is important enough to wake him   said harlan .    maybe so   said the other   but he s outwhen .  he s not in the    th .     exactly when is he  then .   asked harlan impatiently .   the computer s glance became a supercilious stare .   i wouldn t know .    harlan said   but i have an important appointment first thing in the morning .      you  have   said the computer  and harlan was at a loss to account for his obvious amusement at the thought .   the computer went on  even smiling now   you re a little early  aren t you .     but i must see him .     i m sure he ll be here in the morning .   the smile broadened .    but       the computer passed by harlan  carefully avoiding any contact  even of garments .   harlan s fists clenched and unclenched .  he stared helplessly after the computer and then  simply because there was nothing else to do  he walked slowly  and without full consciousness of his surroundings  back to his own room .       harlan slept fitfully .  he told himself he needed sleep .  he tried to relax by main force  and  of course  failed .  his sleep period was a succession of futile thought .   first of all  there was noys .   they would not dare harm her  he thought feverishly .  they could not send her back to time without first calculating the effect on reality and that would take days  probably weeks .  as an alternative  they might do to her what finge had threatened for him  place her in the path of an untraceable accident .   he did not take that into serious consideration .  there was no necessity for drastic action such as that .  they would not risk harlan s displeasure by doing it .   in the quiet of a darkened sleeping room  and in that phase of half sleep where things often grew queerly disproportionate in thought  harlan found nothing grotesque in his sure opinion that the allwhen council would not dare risk a technician s displeasure .    of course  there were uses to which a woman in captivity might be put .  a beautiful woman from a hedonistic reality .   resolutely harlan put the thought away as often as it returned .  it was at once more likely and more unthinkable than death  and he would have none of it .   he thought of twis sell .   the old man was out of the    th .  where was he during hours when he should have been asleep .  an old man needs his sleep .  harlan was sure of the answer .  there were council consultations going on .  about harlan .  about noys .  about what to do with an indispensable technician one dared not touch .   harlan s lips drew back .  if finge reported harlan s assault of that evening  it would not affect their considerations in the least .  his crimes could scarcely be worsened by it .  his indispensability would certainly not be lessened .   and harlan was by no means certain that finge  would  report him .  to admit having been forced to cringe before a technician would put an assistant computer in a ridiculous light  and finge might not choose to do so .   harlan thought of technicians as a group  which  of late  he had done rarely .  his own somewhat anomalous position as twissell s man and as half an educator had kept him too far apart from other technicians .  but technicians lacked solidarity anyway .  why should that be .   did he have to go through the    th and the    nd rarely seeing or speaking to another technician .  did they have to avoid even one another .  did they have to act as though they accepted the status into which the superstition of others forced them .   in his mind he had already forced the capitulation of the council as far as noys was concerned  and now he was making further demands .  the technicians were to be allowed an organization of their own  regular meetings  more friendship  better treatment from the others .   his final thought of himself was as a heroic social revolutionary  with noys at his side  when he sank finally into a dreamless sleep .   .       the door signal awoke him .  it whispered at him with hoarse impatience .  he collected his thoughts to the point of being able to look at the small clock beside his bed and groaned inwardly .   father time .  after all that he had overslept .   he managed to reach the proper button from bed and the viewsquare high on the door grew transparent .  he did not recognize the face  but it carried authority whoever it was .   he opened the door and the man  wearing the orange patch of administration  stepped in .    technician andrew harlan .     yes  administrator .  you have business with me .    the administrator seemed in no wise discommoded at the sharp belligerence of the question .  he said   you have an appointment with senior computer twissell .     well .     i am here to inform you that you are late .    harlan stared at him .   what s this all about .  you re not from the    th  are you .     the    nd is my station   said the other frigidly .   assistant administrator arbut lemm .  i m in charge of the arrangements and i m trying to avoid undue excitement by by passing official notification over the communiplate .     what arrangements .  what excitement .  what s it all about .  listen  i ve had conferences with twissell before .  he s my superior .  there s no excitement involved .    a look of surprise passed momentarily over the studious lack of expression the administrator had so far kept on his face .   you haven t been informed .     about what .     why  that a subcommittee of the allwhen council is holding session here at the    th .  this place  i am told  has been alive with the news for hours .     and they want to see me .   as soon as he asked that  harlan thought  of course they want to see me .  what else could the session be about but me .   and he understood the amusement of the junior computer last night outside twissell s room .  the computer knew of the projected committee meeting and it amused him to think that a technician could possibly expect to see twissell at a time like that .  very amusing  thought harlan bitterly .   the administrator said   i have my orders .  i know nothing more .   then  still surprised   you ve heard nothing of this .     technicians   said harlan sarcastically   lead sheltered lives .        five besides twissell .  senior computers all  none less than thirtyfive years an eternal .   six weeks earlier harlan would have been overwhelmed by the honor of sitting at lunch with such a group  tongue tied by the combination of responsibility and power they represented .  they would have seemed twice life size to him .   but now they were antagonists of his  worse still  judges .  he had no time to be impressed .  he had to plan his strategy .   they might not know that he was aware they had noys .  they could not know unless finge told them of his last meeting with harlan .  in the clear light of day  however  he was more than ever convinced that finge was not the man to broadcast publicly the fact that he had been browbeaten and insulted by a technician .   it seemed advisable  then  for harlan to nurse this possible advantage for the time being  to let  them  make the first move  say the first sentence that would join actual combat .   they seemed in no hurry .  they stared at him placidly over an abstemious lunch as though he were an interesting specimen spreadeagled against a plane of force by mild repulsors .  in desperation harlan stared back .   he knew all of them by reputation and by trimensional reproduction in the physiomonthly orientation films .  the films co ordinated developments throughout the various sections of eternity and were required viewing for all eternals with rating from observer up .   august sennor  the bald one  not even eyebrows or eyelashes   of course attracted harlan most .  first  because the odd appearance of those dark  staring eyes against bare eyelids and forehead was remarkably greater in person than it had ever seemed in trimension .  second  because of his knowledge of past collisions of view between sennor and twissell .  finally  because sennor did not confine himself to watching harlan .  he shot questions at him in a sharp voice .   for the most part his questions were unanswerable  such as   how did you first come to be interested in primitive times  young man .    do you find the study rewarding  young man .    finally  he seemed to settle himself in his seat .  he pushed his plate casually onto the disposal chute and clasped his thick fingers lightly before him .   there was no hair on the back of the hands  harlan noticed .    sennor said   there is something i have always wanted to know .  perhaps you can help me .    harlan thought  all right  now  this is it .   aloud he said   if i can  sir .     some of us here in eternity  i won t say all  or even enough   and he cast a quick glance at twissell s tired face  while the others drew closer to listen   but some  at any rate  are interested in the philosophy of time .  perhaps you know what i mean .     the paradoxes of time travel  sir .     well  if you want to put it melodramatically  yes .  but that s not all  of course .  there is the question of the true nature of reality  the question of the conservation of mass energy during reality change and so on .  now we in eternity are influenced in our consideration of such things by knowing the facts of time travel .  your creatures of the primitive era  however  knew nothing of time travel .  what were  their  views on the matter .    twissell s whisper carried the length of the table .   cobwebs .    but sennor ignored that .  he said   would you answer my question  technician .    harlan said   the primitives gave virtually no thought to timetravel  computer .     did not consider it possible  eh .     i believethat s right .     did not even speculate .     well  as to that   said harlan uncertainly   i believe there were speculations of sorts in some types of escape literature .  i am not well acquainted with these  but i believe a recurrent theme was that of the man who returned in time to kill his own grandfather as a child .    sennor seemed delighted .   wonderful .  wonderful .  after all  that is at least an expression of the basic paradox of time travel  if we assume an indeviant reality  eh .  now your primitives  i ll venture to state  never assumed anything  but  an indeviant reality .  am i right .    harlan waited to answer .  he did not see where the conversation was aiming or what sennor s deeper purposes were  and it unnerved him .  he said   i don t know enough to answer you with certainty  sir .  i believe there may have been speculations as to alternate paths of time or planes of existence .  i don t know .    sennor thrust out a lower lip .   i m sure you re wrong .  you may have been misled by reading your own knowledge into various ambiguities you may have come across .  no  without actual experience of time travel  the philosophic intricacies of reality would be quite beyond the human mind .  for instance  why does reality possess inertia .  we all know that it does .  any alteration in its flow must reach a certain magnitude before a change  a true change  is effected .  even then  reality has a tendency to flow back to its original position .    for instance  suppose a change here in the    th .  reality will change with increasing effects to perhaps the    th .  it will change  but with continually lesser effects to perhaps the    th .  thereafter  reality will be unchanged .  we all know this is so  but do any of us know why it is so .  intuitive reasoning would suggest that any reality change would increase its effects without limit as the centuries pass  yet that is not so .    take another point .  technician harlan  i m told  is excellent at selecting the exact minimum change required for any situation .  i ll wager he cannot explain how he arrives at his own choice .    consider how helpless the primitives must be .  they worry about a man killing his own grandfather because they do not understand the truth about reality .  take a more likely and a more easily analyzed case and let s consider the man who in his travels through time meets himself       harlan said sharply   what about a man who meets himself .    the fact that harlan interrupted a computer was a breach of manners in itself .  his tone of voice worsened the breach to a scandalous extent  and all eyes turned reproachfully on the technician .   sennor harumphed  but spoke in the strained tone of one determined to be polite despite nearly insuperable difficulties .  he said  continuing his broken sentence and thus avoiding the appearance of answering directly the unmannerly question addressed to him   and the four subdivisions into which such an act can fall .  call the man earlier in physiotime  a  and the one later  b .  subdivision one  a and b may not see one another  or do anything that will significantly affect one another .  in that case  they have not really met and we may dismiss this case as trivial .    or b  the later individual  may see a while a does not see b .  here  too  no serious consequences need be expected .  b  seeing a  sees him in a position and engaged in activity of which he already has knowledge .  nothing new is involved .    the third and fourth possibilities are that a sees b  while b does not see a  and that a and b see one another .  in each possibility  the serious point is that a has seen b  the man at an earlier stage in his physiological existence sees himself at a later stage .  observe that he has learned he will be alive at the apparent age of b .  he knows he will live long enough to perform the action he has witnessed .  now a man in knowing his own future in even the slightest detail can act on that knowledge and therefore changes his future .  it follows that reality must be changed to the extent of not allowing a and b to meet or  at the very least  of preventing a from seeing b .  then  since nothing in a reality made un real can be detected  a never has met b .  similarly  in every apparent paradox of time travel  reality always changes to avoid the paradox and we come to the conclusion that there are no paradoxes in time travel and that there can be none .    sennor looked well pleased with himself and his exposition  but twis sell rose to his feet .   twis sell said   i believe  gentlemen  that time presses .    far more suddenly than harlan would have thought the lunch was over .  five of the subcommittee members filed out  nodding at him  with the air of those whose curiosity  mild at best  had been assuaged .  only sennor held out a hand and added a gruff  good day  young man  to the nod .   with mixed feelings harlan watched them go .  what had been the purpose of the luncheon .  most of all  why the reference to men meeting themselves .  they had made no mention of noys .  were they there  then  only to study him .  survey him from top to bottom and leave him to twissell s judging .   twissell returned to the table  empty now of food and cutlery .  he was alone with harlan now  and almost as though to symbolize that he wielded a new cigarette between his fingers .   he said   and now to work  harlan .  we have a great deal to do .    but harlan would not  could not  wait longer .  he said flatly   before we do anything  i have something to say .    twissell looked surprised .  the skin of his face puckered up about his faded eyes  and he tamped at the ash end of his cigarette thoughtfully .   he said   by all means  speak if you wish  but first  sit down  sit down  boy .    technician andrew harlan did not sit down .  he strode up and back the length of the table  biting off his sentences hard to keep them from boiling and bubbling into incoherence .  senior computer laban twissell s age yellowed pippin of a head turned back and forth as he followed the other s nervous stride .   harlan said   for weeks now i ve been going through films on the history of mathematics .  books from several realities of the    th .  the realities don t matter much .  mathematics doesn t change .  the order of its development doesn t change either .  no matter how else the realities shifted  mathematical history stayed about the same .  the mathematicians changed  different ones switched discoveries  but the end results     anyway  i pounded a lot of it into my head .  how does that strike you .    twissell frowned and said   a queer occupation for a technician .     but i m not just a technician   said harlan .   you know that .     go on   said twissell and he looked at the timepiece he wore .  the fingers that held his cigarette played with it with unwonted nervousness .   harlan said   there was a man named vikkor mallansohn who lived in the   th century .  that was part of the primitive era  you know .  the thing he is known best for is the fact that he first successfully built a temporal field .  that means  of course  that he invented eternity  since eternity is only one tremendous temporal field shortcircuiting ordinary time and free of the limitations of ordinary time .     you were taught this as a cub  boy .     but i was not taught that vikkor mallansohn could not possibly have invented the temporal field in the   th century .  nor could anyone have .  the mathematical basis for it didn t exist .  the fundamental lefebvre equations did not exist  nor could they exist until the researches of jan verdeer in the   th century .    if there was one sign by which senior computer twissell could indicate complete astonishment  it was that of dropping his cigarette .  he dropped it now .  even his smile was gone .   he said   were you taught the lefebvre equations  boy .     no .  and i don t say i understand them .  but they re necessary for the temporal field .  i ve learned that .  and they weren t discovered till the   th .  i know that  too .    twissell bent to pick up his cigarette and regarded it dubiously .   what if mallansohn had stumbled on the temporal field without being aware of the mathematical justification .  what if it were simply an empirical discovery .  there have been many such .     i ve thought of that .  but after the field was invented  it took three centuries to work out its implications and at the end of that time there was no one way in which mallansohn s field could be improved on .  that could not be coincidence .  in a hundred ways  mallansohn s design showed that he must have used the lefebvre equations .  if he knew them or bad developed them without verdeer s work  which is impossible  why didn t he say so .    twissell said   you insist on talking like a mathematician .  who told you all this .     i ve been viewing films .     no more .     and thinking .     without advanced mathematical training .  i ve watched you closely for years  boy  and would not have guessed that particular talent of yours .  go on .     eternity could never have been established without mallansohn s discovery of the temporal field .  mallansohn could never have accomplished this without a knowledge of mathematics that existed only in his future .  that s number one .  meanwhile  here in eternity at this moment  there is a cub who was selected as an eternal against all the rules  since he was overage and married  to boot .  you are educating him in mathematics and in primitive sociology .  that s number two .     well .     i say that it is your intention to send him back into time somehow  back past the downwhen terminus of eternity  back to the   th .  it is your intention to have the cub  cooper  teach the lefebvre equations to mallansohn .  you see  then   harlan added with tense passion   that my own position as expert in the primitive and my knowledge of that position entitles me to special treatment .  very special treatment .     father time .   muttered twissell .    it s true  isn t it .  we come full circle   with my help  .  without it  .   .   .   he let the sentence hang .    you come so close to the truth   said twissell .   yet i could swear there was nothing to indicate      he fell into a study in which neither harlan nor the outside world seemed to play a part .   harlan said quickly   only close to the truth .  it  is  the truth .   he could not tell why he was so certain of the essentials of what he said  even quite apart from the fact that he so desperately wanted it to be so .   twissell said   no  no  not the exact truth .  the cub  cooper  is not going back to the   th to teach mallansohn anything .     i don t believe you .     but you must .  you must see the importance of this .  i want your co operation through what is left of the project .  you see  harlan  the situation is more full circle than you imagine .  much more so  boy .  cub brinsley sheridan cooper  is  vikkor mallansohn .           the beginning of eternity    harlan would not have thought that twissell could have said anything at that moment that could have surprised him .  he was wrong .   he said   mallansohn .  he     twissell  having smoked his cigarette to a stub  produced another and said   yes  mallansohn .  do you want a quick summary of mallansohn s life .  here it is .  he was born in the   th  spent some time in eternity  and died in the   th .    twissell s small hand placed itself lightly on harlan s elbow and his gnomish face broke into a wrinkled extension of his usual smile .   but come  boy  physiotime passes even for us and we are not completely masters of ourselves this day .  won t you come with me to my office .    he led the way and harlan followed  not entirely aware of the opening doors and the moving ramps .   he was relating the new information to his own problem and plan of action .  with the passing of the first moment of disorientation his resolution returned .  after all  how did this change things except to make his own importance to eternity still more crucial  his value higher  his demands more sure to be met  noys more certain to be bartered back to him .   noys .   father time  they must not harm her .  she seemed the only real part of his life .  all eternity beside was only a filmy fantasy  and not a worth while one  either .       when he found himself in computer twissell s office  he could not clearly recall how it had come about that he had passed from the dining area here .  though he looked about and tried to make the office grow real by sheer force of the mass of its contents  it still seemed but another part of a dream that had outlived its usefulness .   twissell s office was a clean  long room of porcelain asepsis .  one wall of the office was crowded from floor to ceiling and wall to distant wall with the computing micro units which  together  made up the largest privately operated computaplex in eternity and  indeed  one of the largest altogether .  the opposite wall was crammed with reference films .  between the two what was left of the room was scarcely more than a corridor  broken by a desk  two chairs  recording and projecting equipment  and an unusual object the like of which harlan was not familiar with and which did not reveal its use until twissell flicked the remnants of a cigarette into it .   it flashed noiselessly and twissell  in his usual prestidigitational fashion  held another in his hands .   harlan thought  to the point  now .   he began  a trifle too loudly  a bit too truculently   there is a girl in the    nd       twissell frowned  waved one hand quickly as though brushing an unpleasant matter hastily to one side .   i know  i know .  she will not be disturbed  nor you .  all will be well .  i will see to it .     do you mean        i tell you i know the story .  if the matter has troubled you  it need trouble you no more .    harlan stared at the old man  stupefied .  was this all .  though he had thought intently of the immensity of his power  he had not expected so clear a demonstration .   but twissell was talking again .    let me tell you a story   he began  with almost the tone he would have used in addressing a newly inducted cub .   i had not thought this would be necessary  and perhaps it still isn t  but your own researches and insight deserve it .    he stared at harlan quizzically and said   you know  i still can t quite believe that you worked this out on your own   then went on    the man most of eternity knows as vikkor mallansohn left the record of his life behind him after he died .  it was not quite a diary  not quite a biography .  it was more of a guide  bequeathed to the eternals he knew would someday exist .  it was enclosed in a volume of time stasis which could be opened only by the computers of eternity  and which therefore remained untouched for three centuries after his death  until eternity was established and senior computer henry wadsman  the first of the great eternals  opened it .  the document has been passed along in strictest security since  along a line of senior computers ending with myself .  it is referred to as the mallansohn memoir .    the memoir tells the story of a man named brinsley sheridan cooper  born in the   th  inducted as a cub into eternity at the age of twenty three  having been married for a little over a year  but having been  as yet  childless .    having entered eternity  cooper was trained in mathematics by a computer named laban twissell and in primitive sociology by a technician named andrew harlan .  after a thorough grounding in both disciplines  and in such matters as temporal engineering as well  he was sent back to the   th to teach certain necessary techniques to a primitive scientist named vikkor mallansohn .    once having reached the   th  he embarked first on a slow process of adjusting himself to the society .  in this he benefited a great deal from the training of technician harlan and the detailed advice of computer twissell  who seemed to have an uncanny insight into some of the problems he was to face .    after the passage of two years  cooper located one vikkor mallansohn  an eccentric recluse in the california backwoods  relationless and friendless but gifted with a daring and unconventional mind .  cooper made friends slowly  acclimated the man to the thought of having met a traveler from the future still more slowly  and set about teaching the man the mathematics he must know .    with the passage of time  cooper adopted the other s habits  learned to shift for himself with the help of a clumsy diesel oil electric generator and with wired electrical appliances which freed them of dependence on power beams .    but progress was slow and cooper found himself something less than a marvelous teacher .  mallansohn grew morose and unco operative and then one day died  quite suddenly  in a fall down a canyon of the wild  mountainous country in which they lived .  cooper  after weeks of despair  with the ruin of his lifework and  presumably  of all eternity  staring him in the eye  decided on a desperate expedient .  he did not report mallansohn s death .  instead  he slowly took to building  out of the materials at hand  a temporal field .    the details do not matter .  he succeeded after mountains of drudgery and improvisation and took the generator to the california institute of technology  just as years before he had expected the real mallansohn to do .    you know the story from your own studies .  you know of the disbelief and rebuffs he first met  his period under observation  his escape and the near loss of his generator  the help he received from the man at the lunch counter whose name he never learned  but who is now one of eternity s heroes  and of the final demonstration for professor zimbalist  in which a white mouse moved backward and forward in time .  i won t bore you with any of that .    cooper used the name of vikkor mallansohn in all this because it gave him a background and made him an authentic product of the   th .  the body of the real mallansohn was never recovered .    in the remainder of his life  he cherished his generator and cooperated with the institute scientists in duplicating it .  he dared do no more than that .  he could not teach them the lefebvre equations without outlining three centuries of mathematical development that was to come .  he could not  dared not hint at his true origin .  he dared not do more than the real vikkor mallansohn had  to his knowledge  done .    the men who worked with him were frustrated to find a man who could perform so brilliantly and yet was unable to explain the whys of his performance .  and he himself was frustrated too  because he foresaw  without in any way being able to quicken  the work that would lead  step by step  to the classic experiments of jan verdeer  and how from that the great antoine lefebvre would construct the basic equations of reality .  and how  after that  eternity would be constructed .    it was only toward the end of his long life that cooper  staring into a pacific sunset  he describes the scene in some detail in his memoir  came to the great realization that he was vikkor mallansohn  he was not a substitute but the man himself .  the name might not be his  but the man history called mallansohn was really brinsley sheridan cooper .    fired with that thought  and with all that implied  anxious that the process of establishing eternity be somehow quickened  improved  and made more secure  he wrote his memoir and placed it in a cube of time stasis in the living room of his house .    and so the circle was closed .  cooper mallansohn s intentions in writing the memoir were  of course  disregarded .  cooper must go through his life exactly as he had gone through it .  primitive reality allows of no changes .  at this moment in physiotime  the cooper you know is unaware of what lies ahead of him .  he believes he is only to instruct mallansohn and to return .  he will continue to believe so until the years teach him differently and he sits down to write his memoir .    the intention of the circle in time is to establish the knowledge of time travel and of the nature of reality  to build eternity  ahead of its natural time .  left to itself  mankind would not have learned the truth about time before their technological advances in other directions had made racial suicide inevitable .    harlan listened intently  caught up in the vision of a mighty circle in time  closed upon itself  and traversing eternity in part of its course .  he came as close to forgetting noys  for the moment  as he ever could .   he asked   then you knew all along everything you were to do  everything i was to do  everything i  have  done .    twissell  who seemed lost in his own telling of the tale  his eyes peering through a haze of bluish tobacco smoke  came slowly to life .  his old  wise eyes fixed themselves on harlan and he said reproachfully   no  of course not .  there was a lapse of decades of physiotime between cooper s stay in eternity and the moment when he wrote his memoir .  he could remember only so much  and only what he himself had witnessed .  you should realize that .    twissell sighed and he drew a gnarled finger through a line of updrafting smoke  breaking it into little turbulent swirls .   it worked itself out .  first  i was found and brought to eternity .  when  in the fullness of physiotime  i became a senior computer  i was given the memoir and placed in charge .  i had been described as in charge  so i was placed in charge .  again in the fullness of physiotime  you appeared in the changing of a reality  we had watched your earlier analogues carefully   and then cooper .    i filled in the details by using my common sense and the services of the computaplex .  how carefully  for instance  we instructed educator yarrow in his part while betraying none of the significant truth .  how carefully  in his turn  he stimulated your interest in the primitive .    how carefully we had had to keep cooper from learning anything he did not prove he had learned by reference in the memoir .   twissell smiled sadly .   sennor amuses himself with matters such as this .  he calls it the reversal of cause and effect .  knowing the effect  one adjusts the cause .  fortunately  i am not the cobweb spinner sennor is .    i was pleased  boy  to find you so excellent an observer and technician .  the memoir had not mentioned that since cooper had no opportunity to observe your work or evaluate it .  this suited me .  i could use you in a more ordinary task that would make your essential one less noticeable .  even your recent stay with computer finge fitted in .  cooper mentioned a period of your absence during which his mathematical studies were so sharpened that he longed for your return .  once  though  you frightened me .    harlan said  at once   you mean the time i took cooper along the kettle ways .     how do you come to guess that .   demanded twissell .    it was the one time you were really angry with me .  i suppose now it went against something in the mallansohn memoir .     not quite .  it was just that the memoir did not speak of the kettles .  it seemed to me that to avoid mention of such an outstanding aspect of eternity meant he had little experience with it .  it was my intention therefore to keep him away from the kettles as much as possible .  the fact that you had taken him upwhen in one disturbed me greatly  but nothing happened afterward .  things continued as they should  so all is well .    the old computer rubbed one hand slowly over the other  staring at the young technician with a look compounded of surprise and curiosity .   and all along you ve been guessing this .  it simply astonishes me .  i would have sworn that even a fully trained computer could not have made the proper deductions  given only the information you had .  for a technician to do it is uncanny .   he leaned forward  tapped harlan s knee lightly .   the mallansohn memoir says nothing about your life after cooper s leaving  of course .     i understand  sir   said harlan .    we will be free then  in a manner of speaking  to do as we please with it .  you show a surprising talent that must not be wasted .  i think you are meant for something more than a technician .  i promise nothing now  but i presume that you realize that computership is a clistinct possibility .    it was easy for harlan to keep his dark face expressionless .  he had had years of practice for that .   he thought  an additional bribe .   but nothing must be left to conjecture .  his guesses  wild and unsupported at the start  arrived at by a freak of insight in the course of a very unusual and stimulating night  had become reasonable as the result of directed library research .  they had become certainties now that twissell had told him the story .  yet in one way at least there had been a deviation .  cooper was mallansohn .   that had simply improved his position  but  wrong in one respect  he might be wrong in another .  he must leave nothing to chance  then .  have it out .  make certain .   he said levelly  almost casually   the responsibility is great for me  also  now that i know the truth .     yes  indeed .     how fragile is the situation .  suppose something unexpected were to happen and i were to miss a day when i ought to have been teaching cooper something vital .     i don t understand you .     was it harlan s imagination  or had a spark of alarm sprung to life in those old  tired eyes .     i mean  can the circle break .  let me put it this way .  if an unexpected blow on the head puts me out of action at a time when the memoir distinctly states i am well and active  is the whole scheme disrupted .  or suppose  for some reason  i deliberately choose not to follow the memoir .  what then .     but what puts all this in your mind .     it seems a logical thought .  it seems to me that by a careless or willful action  i could break the circle  and well  what .  destroy eternity .  it seems so .  if it  is  so   harlan added composedly   i ought to be told so that i may be careful to do nothing unfitting .  though i imagine it would take a rather unusual circumstance to drive me to such a thing .    twissell laughed  but the laughter rang false and empty in harlan s ear .   this is all purely academic  my boy .  nothing of this will happen since it hasn t happened .  the full circle will not break .     it might   said harlan .   the girl of the    nd        is safe   said twissell .  he rose impatiently .   there s no end to this kind of talk and i have quite enough of logic chopping from the rest of the subcommittee in charge of the project .  meanwhile  i have yet to tell  you  what i originally called you here to hear and physiotime is still passing .  will you come with me .   harlan was satisfied .  the situation was clear and his power unmistakable .  twissell knew that harlan could say  at will   i will no longer have anything to do with cooper .   twissell knew harlan could at any moment destroy eternity by giving cooper significant information concerning the memoir .   harlan had known enough to do this yesterday .  twissell had thought to overwhelm him with the knowledge of the importance of his task  but if the computer had thought to force harlan into line in that way  he was mistaken .   harlan had made his threat very clear with respect to noys s safety  and twissell s expression as he had barked   is safe   showed he realized the nature of the threat .   harlan rose and followed twissell .       harlan had never been in the room they now entered .  it was large and looked as though walls had been knocked down for its sake .  it had been entered through a narrow corridor which had been blocked off by a force screen that did not go down until after a pause sufficient for twissell s face to be scanned thoroughly by automatic machinery .   the largest part of the room was filled by a sphere that reached nearly to the ceiling .  a door was open  showing four small steps leading to a well lit platform within .   voices sounded from inside and even as harlan watched  legs appeared in the opening and descended the steps .  a man emerged and another pair of legs appeared behind him .  it was sennor of the allwhen council and behind him was another of the group at the breakfast table .   twissell did not look pleased at this .  his voice  however  was restrained .   is the subcommittee still here .     only we two   said sennor casually   rice and myself .  a beautiful instrument we have here .  it has the level of complexity of a spaceship .    rice was a paunchy man with the perplexed look of one who is accustomed to being right yet finds himself unaccountably on the losing side of an argument .  he rubbed his bulbous nose and said   sennor s mind is running on space travel lately .    sennor s bald head glistened in the light .   it s a neat point  twissell   he said .   i put it to you .  is space travel a positive factor or a negative factor in the calculus of reality .     the question is meaningless   said twissell impatiently .   what type of space travel in what society under what circumstances .     oh  come .  surely there s something to be said concerning spacetravel in the abstract .     only that it is self limiting  that it exhausts itself and dies out .     then it is useless   said sennor with satisfaction   and therefore it is a negative factor .  my view entirely .     if you please   said twissell   cooper will be here soon .  we will need the floor clear .     by all means .   sennor hooked an arm under that of rice and led him away .  his voice declaimed clearly as they departed .   periodically  my dear rice  all the mental effort of mankind is concentrated on space travel  which is doomed to a frustrated end by the nature of things .  i would set up the matrices except that i am certain this is obvious to you .  with minds concentrated on space  there is neglect of the proper development of things earthly .  i am preparing a thesis now for submission to the council recommending that realities be changed to eliminate all space travel eras as a matter of course .    rice s treble sounded .   but you can t be that drastic .  space travel is a valuable safety valve in some civilizations .  take reality    of the    th  which i happen to recall offhand .  now there       the voices cut off and twissell said   a strange man  sennor .  intellectually  he s worth two of any of the rest of us  but his worth is lost in leapfrog enthusiasms .    harlan said   do you suppose he can be right .  about space travel  i mean .     i doubt it .  we d have a better chance of judging if sennor would actually submit the thesis he mentioned .  but he won t .  he ll have a new enthusiasm before he s finished and drop the old .  but never mind      he brought the flat of his hand against the sphere so that it rang resoundingly  then brought his hand back so that he could remove a cigarette from his lip .  he said   can you guess what this is  technician .     harlan said   it looks like an outsize kettle with a top .     exactly .  you re right .  you ve got it .  come on inside .    harlan followed twissell into the sphere .  it was large enough to hold four or five men  but the interior was absolutely featureless .  the floor was smooth  the curved wall was broken by two windows .  that was all .    no controls .   asked harlan .    remote controls   said twissell .  he ran his hand over the smoothness of the wall and said   double walls .  the entire interwall volume is given over to a self contained temporal field .  this instrument is a kettle that is not restricted to the kettle shafts but can pass beyond the downwhen terminus of eternity .  its design and construction were made possible by valuable hints in the mallansohn memoir .  come with me .    the control room was a cut off corner of the large room .  harlan stepped in and stared somberly at immense bus bars .   twissell said   can you hear me  boy .    harlan started and looked about .  he had not been aware that twissell had not followed him inside .  he stepped automatically to the window and twissell waved to him .  harlan said   i can hear you  sir .  do you want me outside .     not at all .  you are locked in .    harlan sprang to the door and his stomach turned into a series of cold  wet knots .  twissell was correct and what in time was going on .   twissell said   you will be relieved to know  boy  that your responsibility is over .  you were worried about that responsibility  you asked searching questions about it  and i think i know what you meant .  this should not be your responsibility .  it is mine alone .  unfortunately  we must have you in the control room  since it is stated that you were there and handled the controls .  it is stated in the mallansohn memoir .  cooper will see you through the window and that will take care of that .    furthermore  i will ask you to make the final contact according to instructions i will give you .  if you feel that that  too  is too great a responsibility  you may relax .  another contact in parallel with yours is in charge of another man .  if  for any reason  you are unable to operate the contact  he will do so .  furthermore  i will cut off radio transmission from within the control room .  you will be able to hear us but not to speak to us .  you need not fear  therefore  that some involuntary exclamation from you will break the circle .    harlan stared helplessly out the window .   twissell went on   cooper will be here in moments and his trip to the primitive will take place within two physiohours .  after that  boy  the project will be over and you and i will be free .    harlan was plunging chokingly through the vortex of a waking nightmare .  had twissell tricked him .  had everything he had done been designed only to get harlan quietly into a locked control room .  having learned that harlan knew his own importance  had he improvised with diabolical cleverness  keeping him engaged in conversation  drugging his emotions with words  leading him here  leading him there  until the time was ripe for locking him in .   that quick and easy surrender over noys .  she won t be hurt  twissell had said .  all will be well .   how could he have believed that .  if they were not going to harm her  or touch her  why the temporal barrier across the kettleways at the        th .  that alone should have given twissell completely away .   but because he  fool .   wanted to believe  he allowed himself to be led through those last physiohours blindly  placed inside a locked room where he was no longer needed  even to close the final contact .   in one stroke he had been robbed of his essentiality .  the trumps in his hand had been neatly maneuvered into deuces and noys was out of his reach forever .  what punishment might lie in wait for him did not concern him .  noys was out of his reach forever .   it had never occurred to him that the project would be so close to its end .  that  of course  was what had really made his defeat possible .   twissell s voice sounded dimly .   you ll be cut off now  boy .    harlan was alone  helpless  useless .   .   .   .          beyond the downwhen terminus    brinsley cooper entered .  excitement flushed his thin face and made it almost youthful  despite the heavy mallansohn mustache that draped its upper lip .    harlan could see him through the window  hear him clearly over the room s radio .  he thought bitterly  a mallansohn mustache .  of course .    cooper strode toward twissell .   they wouldn t let me in till now  computer .     very right   said twissell .   they had their instructions .     now s the time  though .  i ll beheading out .     almost the time .     and i ll be coming back .  i ll be seeing eternity again .   despite the straightness cooper gave his back  there was an edge of uncertainty in his voice .    within the control room harlan brought his clenched hands bitterly to the reinforced glass of the window  longing to break through somehow  to shout   stop it .  meet my terms  or i ll    what was the use .    cooper looked about the room  apparently unaware that twissell had refrained from answering his question .  his glance fell on harlan at the control room window .   he waved his hand excitedly .   technician harlan .  come on out .  i want to shake your hand before i go .    twissell interposed .   not now  boy  not now .  he s at the controls .    cooper said   oh .  you know  he doesn t look well .    twissell said   i ve been telling him the true nature of the project .  i m afraid that s enough to make anyone nervous .    cooper said   great time  yes .  i ve known about it for weeks now and i m not used to it yet .   there was a trace of near hysteria in his laugh .   i still haven t got it through my thick head that it is really my show .  i  i m a little scared .     i scarcely blame you for that .     it s my stomach  mostly  you know .  it s the least happy part of me .    twissell said   well  it s very natural and it will pass .  meanwhile  your time of departure on standard intertemporal has been set and there is still a certain amount of orientation to be gone through .  for instance  you haven t actually seen the kettle you will use .        in the two hours that passed harlan heard it all  whether they were in sight or not .  twissell lectured cooper in an oddly stilted manner  and harlan knew the reason .  cooper was being informed of just those things that he was to mention in mallansohn s memoir .    full circle .  full circle .  and no way for harlan to break that circle in one  last defiant samson smash of the temple .  round and round the circle goes  round and round it goes .     ordinary kettles   he heard twissell say   are both pushed and pulled  if we can use such terms in the case of intertemporal forces .  in traveling from century x to century y within eternity there is a fully powered initial point and a fully powered final point .    what we have here is a kettle with a powered initial point but an unpowered destination point .  it can only be pushed  not pulled .  for that reason  it must utilize energies at a level whole orders of magnitude higher than those used by ordinary kettles .  special power transfer units have had to be laid down along the kettleways to siphon in sufficient concentrations of energy from nova sol .    this special kettle  its controls and power supply  are a composite structure .  for physiodecades  the passing realities have been combed for special alloys and special techniques .  the   th reality of the    nd was the key .  it developed the temporal pressor and without that  this kettle could not have been built .  the   th reality of the    nd .    he pronounced that with elaborate distinctness .    harlan thought  remember that  cooper .  remember the   th reality of the    nd so you can put it into the mallansohn memoir so that the etemals will know where to look so they will know what to tell you so you can put it .   .   .   .  round and round the circle goes .   .   .   .    twissell said   the kettle has not been tested past the downwhen terminus  of course  but it has taken numerous trips within eternity .  we are convinced there will be no bad effects .     there can t be  can there .   said cooper .   i mean i did get there or mallansohn could not have succeeded in building the field and he  did  succeed .    twissell said   exactly .  you will find yourself in a protected and isolated spot in the sparsely populated southwestern area of the united states of amellika         america   corrected cooper .    america  then .  the century will be the   th  or  to put it to nearest hundredth  the    .   th .  i suppose we can even call it the year       if we wish .  the kettle  as you saw  is large  much larger than necessary for you .  it is being filled now with food  water  and the means of shelter and defense .  you will have detailed instructions that will  of course  be meaningless to anyone but you .  i must impress upon you now that your first task will be to make certain that none of the indigenous inhabitants discovers you before you are ready for them .  you will have force diggers with which you will be able to burrow well into a mountain to form a cache .  you will have to remove the contents of the kettle rapidly .  they will be stacked so as to facilitate that .     harlan thought  repeat .  repeat .  he must have been told all this before  but repeat what must go into the memoir .  round and round  .   .   .    twissell said   you will have to unload in fifteen minutes .  after that  the kettle will return automatically to starting point  carrying with it all tools that are too advanced for the century .  you will have a list of those .  after the kettle returns  you will be on your own .    cooper said   must the kettle return so quickly .    twissell said   a quick return increases the probabilities of success .     harlan thought  the kettle  must  return in fifteen minutes because it  did  return in fifteen minutes .  round and  .   .   .    twissell hurried on .   we cannot attempt to counterfeit their medium of exchange of any of their negotiable scrip .  you will have gold in the form of small nuggets .  you will be able to explain its possession according to your detailed instructions .  you will have native clothing to wear or at least clothing that will pass for native .     right   said cooper .    now  remember .  move slowly .  take weeks  if necessary .  work your way into the era  spiritually .  technician harlan s instructions are a good basis but they are not enough .  you will have a wireless receiver built on the principles of the z th which will enable you to come abreast of the current events and  more important  learn the proper pronunciation and intonation of the language of the times .  do that thoroughly .  i m sure that harlan s knowledge of english is excellent  but nothing can substitute for native pronunciation on the spot .    cooper said   what if i don t end up in the right spot .  i mean  not in the    .    .     check on that very carefully  of course .  but it will be right .  it will be right .     harlan thought  it will be right because it was right .  round  .   .   .    cooper must have looked unconvinced  though  for twissell said   the accuracy of focus was carefully worked out .  i intended to explain our methods and now is a good time .  for one thing  it will help harlan understand the controls .     suddenly harlan turned away from the windows and fixed his gaze on the controls .  a corner of the curtain of despair lifted .  what if           twissell still lectured cooper with the anxious overprecise tone of the schoolteacher  and with part of his mind harlan still listened .   twissell said   obviously a serious problem was that of determining how far into the primitive an object is sent after the application of a given energy thrust .  the most direct method would have been to send a man into the downwhen via this kettle using carefully graduated thrust levels .  to do that  however  would have meant a certain lapse of time in each case while the man determined the century to its nearest hundredth through astronomical observation or by obtaining appropriate information over the wireless .  that would be slow and also dangerous since the man might well be discovered by the native inhabitants with probably catastrophic effects on our project .    what we did then instead was this  we sent back a known mass of the radioactive isotope  niobium     which decays by beta particle emission to the stable isotope  molybdenum    .  the process has a halflife of almost exactly     centuries .  the original radiation intensity of the mass was known .  that intensity decreases with time according to the simple relationship involved in first order kinetics  and  of course  the intensity can be measured with great precision .    when the kettle reaches its destination in primitive times  the ampule containing the isotope is discharged into the mountainside and the kettle then returns to eternity .  at the moment in physiotime that the ampule is discharged  it simultaneously appears at all future times growing progressively older .  at the place of discharge in the    th  in actual time and not in eternity  a technician detects the ampule by its radiation and retrieves it .    the radiation intensity is measured  the time it has remained in the mountainside is then known  the century to which the kettle traveled is also known to two decimal places .  dozens of ampules were thus sent back at various thrust levels and a calibration curve set up .  the curve was a check against ampules sent not all the way into the primitive but into the early centuries of eternity where direct observations could also be made .    naturally  there were failures .  the first few ampules were lost until we learned to allow for the not too major geological changes between the late primitive and the    th .  then  three of the ampules later on never showed up in the    th .  presumably  something went wrong with the discharge mechanism and they were buried too deeply in the mountain for detection .  we stopped our experiments when the level of radiation grew so high that we feared that some of the primitive inhabitants might detect and wonder what radioactive artifacts might be doing in the region .  but we had enough for our purposes and we are certain we can send back a man to any hundredth of a century of the primitive that is desired .    you follow all this  cooper  don t you .    cooper said   perfectly  computer twissell .  i have seen the calibration curve without understanding the purpose at the time .  it is quite clear now .    but harlan was exceedingly interested now .  he stared at the measured arc marked off in centuries .  the shining arc was porcelain on metal and the fine lines divided it into centuries  decicenturies and centicenturies .  silvery metal gleamed thinly through the porcelainpenetrating lines  marking them clearly .  the figures were as finely done and  bending close  harlan could make out the centuries from    to    .  the hairline was fixed at the    .   th century mark .   he had seen similar time gauges and almost automatically he reached to the pressure control lever .  it did not respond to his grasp .  the hairline remained in place .   he nearly jumped when twissell s voice suddenly addressed him .    technician harlan .    he cried   yes  computer   then remembered that he could not be heard .  he stepped to the window and nodded .   twissell said  almost as though chiming in with harlan s thoughts   the time gauge is set for a thrust back to the    .   th .  that requires no adjustment .  your only task is to pour energy through at the proper moment in physiotime .  there is a chronometer to the right of the gauge .  nod if you see it .    harlan nodded .    it will reach zero point backward .  at the minus fifteen second point  align the contact points .  it s simple .  you see how .    harlan nodded again .   twissell went on   synchronization is not vital .  you can do it at minus fourteen or thirteen or even minus five seconds  but please make every effort to stay this side of minus ten for safety s sake .  once you ve closed contact  a synchronized force gear will do the rest and make certain that the final energy thrust will occur precisely at time zero .  understood .    harlan nodded still again .  he understood more than twissell said .  if he himself did not align the points by minus ten  it would be taken care of from without .   harlan thought grimly  there ll be no need for outsiders .   twissell said   we have thirty physiominutes left .  cooper and i will leave to check on the supplies .    they left .  the door closed behind them  and harlan was left alone with the thrust control  the time  already moving slowly backward toward zero   and a resolute knowledge of what must be done .       harlan turned away from the window .  he put his hand inside his pocket and half withdrew the neuronic whip it still contained .  through all this he had kept the whip .  his hand shook a little .   an earlier thought recurred  a samson smash of the temple .   a corner of his mind wondered sickly  how many eternals have ever heard of samson .  how many know how he died .   there were only twenty five minutes left .  he was not certain how long the operation would take .  he was not really certain it would work at all .   but what choice had he .  his damp fingers almost dropped the weapon before he succeeded in unhinging the butt .   he worked rapidly and in complete absorption .  of all the aspects of what he planned  the possibility of his own passage into nonexistence occupied his mind the least and bothered him not at all .       at minus one minute harlan was standing at the controls .   detachedly he thought  the last minute of life .   nothing in the room was visible to him but the backward sweep of the red hairline that marked the passing seconds .   minus thirty seconds .   he thought  it will not hurt .  it is not death .   he tried to think only of noys .   minus fifteen seconds .   noys .   harlan s left hand moved a switch down toward contact .  not hastily .   minus twelve seconds .   contact .   the force gear would take over now .  thrust would come at zero time .  and that left harlan one last manipulation .  the samson smash .   his right hand moved .  he did not look at his right hand .   minus five seconds .   noys .   his right hand mo  zero  ved again  spasmodically .  he did not look at it .   was this nonexistence .       not yet .  nonexistence not yet .   harlan stared out the window .  he did not move .  time passed and he was unaware of its passage .   the room was empty .  where the giant  enclosed kettle had been was nothing .  metal blocks that had served as its base sat emptily  lifting their huge strength against air .   twissell  strangely small and dwarfed in the room that had become a waiting cavern  was the only thing that moved as he tramped edgily this way and that .   harlan s eyes followed him for a moment and then left him .   then  without any sound or stir  the kettle was back in the spot it had left .  its passage across the hairline from time past to time present did not as much as disturb a molecule of air .   twissell was hidden from harlan s eyes by the bulk of the kettle  but then he rounded it  came into view .  he was running .   a flick of his hand was enough to activate the mechanism that opened the door of the control room .  he hurtled inside  shouting with an almost lyrical excitement .   it s done .  it s done .  we ve closed the circle .   he had breath to say no more .   harlan made no answer .   twissell stared out the window  his hands flat against the glass .  harlan noted the blotches of age upon them and the way in which they trembled .  it was as though his mind no longer had the ability or the strength to filter the important from the inconsequential  but were selecting observational material in a purely random manner .   wearily he thought  what does it matter .  what does anything matter now .   twissell said  harlan heard him dimly    i ll tell you now that i ve been more anxious than i cared to admit .  sennor used to say once that this whole thing was impossible .  he insisted something must happen to stop it     what s the matter .    he had turned at harlan s odd grunt .   harlan shook his head  managed a choked  nothing .    twissell left it at that and turned away .  it was doubtful whether he spoke to harlan or to the air .  it was as though he were allowing years of pent up anxieties to escape in words .    sennor   he said   was the doubter .  we reasoned with him and argued .  we used mathematics and presented the results of generations of research that had preceded us in the physiotime of eternity .  he put it all to one side and presented his case by quoting the man meetshimself paradox .  you heard him talk about it .  it s his favorite .    we knew our own future  sennor said .  i  twissell  knew  for instance  that i would survive  despite the fact that i would be quite old  until cooper made his trip past the downwhen terminus .  i knew other details of my future  the things i would do .    impossible  he would say .  reality must change to correct your knowledge  even if it meant the circle would never close and eternity never established .    why he argued so  i don t know .  perhaps he honestly believed it  perhaps it was an intellectual game with him  perhaps it was just the desire to shock the rest of us with an unpopular viewpoint .  in any case  the project proceeded and some of the memoir began to be fulfilled .  we located cooper  for instance  in the century and reality that the memoir gave us .  sennor s case was exploded by that alone  but it didn t bother him .  by that time  he had grown interested in something else .    and yet  and yet   he laughed gently  with more than a trace of embarrassment  and let his cigarette  unnoticed  burn down nearly to his fingers   you know i was never quite easy in my mind .  something  might  happen .  the reality in which eternity was established  might  change in some way in order to prevent what sennor called a paradox .  it would have to change to one in which eternity would not exist .  sometimes  in the dark of a sleeping period  when i couldn t sleep  i could almost persuade myself that that was indeed so .    and now it s all over and i laugh at myself as a senile fool .    harlan said in a low voice   computer sennor was right .    twissell whirled .   what .     the project failed .   harlan s mind was coming out of the shadows  why  and into what  he was not sure  .   the circle is not complete .     what are you talking about .   twissell s old hands fell on harlan s shoulders with surprising strength .   you re ill  boy .  the strain .     not ill .  sick of everything .  you .  me .  not ill .  the gauge .  see for yourself .     the gauge .   the hairline on the gauge stood at the   th century  hard against the right hand extreme .   what happened .   the joy was gone from his face .  horror replaced it .   harlan grew matter of fact .   i melted the locking mechanism  freed the thrust control .     how could you        i had a neuronic whip .  i broke it open and used its micro pile energy source in one flash  like a torch .  there s what s left of it .   he kicked at a small heap of metal fragments in one corner .   twissell wasn t taking it in .   in the   th .  you mean cooper s in the   th        i don t know where he is   said harlan dully .   i shifted the thrust control downwhen  further down than the z th .  i don t know where .  i didn t look .  then i brought it back .  i still didn t look .    twissell stared at him  his face a pale  unhealthy yellowish color  his lower lip trembling .    i don t know where he is now   said harlan .   he s lost in the primitive .  the circle is broken .  i thought everything would end when i made the stroke .  at zero time .  that s silly .  we ve got to wait .  there ll be a moment in physiotime when cooper will realize he s in the wrong century  when he ll do something against the memoir  when he    he broke off  then broke into a forced and creaky laughter .   what s the difference .  it s only a delay till cooper makes the final break in the circle .  there s no way of stopping it .  minutes  hours  days .  what s the difference .  when the delay is done  there will be no more eternity .  do you hear me .  it will be the end of eternity .          the earlier crime     why .  why .    twissell looked helplessly from the gauge to the technician  his eyes mirroring the puzzled frustration in his voice .   harlan lifted his head .  he had only one word to say .   noys .    twissell said   the woman you took into eternity .    harlan smiled bitterly  said nothing .   twissell said   what has she to do with this .  great time  i don t understand  boy .     what is there to understand .   harlan burned with sorrow .   why do you pretend ignorance .  i had a woman .  i was happy and so was she .  we harmed no one .  she did not exist in the new reality .  what differ .  ence would it have made to anyone .    twissell tried vainly to interrupt .   harlan shouted .   but there are rules in eternity  aren t there .  i know them all .  liaisons require permission  liaisons require computations  liaisons require status  liaisons are tricky things .  what were you planning for noys when all this was over .  a seat in a crashing rocket .  or a more comfortable position as community mistress for worthy computers .  you won t make any plans now  i think .    he ended in a kind of despair and twissell moved quickly to the communiplate .  its function as a transmitter had obviously been restored .   the computer shouted into it till he aroused an answer .  then he said   this is twissell .  no one is to be allowed in here .  no one .  no one .  do you understand .   .   .   .  then see to it .  it goes for members of the allwhen council .  it goes for them particularly .    he turned back to harlan  saying abstractedly   they ll do it because i m old and senior member of the council and because they think i m cranky and queer .  they give in to me because i m cranky and queer .   for a moment he fell into a ruminative silence .  then he said   do you think i m queer .   and his face turned swiftly up to harlan s like that of a seamed monkey .   harlan thought  great time  the man s mad .  the shock has driven him mad .   he took a step backward  automatically aghast at being trapped with a madman .  then he steadied .  the man  be he ever so mad  was feeble  and even madness would end soon .   soon .  why not at once .  what delayed the end of eternity .   twissell said  he had no cigarette in his fingers  his hand made no move to take one  in a quiet insinuating voice   you haven t answered me .   do  you think i m queer .  i suppose you do .  too queer to talk to .  if you had thought of me as a friend instead of as a crotchety old man  whimsical and unpredictable  you would have spoken openly to me of your doubts .  you would have taken no such action as you did .    harlan frowned .  the man thought  harlan  was mad .  that was it .   he said angrily   my action was the right one .  i m quite sane .    twissell said   i told you the girl was in no danger  you know .     i was a fool to believe that even for a while .  i was a fool to believe the council would be just to a technician .     who told you the council knew of any of this .     finge knew of it and sent in a report concerning it to the council .     and how do you know that .     i got it out of finge at the point of a neuronic whip .  the business end of a whip abolishes comparative status .     the same whip that did this .   twissell pointed to the gauge with its blob of molten metal perched wryly above the face of the dial .    yes .     a busy whip .   then  sharply   do you know why finge took it to the council instead of handling the matter himself .     because he hated me and wanted to make certain i lost all status .  he wanted noys .    twissell said   you re na  ve .  if he had wanted the girl  he could easily have arranged liaison .  a technician would not have been in his way .  the man hated  me   boy .    still no cigarette .  he looked odd without one and the stained finger he lay on his chest as he spoke the last pronoun looked almost indecently bare .     you .     there s such a thing  boy  as council politics .  not every computer is appointed to the council .  finge wanted an appointment .  finge is ambitious and wanted it badly .  i blocked it because i thought him emotionally unstable .  time  i never fully appreciated how right i was .   .   .   .  look  boy .  he knew you were a prot  g   of mine .  he had seen me take you out of a job as an observer and make you a master technician .  he saw you working for me steadily .  how better could he get back at me and destroy my influence .  if he could prove my pet technician guilty of a terrible crime against eternity  it would reflect on me .  it might force my resignation from the allwhen council  and who do you suppose would then be a logical successor .    his empty hands moved to his lips and when nothing happened  he looked at the space between finger and thumb blankly .   harlan thought  he s not as calm as he s trying to sound .  he can t be .  but why does he talk all this nonsense  now .   with eternity ending .   then in agony  but why doesn t it  end  then .  now .   twissell said   when i allowed you to go to finge just recently  i more than half suspected danger .  but mallansohn s memoir  said  you were away the last month and no other natural reason for your absence offered itself .  fortunately  finge underplayed his hand .     in what way .   asked harlan wearily .  he didn t really care  but twissell talked and talked and it was easier to take part than to try to shut the sound out of his ears .   twissell said   finge labeled his report    in re  unprofessional conduct of technician andrew harlan .   he was being the faithful eternal  you see  being cool  impartial  unexcited .  he was leaving it to the council to rage and throw itself at me .  unfortunately for himself  he did not know of your real importance .  he did not realize that any report concerning you would be instantly referred to me  unless its supreme importance were made perfectly clear on the very face of things .     you never spoke to me of this .     how could i .  i was afraid to do anything that would disturb you with the crisis of the project at hand .  i gave you every opportunity to bring your problem to me .    every opportunity .  harlan s mouth twisted in disbelief  but then he thought of twissell s weary face on the communiplate asking him if he had nothing to say to him .  that was yesterday .  only yesterday .   harlan shook his head  but turned his face away now .   twissell said softly   i realized at once that he had deliberately goaded you into your  rash action .    harlan looked up .   you know that .     does that surprise you .  i knew finge was after my neck .  i ve known it for a long time .  i am an old man  boy .  i know these things .  but there are ways in which doubtful computers can be checked upon .  there are some protective devices  culled out of time  that are not placed in the museums .  there are some that are known to the council alone .    harlan thought bitterly of the time block at the        th .    from the report and from what i knew independently  it was easy to deduce what must have happened .    harlan asked suddenly   i suppose finge suspected you of spying .     he might have .  i wouldn t be surprised .    harlan thought back to his first days with finge when twissell first showed his abnormal interest in the young observer .  finge had known nothing of the mallansohn project  and he had been interested in twissell s interference .   have you ever met senior computer twissell .   he had once asked and  thinking back  harlan could recall the exact tone of sharp uneasiness in the man s voice .  as early as that finge must have suspected harlan of being twissell s finger man .  his enmity and hate must have begun that early .   twissell was speaking   so if you had come to me        come to  you .    cried harlan .   what of the council .     of the entire council  only i know .     you never told them .   harlan tried to be mocking .    i never did .    harlan felt feverish .  his clothes were choking him .  was this nightmare to go on forever .  foolish  irrelevant chatter .   for what .  why .    why didn t eternity end .  why didn t the clean peace of non reality reach out for them .   great time  what was wrong .    twissell said   don t you believe me .    harlan shouted   why should i .  they came to look at me  didn t they .  at that breakfast .  why should they have done that if they didn t know of the report .  they came to look at the queer phenomenon who had broken the laws of eternity but who couldn t be touched for one more day .  one more day and then the project would be over .  they came to gloat for the tomorrow they were expecting .     my boy  there was nothing of that .  they wanted to see you only because they were human .  councilmen are human too .  they could not witness the final kettle drive because the mallansohn memoir did not place them at the scene .  they could not interview cooper since the memoir made no mention of that either .  yet they wanted something .  father time  boy  don t you see they would want something .  you were as close as they could get  so they brought you close and stared at you .     i don t believe you .     it s the truth .    harlan said   is it .  and while we ate  councilman sennor talked of a man meeting himself .  he obviously knew about my illegal trips into the    nd and my nearly meeting myself .  it was his way of poking at me  enjoying himself cutely at my expense .    twissell said   sennor .  you worried about sennor .  do you know the pathetic figure he is .  his homewhen is the    rd  one of the few cultures in which the human body is deliberately disfigured to meet the aesthetic requirements of the time .  it is rendered hairless at adolescence .    do you know what that means in the continuity of man .  surely you do .  a disfigurement sets men apart from their ancestors and descendants .  men of the    rd are poor risks as eternals  they are too different from the rest of us .  few are chosen .  sennor is the only one of his century ever to sit on the council .    don t you see how that affects him .  surely you understand what insecurity means .  did it ever occur to you that a councilman could be insecure .  sennor has to listen to discussions involving the eradication of his reality for the very characteristic that makes him so conspicuous among us .  and eradicating it would leave him one of a very few in all the generation to be disfigured as he is .  someday it will happen .    he finds refuge in philosophy .  he overcompensates by taking the lead in conversation  by deliberately airing unpopular or unaccepted viewpoints .  his man meeting himself paradox is a case in point .  i told you that he used it to predict disaster for the project and it was we  the councilmen  that he was attempting to annoy  not you .  it had nothing to do with you .  nothing .    twissell had grown heated .  in the long emotion of his words he seemed to forget where he was and the crisis that faced them  for he slipped back into the quick gestured  uneasily motioned gnome that harlan knew so well .  he even slipped a cigarette from his sleeve pouch and had all but frictioned it into combustion .   but then he stopped  wheeled  and looked at harlan again  reaching back through all his own words to what harlan had last said  as though until that moment  he had not heard them properly .   he said   what do you mean  you almost met yourself .    harlan told him briefly and went on   you didn t know that .     no .    there were a few moments of silence that were as welcome to the feverish harlan as water would have been .   twissell said   is that it .  what if you  had  met yourself .     i didn t .    twissell ignored that .   there is always room for random variation .  with an infinite number of realities there can be no such thing as determinism .  suppose that in the mallansohn reality  in the previous turn of the cycle        the circle goes on forever .   asked harlan with what wonder he could still find in himself .    do you think only twice .  do you think two is a magic number .  it s a matter of infinite turns of the circle in finite physiotime .  just as you can draw a pencil round and round the circumference of a circle infinitely yet enclose a finite area .  in previous turns of the cycle  you had not met yourself .  this one time  the statistical uncertainty of things made it possible for you to meet yourself .  reality had to change to prevent the meeting and in the new reality  you did not send cooper back to the   th but       harlan cried   what s all this talk about .  what are you getting at .  it s all done .  everything .  let me alone now .   let me alone .      i want you to know you ve done wrong .  i want you to realize you did the wrong thing .     i didn t .  and even if i did   it s done  .     but it is  not  done .  listen just a little while longer .   twissell was wheedling  almost crooning with an agonized gentleness .   you will have your girl .  i promised that .  i still promise it .  she will not be harmed .  you will not be harmed .  i promise you this .  it is my personal guarantee .    harlan stared at him wide eyed .   but it s too late .  what s the use .     it is  not  too late .  things are  not  irreparable .  with your help  we can succeed yet .  i must have your help .  you must realize that you did wrong .  i am trying to explain this to you .  you must want to undo what you have done .    harlan licked his dry lips with a dry tongue and thought  he is mad .  his mind can t accept the truth .    or  does the council know more .   did it .  did it .  could it reverse the verdict of the changes .  could they halt time or reverse it .   he said   you locked me in the control room  kept me helpless  you thought  till it was all over .     you said you were afraid something might go wrong with you  that you might not be able to carry on with your part .     that was meant to be a threat .     i took it literally .  forgive me .  i must have your help .    it came to that .  harlan s help must be had .  was he mad .  was harlan mad .  did madness have meaning .  or anything at all  for that matter .   the council needed his help .  for that help they would promise him anything .  noys .  computership .  what would they not promise him .  and when his help was done with  what would he get .  he would not be fooled a second time .    no .   he said .    you ll have noys .     you mean the council will be willing to break the laws of eternity once the danger is safely gone .  i don t believe it .   how could the danger safely be passed  a sane scrap of his mind demanded .  what was this all about .    the council will never know .     would  you  be willing to break the laws .  you re the ideal eternal .  with the danger gone  you would obey the law .  you couldn t act otherwise .    twissell reddened blotchily  high on each cheekbone .  from the old face all shrewdness and strength drained away .  there was left only a strange sorrow .    i will keep my word to you and break the law   said twissell   for a reason you don t imagine .  i don t know how much time is left us before eternity disappears .  it could be hours  it could be months .  but i have spent so much time in the hope of bringing you to reason that i will spend a little more .  will you listen to me .  please .    harlan hesitated .  then  out of a conviction of the uselessness of all things as much as out of anything else said wearily   go on .        i have heard  began twissell  that i was born old  that i cut my teeth on a micro computaplex  that i keep my hand computer in a special pocket of my pajamas when i sleep  that my brain is made up of little force relays in endless parallel hookups and that each corpuscle of my blood is a microscopic spatio temporal chart floating in computer oil .   all these stories come to me eventually  and i think i must be a little proud of them .  maybe i go around believing them a bit .  it s a foolish thing for an old man to do  but it makes life a little easier .   does that surprise you .  that i must find a way to make life easier .  i  senior computer twissell  senior member of the allwhen council .   maybe that s why i smoke .  ever think of that .  i have to have a reason  you know .  eternity is essentially an unsmoking society  and most of time is  too .  i ve thought of that often .  i sometimes think it s a rebellion against eternity .  something to take the place of a greater rebellion that failed  .   .   .   no  it s all right .  a tear or two won t hurt me  and it isn t pretense  believe me .  it s just that i haven t thought about this for a long time .  it isn t pleasant .   it involved a woman  of course  as your affair did .  that s not coincidence .  it s almost inevitable  if you stop to think of it .  an eternal  who must sell the normal satisfactions of family life for a handful of perforations on foil  is ripe for infection .  that s one of the reasons eternity must take the precautions it does .  and  apparently  that s also why eternals are so ingenious in evading the precautions once in a while .   i remember my woman .  it s foolish of me to do so  perhaps .  i can t remember anything else about that physiotime .  my old colleagues are only names in the record books  the changes i supervised  all but one  are only items in the computaplex memory pools .  i remember her  though  very well .  perhaps you can understand that .   i had had a long standing request for liaison in the books  and after i achieved status as a junior computer  she was assigned to me .  she was a girl of this very century  the    th .  i didn t see her until after the assignment  of course .  she was intelligent and kind .  not beautiful or even pretty  but then  even when young  yes  i was young  never mind the myths  i was not noted for my own looks .  we were well suited to one another by temperament  she and i  and if i were a timed man  i would have been proud to have her as my wife .  i told her that many times .  i believe it pleased her .  i know it was the truth .  not all eternals  who must take their women as and how computing permits  are that fortunate .   in that particular reality  she was to die young  of course  and none of her analogues was available for liaison .  at first  i took that philosophically .  after all  it was her short lifetime which made it possible for her to live with me without deleteriously affecting reality .   i am ashamed of that now  of the fact that i was glad she had a short time to live .  just at first  that is .  just at first .   i visited her as often as spatio temporal charting allowed .  i squeezed every minute out of it  giving up meals and sleep when necessary  shifting my labor load shamelessly whenever i could .  her amiability passed the heights of my expectations  and i was in love .  i put it bluntly .  my experience of love is very small  and understanding it through observation in time is a shaky matter .  as far as my understanding went  however  i was in love .   what began as the satisfaction of an emotional and physical need became a great deal more .  her imminent death stopped being a convenience and became a calamity .  i life plotted her .  i didn t go to the life plotting departments  either .  i did it myself .  that surprises you  i imagine .  it was a misdemeanor  but it was nothing compared to the crimes i committed later .   yes  i  laban twissell .  senior computer twissell .   three separate times  a point in physiotime came and passed  during which some simple action of my own might have altered her personal reality .  naturally  i knew that no such personally motivated change could possibly be authorized by the council .  still  i began to feel personally responsible for her death .  that was part of my motivation later on  you see .   she became pregnant .  i took no action  though i should have .  i had worked her life plot  modified to include her relationship with me  and i knew pregnancy to be a high probability consequence .  as you may or may not know  timed women are occasionally made pregnant by eternals despite precautions .  it is not unheard of .  still  since no eternal may have a child  such pregnancies as do occur are ended painlessly and safely .  there are many methods .   my life plotting had indicated she would die before delivery  so i took no precautions .  she was happy in her pregnancy and i wanted her to remain so .  so i only watched and tried to smile when she told me she could feel life stirring within her .   but then something happened .  she gave birth prematurely      i don t wonder you look that way .  i had a child .  a real child of my own .  you ll find no other eternal  perhaps  who can say that .  that was more than a misdemeanor .  that was a serious felony  but it was still nothing .   i hadn t expected it .  birth and its problems were an aspect of life with which i had had little experience .   i went back to the life plot in panic and found the living child  in an alternate solution to a low probability forklet i had overlooked .  a professional life plotter would not have overlooked it and i had done wrong to trust my own abilities that far .   but what could i do now .   i couldn t kill the child .  the mother had two weeks to live .  let the child live with her till then  i thought .  two weeks of happiness is not an exorbitant gift to ask .   the mother died  as foreseen  and in the manner foreseen .  i sat in her room  for all the time permitted by the spatio temporal chart  aching with a sorrow all the keener for my having waited for death  in full knowledge  for over a year .  in my arms  i held my son and hers .     yes  i let it live .  why do you cry out so .  are you going to condemn me .   you cannot know what it means to hold a little atom of your own life in your arms .  i may have a computaplex for nerves and spatio temporal charts for a bloodstream  but i do know .   i let it live .  i committed that crime  too .  i put it in the charge of an appropriate organization and returned when i could  in strict temporal sequence  held even with physiotime  to make necessary payments and to watch the boy grow .   two years went by that way .  periodically  i checked the boy s lifeplot  i was used to breaking that particular rule  by now  and was pleased to find that there were no signs of deleterious effects on the then current reality at probability levels over   .      .  the boy learned to walk and mispronounced a few words .  he was not taught to call me  daddy .   whatever speculations the timed people of the child care institution might have made concerning me i don t know .  they took their money and said nothing .   then  when the two years had passed  the necessities of a change that included the    th at one wing was brought up before the allwhen council .  i  having been lately promoted to assistant computer  was placed in charge .  it was the first change ever left to my sole supervision .   i was proud  of course  but also apprehensive .  my son was an intruder in the reality .  he could scarcely be expected to have analogues .  thought of his passage into nonexistence saddened me .   i worked at the change and i flatter myself even yet that i did a flawless job .  my first one .  but i succumbed to a temptation .  i succumbed to it all the more easily because it was becoming an old story now for me .  i was a hardened criminal  a habitu   of crime .  i worked out a new life plot for my son under the new reality  certain of what i would find .   but then for twenty four hours  without eating or sleeping  i sat in my office  striving with the completed life plot  tearing at it in a despairing effort to find an error .   there was no error .   the next day  holding back my solution to the change  i worked out a spatio temporal chart  using rough methods of approximation  after all  the reality was not to last long  and entered time at a point more than thirty years upwhen from the birth of my child .   he was thirty four years old  as old as i myself .  i introduced myself as a distant relation  making use of my knowledge of his mother s family  to do so .  he had no knowledge of his father  no memory of my visits to him in his infancy .   he was an aeronautical engineer .  the    th was expert in half a dozen varieties of air travel  as it still is in the current reality   and my son was a happy and successful member of his society .  he was married to an ardently enamored girl  but would have no children .  nor would the girl have married at all in the reality in which my son had not existed .  i had known that from the beginning .  i had known there would be no deleterious affect on reality .  otherwise  i might not have found it in my heart to let the boy live .  i am not  completely  abandoned .   i spent the day with my son .  i spoke to him formally  smiled politely  took my leave coolly when the spatio temporal chart dictated .  but un derneath all that  i watched and absorbed every action  filling myself with him  and trying to live one day at least out of a reality that the next day  by physiotime  would no longer have existed .   how i longed to visit my wife one last time  too  during that portion of time in which she lived  but i had used every second that had been available to me .  i dared not even enter time to see her  unseen .   i returned to eternity and spent one last horrible night wrestling futilely against what must be .  the next morning i handed in my computations together with my recommendations for change .       twissell s voice had lowered to a whisper and now it stopped .  he sat there with his shoulders bent  his eyes fixed on the floor between his knees  and his fingers twisting slowly into and out of a knotted clasp .   harlan  waiting vainly for another sentence out of the old man  cleared his throat .  he found himself pitying the man  pitying him despite the many crimes he had committed .  he said   and that s all .    twissell whispered   no  the worst  the worst     an analogue of my son did exist .  in the new reality  he existed  as a paraplegic from the age of four .  forty two years in bed  under circumstances that barred me from arranging to have the nerve regenerating techniques of the     s applied to his case  or even for arranging to have his life ended painlessly .    that new reality still exists .  my son is still out there in the appropriate portion of the century .   i  did that to him .  it was my mind and my computaplex that discovered this new life for him  and my word that ordered the change .  i had committed a number of crimes for his sake and for his mother s  but that one last deed  though strictly in accordance with my oath as an eternal  has always seemed to me to be my great crime   the  crime .    there was nothing to say  and harlan said nothing .   twissell said   but you see now why i understand your case  why i will be willing to let you have your girl .  it would not harm eternity and  in a way  it would be expiation for my crime .    and harlan believed .  all in one change of mind  he believed .   harlan sank to his knees and lifted his clenched fists to his temples .  he bent his head and rocked slowly as savage despair beat through him .   he had thrown eternity away  and lost noys  when  except for his samson smash  he might have saved one and kept the other .          search through the primitive    twissell was shaking harlan s shoulders .  the old man s voice urgently called his name .    harlan .  harlan .  for time s sake  man .    harlan emerged only slowly from the slough .   what are we to do .     certainly not  this  .  not despair .  to begin with  listen to me .  forget your technician s view of eternity and look at it through a computer s eyes .  the view is more sophisticated .  when you alter something in time and create a reality change  the change may take place at once .  why should that be .    harlan said shakily   because your alteration has made the change inevitable .     has it .  you could go back and reverse your alteration  couldn t you .     i suppose so .  i never did  though .  or anyone that i heard of .     right .  there is no intention of reversing an alteration  so it goes through as planned .  but here we have something else .  an unintentional alteration .  you sent cooper into the wrong century and now i firmly intend to reverse that alteration and bring cooper back here .     for time s sake  how .     i m not sure yet  but there  must  be a way .  if there were no way  the alteration would be irreversible  change would come at once .  but change has not come .  we are still in the reality of the mallansohn memoir .  that means the alteration is reversible and  will  be reversed .     what .   harlan s nightmare was expanding and swirling  growing murkier and more engulfing .    there must be some way of knitting the circle in time together again and our ability to find the way to do it must be a high probability affair .  as long as our reality exists  we can be certain that the solution remains high probability .  if at any moment  you or i make the wrong decision  if the probability of healing the circle falls below some crucial magnitude  eternity disappears .  do you understand .    harlan was not sure that he did .  he wasn t trying very hard .  slowly he got to his feet and stumbled his way into a chair .   you mean we can get cooper back        and send him to the right place  yes .  catch him at the moment he leaves the kettle and he may end up in his proper place in the   th no more than a few physiohours older  physiodays  at the most .  it would be an alteration  of course  but undoubtedly not enough of one .  reality would be rocked  boy  but not upset .     but how do we get him .     we know there s a way  or eternity wouldn t be existing this moment .  as to what that way is  that is why i need you  why i ve fought to get you back on my side .  you re the expert on the primitive .  tell me .     i can t   groaned harlan .    you can   insisted twissell .   there was suddenly no trace of age or weariness in the old man s voice .  his eyes were ablaze with the light of combat and he wielded his cigarette like a lance .  even to harlan s regret drugged senses the man seemed to be enjoying himself  actually enjoying himself  now that battle had been joined .    we can reconstruct the event   said twissell .   here is the thrust control .  you re standing at it  waiting for the signal .  it comes .  you make contact and at the same time squeeze the power thrust in the downwhen direction .  how far .     i don t know  i tell you .  i don t know .      you  don t know  but your muscles do .  stand there and take the controls in your hand .  get hold of yourself .  take them  boy .  you re waiting for the signal .  you re hating me .  you re hating the council .  you re hating eternity .  you re wearying your heart out for noys .  put yourself back at that moment .  feel what you felt then .  now i ll set the clock in motion again .  i ll give you one minute  boy  to remember your emotions and force them back into your thalamus .  then  at the approach of zero  let your right hand jerk the control as it had done before .  then take your hand away .  don t move it back again .  are you ready .     i don t think i can do it .     you don t think     father time  you have no choice .  is there another way you can get back your girl .    there wasn t .  harlan forced himself back to the controls  and as he did so emotion flooded back .  he did not have to call on it .  repeating the physical movements brought them back .  the red hairline on the clock started moving .   detachedly he thought  the last minute of life .   minus thirty seconds .   he thought  it will not hurt .  it is not death .   he tried to think only of noys .   minus fifteen seconds .   noys .   harlan s left hand moved a switch down toward contact .   minus twelve seconds .   contact .   his right hand moved .   minus five seconds .   noys .   his right hand mo  zero  ved spasmodically .   he jumped away  panting .   twissell came forward  peering at the dial .   twentieth century   he said .   nineteen point three eight  to be exact .    harlan choked out   i don t know .  i tried to feel the same  but it was different .  i knew what i was doing and that made it different .    twissell said   i know  i know .  maybe it s all wrong .  call it a first approximation .   he paused a moment in mental calculation  took a pocket computer half out of its container and thrust it back without consulting it .   to time with the decimal points .  say the probability is   .    that you sent him back to the second quarter of the   th .  somewhere between    .    and    .    .  all right .     i don t know .     well  now  look .  if i make a firm decision to concentrate on that part of the primitive to the exclusion of all else and if i am wrong  the chances are that i will have lost my chance to keep the circle in time closed and eternity will disappear .  the decision itself will be the crucial point  the minimum necessary change  the m . n . c .   to bring about the change .  i now make the decision .  i decide  definitely       harlan  looked about cautiously  as though reality had grown so fragile that a sudden head movement might shatter it .   harlan said   i m thoroughly conscious of eternity .    twissell s normality had infected him to the point where his voice sounded firm in his own ears .     then eternity still exists   said twissell in a blunt  matter of fact manner   and we have made the right decision .  now there s nothing more to do here for the while .  let s get to my office and we can let the subcommittee of the council swarm over this place  if that will make them any happier .  as far as they are concerned  the project has ended successfully .  if it doesn t  they ll never know .  nor we .        twissell studied his cigarette and said   the question that now confronts us is this  what will cooper do when he finds himself in the wrong century .     i don t know .     one thing is obvious .  he s a bright lad  intelligent  imaginative  wouldn t you say .     well  he s mallansohn .     exactly .  and he wondered if he would end up wrong .  one of his last questions was  what if i don t end up in the right spot .  do you remember .     well .   harlan had no idea where this was leading .    so he is mentally prepared for being displaced in time .  he will do something .  try to reach us .  try to leave traces for us .  remember  for part of his life he was an eternal .  that s an important thing .   twissell blew a smoke ring  hooked it with a finger  and watched it curl about and break up .   he s used to the notion of communication across time .  he is not likely to surrender to the thought of being marooned in time .  he ll know that we re looking for him .    harlan said   without kettles and with no eternity in the   th  how would he go about communicating with us .     with  you   technician  with you .  use the singular .  you re our expert on the primitive .  you taught cooper about the primitive .  you re the one he would expect to be capable of finding his traces .      what  traces  computer .    twissell s shrewd old face stared up at harlan  its lines crinkling .   it was intended to leave cooper in the primitive .  he is without the protection of an enclosing shield of physiotime .  his entire life is woven into the fabric of time and will remain so until you and i reverse the alteration .  likewise woven into the fabric of time is any artifact  sign  or message he may have left for us .  surely there must be particular sources you used in studying the   th century .  documents  archives  films  artifacts  reference works .  i mean primary sources  dating from the time itself .     yes .     and he studied them with you .     yes .     and is there any particular reference that was your favorite  one that he knew you were intimately acquainted with  so that you would recognize in it some reference to himself .     i see what you re driving at  of course   said harlan .  he grew thoughtful .    well .   asked twissell with an edge of impatience .   harlan said   my news magazines  almost surely .  news magazines were a phenomenon of the early    s .  the one of which i have nearly a complete set dates from early in the   th and continues well into the   nd .     good .  now is there any way  do you suppose  in which cooper could make use of that news magazine to carry a message .  remember  he d know you d be reading the periodical  that you d be acquainted with it  that you d know your way about in it .     i don t know .   harlan shook his head .   the magazine affected an artificial style .  it was selective rather than inclusive and quite unpredictable .  it would be difficult or even impossible to rely on its printing something you would plan to have it print .  cooper couldn t very well create news and be sure of its appearance .  even if cooper managed to get a position on its editorial staff  which is very unlikely  he couldn t be certain that his exact wording would pass the various editors .  i don t see it  computer .    twissell said   for time s sake  think .  concentrate on that news magazine .  you re in the   th and you re cooper with his education and background .  you taught the boy  harlan .  you molded his thinking .  now what would he do .  how would he go about placing something in the magazine  something with the exact wording he wants .    harlan s eyes widened .   an advertisement .     what .     an advertisement .  a paid notice which they would be compelled to print exactly as requested .  cooper and i discussed them occasionally .     ah  yes .  they have that sort of thing in the    th   said twissell .    not like the   th .  the   th is peak in that respect .  the cultural milieu        considering the advertisement now   interposed twissell hastily   what kind would it be .     i wish i knew .    twissell stared at the lighted end of his cigarette as though seeking inspiration .   he can t say anything directly .  he can t say   cooper of the   th  stranded in the   th and calling eternity         how can you be sure .     impossible .  to give the   th information we know they did not have would be as damaging to the mallansohn circle as would wrong action on our part .  we re still here  so in his whole lifetime in the current reality of the primitive he s done no harm of that sort .     besides which   said harlan  retreating from the contemplation of the circular reasoning which seemed to bother twissell so little   the news magazine is not likely to agree to publish anything which seems mad to it or which it cannot understand .  it would suspect fraud or some form of illegality and would not wish to be implicated .  so cooper couldn t use standard intertemporal for his message .     it would have to be something subtle   said twissell .   he would have to use indirection .  he would have to place an advertisement that would seem perfectly normal to the men of the primitive .  perfectly normal .  and yet something that is obvious to us  once we knew what we were searching for .  very obvious .  obvious at a glance because it would have to be found among uncounted individual items .  how big do you suppose it would be  harlan .  are those advertisements expensive .     quite expensive  i believe .     and cooper would have to hoard his money .  besides which  to avoid the wrong kind of attention  it would have to be small  anyway .  guess  harlan .  how large .    harlan spread his hands .   half a column .     column .     they were printed magazines  you know .  on paper .  with print arranged in columns .     oh yes .  i can t seem to separate literature and film somehow  .   .   .  well  we have a first approximation of another sort now .  we must look for a half column advertisement which will  practically at a glance  give evidence that the man who placed it came from another century  in the upwhen direction  of course  and yet which is so normal an advertisement that no man of that century would see anything suspicious in it .    harlan said   what if i don t find it .     you will .  eternity exists  doesn t it .  as long as it does  we re on the right track .  tell me  can you recall such an advertisement in your work with cooper .  anything which struck you  even momentarily  as odd  queer  unusual  subtly wrong .     no .     i don t want an answer so quickly .  take five minutes and think .     no point .  at the time i was going over the news magazines with cooper  he hadn t been in the   th .     please  boy .  use your head .  sending cooper to the   th has introduced an alteration .  there s no change  it isn t an irreversible alteration .  but there have been some changes with a small  c   or micro changes  as it is usually referred to in computation .  at the instant cooper was sent to the   th  the advertisement appeared in the appropriate issue of the magazine .  your own reality has micro changed in the sense that you may have looked at the page with that advertisement on it rather than one without that advertisement as you did in the previous reality .  do you understand .    harlan was again bewildered  almost as much at the ease with which twissell picked his way through the jungle of temporal logic  as at the  paradoxes  of time .  he shook his head   i remember nothing of the sort .     well  then  where do you keep the files of that periodical .     i had a special library built on level two  using the cooper priority .     good enough   said twissell .   let s go there .  now .        harlan watched twissell stare curiously at the old  bound volumes in the library and then take one down .  they were so old that the fragile paper had to be preserved by special methods and they creaked under twissell s insufficiently gentle handling .   harlan winced .  in better times he would have ordered twissell away from the books  senior computer though he was .   the old man peered through the crinkling pages and silently mouthed the archaic words .   this is the english the linguists are always talking about  isn t it .   he asked  tapping a page .    yes .  english   muttered harlan .   twissell put the volume back .   heavy and clumsy .    harlan shrugged .  to be sure  most of the centuries of eternity were film eras .  a respectable minority were molecular recording eras .  still  print and paper were not unheard of .   he said   books don t require the investment in technology that films do .    twissell rubbed his chin .   quite .  shall we get started .    he took another volume down from the shelf  opening it at random and staring at the page with odd intentness .   harlan thought  does the man think he s going to hit the solution by a lucky stab .   the thought might have been correct  for twissell  meeting harlan s appraising eyes  reddened and put the book back .   harlan took the first volume of the    .   th centicentury and began turning the pages regularly .  only his right hand and his eyes moved .  the rest of his body remained at rigid attention .   at what seemed aeonic intervals to himself harlan rose  grunting  for a new volume .  on those occasions there would be the coffee break or the sandwich break or the other breaks .   harlan said heavily   it s useless your staying .    twissell said   do i bother you .     no .     then i ll stay   muttered twissell .  throughout he wandered occasionally to the bookshelves  staring helplessly at the bindings .  the sparks of his furious cigarettes burned his finger ends at times  but he disregarded them .   a physioday ended .       sleep was poor and sparse .  midmorning  between two volumes  twissell lingered over his last sip of coffee and said   i wonder sometimes why i didn t throw up my computership after the matter of my     you know .    harlan nodded .    i felt like it   the old man went on .   i felt like it .  for physiomonths  i hoped desperately that no changes would come my way .  i got morbid about it .  i began to wonder if changes were right .  funny  the tricks emotions will play on you .     you  know primitive history  harlan .  you know what it was like .  its reality flowed blindly along the line of maximum probability .  if that maximum probability involved a pandemic  or ten centuries of slave economy  a breakdown of technology  or even a  a  let s see  what s really bad  even an atomic war if one had been possible then  why  by time  it  happened  .  there was nothing to stop it .    but where eternity exists  that s been stopped .  upwhen from the   th  things like that don t happen .  father time  we ve lifted our reality to a level of well being far beyond anything primitive times could imagine  to a level which  but for the interference of eternity  would have been very low probability indeed .    harlan thought in shame  what s he trying to do .  get me to work harder .  i m doing my best .   twissell said   if we miss our chance now  eternity disappears  probably through all of physiotime .  and in one vast change all reality reverts to maximum probability with  i am positive  atomic warfare and the end of man .    harlan said   i d better get on to the next volume .        at the next break twissell said helplessly   there s so much to do .  isn t there a faster way .    harlan said   name it .  to me it seems that i must look at every single page .  and look at every part of it  too .  how can i do it faster .    methodically he turned the pages .    eventually   said harlan   the print starts blurring and that means it s time for sleep .    a second physioday ended .       at       a . m .   standard physiotime  of the third physioday of the search harlan stared at a page in quiet wonder and said   this is it .    twissell didn t absorb the statement .  he said   what .    harlan looked up  his face twisted with astonishment .   you know  i didn t believe it .  by time  i never really believed it  even while you were working out all that rigmarole about news magazines and advertisements .    twissell had absorbed it now .    you ve found it .     he leaped at the volume harlan was holding  clutching at it with shaking fingers .   harlan held it out of reach and slammed the volume shut .   just a moment .   you  won t find it  even if i showed you the page .     what are you doing .   shrieked twissell .   you ve lost it .     it s not lost .  i know where it is .  but first        first what .    harlan said   there s one point remaining  computer twissell .  you say i can have noys .  bring her to me  then .  let me see her .    twissell stared at harlan  his thin white hair in disarray .   are you joking .     no   said harlan sharply   i m not joking .  you assured me that you would make arrangments   are  you  joking .  noys and i would be together .  you promised that .     yes  i did .  that part s settled .     then produce her alive  well  and untouched .     but i don t understand you .  i don t have her .  no one has .  she s still in the far upwhen  where finge reported her to be .  no one has touched her .  great time  i told you she was safe .    harlan stared at the old man and grew tense .  he said  chokingly   you re playing with words .  all right  she s in the far upwhen  but what good is that to me .  take down the barrier at the        th      the what .     the barrier .  the kettle won t pass it .     you never said anything of this   said twissell wildly .    i haven t .   said harlan with sharp surprise .  hadn t he .  he had thought of it often enough .  had he never said a word about it .  he couldn t recall  at that .  but then he hardened .   he said   all right .  i tell you now .  take it down .     but the thing is impossible .  a barrier against the kettle .  a temporal barrier .     are you telling me you didn t put one up .     i didn t .  by time  i swear it .     then  then      harlan felt himself grow pale .   then the council did it .  they know of all this and they ve taken action independently of you and  and by all of time and reality  they can whistle for their ad and for cooper  for mallansohn and all of eternity .  they ll have none of it .  none of it .     wait .  wait .   twissell yanked despairingly at harlan s elbow .   keep hold of yourself .  think  boy  think .  the council put up no barrier .     it s there .     but they can t have put up such a barrier .  no one could have .  it s theoretically impossible .     you don t know it all .  it s there .     i know more than anyone else on the council and such a thing is impossible .     but it s there .     but if it is       and harlan grew sufficiently aware of his surroundings to realize that there was a kind of abject fear in twissell s eyes  a fear that had not been there even when he first learned of cooper s misdirection and of the impending end of eternity .          the hidden centuries    andrew harlan watched the men at work with abstracted eyes .  they ignored him politely because he was a technician .  ordinarily he would have ignored them somewhat less politely because they were maintenance men .  but now he watched them and  in his misery  he even caught himself envying them .   they were service personnel from the department of intertemporal transportation  in dun gray uniforms with shoulder patches showing a red  double headed arrow against a black background .  they used intricate force field equipment to test the kettle motors and the degrees of hyper freedom along the kettleways .  they had  harlan imagined  little theoretical knowledge of temporal engineering  but it was obvious that they had a vast practical knowledge of the subject .   harlan had not learned much concerning maintenance when he was a cub .  or  to put it more accurately  he had not really wished to learn .  cubs who did not make the grade were put into maintenance .  the  unspecialized profession   as the euphemism had it  was the hallmark of failure and the average cub automatically avoided the subject .   yet now  as he watched the maintenance men at work  they seemed to harlan to be quietly  tensionlessly efficient  reasonably happy .   why not .  they outnumbered the specialists  the  true eternals   ten to one .  they had a society of their own  residential levels devoted to them  pleasures of their own .  their labor was fixed at so many hours per physioday and there was no social pressure in their case to make them relate their spare time activity to their profession .  they had time  as specialists did not  to devote to the literature and film dramatizations culled out of the various realities .   it was they  after all  who probably had the better rounded personalities .  it was the specialist s life which was harried and affected  artificial in comparison with the sweet and simple life in maintenance .   maintenance was the foundation of eternity .  strange that such an obvious fact had not struck him earlier .  they supervised the importation of food and water from time  the disposal of waste  the functioning of the power plants .  they kept all the machinery of eternity running smoothly .  if every specialist were to die of a stroke on the spot  maintenance could keep eternity going indefinitely .  yet were maintenance to disappear  the specialists would have to abandon eternity in days or die miserably .   did maintenance men resent the loss of their homewhens  or their womanless  childless lives .  was security from poverty  disease  and reality change sufficient compensation .  were their views ever consuited on any matter of importance .  harlan felt some of the fire of the social reformer within him .   senior computer twissell broke harlan s train of thought by bustling in at a half run  looking even more haunted than he had an hour before  when he had left  with maintenance already at work .   harlan thought  how does he keep it up .  he s an old man .   twissell glanced about him with birdlike brightness as the men automatically straightened up to respectful attention .   he said   what about the kettleways .    one of the men responded   nothing wrong  sir .  the ways are clear  the fields mesh .     you ve checked everything .     yes  sir .  as far upwhen as the department s stations go .    twissell said   then go .    there was no mistaking the brusque insistence of his dismissal .  they bowed respectfully  turned  and hastened out briskly .   twissell and harlan were alone in the kettleways .   twissell turned to him .   you ll stay here .  please .    harlan shook his head .   i must go .    twissell said   surely you understand .  if anything happens to me  you still know how to find cooper .  if anything happens to you  what can i or any eternal or any combination of eternals do alone .    harlan shook his head again .   twissell put a cigarette between his lips .  he said   sennor is suspicious .  he s called me several times in the last two physiodays .  why am i in seclusion  he wants to know .  when he finds out i ve ordered a complete overhaul of the kettleway machinery .   .   .  i must go now  harlan .  i can t delay .     i don t want delay .  i m ready .     you insist on going .     if there s no barrier  there ll be no danger .  even if there is  i ve been there already and come back .  what are you afraid of  computer .     i don t want to risk anything i don t have to .     then use your logic  computer .  make the decision that i m to go with you .  if eternity still exists after that  then it means that the circle can still be closed .  it means we ll survive .  if it s a wrong decision  then eternity will pass into nonexistence  but it will anyway if i don t go  because without noys  i ll make no move to get cooper .  i swear it .    twissell said   i ll bring her back to you .     if it is so simple and safe  there will be no harm if i come along .    twissell was in an obvious torture of hesitation .  he said gruffly   well  then  come .    and eternity survived .       twissell s haunted look did not disappear once they were within the kettle .  he stared at the skimming figures of the temporometer .  even the scaler gauge  which measured in units of kilocenturies  and which the men had adjusted for this particular purpose  was clicking at minute intervals .   he said   you should not have come .    harlan shrugged .   why not .     it disturbs me .  no sensible reason .  call it a long standing superstition of mine .  it makes me restless .   he clasped his hands together  holding them tightly .   harlan said   i don t understand you .    twissell seemed eager to talk  as though to exorcise some mental demon .  he said   maybe you ll appreciate this  at that .  you re the expert on the primitive .  how long did man exist in the primitive .    harlan said   ten thousand centuries .  fifteen thousand  maybe .     yes .  beginning as a kind of primitive apelike creature and ending as homo sapiens .  right .     it s common knowledge .  yes .     then it must be common knowledge that evolution proceeds at a fairly rapid pace .  fifteen thousand centuries from ape to homo sapiens .     well .     well  i m from a century in the        s        harlan could not help starting .  he had never known twissell s homewhen or known of anyone who did .     i m from a century in the        s   twissell said again   and you re from the   th .  the time between our homewhens is twice the total length of time of man s existence in the primitive  yet what change is there between us .  i was born with four fewer teeth than you  and without an appendix .  the physiological differences about end with that .  our metabolism is almost the same .  the major difference is that your body can synthesize the steroid nucleus and my body can t  so that i require cholesterol in my diet and you don t .  i was able to breed with a woman of the    th .  that s how undifferentiated with time the species is .    harlan was unimpressed .  he had never questioned the basic identity of man throughout the centuries .  it was one of those things you lived with and took for granted .  he said   there have been cases of species living unchanged through millions of centuries .     not many  though .  and it remains a fact that the cessation of human evolution seems to coincide with the development of eternity .  just coincidence .  it s not a question which is considered  except by a few here and there like sennor  and i ve never been a serinor .  i didn t believe speculation was proper .  if something couldn t be checked by a computaplex  it had no business taking up the time of a computer .  and yet  in my younger days  i sometimes thought        of what .   harlan thought  well  it s something to listen to  anyway .    i sometimes thought about eternity as it was when it was first established .  it stretched over just a few centuries in the    s and    s  and its function was mostly trade .  it interested itself in the ref orestation of denuded areas  shipping topsoil back and forth  fresh water  fine chemicals .  those were simple days .    but then we discovered reality changes .  senior computer henry wadsman  in the dramatic manner with which we are all acquainted  prevented a war by removing the safety brake of a congressman s ground vehicle .  after that  more and more  eternity shifted its center of gravity from trade to reality change .  why .    harlan said   the obvious reason .  betterment of humanity .     yes .  yes .  in normal times  i think so too .  but i m talking of my nightmare .  what if there were another reason  an unexpressed one  an unconscious one .  a man who can travel into the indefinite future may meet men as far advanced over himself as he himself is over an ape .  why not .     maybe .  but men are men          even in the       th .  yes  i know .  and have our reality changes had something to do with it .  we bred out the unusual .  even sennor s homewhen with its hairless creatures is under continual question and that s harmless enough .  perhaps in all honesty  in all sincerity  we ve prevented human evolution because we don t  want  to meet the supermen .    still no spark was struck .  harlan said   then it s done .   vhat does it matter .     but what if the superman exists just the same  further upwhen than we can reach .  we control only to the       th .  beyond that are the hidden centuries .  why are they hidden .  because evolved man does not want to deal with us and bars us from his time .  why do we allow them to remain hidden .  because we don t want to deal with them and  having failed to enter in our first attempt  we refuse even to make additional attempts .  i don t say it s our conscious reason  but conscious or unconscious  it s a reason .     grant everything   said harlan sullenly .   they re out of our reach and we re out of theirs .  live and let live .    twissell seemed struck by the phrase .   live and let live .  but we don t .  we make changes .  the changes extend only through a few centuries before temporal inertia causes its effects to die out .  you remember sennor brought that up as one of the unanswered problems of time at our breakfast .  what he might have said was that it s all a matter of statistics .  some changes affect more centuries than other .  theoretically  any number of centuries can be affected by the proper change  a hundred centuries  a thousand  a hundred thousand .  evolved man of the hidden centuries may know that .  suppose he is disturbed by the possibility that someday a change may reach him clear to the        th .     it s useless to worry about such things   said harlan with the air of a man who had much greater worries .    but suppose   went on twissell in a whisper   they were calm enough as long as we left the sections of the hidden centuries empty .  it meant we weren t aggressing .  suppose this truce  or whatever you wish to call it  were broken  and someone appeared to have established permanent residence upwhen from the       th .  suppose they thought it might mean the first of a serious invasion .  they can bar us from their time  so their science is that far advanced beyond ours .  suppose they may further do what seems impossible to us and throw a barrier across the kettleways  cutting us off       and now harlan was on his feet  in full horror    they  have noys .     i don t know .  it s speculation .  maybe there is no barrier .  maybe there was something wrong with your ket      there was a barrier .   yelled harlan .   what other explanation is there .  why didn t you tell me this before .     i didn t believe it   groaned twissell .   i still don t .  i shouldn t have said a word of this foolish dreaming .  my own fears  the question of cooper  everything   but wait  just a few minutes .    he pointed at the temporometer .  the scaler indicated them to be between the       th and       th centuries .       twissell s hand on the controls slowed the kettle .  the       th was passed .  the scaler s motions stopped .  the individual centuries could be read .                              what will we do .   muttered harlan .   twissell shook his head in a gesture that spoke eloquently of patience and hope  but perhaps also of helplessness .                             harlan steeled himself for the shock of the barrier and thought desperately  would preserving eternity be the only means of finding time to fight back at the creatures of the hidden centuries .  how else recover noys .  dash back  back to the    th and work like fury to                              harlan held his breath .  twissell slowed the kettle further  let it creep .  it responded perfectly to the controls .                              now  now  now   said harlan in a whisper  unaware that he had made any sound at all .                                                the numbers mounted and the two men watched them continue to mount in paralytic silence .   then twissell cried   there  is  no barrier .    and harlan answered   there was .  there was .   then  in agony   maybe they ve got her  and need a barrier no longer .               th .   harlan leaped from the kettle  and raised his voice .   noys .  noys .    the echoes bounced off the walls of the empty section in hollow syncopation .   twissell  climbing out more sedately  called after the younger man   wait  harlan       that was useless .  harlan  at a run  was hurtling along the corridors toward that portion of the section they had made a kind of home .   he thought vaguely of the possibility of meeting one of twissell s  evolved men  and momentarily his skin prickled  but then that was drowned in his urgent need to find noys .     noys .     and all at once  so quickly that she was in his arms before he was sure he had seen her at all  she was there and with him  and her arms were around him and clutching him and her cheek was against his shoulder and her dark hair was soft against his chin .    andrew .   she said  her voice muffled by the pressure of his body .   where were you .  it s been days and i was getting frightened .    harlan held her out at arm s length  staring at her with a kind of hungry solemnity .   are you all right .      i m  all right .  i thought something might have happened to you .  i thought      she broke off  terror springing into her eyes and gasped   andrew .    harlan whirled .   it was only twissell  panting .   noys must have gained confidence from harlan s expression .  she said more quietly   do you know him  andrew .  is it all right .    harlan said   it s all right .  this is my superior  senior computer laban twissell .  he knows of you .     a senior computer .   noys shrank away .   twissell advanced slowly .   i will help you  my child .  i will help you both .  the technician has my promise  if he would only believe it .     my apologies  computer   said harlan stiffly  and not yet entirely repentant .    forgiven   said twissell .  he held out his hand  took the girl s reluctant one .   tell me  girl  has it been well with you here .     i ve been worried .     there s been no one here  since harlan last left you .     n  no  sir .     no one at all .  nothing .    she shook her head .  her dark eyes sought harlan s .   why do you ask .     nothing  girl .  a foolish nightmare .  come  we will take you back to the    th .    on the kettle back andrew harlan sank  by degrees  into a troubled and deepening silence .  he did not look up when the        th was passed in the downwhen direction and twissell had snorted an obvious sigh of relief as though he had half expected to be trapped on the upwhen side .   he scarcely moved when noys s hand stole into his  and the manner in which he returned the pressure of her fingers was almost mechanical .       noys slept in another room and now twissell s restlessness reached a peak of devouring intensity .    the advertisement  boy .  you have your woman .  my part of the agreement is done .    silently  still abstracted  harlan turned the pages of the volume on the desk .  he found his page .    it s simple enough   he said   but it s in english .  i ll read it to you and then translate it .    it was a small advertisement in the upper left hand corner of a page numbered    .  against an irregular line drawing as background were the unadorned words  in block letters     all the  talk  of the  market    underneath  in smaller letters  it said   investments news letter  p . o .  box     denver  colorado .    twissell listened painstakingly to harlan s translation and was obviously disappointed .  he said   what is the market .  what do they mean by that .     the stock market   said harlan impatiently .   a system by which private capital was invested in business .  but that s not the point at all .  don t you see the line drawing against which the advertisement is set .     yes .  the mushroom cloud of an a bomb blast .  an attention getter .  what about it .    harlan exploded .   great time  computer  what s wrong with you .  look at the date of the magazine issue .    he pointed to the top heading  just to the left of the page number .  it read march          .   harlan said   that scarcely needs translation .  the numbers are about those of standard intertemporal and you see it s the    .   nd century .  don t you know that at that time no human being who had ever lived had seen the mushroom cloud .  no one could possibly reproduce it so accurately  except        now  wait .  it s just a line pattern   said twissell  trying to retain his equilibrium .   it might resemble the mushroom cloud only coincidentally .     might it .  will you look at the wording again .   harlan s fingers punched out the short lines   all the  talk  of the  market .  the initials spell out atom  which is english for atom .  is that coincidence  too .  not a chance .    don t you see  computer  how this advertisement fits the conditions you yourself set up .  it caught my eye instantly .  cooper knew it would out of sheer anachronism .  at the same time  it has no meaning other than its face value  no meaning at all  for any man of the    .   nd .    so it must be cooper .  that s his message .  we have the date to the nearest week of a centicentury .  we have his mailing address .  it is only necessary to go after him and i m the only one with enough knowledge of the primitive to manage that .     and you ll go .   twissell s face was ablaze with relief and happiness .    i ll go  on one condition .    twissell frowned in a sudden reversal of emotion .   again conditions .     the same condition .  i m not adding new ones .  noys must be safe .  she must come with me .  i will not leave her behind .     you  still  don t trust me .  in what way have i failed you .  what can there be that still disturbs you .     one thing  computer   said harlan solemnly .   one thing still .  there  was  a barrier across the        th .  why .  that is what still disturbs me .           the closing circle    it did not stop disturbing him .  it was a matter that grew in his mind as the days of preparation sped by .  it interposed itself between him and twissell  then between him and noys .  when the day of departure came  he was only distantly aware of the fact .   it was all he could do to rouse a shadow of interest when twissell returned from a session with the council subcommittee .  he said   how did it go .    twissell said wearily   it wasn t exactly the most pleasant conversation i ve ever had .    harlan was almost willing to let it go at that  but he broke his moment s silence with a muttered  i suppose you said nothing about        no  no   was the testy response .   i said nothing about the girl or about your part in the misdirection of cooper .  it was an unfortunate error  a mechanical failure .  i took full responsibility .    harlan s conscience  burdened as it was  could find room for a twinge .  he said   that won t affect you well .     what can they do .  they must wait for the correction to be made before they can touch me .  if we fail  we re all beyond help or harm .  if we succeed  success itself will probably protect me .  and if it doesn t      the old man shrugged .   i plan to retire from active participation in eternity s affairs thereafter anyway .   but he fumbled his cigarette and disposed of it before it was half burned away .   he sighed .   i would rather not have brought them into this at all  but there would have been no way  otherwise  of using the special kettle for further trips past the downwhen terminus .    harlan turned away .  his thoughts moved around and about the same channels that had been occupied to the increasing exclusion of all else for days .  he heard twissell s further remark dimly  but it was only at its repetition that he said with a start   pardon me .     i say  is your woman ready  boy .  does she understand what she s to do .     she s ready .  i ve told her everything .     how did she take it .     what .   .   .   .  oh  yes  uh  as i expected her to .  she s not afraid .     it s less than three physiohours now .     i know .    that was all for the moment  and harlan was left alone with his thoughts and a sickening realization of what he must do .       with the kettle loading done and the controls adjusted harlan and noys appeared in a final change of costume  approximating that of an unurbanized area of the early   th .   noyshad modified harlan s suggestion for her wardrobe  according to some instinctive feeling she claimed women had when it came to matters of clothing and aesthetics .  she chose thoughtfully from pictures in the advertisements of the appropriated volumes of the news magazine and had minutely scrutinized items imported from a dozen different centuries .   occasionally she would say to harlan   what do you think .    he would shrug .   if it s instinctive knowledge  i ll leave it to you .     that s a bad sign  andrew   she said  with a lightness that did not quite ring true .   you re too pliable .  what s the matter  anyway .  you re just not yourself .  you haven t been for days .     i m all right   harlan said in a monotone .   twissell s first sight of them in the role of natives of the   th elicited a feeble attempt at jocularity .   father time   he said   what ugly costumes in the primitive  and yet how it fails to hide your beauty  my  my dear .    noys smiled warmly at him  and harlan  standing there impassively silent  was forced to admit that twissell s rust choked vein of gallantry had something of truth in it .  noys s clothing encompassed her without accentuating her as clothing should .  her make up was confined to unimaginative dabs of color on lips and cheeks and an ugly rearrangement of the eyebrow line .  her lovely hair  this had been the worst of it  had been cut ruthlessly .  yet she was beautiful .   harlan himself was already growing accustomed to his own uncomfortable belt  the tightness of fit under armpits and in the crotch and the mousy lack of color about his rough textured clothing .  wearing strange costumes to suit a century was an old story to him .   twissell was saying   now what i really wanted to do was to install hand controls inside the kettle  as we discussed  but there isn t any way  apparently .  the engineers simply must have a source of power large enough to handle temporal displacement and that isn t available outside eternity .  temporal tension while occupying the primitive is all that can be managed .  however  we have a return lever .    he led them into the kettle  picking his way among the piled supplies  and pointed out the obtruding finger of metal that now marred the smooth inner wall of the kettle .    it amounts to the installation of a simple switch   he said .   instead of returning automatically to eternity  the kettle will remain in the primitive indefinitely .  once the lever is plunged home  however  you will return .  there will then be the matter of the second and  i hope  final trip      a second trip .   asked noys at once .   harlan said   i haven t explained that .  look  this first trip is intended merely to fix the time of cooper s arrival precisely .  we don t know how long a time lapse exists between his arrival and the placing of the advertisement .  we ll reach him by the post office box  and learn  if possible  the exact minute of his arrival  or as close as we can  anyway .  we can then return to that moment plus fifteen minutes to allow for the kettle to have left cooper     twissell interposed   couldn t have the kettle in the same place at the same time in two different physiotimes  you know   and tried to smile .   noys seemed to absorb it .   i see   she said  not too definitely .   twissell said to noys   picking up cooper at the time of his arrival will reverse all micro changes .  the a bomb advertisement will disappear again and cooper will know only that the kettle  having disappeared as we told him it would  had unexpectedly appeared again .  he will not know that he was in the wrong century and he will not be told .  we will tell him that there was some vital instruction we had forgotten to give him  we ll have to manufacture some  and we can only hope that he will regard the matter as so unimportant that he won t mention being sent back twice when he writes his memoir .    noys lifted her plucked eyebrows .   it s very complicated .     yes .  unfortunately .   he rubbed his hands together and looked at the others as though nursing an inner doubt .  then he straightened  produced a fresh cigarette  and even managed a certain jauntiness as he said   and now  boy  good luck .   twissell touched hands briefly with harlan  nodded to noys  and stepped out of the kettle .    are we leaving now .   asked noys of harlan when they were alone .    in a few minutes   said harlan .   he glanced sideways at noys .  she was looking up at him  smiling  unfrightened .  momentarily his own spirits responded to that .  but that was emotion  not reason  he counciled himself  instinct  not thought .  he looked away .       the trip was nothing  or almost nothing  no different from an ordinary kettle ride .  midway there was a kind of internal jar that might have been the downwhen terminus and might have been purely psychosomatic .  it was barely noticeable .   and then they were in the primitive and they stepped into a craggy  lonely world brightened by the splendor of an afternoon sun .  there was a soft wind with a chilly edge to it and  most of all  silence .   the bare rocks were tumbled and mighty  colored into dull rainbows by compounds of iron  copper  and chromium .  the grandeur of the manless and all but lifeless surroundings dwarfed and shriveled harlan .  eternity  which did not belong to the world of matter  had no sun and none but imported air .  his memories of his own homewhen were dim .  his observations in the various centuries had dealt with men and their cities .  he had never experienced  this  .   noys touched his elbow .    andrew .  i m cold .    he turned to her with a start .   she said   hadn t we better set up the radiant .    he said   yes .  in cooper s cavern .     do you know where it is .     it s right here   he said shortly .   he had no doubt of that .  the memoir had located it and first cooper  now he  had been pin pointed back to it .   he had not doubted precision pin pointing in time travel since his cubhood days .  he remembered himself then  facing educator yarrow seriously  saying   but earth moves about the sun  and the sun moves about the galactic center and the galaxy moves too .  if you started from some point on earth  and move downwhen a hundred years  you ll be in empty space  because it will take a hundred years for earth to reach that point .    those were the days when he still referred to a century as a  hundred years .     and educator yarrow had snapped back   you don t separate time from space .  moving through time  you share earth s motions .  or do you believe that a bird flying through the air whiffs out into space because the earth is hurrying around the sun at eighteen miles a second and vanishes from under the creature .    arguing from analogy is risky  but harlan obtained more rigorous proof in later days and  now  after a scarcely precedented trip into the primitive  he could turn confidently and feel no surprise at finding the opening precisely where he had been told it would be .   he moved the camouflage of loose rubble and rock to one side and entered .   he probed the darkness within  using the white beam of his flash almost like a scalpel .  he scoured the walls  ceiling  floor  every inch .   noys  remaining close behind him  whispered   what are you looking for .    he said   something .  anything    he found his something  anything  at the very rear of the cave in the shape of a flattish stone covering greenish sheets like a paperweight .   harlan threw the stone aside and flipped the sheets past one thumb .    what are they .   asked noys .    bank notes .  medium of exchange .  money .     did you know they were there .     i knew nothing .  i just hoped .    it was only a matter of using twissell s reverse logic  of calculating cause from effect .  eternity existed  so cooper must be making correct decisions too .  in assuming the advertisement would pull harlan into the correct time  the cave was an obvious additional means of communication .   yet this was almost better than he had dared hope .  more than once during the preparations for his trip into the primitive  harlan had thought that making his way into a town with nothing but bullion in his possession would result in suspicion and delay .   cooper had managed  to be sure  but cooper had had time .  harlan hefted the sheaf of bills .  and he must have used time to accumulate this much .  he had done well  the youngster  marvelously well .   and the circle was closing .   the supplies had been moved into the cave  in the increasingly ruddy glow of the westering sun .  the kettle had been covered by a diffuse reflecting film which would hide it from any but the closest of prying eyes  and harlan had a blaster to take care of those  if need be .  the radiant was set up in the cave and the flash was wedged into a crevice  so that they had heat and light .   outside it was a chill march night .   noys stared thoughtfully into the smooth paraboloid interior of the radiant as it slowly rotated .  she said   andrew  what are your plans .     tomorrow morning   he said   i ll leave for the nearest town .  i know where it is  or should be .    he changed it back to  is  in his mind .  there would be no trouble .  twissell s logic again .     i ll come with you  won t i .    he shook his head .   you can t speak the language  for one thing  and the trip will be difficult enough for one to negotiate .    noys looked strangely archaic in her short hair and the sudden anger in her eyes made harlan look away uneasily .   she said   i m no fool  andrew .  you scarcely speak to me .  you don t look at me .  what is it .  is your homewhen morality taking hold .  do you feel you have betrayed eternity and are you blaming me for that .  do you feel i have corrupted you .  what is it .    he said   you don t know what i feel .    she said   then describe it .  you might as well .  you ll never have a chance as good as this one .  do you feel love .  for me .  you couldn t or you wouldn t be using me as a scapegoat .  why did you bring me here .  tell me .  why not have left me in eternity since you have no use for me here and since it seems you can hardly bear the sight of me .    harlan muttered   there s danger .     oh  come now .     it s more than danger .  it s a nightmare .  computer twissell s nightmare   said harlan .   it was during our last panicky flash upwhen into the hidden centuries that he told me of thoughts he had had concerning those centuries .  he speculated on the possibility of evolved varieties of man  new species  supermen perhaps  hiding in the far upwhen  cutting themselves off from our interference  plotting to end our tamperings with reality .  he thought it was they who built the barrier across the        th .  then we found you  and computer twissell abandoned his nightmare .  he decided there had never been a barrier .  he returned to the more immediate problem of salvaging eternity .    but i  you see  had been infected by his nightmare .  i had experienced the barrier  so i knew it existed .  no eternal had built it  for twissell said such a thing was theoretically impossible .  maybe eternity s theories didn t go far enough .  the barrier was there .  someone had built it .  or something .    of course   he went on thoughtfully   twissell was wrong in some ways .  he felt that man  must  evolve  but that s not so .  paleontology is not one of the sciences that interest eternals  but it interested the late primitives  so i picked up a bit of it myself .  i know this much  species evolve only to meet the pressures of new environments .  in a stable environment  a species may remain unchanged for millions of centuries .  primitive man evolved rapidly because his environment was a harsh and changing one .  once  however  mankind learned to create his own environment  he created a pleasant and stable one  so he just naturally stopped evolving .     i don t know what you re talking about   said noys  sounding not the least mollified   and you re not saying anything about us  which is what i want to talk about .    harlan managed to remain outwardly unmoved .  he said   now why the barrier at the        th .  what purpose did it serve .  you weren t harmed .  what other meaning could it have .  i asked myself  what happened because of its presence that would not have happened had it been absent .    he paused  looking at his clumsy and heavy boots of natural leather .  it occurred to him that he could add to his comfort by removing them for the night  but not now  not now  .   .   .   he said   there was only one answer to that question .  the existence of that barrier sent me raving back downwhen to get a neuronic whip  to assault finge .  it fired me to the thought of risking eternity to get you back and smashing eternity when i thought i had failed .  do you see .    noys stared at him with a mixture of horror and disbelief .   do you mean the people in the upwhen wanted you to do all that .  they planned it .      yes  .  don t look at me like that .   yes .   and don t you see how it makes everything different .  as long as i acted on my own  for reasons of my own  i ll take all the consequences  material and spiritual .  but to be  fooled  into it  to be  tricked  into it  by people handling and manipulating my emotions as though i were a computaplex on which it was only necessary to insert the properly perforated foils     harlan realized suddenly that he was shouting and stopped abruptly .  he let a few moments pass  then said   that is impossible to take .  i ve got to undo what i was marionetted into doing .  and when i undo it  i will be able to rest again .    and he would  perhaps .  he could feel the coming of an impersonal triumph  dissociated from the personal tragedy which lay behind and ahead .  the circle was closing .   noys s hand reached out uncertainly as though to take his own rigid  unyielding one .   harlan drew away  avoided her sympathy .  he said   it had all been arranged .  my meeting with you .  everything .  my emotional make up had been analyzed .  obviously .  action and response .  push this button and the man will do that .  push that button and he will do this .    harlan was speaking with difficulty  out of the depths of shame .  he shook his head  trying to shake the horror of it away as a dog would water  then went on .   one thing i didn t understand at first .  how did i come to guess that cooper was to be sent back into the primitive .  it was a most unlikely thing to guess .  i had no basis .  twissell didn t understand it .  more than once he wondered how i could have done it with so little understanding of mathematics .    yet i had .  the first time was that  that night .  you were asleep  but i wasn t .  i had the feeling then that there was something i must remember  some remark  some thought   something  that i had caught sight of in the excitement and exhilaration of the evening .  when i thought long  the whole significance of cooper sprang into my mind  and along with it the thought entered my mind that i was in a position to destroy eternity .  later i checked through histories of mathematics  but it was unnecessary really .  i already knew .  i was certain of it .  how .  how .    noys stared at him intently .  she didn t try to touch him now .   do you mean the men of the hidden centuries arranged that  too .  they put it all in your mind  then maneuvered you properly .     yes .  yes .  nor are they done .  there is still work for them to do .  the circle may be closing  but it is not yet closed .     how can they do anything now .  they re not here with us .     no .   he said the word in so hollow a voice that noys paled .    invisible superthings .   she whispered .    not superthings .  not invisible .  i told you man would not evolve while he controlled his own environment .  the people of the hidden centuries are homo sapiens .  ordinary people .     then they re certainly not here .    harlan said sadly   you re here  noys .     yes .  and you .  and no one else .     you and i   agreed harlan .   no one else .  a woman of the hidden centuries and i  .   .   .  don t act any more  noys .  please .    she stared at him with horror .   what are you saying  andrew .     what i must say .  what were you saying that evening  when you gave me the peppermint drink .  you were talking to me .  your soft voice  soft words  .   .   .  i heard nothing  not consciously  but i remember your delicate voice whispering .  about what .  the downwhen journey of cooper  the samson smash of eternity .  am i right .    noys said   i don t even know what samson smash means .     you can guess very accurately  noys .  tell me  when did you enter the    nd .  whom did you replace .  or did you just  squeeze in .  i had your life plot worked out by an expert in the     th .  in the new reality  you had no existence at all .  no analogue .  strange for such a small change  but not impossible .  and then the life plotter said one thing which i heard with my ears but not with my mind .  strange that i should remember it .  perhaps even then  something clanged in my mind  but i was too full of  you to listen .  he said    with the combination of factors you handed me  i don t quite see how she fit in the old reality  .     he was right .  you didn t fit in .  you were an invader from the far upwhen  manipulating me and finge  too  to suit yourself .    noys said urgently   andrew        it all fit in  if i had the eyes to look .  a book film in your house entitled  social and economic history  .  it surprised me when first i saw it .  you needed it  didn t you  to teach you how best to be a woman of the century .  another item .  our first trip into the hidden centuries  remember .   you  stopped the kettle at the        th .  you stopped it with finesse  without fumbling .  where did you learn to control a kettle .  if you were what you seemed to be  that would have been your first trip in a kettle .  why the        th  anyway .  was it your homewhen .    she said softly   why did you bring me to the primitive  andrew .    he shouted suddenly   to protect eternity .  i could not tell what damage you might do there .  here  you are helpless  because i know you .  admit that all i say is true .  admit it .    he rose in a paroxysm of wrath  arm upraised .  she did not flinch .  she was utterly calm .  she might have been modeled out of warm  beautiful wax .  harlan did not complete his motion .   he said   admit it .    she said   are you so uncertain  after all your deductions .  what will it matter to you whether i admit it or not .    harlan felt the wildness mount .   admit it  anyway  so that i need feel no pain at all .  none at all .     pain .     because i have a blaster  noys  and it is my intention to kill you .           the beginning of infinity    there was a crawling uncertainty inside harlan  an irresolution that was consuming him .  he had the blaster in his hand .  it was aimed at noys .   but why did she say nothing .  why did she persist in this impassive attitude .   how could he kill her .   how could he not kill her .   he said hoarsely   well .    she moved  but it was only to clasp her hands loosely in her lap  to look more relaxed  more aloof .  when she spoke her voice seemed scarcely that of a human being .  facing the muzzle of a blaster  it yet gained assurance and took on an almost mystic quality of impersonal strength .   she said   you cannot wish to kill me only in order to protect eternity .  if that were your desire  you could stun me  tie me firmly  pin me within this cave and then take to your travels in the dawn .  or you might have asked computer twissell to keep me in solitary confinement during your absence in the primitive .  or you might take me with you at dawn  lose me in the wastes .  if it is only killing that will satisfy you  it is only because you think that i have betrayed you  that i have tricked you into love first in order that i might trick you into treason later .  this is murder out of wounded pride and not at all the just retribution you tell yourself it is .    harlan squirmed .   are you from the hidden centuries .  tell me .    noys said   i am .  will you now blast .    harlan s finger trembled on the blaster s contact point .  yet he hesitated .  something irrational within him could still plead her case and point up the remnants of his own futile love and longing .  was she desperate at his rejection of her .  was she deliberately courting death by lying .  was she indulging in foolish heroics born of despair at his doubts of her .    no .    the book films of the sickly sweet literary traditions of the    th might have it so  but not a girl like noys .  she was not one to meet her death at the hands of a false lover with the joyful masochism of a broken  bleeding lily .   then was she scornfully denying his ability to kill her for any reason whatever .  was she confidently relying on the attraction she knew she had for him even now  certain that it would immobilize him  freeze him in weakness and shame .   that hit too closely .  his finger clamped a bit harder on the contact .   noys spoke again .   you re waiting .  does that mean you expect me to enter a brief for the defense .     what defense .   harlan tried to make that scornful  yet he welcomed the diversion .  it could postpone the moment when he must look down upon her blasted body  upon whatever remnants of bloody flesh might remain  and know that what had been done to his beautiful noys had been done by his own hand .   he found excuses for his delay .  he thought feverishly  let her talk .  let her tell what she can about the hidden centuries .  so much better protection for eternity .   it put a front of firm policy on his action and for the moment he could look at her with as calm a face  almost  as she looked at him .   noys might have read his mind .  she said   do you want to know about the hidden centuries .  if that will be a defense  it is easily done .  would you like to know  for instance  why earth is empty of mankind after the        th .  would you be interested .    harlan wasn t going to plead for knowledge  nor was he going to buy knowledge .  he had the blaster .  he was very intent on no show of weakness .   he said   talk .   and flushed at the little smile which was her first response to his exclamation .   she said   at a moment in physiotime before eternity had reached very far upwhen  before it had reached even the       th  we of our century  and you re right  it was the        th  learned of eternity s existence .  we  toe  had time travel  you see  but it was based on a completely different set of postulates than yours  and we preferred to view time  rather than shifting mass .  furthermore  we dealt with our past only  our downwhen .    we discovered eternity indirectly .  first  we developed the calculus of realities and tested our own reality through it .  we were amazed to find we lived in a reality of rather low probability .  it was a serious question .  why such an improbable reality .   .   .   .  you seem abstracted  andrew .  are you interested at all .    harlan heard her say his name with all the intimate tenderness she had used in weeks past .  it should grate on him now  anger him with its cynical faithlessness .  and yet it didn t .   he said desperately   go on and get it over with  woman .    he tried to balance the warmth of her  andrew  with the chill anger of his  woman  and yet she only smiled again  pallidly .   she said   we searched back through time and came across the growing eternity .  it seemed obvious to us almost at once that there had been at one point in physiotime  a conception we have also  but under another name  another reality .  the other reality  the one of maximum probability we call the basic state .  the basic state had encompassed us once  or had encompassed our analogues  at least .  at the time we could not say what the nature of the basic state was .  we could not possibly know .    we did know  however  that some change initiated by eternity in the far downwhen had managed  through the workings of statistical chance  to alter the basic state all the way up to our century and beyond .  we set about determining the nature of the basic state  intending to undo the evil  if evil it was .  first we set up the quarantined area you call the hidden centuries  isolating the eternals on the downwhen side of the       th .  this armor of isolation would affect us from all but a vanishingly small percentage of the changes being made .  it wasn t absolute security but it gave us time .    we next did something our culture and ethics did not ordinarily allow us to do .  we investigated our own future  our upwhen .  we learned the destiny of man in the reality that actually existed in order that we might compare it eventually with basic state .  somewhere past the        th  mankind solved the secret of the interstellar drive .  they learned how to manage the jump through hyperspace .  finally  mankind could reach the stars .    harlan was listening in growing absorption to her measured words .  how much truth was there in all this .  how much was a calculated attempt to deceive him .  he tried to break the spell by speaking  by breaking the smooth flow of her sentences .  he said    and once they could reach the stars  they did so and left the earth .  some of us have guessed that .     then some of you have guessed wrong .  man  tried  to leave earth .  unfortunately  however  we are not alone in the galaxy .  there are other stars with other planets  you know .  there are even other intelligences .  none  in this galaxy at least  are as ancient as mankind  but in the         centuries man remained on earth  younger minds caught up and passed us  developed the interstellar drive  and colonized the galaxy .    when we moved out into space  the signs were up .   occupied .  no trespassing .  clear out .   mankind drew back its exploratory feelers  remained at home .  but now he knew earth for what it was  a prison surrounded by an infinity of freedom  .   .   .  and mankind died out .    harlan said   just died out .  nonsense .     they didn t  just  die out .  it took thousands of centuries .  there were ups and downs but  on the whole  there was a loss of purpose  a sense of futility  a feeling of hopelessness that could not be overcome .  eventually there was one last decline of the birth rate and finally  extinction .  your eternity did that .    harlan could defend eternity now  the more intensely and extravagantly for having so shortly before attacked it so keenly .  he said   let us at the hidden centuries and we will correct that .  we have not failed yet to achieve the greatest good in those centuries we could reach .     the greatest good .   asked noys in a detached tone that seemed to make a mockery of the phrase .   what is that .  your machines tell you .  your computaplexes .  but who adjusts the machines and tells them what to weigh in the balance .  the machines do not solve problems with greater insight than men do  only faster .  only faster .  then what is it the eternals consider good .  i ll tell you .  safety and security .  moderation .  nothing in excess .  no risks without overwhelming certainty of an adequate return .    harlan swallowed .  with sudden force he remembered twissell s words in the kettle while talking about the evolved men of the hidden centuries .  he said    we bred out the unusual  .    and wasn t it so .    well   said noys   you seem to be thinking .  think of this  then .  in the reality that now exists  why is it that man is continually attempting space travel and continually failing .  surely each space travel era must know of previous failures .  why try again  then .    harlan said   i haven t studied the matter .   but he thought uneasily of the colonies on mars  established again and again  always failing .  he thought of the odd attraction that space flight always had  even for eternals .  he could hear sociologist kantor voy of the     th  sighing at the loss of electro gravitic space flight in one century  and saying longingly    it had been very beautiful  .   and life plotter neron feruque  who had sworn bitterly at its passing and had launched into a fit of railing at eternity s handling of anti cancer serums to case his spirit .    was  there such a thing as an instinctive yearning on the part of intelligent beings to expand outward  to reach the stars  to leave the prison of gravity behind .  was it that which forced man to develop interplanetary travel dozens of times  forced him to travel over and over again to the dead worlds of a solar system in which only earth was livable .  was it the eventual failure  the knowledge that one must return to the home prison  that brought about the maladjustments that eternity was forever fighting .  harlan thought of the drug addiction in those same futile centuries of the electro gravitics .   noys said   in ironing out the disasters of reality  eternity rules out the triumphs as well .  it is in meeting the great tests that mankind can most successfully rise to great heights .  out of danger and restless insecurity comes the force that pushes mankind to newer and loftier conquests .  can you understand that .  can you understand that in averting the pitfalls and miseries that beset man  eternity prevents men from finding their own bitter and better solutions  the real solutions that come from conquering difficulty  not avoiding it .    harlan began woodenly   the greatest good of the greatest number       noys cut in .   suppose eternity had never been established .     well .     i ll tell you what would have happened .  the energies that went into temporal engineering would have gone into nucleonics instead .  eternity would not have come but the interstellar drive would .  man would have reached the stars more than a hundred thousand centuries before he did in this current reality .  the stars would then have been untenanted and mankind would have established itself throughout the galaxy .   we  would have been first .     and what would have been gained .   asked harlan doggedly .   would we be happier .     whom do you mean by  we  .  man would not be a world but a million worlds  a billion worlds .  we would have the infinite in our grasp .  each world would have its own stretch of the centuries  each its own values  a chance to seek happiness after ways of its own in an environment of its own .  there are many happinesses  many goods  infinite variety .   .   .   .   that  is the basic state of mankind .     you re guessing   said harlan  and he was angry at himself for feeling attraction for the picture she had conjured .   how can you tell what would have happened .    noys said   you smile at the ignorance of the timers who know only one reality .  we smile at the ignorance of the eternals who think there are many realities but that only one exists at a time .     what does that gibberish mean .     we don t calculate alternate realities .  we view them .  we see them in their state of non reality .     a kind of ghostly never never land where the might have beens play with the ifs .     without the sarcasm  yes .     and how do you do that .    noys paused  then said   how can i explain that  andrew .  i have been educated to know certain things without really understanding all about them  just as you have .  can you explain the workings of a computaplex .  yet you know it exists and works .    harlan flushed .   well  then .    noys said   we learned to view realities and we found basic state to be as i have described .  we found  too  the change that had destroyed basic state .  it was not any change that eternity had initiated  it was the establishment of eternity itself  the mere fact of its existence .  any system like eternity  which allows men to choose their own future  will end by choosing safety and mediocrity  and in such a reality the stars are out of reach .  the mere existence of eternity at once wiped out the galactic empire .  to restore it  eternity must be done away with .    the number of realities is infinite .  the number of any subclass of realities is also infinite .  for instance  the number of realities containing eternity is infinite  the number in which eternity does not exist is infinite  the number in which eternity does exist but is abolished is also infinite .  but my people chose from among the infinite a group that involved me .    i had nothing to do with that .  they educated me for my job as twissell and yourself educated cooper for his job .  but the number of realities in which i was the agent in destroying eternity was also infinite .  i was offered a choice among five realities that seemed least complex .  i chose this one  the one involving you  the only reality system involving you .    harlan said   why did you choose it .    noys looked away .   because i loved you  you see .  i loved you long before i met you .    harlan was shaken .  she said it with such depths of sincerity .  he thought  sickly  she s an actress    he said   that s rather ridiculous .     is it .  i studied the realities at my disposal .  i studied the reality in which i went back to the    nd  met first finge  then you .  the one in which you came to me and loved me  in which you took me into eternity and the far upwhen of my own century  in which you misdirected cooper  and in which you and i  together  returned to the primitive .  we lived in the primitive for the rest of our days .  i saw our lives together and they were happy and i loved you .  so it s not ridiculous at all .  i chose this alternative so that our love might be true .    harlan said   all this is false .  it s false .  how can you expect me to believe you .   he stopped  then said suddenly   wait .  you say you knew all this in advance .  all that would happen .     yes .     then you re obviously lying .  you would have known that i would have you here at blaster point .  you would have known you would fail .  what is your answer to that .    she sighed lightly   i told you there are an infinite number of any subclass of realities .  no matter how finely we focus on a given reality it always represents an infinite number of very similar realities .  there are fuzzy spots .  the finer we focus  the less fuzzy  but perfect sharpness cannot be obtained .  the less fuzzy  the lower the probability of chance variation spoiling the result  but the probability is never absolutely zero .  one fuzzy spot spoiled things .     which .     you were to have come back to the far upwhen after the barrier at the        th had been lowered and you did .  but you were to have come back alone .  it is for that reason that i was momentarily so startled at seeing computer twisseil with you .    again harlan was troubled .  how she made things fit in .   noys said   i would have been even more startled  had i realized the significance of that alteration in full .  had you come alone  you would have brought me back to the primitive as you did .  then  for love of humanity  for love of me  you would have left cooper untouched .  your circle would have been broken  eternity ended  our life together here safe .    but you came with twissell  a chance variation .  while coming  he talked to you of his thoughts about the hidden centuries and started you on a train of deductions that ended with your doubting my good faith .  it ended with a blaster between us .   .   .   .  and now  andrew  that s the story .  you may blast me .  there is nothing to stop you .    harlan s hand ached from its spastic grasp on the blaster .  he shifted it dizzily to the other hand .  was there no flaw in her story .  where was the resolution he was to have gained from knowing certainly that she was a creature of the hidden centuries .  he was more than ever tearing at himself in conflict and dawn was approaching .   he said   why two efforts to end eternity .  why couldn t eternity have ended once and for all when i sent cooper back to the   th .   things would have ended then and there would not have been this agony of uncertainty .     because   said noys   ending this eternity is not enough .  we must reduce the probability of establishing any form of eternity to as near zero as we can manage .  so there is one thing we must do here in the primitive .  a small change  a little thing .  you know what a minimum necessary change is like .  it is only a letter to a peninsula called italy here in the   th .  it is now the    .   nd .  in a few centicenturies  provided i send the letter  a man of italy will begin experimenting with the neutronic bombardment of uranium .    harlan found himself horrified .   you will alter primitive history .     yes .  it is our intention .  in the new reality  the final reality  the first nuclear explosion will take place not in the   th century but in the    .   th .     but do you know the danger .  can you possibly estimate the danger .     we know the danger .  we have viewed the sheaf of resulting realities .  there is a probability  not a certainty  of course  that earth will end with a largely radioactive crust  but before that        you mean there can be compensation for that .     a galactic empire .  an actual intensification of the basic state .     yet you accuse the eternals of interfering        we accuse them of interfering many times to keep mankind safely at home and in prison .  we interfere once  once  to turn him prematurely to nucleonics so that he might never   never   establish an eternity .     no   said harlan desperately .   there must be an eternity .     if you choose .  it is yours to choose .  if you wish to have psychopaths dictate the future of man       psychopaths .    exploded harlan .    aren t they .  you know them .  think .    harlan stared at her in outraged horror  yet he could not help thinking .  he thought of cubs learning the truth about reality and cub latourette trying to kill himself as a result .  latourette had survived to become an eternal  with what scars on his personality none could say  yet helping to decide on alternate realities .   he thought of the caste system in eternity  of the abnormal life that turned guilt feelings into anger and hatred against technicians .  he thought of computers  struggling against themselves  of finge intriguing against twissell and twissell spying on finge .  he thought of sennor  fighting his bald head by fighting all the eternals .   he thought of himself .   then he thought of twissell  the great twissell  also breaking the laws of eternity .   it was as though he had always known eternity to be all this .  why else should he have been so willing to destroy it .  yet he had never admitted it to himself fully  he had never looked it clearly in the face  until  suddenly  now .   and he saw eternity with great clarity as a sink of deepening psychoses  a writhing pit of abnormal motivation  a mass of desperate lives torn brutally out of context .   he looked blankly at noys .   she said softly   do you see .  come to the mouth of the cave with me  andrew .    he followed her  hypnotized  appalled at the completeness with which he had gained a new viewpoint .  his blaster fell away from the line connecting it and noys s heart for the first time .       the pale streakings of dawn grayed the sky  and the bulking kettle just outside the cave was an oppressive shadow against the pallor .  its outlines were dulled and blurred by the film thrown over it .   noys said   this is earth .  not the eternal and only home of mankind  but only a starting point of an infinite adventure .  all you need do is make the decision .  it is yours to make .  you and i and the contents of this cave will be protected by a physiotime field against the change .  cooper will disappear along with his advertisement  eternity will go and the reality of my century  but we will remain to have children and grandchildren  and mankind will remain to reach the stars .    he turned to look at her  and she was smiling at him .  it was noys as she had been  and his own heart beating as it had used to .   he wasn t even aware that he had made his decision until the grayness suddenly invaded all the sky as the hulk of the kettle disappeared from against it .   with that disappearance  he knew  even as noys moved slowly into his arms  came the end  the final end of eternity .     and the beginning of infinity .
