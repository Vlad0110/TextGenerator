terry pratchett   sourcery     a novel of discworld        dedication   many years ago i saw  in bath  a very large american lady towing a huge tartan suitcase very fast on little rattly wheels which caught in the pavement cracks and generally gave it a life of its own .  at that moment the luggage was born .  many thanks to that lady and everyone else in places like power cable  neb .   who don   t get nearly enough encouragement .   this book does not contain a map .  please feel free to draw your own .       there was a man and he had eight sons .  apart from that  he was nothing more than a comma on the page of history .  it   s sad  but that   s all you can say about some people .   but the eighth son grew up and married and had eight sons  and because there is only one suitable profession for the eighth son of an eighth son  he became a wizard .  and he became wise and powerful  or at any rate powerful  and wore a pointed hat and there it would have ended     should have ended     but against the lore of magic and certainly against all reason   except the reasons of the heart  which are warm and messy and  well  unreasonable   he fled the halls of magic and fell in love and got married  not necessarily in that order .   and he had seven sons  each one from the cradle at least as powerful as any wizard in the world .   and then he had an eighth son     a wizard squared .  a source of magic .   a sourcerer .      summer thunder rolled around the sandy cliffs .  far below  the sea sucked on the shingle as noisily as an old man with one tooth who had been given a gobstopper .  a few seagulls hung lazily in the updraughts  waiting for something to happen .   and the father of wizards sat among the thrift and rattling sea grasses at the edge of the cliff  cradling the child in his arms  staring out to sea .   there was a roil of black cloud out there  heading inland  and the light it pushed before it had that deep syrup quality it gets before a really serious thunderstorm .   he turned at a sudden silence behind him  and looked up through tear reddened eyes at a tall hooded figure in a black robe .   ipslore the red .  it said .  the voice was as hollow as a cave  as dense as a neutron star .   ipslore grinned the terrible grin of the suddenly mad  and held up the child for death   s inspection .      my son     he said .     i shall call him coin .      a name as good as any other  said death politely .  his empty sockets stared down at a small round face wrapped in sleep .  despite rumor  death isn   t cruel   merely terribly  terribly good at his job .      you took his mother     said ipslore .  it was a flat statement  without apparent rancor .  in the valley behind the cliffs ipslore   s homestead was a smoking ruin  the rising wind already spreading the fragile ashes across the hissing dunes .   it was a heart attack at the end  said death .  there are worse ways to die .  take it from me .   ipslore looked out to sea .     all my magic could not save her     he said .   there are places where even magic may not go .      and now you have come for the child .      no .  the child has his own destiny .  i have come for you .      ah .     the wizard stood up  carefully laid the sleeping baby down on the thin grass  and picked up a long staff that had been lying there .  it was made of a black metal  with a meshwork of silver and gold carvings that gave it a rich and sinister tastelessness  the metal was octiron  intrinsically magical .      i made this  you know     he said .     they all said you couldn   t make a staff out of metal  they said they should only be of wood  but they were wrong .  i put a lot of myself into it .  i shall give it to him .      he ran his hands lovingly along the staff  which gave off a faint tone .   he repeated  almost to himself     i put a lot of myself into it .      it is a good staff  said death .   ipslore held it in the air and looked down at his eighth son  who gave a gurgle .      she wanted a daughter     he said .   death shrugged .  ipslore gave him a look compounded of bewilderment and rage .      what is he .      the eighth son of an eighth son of an eighth son  said death  unhelpfully .  the wind whipped at his robe  driving the black clouds overhead .      what does that make him .      a sourcerer  as you are well aware .   thunder rolled  on cue .      what is his destiny .     shouted ipslore  above the rising gale .   death shrugged again .  he was good at it .   sourcerers make their own destiny .  they touch the earth lightly .   ipslore leaned on the staff  drumming on it with his fingers  apparently lost in the maze of his own thoughts .  his left eyebrow twitched .      no     he said  softly     no .  i will make his destiny for him .      i advise against it .      be quiet .  and listen when i tell you that they drove me out  with their books and their rituals and their lore .  they called themselves wizards  and they had less magic in their whole fat bodies than i have in my little finger .  banished .  me .  for showing that i was human .  and what would humans be without love .      rare  said death .  nevertheless        listen .  they drove us here  to the ends of the world  and that killed her .  they tried to take my staff away .     ipslore was screaming above the noise of the wind .      well  i still have some power left     he snarled .     and i say that my son shall go to unseen university and wear the archchancellor   s hat and the wizards of the world shall bow to him .  and he shall show them what lies in their deepest hearts .  their craven  greedy hearts .  he   ll show the world its true destiny  and there will be no magic greater than his .      no .  and the strange thing about the quiet way death spoke the word was this  it was louder than the roaring of the storm .  it jerked ipslore back to momentary sanity .   ipslore rocked back and forth uncertainly .     what .     he said .   i said no .  nothing is final .  nothing is absolute .  except me  of course .  such tinkering with destiny could mean the downfall of the world .  there must be a chance  however small .  the lawyers of fate demand a loophole in every prophecy .   ipslore stared at death   s implacable face .      i must give them a chance .      yes .   tap  tap  tap went ipslore   s fingers on the metal of the staff .      then they shall have their chance     he said     when hell freezes over .      no .  i am not allowed to enlighten you  even by default  about current temperatures in the next world .      then     ipslore hesitated     then they shall have their chance when my son throws his staff away .      no wizard would ever throw his staff away  said death .  the bond is too great .      yet it is possible  you must agree .      death appeared to consider this .  must was not a word he was accustomed to hearing  but he seemed to concede the point .   agreed  he said .      is that a small enough chance for you .      sufficiently molecular .   ipslore relaxed a little .  in a voice that was nearly normal  he said     i don   t regret it  you know .  i would do it all again .  children are our hope for the future .      there is no hope for the future  said death .      what does it contain  then .      me .      besides you  i mean .      death gave him a puzzled look .  i   m sorry .   the storm reached its howling peak overhead .  a seagull went past backwards .      i meant     said ipslore  bitterly     what is there in this world that makes living worthwhile .      death thought about it .   cats  he said eventually  cats are nice .      curse you .      many have  said death  evenly .      how much longer do i have .      death pulled a large hourglass from the secret recesses of his robe .  the two bulbs were enclosed in bars of black and gold  and the sand was nearly all in the bottom one .   oh  about nine seconds .   ipslore pulled himself up to his full and still impressive height  and extended the gleaming metal staff toward the child .  a hand like a little pink crab reached out from the blanket and grasped it .      then let me be the first and last wizard in the history of the world to pass on his staff to his eighth son     he said slowly and sonorously .     and i charge him to use it to     i should hurry up  if i were you           the full     said ipslore     becoming the mightiest        the lightning screamed from the heart of the cloud  hit ipslore on the point of his hat  crackled down his arm  flashed along the staff and struck the child .   the wizard vanished in a wisp of smoke .  the staff glowed green  then white  then merely red hot .  the child smiled in his sleep .   when the thunder had died away death reached down slowly and picked up the boy  who opened his eyes .   they glowed golden  from the inside .  for the first time in what  for want of any better word  must be called his life  death found himself looking at a stare that he found hard to return .  the eyes seemed to be focused on a point several inches inside his skull .   i did not mean for that to happen  said the voice of ipslore  from out of the empty air .  is he harmed .   no .  death tore his gaze away from that fresh  knowing smile .  he contained the power .  he is a sourcerer  no doubt he will survive much worse .  and now   you will come with me .   no .   yes .  you are dead  you see .  death looked around for ipslore   s wavering shade  and failed to find it .  where are you .   in the staff .   death leaned on his scythe and sighed .   foolish .  how easily could i cut you loose .   not without destroying the staff  said the voice of ipslore  and it seemed to death that there was a new  thick  exultant quality to it .  and now the child has accepted the staff you cannot destroy it without destroying him .  and that you cannot do without upsetting destiny .  my last magic .  rather neat  i feel .   death prodded the staff .  it crackled  and sparks crawled obscenely along its length .   strangely enough  he wasn   t particularly angry .  anger is an emotion  and for emotion you need glands  and death didn   t have much truck with glands and needed a good run at it to get angry .  but he was mildly annoyed .  he sighed again .  people were always trying this sort of thing .  on the other hand  it was quite interesting to watch  and at least this was a bit more original than the usual symbolic chess game  which death always dreaded because he could never remember how the knight was supposed to move .   you   re only putting off the inevitable  he said .   that   s what being alive is all about .   but what precisely do you expect to gain .   i shall be by my son   s side .  i shall teach him  even though he won   t know it .  i shall guide his understanding .  and  when he is ready  i shall guide his steps .   tell me  said death  how did you guide the steps of your other sons .   i drove them out .  they dared to argue with me  they would not listen to what i could teach them .  but this one will .   is this wise .   the staff was silent .  beside it  the boy chuckled at the sound of a voice only he could hear .       there was no analogy for the way in which great a   tuin the world turtle moved against the galactic night .  when you are ten thousand miles long  your shell pocked with meteor craters and frosted with comet ice  there is absolutely nothing you can realistically be like except yourself .   so great a   tuin swam slowly through the interstellar deeps like the largest turtle there has ever been  carrying on its carapace the four huge elephants that bore on their backs the vast  glittering waterfall fringed circle of the discworld  which exists either because of some impossible blip on the curve of probability or because the gods enjoy a joke as much as anyone .   more than most people  in fact .   near the shores of the circle sea  in the ancient  sprawling city of ankh morpork  on a velvet cushion on a ledge high up in the unseen university  was a hat .   it was a good hat .  it was a magnificent hat .   it was pointy  of course  with a wide floppy brim  but after disposing of these basic details the designer had really got down to business .  there was gold lace on there  and pearls  and bands of purest vermine  and sparkling ankhstones    and some incredibly tasteless sequins  and   a dead giveaway  of course   a circle of octarines .   since they weren   t in a strong magical field at the moment they weren   t glowing  and looked like rather inferior diamonds .   spring had come to ankh morpork .  it wasn   t immediately apparent  but there were signs that were obvious to the cognoscenti .  for example  the scum on the river ankh  that great wide slow waterway that served the double city as reservoir  sewer and frequent morgue  had turned a particularly iridescent green .  the city   s drunken rooftops sprouted mattresses and bolsters as the winter bedding was put out to air in the weak sunshine  and in the depths of musty cellars the beams twisted and groaned when their dry sap responded to the ancient call of root and forest .  birds nested among the gutters and eaves of unseen university  although it was noticeable that however great the pressure on the nesting sites they never  ever  made nests in the invitingly open mouths of the gargoyles that lined the rooftops  much to the gargoyles    disappointment .   a kind of spring had even come to the ancient university itself .  tonight would be the eve of small gods  and a new archchancellor would be elected .   well  not exactly elected  because wizards didn   t have any truck with all this undignified voting business  and it was well known that archchancellors were selected by the will of the gods  and this year it was a pretty good bet that the gods would see their way clear to selecting old virrid wayzygoose  who was a decent old boy and had been patiently waiting his turn for years .   the archchancellor of unseen university was the official leader of all the wizards on the disc .  once upon a time it had meant that he would be the most powerful in the handling of magic  but times were a lot quieter now and  to be honest  senior wizards tended to look upon actual magic as a bit beneath them .  they tended to prefer administration  which was safer and nearly as much fun  and also big dinners .   and so the long afternoon wore on .  the hat squatted on its faded cushion in wayzygoose   s chambers  while he sat in his tub in front of the fire and soaped his beard .  other wizards dozed in their studies  or took a gentle stroll around the gardens in order to work up an appetite for the evening   s feast  about a dozen steps was usually considered quite sufficient .   in the great hall  under the carved or painted stares of two hundred earlier archchancellors  the butler   s staff set out the long tables and benches .  in the vaulted maze of the kitchens   well  the imagination should need no assistance .  it should include lots of grease and heat and shouting  vats of caviar  whole roast oxen  strings of sausages like paperchains strung from wall to wall  the head chef himself at work in one of the cold rooms putting the finishing touches to a model of the university carved for some inexplicable reason out of butter .  he kept doing this every time there was a feast   butter swans  butter buildings  whole rancid greasy yellow menageries   and he enjoyed it so much no one had the heart to tell him to stop .   in his own labyrinth of cellars the butler prowled among his casks  decanting and tasting .   the air of expectation had even spread to the ravens who inhabited the tower of art  eight hundred feet high and reputedly the oldest building in the world .  its crumbling stones supported thriving miniature forests high above the city   s rooftops .  entire species of beetles and small mammals had evolved up there and  since people rarely climbed it these days owing to the tower   s distressing tendency to sway in the breeze  the ravens had it all to themselves .  now they were flying around it in a state of some agitation  like gnats before a thunderstorm .  if anyone below is going to take any notice of them it might be a good idea .   something horrible was about to happen .   you can tell  can   t you .      you   re not the only one .      what   s got into them .     shouted rincewind above the din .   the librarian ducked as a leather bound grimoire shot out from its shelf and jerked to a mid air halt on the end of its chain .  then he dived  rolled and landed on a copy of maleficio   s discouverie of demonologie that was industriously bashing at its lectern .      oook .     he said .   rincewind put his shoulder against a trembling bookshelf and forced its rustling volumes back into place with his knees .  the noise was terrible .   books of magic have a sort of life of their own .  some have altogether too much  for example  the first edition of the necrotelicomicon has to be kept between iron plates  the true arte of levitatione has spent the last one hundred and fifty years up in the rafters  and ge fordge   s compenydyum of sex majick is kept in a vat of ice in a room all by itself and there   s a strict rule that it can only be read by wizards who are over eighty and  if possible  dead .   but even the everyday grimoires and incunabula on the main shelves were as restless and nervy as the inmates of a chicken house with something rank scrabbling under the door .  from their shut covers came a muffled scratching  like claws .      what did you say .     screamed rincewind .      oook .          right .      rincewind  as honorary assistant librarian  hadn   t progressed much beyond basic indexing and banana fetching  and he had to admire the way the librarian ambled among the quivering shelves  here running a black leather hand over a trembling binding  here comforting a frightened thesaurus with a few soothing simian murmurings .   after a while the library began to settle down  and rincewind felt his shoulder muscles relax .   it was a fragile peace  though .  here and there a page rustled .  from distant shelves came the ominous creak of a spine .  after its initial panic the library was now as alert and jittery as a long tailed cat in a rocking chair factory .   the librarian ambled back down the aisles .  he had a face that only a lorry tire could love and it was permanently locked in a faint smile  but rincewind could tell by the way the ape crept into his cubbyhole under the desk and hid his head under a blanket that he was deeply worried .   examine rincewind  as he peers around the sullen shelves .  there are eight levels of wizardry on the disc  after sixteen years rincewind has failed to achieve even level one .  in fact it is the considered opinion of some of his tutors that he is incapable even of achieving level zero  which most normal people are born at  to put it another way  it has been suggested that when rincewind dies the average occult ability of the human race will actually go up by a fraction .   he is tall and thin and has the scrubby kind of beard that looks like the kind of beard worn by people who weren   t cut out by nature to be beard wearers .  he is dressed in a dark red robe that has seen better days  possibly better decades .  but you can tell he   s a wizard  because he   s got a pointy hat with a floppy brim .  it   s got the word    wizzard    embroidered on it in big silver letters  by someone whose needlework is even worse than their spelling .  there   s a star on top .  it has lost most of its sequins .   clamping his hat on his head  rincewind pushed his way through the library   s ancient doors and stepped out into the golden light of the afternoon .  it was calm and quiet  broken only by the hysterical croaking of the ravens as they circled the tower of art .   rincewind watched them for a while .  the university   s ravens were a tough bunch of birds .  it took a lot to unsettle them .   on the other hand        the sky was pale blue tinted with gold  with a few high wisps of fluffy cloud glowing pinkly in the lengthening light .  the ancient chestnut trees in the quadrangle were in full bloom .  from an open window came the sound of a student wizard practicing the violin  rather badly .  it was not what you would call ominous .   rincewind leaned against the warm stonework .  and screamed .   the building was shuddering .  he could feel it come up through his hand and along his arms  a faint rhythmic sensation at just the right frequency to suggest uncontrollable terror .  the stones themselves were frightened .   he looked down in horror at a faint clinking noise .  an ornamental drain cover fell backwards and one of the university   s rats poked its whiskers out .  it gave rincewind a desperate look as it scrambled up and fled past him  followed by dozens of its tribe .  some of them were wearing clothes but that wasn   t unusual for the university  where the high level of background magic does strange things to genes .   as he stared around him rincewind could see other streams of gray bodies leaving the university by every drainpipe and flowing toward the outside wall .  the ivy by his ear rustled and a group of rats made a series of death defying leaps onto his shoulders and slid down his robe .  they otherwise ignored him totally but  again  this wasn   t particularly unusual .  most creatures ignored rincewind .   he turned and fled into the university  skirts flapping around his knees  until he reached the bursar   s study .  he hammered on the door  which creaked open .      ah .  it   s  um  rincewind  isn   t it .     said the bursar  without much enthusiasm .     what   s the matter .         we   re sinking .      the bursar stared at him for a few moments .  his name was spelter .  he was tall and wiry and looked as though he had been a horse in previous lives and had only just avoided it in this one .  he always gave people the impression that he was looking at them with his teeth .      sinking .         yes .  all the rats are leaving .      the bursar gave him another stare .      come inside  rincewind     he said  kindly .  rincewind followed him into the low  dark room and across to the window .  it looked out over the gardens to the river  oozing peacefully toward the sea .      you haven   t been  um  overdoing it .     said the bursar .      overdoing what .     said rincewind  guiltily .      this is a building  you see     said the bursar .  like most wizards when faced with a puzzle  he started to roll himself a cigarette .     it   s not a ship .  there are ways of telling  you know .  absence of porpoises frolicking around the bows  a shortage of bilges  that sort of thing .  the chances of foundering are remote .  otherwise  um  we   d have to man the sheds and row for shore .  um .         but the rats           grain ship in harbor  i expect .  some  um  springtime ritual .         i   m sure i felt the building shaking  too     said rincewind  a shade uncertainly .  here in this quiet room  with the fire crackling in the grate  it didn   t seem quite so real .      a passing tremor .  great a   tuin hiccuping  um  possibly .  a grip on yourself  um  is what you should get .  you haven   t been drinking  have you .         no .         um .  would you like to .      spelter padded over to a dark oak cabinet and pulled out a couple of glasses  which he filled from the water jug .      i tend to be best at sherry this time of day     he said  and spread his hands over the glasses .     say  um  the word   sweet or dry .         um  no     said rincewind .     perhaps you   re right .  i think i   ll go and have a bit of rest .         good idea .      rincewind wandered down the chilly stone passages .  occasionally he   d touch the wall and appear to be listening  and then he   d shake his head .   as he crossed the quadrangle again he saw a herd of mice swarm over a balcony and scamper toward the river .  the ground they were running over seemed to be moving  too .  when rincewind looked closer he could see that it was because it was covered with ants .   these weren   t ordinary ants .  centuries of magical leakage into the walls of the university had done strange things to them .  some of them were pulling very small carts  some of them were riding beetles  but all of them were leaving the university as quickly as possible .  the grass on the lawn rippled as they passed .   he looked up as an elderly striped mattress was extruded from an upper window and flopped down onto the flagstones below .  after a pause  apparently to catch its breath  it rose a little from the ground .  then it started to float purposefully across the lawn and bore down on rincewind  who managed to jump out of its way just in time .  he heard a high pitched chittering and caught a glimpse of thousands of determined little legs under the bulging fabric before it hurtled onward .  even the bedbugs were on the move  and in case they didn   t find such comfortable quarters elsewhere they were leaving nothing to chance .  one of them waved at him and squeaked a greeting .   rincewind backed away until something touched the back of his legs and froze his spine .  it turned out to be a stone seat .  he watched it for some time .  it didn   t seem in any hurry to run away .  he sat down gratefully .   there   s probably a natural explanation  he thought .  or a perfectly normal unnatural one  anyway .   a gritty noise made him look across the lawn .   there was no natural explanation of this .  with incredible slowness  easing themselves down parapets and drainpipes in total silence except for the occasional scrape of stone on stone  the gargoyles were leaving the roof .   it   s a shame that rincewind had never seen poor quality stop motion photography  because then he would have known exactly how to describe what he was seeing .  the creatures didn   t exactly move  but they managed to progress in a series of high speed tableaux  and lurched past him in a spindly procession of beaks  manes  wings  claws and pigeon droppings .      what   s happening .     he squeaked .   a thing with a goblin   s face  harpy   s body and hen   s legs turned its head in a series of little jerks and spoke in a voice like the peristalsis of mountains  although the deep resonant effect was rather spoiled because  of course  it couldn   t close its mouth  .   it said     a ourcerer is umming .  eee orr ife .      rincewind said    pardon .     but the thing had gone past and was lurching awkwardly across the ancient lawn .    so rincewind sat and stared blankly at nothing much for fully ten seconds before giving a little scream and running as fast as he could .   he didn   t stop until he   d reached his own room in the library building .  it wasn   t much of a room  being mainly used to store old furniture  but it was home .   against one shadowy wall was a wardrobe .  it wasn   t one of your modern wardrobes  fit only for nervous adulterers to jump into when the husband returned home early  but an ancient oak affair  dark as night  in whose dusty depths coat hangers lurked and bred  herds of flaking shoes roamed its floor .  it was quite possible that it was a secret doorway to fabulous worlds  but no one had ever tried to find out because of the distressing smell of mothballs .   and on top of the wardrobe  wrapped in scraps of yellowing paper and old dust sheets  was a large brass bound chest .  it went by the name of the luggage .  why it consented to be owned by rincewind was something only the luggage knew  and it wasn   t telling  but probably no other item in the entire chronicle of travel accessories had quite such a history of mystery and grievous bodily harm .  it had been described as half suitcase  half homicidal maniac .  it had many unusual qualities which may or may not become apparent soon  but currently there was only one that set it apart from any other brass bound chest .  it was snoring  with a sound like someone very slowly sawing a log .   the luggage might be magical .  it might be terrible .  but in its enigmatic soul it was kin to every other piece of luggage throughout the multiverse  and preferred to spend its winters hibernating on top of a wardrobe .   rincewind hit it with a broom until the sawing stopped  filled his pockets with odds and ends from the banana crate he used as a dressing table  and made for the door .  he couldn   t help noticing that his mattress had gone but that didn   t matter because he was pretty clear that he was never going to sleep on a mattress again  ever .   the luggage landed on the floor with a solid thump .  after a few seconds  and with extreme care  it rose up on hundreds of little pink legs .  it tilted backwards and forward a bit  stretching every leg  and then it opened its lid and yawned .      are you coming or not .      the lid shut with a snap .  the luggage maneuverd its feet into a complicated shuffle until it was facing the doorway  and headed after its master .   the library was still in a state of tension  with the occasional clinking  of a chain or muffled crackle of a page .  rincewind reached under the desk and grabbed the librarian who was still hunched under his blanket .      come on  i said .         oook .         i   ll buy you a drink     said rincewind desperately .   the librarian unfolded like a four legged spider .     oook .      rincewind half dragged the ape from his nest and out through the door .  he didn   t head for the main gates but for an otherwise undistinguished area of wall where a few loose stones had  for two thousand years  offered students an unobtrusive way in after lights out .  then he stopped so suddenly that the librarian cannoned into him and the luggage ran into both of them .      oook .         oh  gods     he said .     look at that .         oook .      there was a shiny black tide flowing out of a grating near the kitchens .  early evening starlight glinted off millions of little black backs .   but it wasn   t the sight of the cockroaches that was so upsetting .  it was the fact that they were marching in step  a hundred abreast .  of course  like all the informal inhabitants of the university the roaches were a little unusual  but there was something particularly unpleasant about the sound of billions of very small feet hitting the stones in perfect time .   rincewind stepped gingerly over the marching column .  the librarian jumped it .   the luggage  of course  followed them with a noise like someone tapdancing over a bag of potato chips .   and so  forcing the luggage to go all the way around to the gates anyway  because otherwise it   d only batter a hole in the wall  rincewind quit the university with all the other insects and small frightened rodents and decided that if a few quiet beers wouldn   t allow him to see things in a different light  then a few more probably would .  it was certainly worth a try .   that was why he wasn   t present in the great hall for dinner .  it would turn out to be the most important missed meal of his life .      further along the university wall there was a faint clink as a grapnel caught the spikes that lined its top .  a moment later a slim  black clad figure dropped lightly into the university grounds and ran soundlessly toward the great hall  where it was soon lost in the shadows .   no one would have noticed it anyway .  on the other side of the campus the sourcerer was walking toward the gates of the university .  where his feet touched the cobbles blue sparks crackled and evaporated the early evening dew .      it was very hot .  the big fireplace at the turnwise end of the great hall was practically incandescent .  wizards feel the cold easily  so the sheer blast of heat from the roaring logs was melting candles twenty feet away and bubbling the varnish on the long tables .  the air over the feast was blue with tobacco smoke  which writhed into curious shapes as it was bent by random drifts of magic .  on the center table the complete carcass of a whole roast pig looked extremely annoyed at the fact that someone had killed it without waiting for it to finish its apple  and the model university made of butter was sinking gently into a pool of grease .   there was a lot of beer about .  here and there red faced wizards were happily singing ancient drinking songs which involved a lot of knee slapping and cries of    ho .     the only possible excuse for this sort of thing is that wizards are celibate  and have to find their amusement where they can .   another reason for the general conviviality was the fact that no one was trying to kill anyone else .  this is an unusual state of affairs in magical circles .   the higher levels of wizardry are a perilous place .  every wizard is trying to dislodge the wizards above him while stamping on the fingers of those below  to say that wizards are healthily competitive by nature is like saying that piranhas are naturally a little peckish .  however  ever since the great mage wars left whole areas of the disc uninhabitable   wizards have been forbidden to settle their differences by magical means  because it caused a lot of trouble for the population at large and in any case it was often difficult to tell which of the resultant patches of smoking fat had been the winner .  so they traditionally resort to knives  subtle poisons  scorpions in shoes and hilarious booby traps involving razor sharp pendulums .   on small gods    eve  however  it was considered extremely bad form to kill a brother wizard  and wizards felt able to let their hair down without fear of being strangled with it .   the archchancellor   s chair was empty .  wayzygoose was dining alone in his study  as befits a man chosen by the gods after their serious discussion with sensible senior wizards earlier in the day .  despite his eighty years  he was feeling a little bit nervous and hardly touched his second chicken .   in a few minutes he would have to make a speech .  wayzygoose had  in his younger days  sought power in strange places  he   d wrestled with demons in blazing octagrams  stared into dimensions that men were not meant to know of  and even outfaced the unseen university grants committee  but nothing in the eight circles of nothingness was quite so bad as a couple of hundred expectant faces staring up at him through the cigar smoke .   the heralds would soon be coming by to collect him .  he sighed and pushed his pudding away untasted  crossed the room  stood in front of the big mirror  and fumbled in the pocket of the robe for his notes .   after a while he managed to get them in some sort of order and cleared his throat .      my brothers in art     he began     i cannot tell you how much i   er  how much   fine traditions of this ancient university   er   as i look around me and see the pictures of archchancellors gone before       he paused  sorted through his notes again  and plunged on rather more certainly .     standing here tonight i am reminded of the story about the three legged pedlar and the  er  merchant   s daughters .  it seems that this merchant        there was a knock at the door .      enter     wayzygoose barked  and peered at the notes carefully .      this merchant     he muttered     this merchant  yes  this merchant had three daughters .  i think it was .  yes .  it was three .  it would appear        he looked into the mirror  and turned round .   he started to say     who are y        and found that there are things worse than making speeches  after all .      the small dark figure creeping along the deserted corridors heard the noise  and didn   t take too much notice .  unpleasant noises were not uncommon in areas where magic was commonly practiced .  the figure was looking for something .  it wasn   t sure what it was  only that it would know it when it found it .   after some minutes its search led it to wayzygoose   s room .  the air was full of greasy coils .  little particles of soot drifted gently on the air currents  and there were several foot shaped burn marks on the floor .   the figure shrugged .  there was no accounting for the sort of things you found in wizard   s rooms .  it caught sight of its multi faceted reflection in the shattered mirror  adjusted the set of its hood  and got on with the search .   moving like one listening to inner directions  it padded noiselessly across the room until it reached the table whereon stood a tall  round and battered leather box .  it crept closer and gently raised the lid .   the voice from inside sounded as though it was talking through several layers of carpet when it said  at last .  what kept you .         i mean  how did they all get started .  i mean  back in the old times  there were real wizards  there was none of this levels business .  they just went out and   did it .  pow .      one or two of the other customers in the darkened bar of the mended drum tavern looked around hastily at the noise .  they were new in town .  regular customers never took any notice of surprising noises like groans or unpleasantly gristly sounds .  it was a lot healthier .  in some parts of the city curiosity didn   t just kill the cat  it threw it in the river with lead weights tied to its feet .   rincewind   s hands weaved unsteadily over the array of empty glasses on the table in front of him .  he   d almost been able to forget about the cockroaches .  after another drink he might manage to forget about the mattress  too .      whee .  a fireball .  fizz .  vanishing like smoke .  whee .    sorry .      the librarian carefully pulled what remained of his beer out of the reach of rincewind   s flailing arms .      proper magic .     rincewind stifled a belch .      oook .      rincewind stared into the frothy remnants of his last beer  and then  with extreme care in case the top of his head fell off  leaned down and poured some into a saucer for the luggage .  it was lurking under the table  which was a relief .  it usually embarrassed him in bars by sidling up to drinkers and terrorizing them into feeding it potato chips .   he wondered fuzzily where his train of thought had been derailed .      where was i .         oook     the librarian hinted .      yeah .     rincewind brightened .     they didn   t have all this levels and grades business  you know .  they had sourcerers in those days .  they went out in the world and found new spells and had adventures        he dipped a finger in a puddle of beer and doodled a design on the stained  scratched timber of the table .   one of rincewind   s tutors had said of him that    to call his understanding of magical theory abysmal is to leave no suitable word to describe his grasp of its practice .     this had always puzzled him .  he objected to the fact that you had to be good at magic to be a wizard .  he knew he was a wizard  deep in his head .  being good at magic didn   t have anything to do with it .  that was just an extra  it didn   t actually define somebody .      when i was a little boy     he said wistfully     i saw this picture of a sourcerer in a book .  he was standing on a mountain top waving his arms and the waves were coming right up  you know  like they do down in ankh bay in a gale  and there were flashes of lightning all around him           oook .         i don   t know why they didn   t  perhaps he had rubber boots on     rincewind snapped  and went on dreamily     and he had this staff and a hat on  just like mine  and his eyes were sort of glowing and there was all this sort of like glitter coming out of his fingertips  and i thought one day i   ll do that  and           oook .         just a half  then .         oook .         how do you pay for this stuff .  every time anyone gives you any money you eat it .         oook .         amazing .      rincewind completed his sketch in the beer .  there was a stick figure on a cliff .  it didn   t look much like him   drawing in stale beer is not a precise art   but it was meant to .      that   s what i wanted to be     he said .     pow .  not all this messing around .  all this books and stuff  that isn   t what it should all be about .  what we need is real wizardry .      that last remark would have earned the prize for the day   s most erroneous statement if rincewind hadn   t then said      it   s a pity there aren   t any of them around anymore .         spelter rapped on the table with his spoon .   he was an impressive figure  in his ceremonial robe with the purple and vermine  hood of the venerable council of seers and the yellow sash of a fifth level wizard  he   d been fifth level for three years  waiting for one of the sixty four sixth level wizards to create a vacancy by dropping dead .  he was in an amiable mood  however .  not only had he just finished a good dinner  he also had in his quarters a small vial of a guaranteed untastable poison which  used correctly  should guarantee him promotion within a few months .  life looked good .   the big clock at the end of the hall trembled on the verge of nine o   clock .   the tattoo with the spoon hadn   t had much effect .  spelter picked up a pewter tankard and brought it down hard .      brothers .     he shouted  and nodded as the hubbub died away .     thank you .  be upstanding  please  for the ceremony of the  um  keys .      there was a ripple of laughter and a general buzz of expectancy as the wizards pushed back their benches and got unsteadily to their feet .   the double doors to the hall were locked and triple barred .  an incoming archchancellor had to request entry three times before they would be unlocked  signifying that he was appointed with the consent of wizardry in general .  or some such thing .  the origins were lost in the depths of time  which was as good a reason as any for retaining the custom .   the conversation died away .  the assembled wizardry stared at the doors .   there was a soft knocking .      go away .     shouted the wizards  some of them collapsing at the sheer subtlety of the humor .   spelter picked up the great iron ring that contained the keys to the university .  they weren   t all metal .  they weren   t all visible .  some of them looked very strange indeed .      who is that who knocketh without .     he intoned .      i do .      what was strange about the voice was this  it seemed to every wizard that the speaker was standing right behind him .  most of them found themselves looking over their shoulders .   in that moment of shocked silence there was the sharp little snick of the lock .  they watched in fascinated horror as the iron bolts traveled back of their own accord  the great oak beams of timber  turned by time into something tougher than rock  slid out of their sockets  the hinges flared from red through yellow to white and then exploded .  slowly  with a terrible inevitability  the doors fell into the hall .   there was an indistinct figure standing in the smoke from the burning hinges .      bloody hell  virrid     said one of the wizards nearby     that was a good one .      as the figure strode into the light they could all see that it was not  after all  virrid wayzygoose .   he was at least a head shorter than any other wizard  and wore a simple white robe .  he was also several decades younger  he looked about ten years old  and in one hand he held a staff considerably taller than he was .      here  he   s no wizard           where   s his hood  then .         where   s his hat .      the stranger walked up the line of astonished wizards until he was standing in front of the top table .  spelter looked down at a thin young face framed by a mass of blond hair  and most of all he looked into two golden eyes that glowed from within .  but he felt they weren   t looking at him .  they seemed to be looking at a point six inches beyond the back of his head .  spelter got the impression that he was in the way  and considerably surplus to immediate requirements .   he rallied his dignity and pulled himself up to his full height .      what is the meaning of  um  this .     he said .  it was pretty weak  he had to admit  but the steadiness of that incandescent glare appeared to be stripping all the words out of his memory .      i have come     said the stranger .      come .  come for what .         to take my place .  where is the seat for me .         are you a student .     demanded spelter  white with anger .     what is your name  young man .      the boy ignored him and looked around at the assembled wizards .      who is the most powerful wizard here .     he said .     i wish to meet him .      spelter nodded his head .  two of the college porters  who had been sidling toward the newcomer for the last few minutes  appeared at either elbow .      take him out and throw him in the street     said spelter .  the porters  big solid serious men  nodded .  they gripped the boy   s pipestem arms with hands like banana bunches .      your father will hear of this     said spelter severely .      he already has     said the boy .  he glanced up at the two men and shrugged .      what   s going on here .      spelter turned to see skarmer billias  head of the order of the silver star .  whereas spelter tended toward the wiry  billias was expansive  looking rather like a small captive balloon that had for some reason been draped in blue velvet and vermine  between them  the wizards averaged out as two normal sized men .   unfortunately  billias was the type of person who prided himself on being good with children .  he bent down as far as his dinner would allow and thrust a whiskery red face toward the boy .      what   s the matter  lad .     he said .      this child had forced his way into here because  he says  he wants to meet a powerful wizard     said spelter  disapprovingly .  spelter disliked children intensely  which was perhaps why they found him so fascinating .  at the moment he was successfully preventing himself from wondering about the door .      nothing wrong with that     said billias .     any lad worth his salt wants to be a wizard .  i wanted to be a wizard when i was a lad .  isn   t that right lad .         are you puissant .     said the boy .      hmm .         i said  are you puissant .  how powerful are you .         powerful .     said billias .  he stood up  fingered his eighth level sash  and winked at spelter .     oh  pretty powerful .  quite powerful as wizards go .         good .  i challenge you .  show me your strongest magic .  and when i have beaten you  why  then i shall be archchancellor .         why  you impudent       began spelter  but his protest was lost in the roar of laughter from the rest of the wizards .  billias slapped his knees  or as near to them as he could reach .      a duel  eh .     he said .     pretty good  eh .         duelling is forbidden  as well you know     said spelter .     anyway  it   s totally ridiculous .  i don   t know who did the doors for him  but i will not stand here and see you waste all our time           now  now     said billias .     what   s your name  lad .         coin .         coin sir     snapped spelter .      well  now  coin     said billias .     you want to see the best i can do  eh .         yes .         yes sir     snapped spelter .  coin gave him an unblinking stare  a stare as old as time  the kind of stare that basks on rocks on volcanic islands and never gets tired .  spelter felt his mouth go dry .   billias held out his hands for silence .  then  with a theatrical flourish  he rolled up the sleeve of his left arm and extended his hand .   the assembled wizards watched with interest .  eighth levels were above magic  as a rule  spending most of their time in contemplation   normally of the next menu   and  of course  avoiding the attentions of ambitious wizards of the seventh level .  this should be worth seeing .   billias grinned at the boy  who returned it with a stare that focused on a point a few inches beyond the back of the old wizard   s head .   somewhat disconcerted  billias flexed his fingers .  suddenly this wasn   t quite the game he had intended  and he felt an overpowering urge to impress .  it was swiftly overtaken by a surge of annoyance at his own stupidity in being unnerved .      i shall show you     he said  and took a deep breath     maligree   s wonderful garden .      there was a susurration from the diners .  only four wizards in the entire history of the university had ever succeeded in achieving the complete garden .  most wizards could create the trees and flowers  and a few had managed the birds .  it wasn   t the most powerful spell  it couldn   t move mountains  but achieving the fine detail built into maligree   s complex syllables took a finely tuned skill .      you will observe     billias added     nothing up my sleeve .      his lips began to move .  his hands flickered through the air .  a pool of golden sparks sizzled in the palm of his hand  curved up  formed a faint sphere  began to fill in the detail     legend had it that maligree  one of the last of the true sourcerers  created the garden as a small  timeless  private self locking universe where he could have a quiet smoke and a bit of a think while avoiding the cares of the world .  which was itself a puzzle  because no wizard could possibly understand how any being as powerful as a sourcerer could have a care in the world .  whatever the reason  maligree retreated further and further into a world of his own and then  one day  closed the entrance after him .   the garden was a glittering ball in billias   s hands .  the nearest wizards craned admiringly over his shoulders  and looked down into a two foot sphere that showed a delicate  flower strewn landscape  there was a lake in the middle distance  complete in every ripple  and purple mountains behind an interesting looking forest .  tiny birds the size of bees flew from tree to tree  and a couple of deer no larger than mice glanced up from their grazing and stared out at coin .   who said critically     it   s quite good .  give it to me .      he took the intangible globe out of the wizard   s hands and held it up .      why isn   t it bigger .     he said .   billias mopped his brow with a lace edged handkerchief .      well     he said weakly  so stunned by coin   s tone that he was quite unable to be affronted     since the old days  the efficacity of the spell has rather        coin stood with his head on one side for a moment  as though listening to something .  then he whispered a few syllables and stroked the surface of the sphere .   it expanded .  one moment it was a toy in the boy   s hands  and the next        the wizards were standing on cool grass  in a shady meadow rolling down to the lake .  there was a gentle breeze blowing from the mountains  it was scented with thyme and hay .  the sky was deep blue shading to purple at the zenith .   the deer watched the newcomers suspiciously from their grazing ground under the trees .   spelter looked down in shock .  a peacock was pecking at his bootlaces .             he began  and stopped .  coin was still holding a sphere  a sphere of air .  inside it  distorted as though seen through a fish eye lens or the bottom of a bottle  was the great hall of unseen university .   the boy looked around at the trees  squinted thoughtfully at the distant  snow capped mountains  and nodded at the astonished men .      it   s not bad     he said .     i should like to come here again .     he moved his hands in a complicated motion that seemed  in some unexplained way  to turn them inside out .   now the wizards were back in the hall  and the boy was holding the shrinking garden in his palm .  in the heavy  shocked silence he put it back into billias   s hands  and said     that was quite interesting .  now i will do some magic .      he raised his hands  stared at billias  and vanished him .   pandemonium broke out  as it tends to on these occasions .  in the center of it stood coin  totally composed  in a spreading cloud of greasy smoke .   ignoring the tumult  spelter bent down slowly and  with extreme care  picked a peacock feather off the floor .  he rubbed it thoughtfully back and forth across his lips as he looked from the doorway to the boy to the vacant archchancellor   s chair  and his thin mouth narrowed  and he began to smile .      an hour later  as thunder began to roll in the clear skies above the city  and rincewind was beginning to sing gently and forget all about cockroaches  and a lone mattress was wandering the streets  spelter shut the door of the archchancellor   s study and turned to face his fellow mages .   there were six of them  and they were very worried .   they were so worried  spelter noted  that they were listening to him  a mere fifth level wizard .      he   s gone to bed     he said     with a hot milk drink .         milk .     said one of the wizards  with tired horror in his voice .      he   s too young for alcohol     explained the bursar .      oh  yes .  silly of me .      the hollow eyed wizard opposite said     did you see what he did to the door .         i know what he did to billias .         what did he do .         i don   t want to know .         brothers  brothers     said spelter soothingly .  he looked down at their worried faces and thought  too many dinners .  too many afternoons waiting for the servants to bring in the tea .  too much time spent in stuffy rooms reading old books written by dead men .  too much gold brocade and ridiculous ceremony .  too much fat .  the whole university is ripe for one good push     or one good pull        i wonder if we really have  um  a problem here     he said .   gravie derment of the sages of the unknown shadow hit the table with his fist .      good grief  man .     he snapped .     some child wanders in out of the night  beats two of the university   s finest  sits down in the archchancellor   s chair and you wonder if we have a problem .  the boy   s a natural .  from what we   ve seen tonight  there isn   t a wizard on the disc who could stand against him .         why should we stand against him .     said spelter  in a reasonable tone of voice .      because he   s more powerful than we are .         yes .     spelter   s voice would have made a sheet of glass look like a plowed field  it made honey look like gravel .      it stands to reason        gravie hesitated .  spelter gave him an encouraging smile .      ahem .      the ahemmer was marmaric carding  head of the hoodwinkers .  he steepled his beringed fingers and peered sharply at spelter over the top of them .  the bursar disliked him intensely .  he had considerable doubt about the man   s intelligence .  he suspected it might be quite high  and that behind those vein crazed jowls was a mind full of brightly polished little wheels  spinning like mad .      he does not seem overly inclined to use that power     said carding .      what about billias and virrid .         childish pique     said carding .   the other wizards stared from him to the bursar .  they were aware of something going on  and couldn   t quite put their finger on it .   the reason that wizards didn   t rule the disc was quite simple .  hand any two wizards a piece of rope and they would instinctively pull in opposite directions .  something about their genetics or their training left them with an attitude toward mutual co operation that made an old bull elephant with terminal toothache look like a worker ant .   spelter spread his hands .     brothers     he said again     do you not see what has happened .  here is a gifted youth  perhaps raised in isolation out in the untutored  um  countryside  who  feeling the ancient call of the magic in his bones  has journeyed far across tortuous terrain  through who knows what perils  and at last has reached his journey   s end  alone and afraid  seeking only the steadying influence of us  his tutors  to shape and guide his talents .  who are we to turn him away  into the  um  wintry blast  shunning his        the oration was interrupted by gravie blowing his nose .      it   s not winter     said one of the other wizards flatly     and it   s quite a warm night .         out into the treacherously changeable spring weather     snarled spelter     and cursed indeed would be the man who failed  um  at this time           it   s nearly summer .      carding rubbed the side of his nose thoughtfully .      the boy has a staff     he said .     who gave it to him .  did you ask .         no     said spelter  still glowering at the almanackical interjector .   carding started to look at his fingernails in what spelter considered to be a meaningful way .      well  whatever the problem  i feel sure it can wait until morning     he said in what spelter felt was an ostentatiously bored voice .      ye gods  he blew billias away .     said gravie .     and they say there   s nothing in virrid   s room but soot .         they were perhaps rather foolish     said carding smoothly .     i am sure  my good brother  that you would not be defeated in affairs of the art by a mere stripling .      gravie hesitated .     well  er     he said     no .  of course not .     he looked at carding   s innocent smile and coughed loudly .     certainly not  of course .  billias was very foolish .  however  some prudent caution is surely           then let us all be cautious in the morning     said carding cheerfully .     brothers  let us adjourn this meeting .  the boy sleeps  and in that at least he is showing us the way .  this will look better in the light .         i have seen things that didn   t     said gravie darkly  who didn   t trust youth .  he held that no good ever came of it .   the senior wizards filed out and back to the great hall  where the dinner had got to the ninth course and was just getting into its stride .  it takes more than a bit of magic and someone being blown to smoke in front of him to put a wizard off his food .   for some unexplained reason spelter and carding were the last to leave .  they sat at either end of the long table  watching each other like cats .  cats can sit at either end of a lane and watch each other for hours  performing the kind of mental maneuvering that would make a grand master appear impulsive by comparison  but cats have got nothing on wizards .  neither was prepared to make a move until he had run the entire forthcoming conversation through his mind to see if it left him a move ahead .   spelter weakened first .      all wizards are brothers     he said .     we should trust one another .  i have information .         i know     said carding .     you know who the boy is .      spelter   s lips moved soundlessly as he tried to foresee the next bit of the exchange .     you can   t be certain of that     he said  after a while .      my dear spelter  you blush when you inadvertently tell the truth .         i didn   t blush .         precisely     said carding     my point .         all right     spelter conceded .     but you think you know something else .      the fat wizard shrugged .     a mere suspicion of a hunch     he said .     but why should i ally     he rolled the unfamiliar word around his tongue     with you  a mere fifth level .  i could more certainly obtain the information by rendering down your living brain .  i mean no offense  you understand  i ask only for knowledge .      the events of the next few seconds happened far too fast to be understood by non wizards  but went approximately like this   spelter had been drawing the signs of megrim   s accelerator in the air under cover of the table .  now he muttered a syllable under his breath and fired the spell along the tabletop  where it left a smoking path in the varnish and met  about halfway  the silver snakes of brother hushmaster   s potent asp spray as they spewed from carding   s fingertips .   the two spells cannoned into one another  turned into a ball of green fire and exploded  filling the room with fine yellow crystals .   the wizards exchanged the kind of long  slow glare you could roast chestnuts on .   bluntly  carding was surprised .  he shouldn   t have been .  eighth level wizards are seldom faced with challenging tests of magical skill .  in theory there are only seven other wizards of equal power and every lesser wizard is  by definition   well  lesser .  this makes them complacent .  but spelter  on the other hand  was at the fifth level .   it may be quite tough at the top  and it is probably even tougher at the bottom  but halfway up it   s so tough you could use it for horseshoes .  by then all the no hopers  the lazy  the silly and the downright unlucky have been weeded out  the field   s cleared  and every wizard stands alone and surrounded by mortal enemies on every side .  there   s the pushy fours below  waiting to trip him up .  there   s the arrogant sixes above  anxious to stamp out all ambition .  and  of course  all around are his fellow fives  ready for any opportunity to reduce the competition a little .  and there   s no standing still .  wizards of the fifth level are mean and tough and have reflexes of steel and their eyes are thin and narrow from staring down the length of that metaphorical last furlong at the end of which rests the prize of prizes  the archchancellor   s hat .   the novelty of cooperation began to appeal to carding .  there was worthwhile power here  which could be bribed into usefulness for as long as it was necessary .  of course  afterwards it might have to be   discouraged     spelter thought  patronage .  he   d heard the term used  though never within the university  and he knew it meant getting those above you to give you a leg up .  of course  no wizard would normally dream of giving a colleague a leg up unless it was in order to catch them on the hop .  the mere thought of actually encouraging a competitor   but on the other hand  this old fool might be of assistance for a while  and afterwards  well     they looked at one another with mutual  grudging admiration and unlimited mistrust  but at least it was a mistrust each one felt he could rely on .  until afterwards .      his name is coin     said spelter .     he says his father   s name is ipslore .         i wonder how many brothers has he got .     said carding .      i   m sorry .         there hasn   t been magic like that in this university in centuries     said carding     maybe for thousands of years .  i   ve only ever read about it .         we banished an ipslore thirty years ago     said spelter .     according to the records  he   d got married .  i can see that if he had sons  um  they   d be wizards  but i don   t understand how           that wasn   t wizardry .  that was sourcery     said carding  leaning back in his chair .   spelter stared at him across the bubbling varnish .      sourcery .         the eighth son of a wizard would be a sourcerer .         i didn   t know that .         it is not widely advertised .         yes  but   sourcerers were a long time ago  i mean  the magic was a lot stronger then  um  men were different   it didn   t have anything to do with  well  breeding .     spelter was thinking  eight sons  that means he did it eight times .  at least .  gosh .      sourcerers could do everything     he went on .     they were nearly as powerful as the gods .  um .  there was no end of trouble .  the gods simply wouldn   t allow that sort of thing anymore  depend upon it .         well  there was trouble because the sourcerers fought among themselves     said carding     but one sourcerer wouldn   t be any trouble .  one sourcerer correctly advised  that is .  by older and wiser minds .         but he wants the archchancellor   s hat .         why can   t he have it .      spelter   s mouth dropped open .  this was too much  even for him .   carding smiled at him amiably .      but the hat           it   s just a symbol     said carding .     it   s nothing special .  if he wants it  he can have it .  it   s a small enough thing .  just a symbol  nothing more .  a figurehat .         figurehat .         worn by a figurehead .         but the gods choose the archchancellor .      carding raised an eyebrow .     do they .     he said  and coughed .      well  yes  i suppose they do .  in a manner of speaking .         in a manner of speaking .      carding got up and gathered his skirts around him .     i think     he said     that you have a great deal to learn .  by the way  where is that hat .         i don   t know     said spelter  who was still quite shaken .     somewhere in  um  virrid   s apartments  i suppose .         we   d better fetch it     said carding .   he paused in the doorway and stroked his beard reflectively .     i remember ipslore     he said .     we were students together .  wild fellow .  odd habits .  superb wizard  of course  before he went to the bad .  had a funny way of twitching his eyebrow  i remember  when he was excited .     carding looked blankly across forty years of memory  and shivered .      the hat     he reminded himself .     let   s find it .  it would be a shame if anything happened to it .         in fact the hat had no intention of letting anything happen to it  and was currently hurrying toward the mended drum under the arm of a rather puzzled  black clad thief .   the thief  as will become apparent  was a special type of thief .  this thief was an artist of theft .  other thieves merely stole everything that was not nailed down  but this thief stole the nails as well .  this thief had scandalised ankh by taking a particular interest in stealing  with astonishing success  things that were in fact not only nailed down but also guarded by keen eyed guards in inaccessible strong rooms .  there are artists that will paint an entire chapel ceiling  this was the kind of thief that could steal it .   this particular thief was credited with stealing the jewelled disembowelling knife from the temple of offler the crocodile god during the middle of evensong  and the silver shoes from the patrician   s finest racehorse while it was in the process of winning a race .  when gritoller mimpsey  vice president of the thieves    guild  was jostled in the marketplace and then found on returning home that a freshly stolen handful of diamonds had vanished from their place of concealment  he knew who to blame .   this was the type of thief that could steal the initiative  the moment and the words right out of your mouth .   however  it was the first time it had stolen something that not only asked it to  in a low but authoritative voice  but gave precise and somehow unarguable instructions about how it was to be disposed of .   it was that cusp of the night that marks the turning point of ankh morpork   s busy day  when those who make their living under the sun are resting after their labors and those who turn an honest dollar by the cold light of the moon are just getting up the energy to go to work .  the day had  in fact  reached that gentle point when it was too late for housebreaking and too early for burglary .   rincewind sat alone in the crowded  smoky room  and didn   t take much notice when a shadow passed over the table and a sinister figure sat down opposite him .  there was nothing very remarkable about sinister figures in this place .  the drum jealousy guarded its reputation as the most stylishly disreputable tavern in ankh morpork and the big troll that now guarded the door carefully vetted customers for suitability in the way of black cloaks  glowing eyes  magic swords and so forth .  rincewind never found out what he did to the failures .  perhaps he ate them .   when the figure spoke  its husky voice came from the depths of a black velvet hood  lined with fur .      psst     it said .      not very     said rincewind  who was in a state of mind where he couldn   t resist it     but i   m working on it .         i   m looking for a wizard     said the voice .  it sounded hoarse with the effort of disguising itself but  again  this was nothing unusual in the drum .      any wizard in particular .     rincewind said guardedly .  people could get into trouble this way .      one with a keen sense of tradition who would not mind taking risks for high reward     said another voice .  it appeared to be coming from a round black leather box under the stranger   s arm .      ah     said rincewind     that narrows it down a bit  then .  does this involve a perilous journey into unknown and probably dangerous lands .         it does  as a matter of fact .         encounters with exotic creatures .     rincewind smiled .      could be .         almost certain death .         almost certainly .      rincewind nodded  and picked up his hat .      well  i wish you every success in your search     he said     i   d help you myself  only i   m not going to .         what .         sorry .  i don   t know why  but the prospect of certain death in unknown lands at the claws of exotic monsters isn   t for me .  i   ve tried it  and i couldn   t get the hang of it .  each to their own  that   s what i say  and i was cut out for boredom .     he rammed his hat on his head and stood up a little unsteadily .   he   d reached the foot of the steps leading up into the street when a voice behind him said     a real wizard would have accepted .      he could have kept going .  he could have walked up the stairs  out into the street  got a pizza at the klatchian takeaway in sniggs alley  and gone to bed .  history would have been totally changed  and in fact would also have been considerably shorter  but he would have got a good night   s sleep although  of course  it would have been on the floor .   the future held its breath  waiting for rincewind to walk away .   he didn   t do this for three reasons .  one was alcohol .  one was the tiny flame of pride that flickers in the heart of even the most careful coward .  but the third was the voice .   it was beautiful .  it sounded like wild silk looks .   the subject of wizards and sex is a complicated one  but as has already been indicated it does  in essence  boil down to this  when it comes to wine  women and song  wizards are allowed to get drunk and croon as much as they like .   the reason given to young wizards was that the practice of magic is hard and demanding and incompatible with sticky and furtive activities .  it was a lot more sensible  they were told  to stop worrying about that sort of thing and really get to grips with woddeley   s occult primer instead .  funnily enough this didn   t seem to satisfy  and young wizards suspected that the real reason was that the rules were made by old wizards .  with poor memories .  they were quite wrong  although the real reason had long been forgotten  if wizards were allowed to go around breeding all the time  there was a risk of sourcery .   of course  rincewind had been around a bit and had seen a thing or two  and had thrown off his early training to such an extent that he was quite capable of spending hours at a time in a woman   s company without having to go off for a cold shower and a lie down .  but that voice would have made even a statue get down off its pedestal for a few brisk laps of the playing field and fifty press ups .  it was a voice that could make    good morning    sound like an invitation to bed .   the stranger threw back her hood and shook out her long hair .  it was almost pure white .  since her skin was tanned golden the general effect was calculated to hit the male libido like a lead pipe .   rincewind hesitated  and lost a splendid opportunity to keep quiet .  from the top of the stairs came a thick trollish voice      ere  i thed you can   t go freu dere        she sprang forward and shoved a round leather box into rincewind   s arms .      quick  you must come with me     she said .     you   re in great danger .         why .         because i will kill you if you don   t .         yes  but hang on a moment  in that case       rincewind protested feebly .   three members of the patrician   s personal guard appeared at the top of the stairs .  their leader beamed down at the room .  the smile suggested that he intended to be the only one to enjoy the joke .      don   t nobody move     he suggested .   rincewind heard a clatter behind him as more guards appeared at the back door .   the drum   s other customers paused with their hands on assorted hilts .  these weren   t the normal city watch  cautious and genially corrupt .  these were walking slabs of muscle and they were absolutely unbribable  if only because the patrician could outbid anyone else .  anyway  they didn   t seem to be looking for anyone except the woman .  the rest of the clientele relaxed and prepared to enjoy the show .  eventually it might be worth joining it  once it was certain which was the winning side .   rincewind felt the pressure tighten on his wrist .      are you mad .     he hissed .     this is messing with the man .      there was a swish and the sergeant   s shoulder suddenly sprouted a knife hilt .  then the girl spun around and with surgical precision planted a small foot in the groin of the first guard through the door .  twenty pairs of eyes watered in sympathy .   rincewind grabbed his hat and tried to dive under the nearest table  but that grip was steel .  the next guard to approach got another knife in the thigh .  then she drew a sword like a very long needle and raised it threateningly .      anyone else .     she said .   one of the guards raised a crossbow .  the librarian  sitting hunched over his drink  reached out a lazy arm like two broom handles strung with elastic and slapped him backwards .  the bolt rebounded from the star on rincewind   s hat and hit the wall by a respected procurer who was sitting two tables away .  his bodyguards threw another knife which just missed a thief across the room  who picked up a bench and hit two guards  who struck out at the nearest drinkers .  after that one thing sort of led to another and pretty soon everyone was fighting to get something   either away  out or even .   rincewind found himself pulled relentlessly behind the bar .  the landlord was sitting on his moneybags under the counter with two machetes crossed on his knees  enjoying a quiet drink .  occasionally the sound of breaking furniture would make him wince .   the last thing rincewind saw before he was dragged away was the librarian .  despite looking like a hairy rubber sack full of water  the orangutan had the weight and reach of any man in the room and was currently sitting on a guard   s shoulders and trying  with reasonable success  to unscrew his head .   of more concern to rincewind was the fact that he was being dragged upstairs .      my dear lady     he said desperately .     what do you have in mind .         is there a way onto the roof .         yes .  what   s in this box .         shhh .      she halted at a bend in the dingy corridor  reached into a belt pouch and scattered a handful of small metal objects on the floor behind them .  each one was made of four nails welded together so that  however the things fell  one was always pointing upwards .   she looked critically at the nearest doorway .      you haven   t got about four feet of cheesewire on you  have you .     she said wistfully .  she   d drawn another throwing knife and was throwing it up and catching it again .      i don   t think so     said rincewind weakly .      pity .  i   ve run out .  okay  come on .         why .  i haven   t done anything .      she went to the nearest window  pushed open the shutters and paused with one leg over the sill .      fine     she said  over her shoulder .     stay here and explain it to the guards .         why are they chasing you .         i don   t know .         oh  come on .  there must be a reason .         oh  there   s plenty of reasons .  i just don   t know which one .  are you coming .      rincewind hesitated .  the patrician   s personal guard was not known for its responsive approach to community policing  preferring to cut bits off instead .  among the things they took a dim view of was  well  basically  people being in the same universe .  running away from them was likely to be a capital offense .      i think maybe i   ll come along with you     he said gallantly .     a girl can come to harm all alone in this city .         freezing fog filled the streets of ankh morpork .  the flares of street traders made little yellow haloes in the smothering billows .   the girl peered around a corner .      we   ve lost them     she said .     stop shaking .  you   re safe now .         what  you mean i   m all alone with a female homicidal maniac .     said rincewind .     fine .      she relaxed and laughed at him .      i was watching you     she said .     an hour ago you were afraid that your future was going to be dull and uninteresting .         i want it to be dull and uninteresting     said rincewind bitterly .     i   m afraid it   s going to be short .         turn your back     she commanded  stepping into an alley .      not on your life     he said .      i   m going to take my clothes off .      rincewind spun around  his face red .  there was a rustling behind him  and a waft of scent .  after a while she said     you can look around now .      he didn   t .      you needn   t worry .  i   ve put some more on .      he opened his eyes .  the girl was wearing a demure white lace dress with fetchingly puffed sleeves .  he opened his mouth .  he realized with absolute clarity that up to now the trouble he had been in was simple  modest and nothing he couldn   t talk his way out of given a decent chance or  failing that  a running start .  his brain started to send urgent messages to his sprinting muscles  but before they could get through she   d grabbed his arm again .      you really shouldn   t be so nervous     she said sweetly .     now  let   s have a look at this thing .      she pulled the lid off the round box in rincewind   s unprotesting hands  and lifted out the archchancellor   s hat .   the octarines around its crown blazed in all eight colors of the spectrum  creating the kind of effects in the foggy alley that it would take a very clever special effects director and a whole battery of star filters to achieve by any non magical means .  as she raised it high in the air it created its own nebula of colors that very few people ever see in legal circumstances .   rincewind sank gently to his knees .   she looked down at him  puzzled .      legs given out .         it   s   it   s the hat .  the archchancellor   s hat     said rincewind  hoarsely .  his eyes narrowed .     you   ve stolen it .     he shouted  struggling back to his feet and grabbing for the sparkling brim .      it   s just a hat .         give it to me this minute .  women mustn   t touch it .  it belongs to wizards .         why are you getting so worked up .     she said .   rincewind opened his mouth .  rincewind closed his mouth .   he wanted to say  it   s the archchancellor   s hat  don   t you understand .  it   s worn by the head of all wizards  well  on the head of the head of all wizards  no  metaphorically it   s worn by all wizards  potentially  anyway  and it   s what every wizard aspires to  it   s the symbol of organized magic  it   s the pointy tip of the profession  it   s a symbol  it   s what it means to all wizards     and so on .  rincewind had been told about the hat on his first day at university  and it had sunk into his impressionable mind like a lead weight into a jelly .  he wasn   t sure of much in the world  but he was certain that the archchancellor   s hat was important .  maybe even wizards need a little magic in their lives .   rincewind  said the hat .   he stared at the girl .     it spoke to me .         like a voice in your head .         yes .         it did that to me  too .         but it knew my name .      of course we do  stupid fellow .  we are supposed to be a magic hat after all .   the hat   s voice wasn   t only clothy .  it also had a strange choral effect  as if an awful lot of voices were talking at the same time  in almost perfect unison .   rincewind pulled himself together .      o great and wonderful hat     he said pompously     strike down this impudent girl who has had the audacity  nay  the        oh  do shut up .  she stole us because we ordered her to .  it was a near thing  too .      but she   s a       rincewind hesitated .     she   s of the female persuasion       he muttered .   so was your mother .      yes  well  but she ran away before i was born     rincewind mumbled .   of all the disreputable taverns in all the city you could have walked into  you walked into his  complained the hat .      he was the only wizard i could find     said the girl .     he looked the part .  he had    wizard    written on his hat and everything .      don   t believe everything you read .  too late now  anyway .  we haven   t got much time .      hold on  hold on     said rincewind urgently     what   s going on .  you wanted her to steal you .  why haven   t we got much time .     he pointed an accusing finger at the hat .     anyway  you can   t go around letting yourself be stolen  you   re supposed to be on   on the archchancellor   s head .  the ceremony was tonight  i should have been there        something terrible is happening at the university .  it is vital that we are not taken back  do you understand .  you must take us to klatch  where there is someone fit to wear me .      why .     there was something very strange about the voice  rincewind decided .  it sounded impossible to disobey  as though it was solid destiny .  if it told him to walk over a cliff  he thought  he   d be halfway down before it could occur to him to disobey .   the death of all wizardry is at hand .   rincewind looked around guiltily .      why .     he said .   the world is going to end .      what  again .      i mean it  said the hat sulkily .  the triumph of the ice giants  the apocralypse  the teatime of the gods  the whole thing .      can we stop it .      the future is uncertain on that point .   rincewind   s expression of determined terror faded slowly .      is this a riddle .     he said .   perhaps it would be simpler if you just did what you   re told and didn   t try to understand things  said the hat .  young woman  you will put us back in our box .  a great many people will shortly be looking for us .      hey  hold on     said rincewind .     i   ve seen you around here for years and you never talked before .      i didn   t have anything that needed to be said .   rincewind nodded .  that seemed reasonable .      look  just shove it in its box  and let   s get going     said the girl .      a bit more respect if you please  young lady     said rincewind haughtily .     that is the symbol of ancient wizardry you happen to be addressing .         you carry it  then     she said .      hey  look     said rincewind  scrambling along after her as she swept down the alleys  crossed a narrow street and entered another alley between a couple of houses that leaned together so drunkenly that their upper storys actually touched .  she stopped .      well .     she snapped .      you   re the mystery thief  aren   t you .     he said     everyone   s been talking about you  how you   ve taken things even from locked rooms and everything .  you   re different than i imagined           oh .     she said coldly .     how .         well  you   re   shorter .         oh  come on .      the street cressets  not particularly common in this part of the city in any case  gave out altogether here .  there was nothing but watchful darkness ahead .      i said come on     she repeated .     what are you afraid of .      rincewind took a deep breath .     murderers  muggers  thieves  assassins  pickpockets  cutpurses  reevers  snigsmen  rapists and robbers     he said .     that   s the shades you   re going into .          yes  but people won   t come looking for us in here     she said .      oh  they   ll come in all right  they just won   t come out     said rincewind .     nor will we .  i mean  a beautiful young woman like you   it doesn   t bear thinking about   i mean  some of the people in there           but i   ll have you to protect me     she said .   rincewind thought he heard the sound of marching feet several streets away .      you know     he sighed     i knew you   d say that .      down these mean streets a man must walk  he thought .  and along some of them he will break into a run .      it is so black in the shades on this foggy spring night that it would be too dark to read about rincewind   s progress through the eerie streets  so the descriptive passage will lift up above the level of the ornate rooftops  the forest of twisty chimneys  and admire the few twinkling stars that manage to pierce the swirling billows .  it will try to ignore the sounds drifting up from below   the patter of feet  the rushes  the gristly noises  the groans  the muffled screams .  it could be that some wild animal is pacing through the shades after two weeks on a starvation diet .   somewhere near the center of the shades   the district has never been adequately mapped   is a small courtyard .  here at least there are torches on the walls  but the light they throw is the light of the shades themselves  mean  reddened  dark at the core .   rincewind staggered into the yard and hung onto the wall for support .  the girl stepped into the ruddy light behind him  humming to herself .      are you all right .     she said .      nurrgh     said rincewind .      sorry .         those men     he bubbled     i mean  the way you kicked his   when you grabbed them by the   when you stabbed that one right in   who are you .         my name is conina .      rincewind looked at her blankly for some time .      sorry     he said     doesn   t ring a bell .         i haven   t been here long     she said .      yes  i didn   t think you were from around these parts     he said .     i would have heard .         i   ve taken lodgings here .  shall we go in .      rincewind glanced up at the dingy pole just visible in the smoky light of the spitting torches .  it indicated that the hostelry behind the small dark door was the troll   s head .   it might be thought that the mended drum  scene of unseemly scuffles only an hour ago  was a seedy disreputable tavern .  in fact it was a reputable disreputable tavern .  its customers had a certain rough hewn respectability   they might murder each other in an easygoing way  as between equals  but they didn   t do it vindictively .  a child could go in for a glass of lemonade and be certain of getting nothing worse than a clip around the ear when his mother heard his expanded vocabulary .  on quiet nights  and when he was certain the librarian wasn   t going to come in  the landlord was even known to put bowls of peanuts on the bar .   the troll   s head was a cesspit of a different odor .  its customers  if they reformed  tidied themselves up and generally improved their image out of all recognition might  just might  aspire to be considered the utter dregs of humanity .  and in the shades  a dreg is a dreg .   by the way  the thing on the pole isn   t a sign .  when they decided to call the place the troll   s head  they didn   t mess about .   feeling sick  and clutching the grumbling hatbox to his chest  rincewind stepped inside .   silence .  it wrapped itself around them  nearly as thickly as the smoke of a dozen substances guaranteed to turn any normal brain to cheese .  suspicious eyes peered through the smog .   a couple of dice clattered to a halt on a tabletop .  they sounded very loud  and probably weren   t showing rincewind   s lucky number .   he was aware of the stares of several score of customers as he followed the demure and surprisingly small figure of conina into the room .  he looked sideways into the leering faces of men who would kill him sooner than think  and in fact would find it a great deal easier .   where a respectable tavern would have had a bar there was just a row of squat black bottles and a couple of big barrels on trestles against the wall .   the silence tightened like a tourniquet .  any minute now  rincewind thought .   a big fat man wearing nothing but a fur vest and a leather loincloth pushed back his stool and lurched to his feet and winked evilly at his colleagues .  when his mouth opened  it was like a hole with a hem .      looking for a man  little lady .     he said .   she looked up at him .      please keep away .      a snake of laughter writhed around the room .  conina   s mouth snapped shut like a letterbox .      ah     the big man gurgled     that   s right  i likes a girl with spirit        conina   s hand moved .  it was a pale blur  stopping here and here  after a few seconds of disbelief the man gave a little grunt and folded up  very slowly .   rincewind shrank back as every other man in the room leaned forward .  his instinct was to run  and he knew it was an instinct that would get him instantly killed .  it was the shades out there .  whatever was going to happen to him next was going to happen to him here .  it was not a reassuring thought .   a hand closed around his mouth .  two more grabbed the hatbox from his arms .   conina spun past him  lifting her skirt to place a neat foot on a target beside rincewind   s waist .  someone whimpered in his ear and collapsed .  as the girl pirouetted gracefully around she picked up two bottles  knocked out their bottoms on the shelf and landed with their jagged ends held out in front of her .  morpork daggers  they were called in the patois of the streets .   in the face of them  the troll   s head   s clientele lost interest .      someone got the hat     rincewind muttered through dry lips     they slipped out of the back way .      she glared at him and made for the door .  the head   s crowd of customers parted automatically  like sharks recognizing another shark  and rincewind darted anxiously after her before they came to any conclusion about him .   they ran out into another alley and pounded down it .  rincewind tried to keep up with the girl  people following her tended to tread on sharp things  and he wasn   t sure she   d remember he was on her side  whatever side that was .   a thin  half hearted drizzle was falling .  and at the end of the alley was a faint blue glow .      wait .      the terror in rincewind   s voice was enough to slow her down .      what   s wrong .         why   s he stopped .         i   ll ask him     said conina  firmly .      why   s he covered in snow .      she stopped and turned around  arms thrust into her sides  one foot tapping impatiently on the damp cobbles .      rincewind  i   ve known you for an hour and i   m astonished you   ve lived even that long .         yes  but i have  haven   t i .  i   ve got a sort of talent for it .  ask anyone .  i   m an addict .         addicted to what .         life .  i got hooked on it at an early age and i don   t want to give it up and take it from me  this doesn   t look right .      conina looked back at the figure surrounded by the glowing blue aura .  it seemed to be looking at something in its hands .   snow was settling on its shoulder like really bad dandruff .  terminal dandruff .  rincewind had an instinct for these things  and he had a deep suspicion that the man had gone where shampoo would be no help at all .   they sidled along a glistening wall .      there   s something very strange about him     she conceded .      you mean the way he   s got his own private blizzard .         doesn   t seem to upset him .  he   s smiling .         a frozen grin  i   d call it .      the man   s icicle hung hands had been taking the lid off the box  and the glow from the hat   s octarines shone up into a pair of greedy eyes that were already heavily rimed with frost .      know him .     said conina .   rincewind shrugged .     i   ve seen him around     he said .     he   s called larry the fox or fezzy the stoat or something .  some sort of rodent  anyway .  he just steals things .  he   s harmless .         he looks incredibly cold .     conina shivered .      i expect he   s gone to a warmer place .  don   t you think we should shut the box .      it   s perfectly safe now  said the hat   s voice from inside the glow .  and so perish all enemies of wizardry .   rincewind wasn   t about to trust what a hat said .      we need something to shut the lid     he muttered .     a knife or something .  you wouldn   t have one  would you .         look the other way     conina warned .   there was a rustle and another gust of perfume .      you can look back now .      rincewind was handed a twelve inch throwing knife .  he took it gingerly .  little particles of metal glinted on its edge .      thanks .     he turned back .     not leaving you short  am i .         i have others .         i   ll bet .      rincewind reached out gingerly with the knife .  as it neared the leather box its blade went white and started to steam .  he whimpered a little as the cold struck his hand   a burning  stabbing cold  a cold that crept up his arm and made a determined assault on his mind .  he forced his numb fingers into action and  with great effort  nudged the edge of the lid with the tip of the blade .   the glow faded .  the snow became sleet  then melted into drizzle .   conina nudged him aside and pulled the box out of the frozen arms .      i wish there was something we could do for him .  it seems wrong just to leave him here .         he won   t mind     said rincewind  with conviction .      yes  but we could at least lean him against the wall .  or something .      rincewind nodded  and grabbed the frozen thief by his icicle arm .  the man slipped out of his grasp and hit the cobbles .   where he shattered .   conina looked at the pieces .      urg     she said .   there was a disturbance further up the alley  coming from the back door of the troll   s head .  rincewind felt the knife snatched from his hand and then go past his ear in a flat trajectory that ended in the doorpost twenty yards away .  a head that had been sticking out withdrew hurriedly .      we   d better go     said conina  hurrying along the alley .     is there somewhere we can hide .  your place .         i generally sleep at the university     said rincewind  hopping along behind her .   you must not return to the university  growled the hat from the depths of its box .  rincewind nodded distractedly .  the idea certainly didn   t seem attractive .      anyway  they don   t allow women inside after dark     he said .      and before dark .         not then  either .      conina sighed .     that   s silly .  what have you wizards got against women  then .      rincewind   s brow wrinkled .     we   re not supposed to put anything against women     he said .     that   s the whole point .         sinister gray mists rolled through the docks of morpork  dripping from the rigging  coiling around the drunken rooftops  lurking in alleys .  the docks at night were thought by some to be even more dangerous than the shades .  two muggers  a sneak thief and someone who had merely tapped conina on the shoulder to ask her the time had already found this out .      do you mind if i ask you a question .     said rincewind  stepping over the luckless pedestrian who lay coiled around his private pain .      well .         i mean  i wouldn   t like to cause offense .         well .         it   s just that i can   t help noticing           hmmm .         you have this certain way with strangers .     rincewind ducked  but nothing happened .      what are you doing down there .     said conina  testily .      sorry .         i know what you   re thinking .  i can   t help it  i take after my father .         who was he  then .  cohen the barbarian .     rincewind grinned to show it was a joke .  at least  his lips moved in a desperate crescent .      no need to laugh about it  wizard .         what .         it   s not my fault .      rincewind   s lips moved soundlessly .     sorry     he said .     have i got this right .  your father really is cohen the barbarian .         yes .     the girl scowled at rincewind .     everyone has to have a father     she added .     even you  i imagine .      she peered around a corner .      all clear .  come on     she said  and then when they were striding along the damp cobbles she continued     i expect your father was a wizard  probably .         i shouldn   t think so     said rincewind .     wizardry isn   t allowed to run in families .     he paused .  he knew cohen  he   d even been a guest at one of his weddings when he married a girl of conina   s age  you could say this about cohen  he crammed every hour full of minutes .     a lot of people would like to take after cohen  i mean  he was the best fighter  the greatest thief  he           a lot of men would     conina snapped .  she leaned against a wall and glared at him .      listen     she said     there   s this long word  see  an old witch told me about it   can   t remember it   you wizards know about long words .      rincewind thought about long words .     marmalade .     he volunteered .   she shook her head irritably .     it means you take after your parents .      rincewind frowned .  he wasn   t too good on the subject of parents .      kleptomania .  recidivist .     he hazarded .      begins with an h .         hedonism .     said rincewind desperately .      herrydeterry     said conina .     this witch explained it to me .  my mother was a temple dancer for some mad god or other  and father rescued her  and   they stayed together for a while .  they say i get my looks and figure from her .         and very good they are  too     said rincewind  with hopeless gallantry .   she blushed .     yes  well  but from him i got sinews you could moor a boat with  reflexes like a snake on a hot tin  a terrible urge to steal things and this dreadful sensation every time i meet someone that i should be throwing a knife through his eye at ninety feet .  i can  too     she added with a trace of pride .      gosh .         it tends to put men off .         well  it would     said rincewind weakly .      i mean  when they find out  it   s very hard to hang onto a boyfriend .         except by the throat  i imagine     said rincewind .      not what you really need to build up a proper relationship .         no .  i can see     said rincewind .     still  pretty good if you want to be a famous barbarian thief .         but not     said conina     if you want to be a hairdresser .         ah .      they stared into the mist .      really a hairdresser .     said rincewind .   conina sighed .      not much call for a barbarian hairdresser  i expect     said rincewind .     i mean  no one wants a shampoo and beheading .         it   s just that every time i see a manicure set i get this terrible urge to lay about me with a double handed cuticle knife .  i mean sword     said conina .   rincewind sighed .     i know how it is     he said .     i wanted to be a wizard .         but you are a wizard .         ah .  well  of course  but           quiet .      rincewind found himself rammed against the wall  where a trickle of condensed mist inexplicably began to drip down his neck .  a broad throwing knife had mysteriously appeared in conina   s hand  and she was crouched like a jungle animal or  even worse  a jungle human .      what       rincewind began .      shut up .     she hissed .     something   s coming .      she stood up in one fluid movement  spun on one leg and let the knife go .   there was a single  hollow  wooden thud .   conina stood and stared .  for once  the heroic blood that pounded through her veins  drowning out all chances of a lifetime in a pink pinny  was totally at a loss .      i   ve just killed a wooden box     she said .   rincewind looked around the corner .   the luggage stood in the dripping street  the knife still quivering in its lid  and stared at her .  then it changed its position slightly  its little legs moving in a complicated tango pattern  and stared at rincewind .  the luggage didn   t have any features at all  apart from a lock and a couple of hinges  but it could stare better than a rockful of iguanas .  it could outstare a glass eyed statue .  when it came to a look of betrayed pathos  the luggage could leave the average kicked spaniel moping back in its kennel .  it had several arrowheads and broken swords sticking in it .      what is it .     hissed conina .      it   s just the luggage     said rincewind wearily .      does it belong to you .         not really .  sort of .         is it dangerous .      the luggage shuffled around to stare at her again .      there   s two schools of thought about that     said rincewind .     there   s some people who say it   s dangerous  and others who say it   s very dangerous .  what do you think .      the luggage raised its lid a fraction .   the luggage was made from the wood of the sapient peartree  a plant so magical that it had nearly died out on the disc and survived only in one or two places  it was a sort of rosebay willowherb  only instead of bomb sites it sprouted in areas that had seen vast expenditures of magic .  wizards    staves were traditionally made of it  so was the luggage .   among the luggage   s magical qualities was a fairly simple and direct one  it would follow its adopted owner anywhere .  not anywhere in any particular set of dimensions  or country  or universe  or lifetime .  anywhere .  it was about as easy to shake off as a head cold and considerably more unpleasant .   the luggage was also extremely protective of its owner .  it would be hard to describe its attitude to the rest of creation  but one could start with the phrase    bloody minded malevolence    and work up from there .   conina stared at that lid .  it looked very much like a mouth .      i think i   d vote for    terminally dangerous        she said .      it likes potato chips     volunteered rincewind  and then added     well  that   s a bit strong .  it eats potato chips .         what about people .         oh  and people .  about fifteen so far  i think .         were they good or bad .         just dead  i think .  it also does your laundry for you  you put your clothes in and they come out washed and ironed .         and covered in blood .         you know  that   s the funny thing     said rincewind .      the funny thing .     repeated conina  her eyes not leaving the luggage .      yes  because  you see  the inside isn   t always the same  it   s sort of multidimensional  and           how does it feel about women .         oh  it   s not choosy .  it ate a book of spells last year .  sulked for three days and then spat it out .         it   s horrible     said conina  and backed away .      oh  yes     said rincewind     absolutely .         i mean the way it stares .         it   s very good at it  isn   t it .      we must leave for klatch  said a voice from the hatbox .  one of these boats will be adequate .  commandeer it .   rincewind looked at the dim  mist wreathed shapes that loomed in the mist under a forest of rigging .  here and there a riding light made a little fuzzy ball of light in the gloom .      hard to disobey  isn   t it .     said conina .      i   m trying     said rincewind .  sweat prickled on his forehead .   go aboard now  said the hat .  rincewind   s feet began to shuffle of their own accord .      why are you doing this to me .     he moaned .   because i have no alternative .  believe me  if i could have found an eighth level mage i would have done so .  i must not be worn .      why not .  you are the archchancellor   s hat .      and through me speak all the archchancellors who ever lived .  i am the university .  i am the lore .  i am the symbol of magic under the control of men   and i will not be worn by a sourcerer .  there must be no more sourcerers .  the world is too worn out for sourcery .   conina coughed .      did you understand any of that .     she said  cautiously .      i understood some of it  but i didn   t believe it     said rincewind .  his feet remained firmly rooted to the cobbles .   they called me a figurehat .  the voice was heavy with sarcasm .  fat wizards who betray everything the university ever stood for  and they called me a figurehat .  rincewind  i command you .  and you  madam .  serve me well and i will grant you your deepest desire .      how can you grant my deepest desire if the world   s going to end .      the hat appeared to think about it .  well  have you got a deepest desire that need only take a couple of minutes .      look  how can you do magic .  you   re just a       rincewind   s voice trailed off .   i am magic .  proper magic .  besides  you don   t get worn by some of the world   s greatest wizards for two thousand years without learning a few things .  now .  we must flee .   but with dignity of course .   rincewind looked pathetically at conina  who shrugged again .      don   t ask me     she said .     this looks like an adventure .  i   m doomed to have them  i   m afraid .  that   s genetics  for you .         but i   m no good at them .  believe me  i   ve been through dozens .     rincewind wailed .   ah .  experience  said the hat .      no  really  i   m a terrible coward  i always run away .     rincewind   s chest heaved .     danger has stared me in the back of the head  oh  hundreds of times .      i don   t want you to go into danger .      good .      i want you to stay out of danger .   rincewind sagged .     why me .     he moaned .   for the good of the university .  for the honor of wizardry .  for the sake of the world .  for your heart   s desire .  and i   ll freeze you alive if you don   t .   rincewind breathed a sigh almost of relief .  he wasn   t good on bribes  or cajolery  or appeals to his better nature .  but threats  now  threats were familiar .  he knew where he was with threats .      the sun dawned on small gods    day like a badly poached egg .  the mists had closed in over ankh morpork in streamers of silver and gold   damp  warm  silent .  there was the distant grumbling of springtime thunder  out on the plains .  it seemed warmer than it ought to be .   wizards normally slept late .  on this morning  however  many of them had got up early and were wandering the corridors aimlessly .  they could feel the change in the air .   the university was filling up with magic .   of course  it was usually full of magic anyway  but it was an old  comfortable magic  as exciting and dangerous as a bedroom slipper .  but seeping through the ancient fabric was a new magic  saw edged and vibrant  bright and cold as comet fire .  it sleeted through the stones and crackled off sharp edges like static electricity on the nylon carpet of creation .  it buzzed and sizzled .  it curled wizardly beards  poured in wisps of octarine smoke from fingers that had done nothing more mystical for three decades than a little light illusion .  how can the effect be described with delicacy and taste .  for most of the wizards  it was like being an elderly man who  suddenly faced with a beautiful young woman  finds to his horror and delight and astonishment that the flesh is suddenly as willing as the spirit .   and in the halls and corridors of the university the word was being whispered  sourcery .   a few wizards surreptitiously tried spells that they hadn   t been able to master for years  and watched in amazement as they unrolled perfectly .  sheepishly at first  and then with confidence  and then with shouts and whoops  they threw fireballs to one another or produced live doves out of their hats or made multi colored sequins fall out of the air .   sourcery .  one or two wizards  stately men who had hitherto done nothing more blameworthy that eat a live oyster  turned themselves invisible and chased the maids and bedders through the corridors .   sourcery .  some of the bolder spirits had tried out ancient flying spells and were bobbing a little uncertainly among the rafters .  sourcery .   only the librarian didn   t share in the manic breakfast .  he watched the antics for some time  pursing his prehensile lips  and then knuckled stiffly off toward his library .  if anyone had bothered to notice  they   d have heard him bolting the door .   it was deathly quiet in the library .  the books were no longer frantic .  they   d passed through their fear and out into the calm waters of abject terror  and they crouched on their shelves like so many mesmerized rabbits .   a long hairy arm reached up and grabbed casplock   s compleet lexicon of majik with precepts for the wise before it could back away  soothed its terror with a long fingered hand  and opened it under    s .     the librarian smoothed the trembling page gently and ran a horny nail down the entries until he came to       sourcerer  n .   mythical  .  a proto wizard  a doorway through which new majik may enterr the world  a wizard not limited by the physical capabilities of hys own bodie  not by destinie  nor by deathe .  it is written that there once werre sourcerers in the youth of the world but not may there by nowe and blessed be  for sourcery is not for menne and the return of sourcery would mean the ende of the worlde   if the creator hadd meant menne to bee as goddes  he ould have given them wings .  see also  thee apocralypse  the legende of thee ice giants  and thee teatime of the goddes .     the librarian read the cross references  turned back to the first entry  and stared at it through deep dark eyes for a long time .  then he put the book back carefully  crept under his desk  and pulled the blanket over his head .   but in the minstrel gallery over the great hall carding and spelter watched the scene with entirely different emotions .   standing side by side they looked almost exactly like the number    .      what is happening .     said spelter .  he   d had a sleepless night  and wasn   t thinking very straight .      magic is flowing into the university     said carding .     that   s what sourcerer means .  a channel for magic .  real magic  my boy .  not the tired old stuff we   ve made do with these past centuries .  this is the dawning of a   a           new  um  dawn .         exactly .  a time of miracles  a   a           anus mirabilis .      carding frowned .     yes     he said  eventually     something like that  i expect .  you have quite a way with words  you know .         thank you  brother .      the senior wizard appeared to ignore the familiarity .  instead he turned and leaned on the carved rail  watching the magical displays below them .  his hands automatically went to his pockets for his tobacco pouch  and then paused .  he grinned  and snapped his fingers .  a lighted cigar appeared in his mouth .      haven   t been able to do that in years     he mused .     big changes  my boy .  they haven   t realized it yet  but it   s the end of orders and levels .  that was just a   rationing system .  we don   t need them anymore .  where is the boy .         still asleep       spelter began .      i am here     said coin .   he stood in the archway leading to the senior wizard   s quarters  holding the octiron staff that was half again as tall as he was .  little veins of yellow fire coruscated across its matt black surface  which was so dark that it looked like a slit in the world .   spelter felt the golden eyes bore through him  as if his innermost thoughts were being scrolled across the back of his skull .      ah     he said  in a voice that he believed was jolly and avuncular but in fact sounded like a strangled death rattle .  after a start like that his contribution could only get worse  and it did .     i see you   re  um  up     he said .      my dear boy     said carding .   coin gave him a long  freezing stare .      i saw you last night     he said .     are you puissant .         only mildly     said carding  hurriedly recalling the boy   s tendency to treat wizardry as a terminal game of conkers .     but not so puissant as you  i   m sure .         i am to be made archchancellor  as is my destiny .         oh  absolutely     said carding .     no doubt about it .  may i have a look at your staff .  such an interesting design        he reached out a pudgy hand .   it was a shocking breach of etiquette in any case  no wizard should even think of touching another   s staff without his express permission .  but there are people who can   t quite believe that children are fully human  and think that the operation of normal good manners doesn   t apply to them .   carding   s fingers curled around the black staff .   there was a noise that spelter felt rather than heard  and carding bounced across the gallery and struck the opposite wall with a sound like a sack of lard hitting a pavement .      don   t do that     said coin .  he turned and looked through spelter  who had gone pale  and added     help him up .  he is probably not badly hurt .      the bursar scuttled hurriedly across the floor and bent over carding  who was breathing heavily and had gone an odd color .  he patted the wizard   s hand until carding opened one eye .      did you see what happened .     he whispered .      i   m not sure .  um .  what did happen .     hissed spelter .      it bit me .         the next time you touch the staff     said coin  matter of factly     you will die .  do you understand .      carding raised his head gently  in case bits of it fell off .      absolutely     he said .      and now i would like to see the university     the boy continued .     i have heard a great deal about it        spelter helped carding to his unsteady feet and supported him as they trotted obediently after the boy .      don   t touch his staff     muttered carding .      i   ll remember  um  not to     said spelter firmly .     what did it feel like .         have you ever been bitten by a viper .         no .         in that case you   ll understand exactly what it felt like .         hmmm .         it wasn   t like a snake bite at all .      they hurried after the determined figure as coin marched down the stairs and through the ravished doorway of the great hall .   spelter dodged in front  anxious to make a good impression .      this is the great hall     he said .  coin turned his golden gaze toward him  and the wizard felt his mouth dry up .     it   s called that because it   s a hall  d   you see .  and big .      he swallowed .     it   s a big hall     he said  fighting to stop the last of his coherence being burned away by the searchlight of that stare .     a great big hall  which is why it   s called           who are those people .     said coin .  he pointed with his staff .  the assembled wizards  who had turned to watch him enter  backed out of the way as though the staff was a flamethrower .   spelter followed the sourcerer   s stare .  coin was pointing to the portraits and statues of former archchancellors  which decorated the walls .  full bearded and point hatted  clutching ornamental scrolls or holding mysterious symbolic bits of astrological equipment  they stared down with ferocious self importance or  possibly  chronic constipation .      from these walls     said carding     two hundred supreme mages look down upon you .         i don   t care for them     said coin  and the staff streamed octarine fire .  the archchancellors vanished .      and the windows are too small           the ceiling is too high           everything is too old        the wizards threw themselves flat as the staff flared and spat .  spelter pulled his hat over his eyes and rolled under a table when the very fabric of the university flowed around him .  wood creaked  stone groaned .   something tapped him on the head .  he screamed .      stop that .     shouted carding above the din .     and pull your hat up .  show a little dignity .         why are you under the table  then .     said spelter sourly .      we must seize our opportunity .         what  like the staff .         follow me .      spelter emerged into a bright  a horrible bright new world .   gone were the rough stone walls .  gone were the dark  owl haunted rafters .  gone was the tiled floor  with its eye boggling pattern of black and white tiles .   gone  too  were the high small windows  with their gentle patina of antique grease .  raw sunlight streamed into the hall for the first time .   the wizards stared at one another  mouths open  and what they saw was not what they had always thought they   d seen .  the unforgiving rays transmuted rich gold embroidery into dusty gilt  exposed opulent fabric as rather stained and threadbare velvet  turned fine flowing beards into nicotine stained tangles  betrayed splendid diamonds as rather inferior ankhstones .  the fresh light probed and prodded  stripping away the comfortable shadows .   and  spelter had to admit  what was left didn   t inspire confidence .  he was suddenly acutely aware that under his robes   his tattered  badly faded robes  he realized with an added spasm of guilt  the robes with the perforated area where the mice had got at them   he was still wearing his bedroom slippers .   the hall was now almost all glassa .  what wasn   t glass was marble .  it was all so splendid that spelter felt quite unworthy .   he turned to carding  and saw that his fellow wizard was staring at coin with his eyes gleaming .   most of the other wizards had the same expression .  if wizards weren   t attracted to power they wouldn   t be wizards  and this was real power .  the staff had them charmed like so many cobras .   carding reached out to touch the boy on the shoulder  and then thought better of it .      magnificent     he said  instead .   he turned to the assembled wizardry and raised his arms .     my brothers     he intoned     we have in our midst a wizard of great power .      spelter tugged at his robe .      he nearly killed you     he hissed .  carding ignored him .      and i propose       carding swallowed      i propose him for archchancellor .      there was a moment   s silence  and then a burst of cheering and shouts of dissent .  several quarrels broke out at the back of the crowd .  the wizards nearer the front weren   t quite so ready to argue .  they could see the smile on coin   s face .  it was bright and cold  like the smile on the face of the moon .   there was a commotion  and an elderly wizard fought his way to the front of the throng .   spelter recognized ovin hakardly  a seventh level wizard and a lecturer in lore .  he was red with anger  except where he was white with rage .  when he spoke  his words seared through the air like so many knives  clipped as topiary  crisp as biscuits .      are you mad .     he said .     no one but a wizard of the eighth level may become archchancellor .  and he must be elected by the other most senior wizards in solemn convocation .   duly guided by the gods  of course .   it is the lore .   the very idea .       hakardly had studied the lore of magic for years and  because magic always tends to be a two way process  it had made its mark on him  he gave the impression of being as fragile as a cheese straw  and in some unaccountable way the dryness of his endeavours had left him with the ability to pronounce punctuation .   he stood vibrating with indignation and  he became aware  he was rapidly standing alone .  in fact he was the center of an expanding circle of empty floor fringed with wizards who were suddenly ready to swear that they   d never clapped eyes on him in their life .   coin had raised his staff .   hakardly raised an admonitory finger .      you do not frighten me  young man     he snapped .     talented you may be  but magical talent alone is not enough .  there are many other qualities required of a great wizard .  administrative ability  for example  and wisdom  and the        coin lowered his staff .      the lore applies to all wizards  does it not .     he said .      absolutely .  it was drawn up           but i am not a wizard  lord hakardly .      the wizard hesitated .     ah     he said  and hesitated again .     good point     he said .      but i am well aware of the need for wisdom  foresight and good advice  and i would be honored if you could see your way clear to providing those much valued commodities .  for example   why is it that wizards do not rule the world .         what .         it is a simple question .  there are in this room       coin   s lips moved for a fraction of a second      four hundred and seventy two wizards  skilled in the most subtle of arts .  yet all you rule are these few acres of rather inferior architecture .  why is this .      the most senior wizards exchanged knowing glances .      such it may appear     said hakardly eventually     but  my child  we have domains beyond the ken of the temporal power .     his eyes gleamed .     magic can surely take the mind to inner landscape of arcane           yes  yes     said coin .     yet there are extremely solid walls outside your university .  why is this .      carding ran his tongue over his lips .  it was extraordinary .  the child was speaking his thoughts .      you squabble for power     said coin  sweetly     and yet  beyond these walls  to the man who carts nightsoil or the average merchant  is there really so much difference between a high level mage and a mere conjuror .      hakardly stared at him in complete and untrammeled astonishment .      child  it   s obvious to the meanest citizen     he said .     the robes and trimmings themselves           ah     said coin     the robes and trimmings .  of course .      a short  heavy and thoughtful silence filled the hall .      it seems to me     said coin eventually     that wizards rule only wizards .  who rules in the reality outside .         as far as the city is concerned  that would be the patrician  lord vetinari     said carding with some caution .      and is he a fair and just ruler .      carding thought about it .  the patrician   s spy network was said to be superb .     i would say     he said carefully     that he is unfair and unjust  but scrupulously evenhanded .  he is unfair and unjust to everyone  without fear or favor .         and you are content with this .     said coin .   carding tried not to catch hakardly   s eye .      it   s not a case of being content with it     he said .     i suppose we   ve not given it much thought .  a wizard   s true vocation  you see           is it really true that the wise suffer themselves to be ruled in this way .      carding growled .     of course not .  don   t be silly .  we merely tolerate it .  that   s what wisdom is all about  you   ll find that out when you grow up  it   s a case of biding one   s time           where is this patrician .  i would like to see him .         that can be arranged  of course     said carding .     the patrician is always graciously pleased to grant wizards an interview  and           now i will grant him an interview     said coin .     he must learn that wizards have bided their time long enough .  stand back  please .      he pointed the staff .      the temporal ruler of the sprawling city of ankh morpork was sitting in his chair at the foot of the steps leading up to the throne  looking for any signs of intelligence in intelligence reports .  the throne had been empty for more than two thousand years  since the death of the last of the line of the kings of ankh .  legend said that one day the city would have a king again  and went on with various comments about magic swords  strawberry birthmarks and all the other things that legends gabble on about in these circumstances .   in fact the only real qualification now was the ability to stay alive for more than about five minutes after revealing the existence of any magic swords or birthmarks  because the great merchant families of ankh had been ruling the city for the last twenty centuries and were about to relinquish power as the average limpet is to let go of its rock .   the current patrician  head of the extremely rich and powerful vetinari family  was thin  tall and apparently as cold blooded as a dead penguin .  just by looking at him you could tell he was the sort of man you   d expect to keep a white cat  and caress it idly while sentencing people to death in a piranha tank  and you   d hazard for good measure that he probably collected rare thin porcelain  turning it over and over in his blue white fingers while distant screams echoed from the depths of the dungeons .  you wouldn   t put it past him to use the word    exquisite    and have thin lips .  he looked the kind of person who  when they blink  you mark it off on the calendar .   practically none of this was in fact the case  although he did have a small and exceedingly elderly wire haired terrier called wuffles that smelled badly and wheezed at people .  it was said to be the only thing in the entire world he truly cared about .  he did of course sometimes have people horribly tortured to death  but this was considered to be perfectly acceptable behavior for a civic ruler and generally approved of by the overwhelming majority of citizens .   the people of ankh are of a practical persuasion  and felt that the patrician   s edict forbidding all street theater and mime artists made up for a lot of things .  he didn   t administer a reign of terror  just the occasional light shower .   the patrician sighed  and laid the latest report on top of the large heap beside the chair .   when he had been a little boy he had seen a showman who could keep a dozen plates spinning in the air .  if the man had been capable of working the same trick with a hundred of them  lord vetinari considered  he would just about begin to be ready for training in the art of ruling ankh morpork  a city once described as resembling an overturned termite heap without the charm .   he glanced out of the window at the distant pillar of the tower of art  the center of unseen university  and wondered vaguely whether any of those tiresome old fools could come up with a better way of collating all this paperwork .  they wouldn   t  of course   you couldn   t expect a wizard to understand anything as basic as elementary civic espionage .   he sighed again  and picked up the transcript of what the president of the thieves    guild had said to his deputy at midnight in the soundproof room hidden behind the office in the guild headquarters  and     was in the great ha     was not in the great hall of unseen university  where he had spent some interminable dinners  but there were a lot of wizards around him and they were        different .   like death  which some of the city   s less fortunate citizens considered he intimately resembled  the patrician never got angry until he had time to think about it .  but sometimes he thought very quickly .   he stared around at the assembled wizards  but there was something about them that choked the words of outrage in his throat .  they looked like sheep who had suddenly found a trapped wolf at exactly the same time as they heard about the idea of unity being strength .   there was something about their eyes .      what is the meaning of this outr       he hesitated  and concluded     this .  a merry small gods    day prank  is it .      his eyes swivelled to meet those of a small boy holding a long metal staff .  the child was smiling the oldest smile the patrician had ever seen .   carding coughed .      my lord     he began .      out with it  man     snapped lord vetinari .   carding had been diffident  but the patrician   s tone was just that tiny bit too peremptory .  the wizard   s knuckles went white .      i am a wizard of the eighth level     he said quietly     and you will not use that tone to me .         well said     said coin .      take him to the dungeons     said carding .      we haven   t got any dungeons     said spelter .     this is a university .         then take him to the wine cellars     snapped carding .     and while you   re down there  build some dungeons .         have you the faintest inkling of what you are doing .     said the patrician .     i demand to know the meaning of this           you demand nothing at all     said carding .     and the meaning is that from now on the wizards will rule  as it was ordained .  now take           you .  rule ankh morpork .  wizards who can barely govern themselves .         yes .     carding was aware that this wasn   t the last word in repartee  and was even more alive to the fact that the dog wuffles  who had been teleported along with his master  had waddled painfully across the floor and was peering short sightedly at the wizard   s boots .      then all truly wise men would prefer the safety of a nice deep dungeon     said the patrician .     and now you will cease this foolery and replace me in my palace  and it is just possible that we will say no more about this .  or at least that you won   t have the chance to .      wuffles gave up investigating carding   s boots and trotted toward coin  shedding a few hairs on the way .      this pantomime has gone on long enough     said the patrician .     now i am getting        wuffles growled .  it was a deep  primeval noise  which struck a chord in the racial memory of all those present and filled them with an urgent desire to climb a tree .  it suggested long gray shapes hunting in the dawn of time .  it was astonishing that such a small animal could contain so much menace  and all of it was aimed at the staff in coin   s hand .   the patrician strode forward to snatch the animal  and carding raised his hand and sent a blaze of orange and blue fire searing across the room .   the patrician vanished .  on the spot where he had been standing a small yellow lizard blinked and glared with malevolent reptilian stupidity .   carding looked in astonishment at his fingers  as if for the first time .      all right     he whispered hoarsely .   the wizards stared down at the panting lizard  and then out at the city sparkling in the early morning light .  out there was the council of aldermen  the city watch  the guild of thieves  the guild of merchants  the priesthoods   and none of them knew what was about to hit them .      it has begun  said the hat  from its box on the deck .          what has .     said rincewind .   the rule of sourcery .   rincewind looked blank .     is that good .      do you ever understand anything anyone says to you .   rincewind felt on firmer ground here .     no     he said .     not always .  not lately .  not often .         are you sure you are a wizard .     said conina .      it   s the only thing i   ve ever been sure of     he said  with conviction .      how strange .      rincewind sat on the luggage in the sun on the foredeck of the ocean waltzer as it lurched peacefully across the green waters of the circle sea .  around them men did what he was sure were important nautical things  and he hoped they were doing them correctly  because next to heights he hated depths most of all .      you look worried     said conina  who was cutting his hair .  rincewind tried to make his head as small as possible as the blades flashed by .      that   s because i am .         what exactly is the apocralypse .      rincewind hesitated .     well     he said     it   s the end of the world .  sort of .         sort of .  sort of the end of the world .  you mean we won   t be certain .  we   ll look around and say    pardon me  did you hear something .     .         it   s just that no two seers have ever agreed about it .  there have been all kinds of vague predictions .  quite mad  some of them .  so it was called the apocralypse .     he looked embarrassed .     it   s a sort of apocryphal apocalypse .  a kind of pun  you see .         not very good .         no .  i suppose not .       conina   s scissors snipped busily .      i must say the captain seemed quite happy to have us aboard     she observed .      that   s because they think it   s lucky to have a wizard on the boat     said rincewind .     it isn   t  of course .         lots of people believe it     she said .      oh  it   s lucky for other people  just not for me .  i can   t swim .         what  not a stroke .      rincewind hesitated  and twiddled the star on his hat cautiously .        about how deep is the sea here  would you say .  approximately .     he said .      about a dozen fathoms  i believe .         then i could probably swim about a dozen fathoms  whatever they are .         stop trembling like that  i nearly had your ear off     conina snapped .  she glared at a passing seaman and waved her scissors .     what   s the matter  you never saw a man have a haircut before .      someone up in the rigging made a remark which caused a ripple of ribald laughter in the topgallants  unless they were forecastles .      i shall pretend i didn   t hear that     said conina  and gave the comb a savage yank  dislodging numerous inoffensive small creatures .      ow .         well  you should keep still .         it   s a little difficult to keep still knowing who it is that   s waving a couple of steel blades around my head .      and so the morning passed  with scudding wavelets  the creaking of the rigging  and a rather complex layer cut .  rincewind had to admit  looking at himself in a shard of mirror  that there was a definite improvement .   the captain had said that they were bound for the city of al khali  on the hubward coast of klatch .      like ankh  only with sand instead of mud     said rincewind  leaning over the rail .     but quite a good slave market .         slavery is immoral     said conina firmly .      is it .  gosh     said rincewind .      would you like me to trim your beard .     said conina  hopefully .   she stopped  scissors drawn  and stared out to sea .      is there a kind of sailor that uses a canoe with sort of extra bits on the side and a sort of red eye painted on the front and a small sail .     she said .      i   ve heard of klatchian slave pirates     said rincewind     but this is a big boat .  i shouldn   t think one of them would dare attack it .         one of them wouldn   t     said conina  still staring at the fuzzy area where the sea became the sky     but these five might .      rincewind peered at the distant haze  and then looked up at the man on watch  who shook his head .      come on     he chuckled  with all the humor of a blocked drain .     you can   t really see anything out there .  can you .         ten men in each canoe     said conina grimly .      look  a joke   s a joke           with long curvy swords .         well  i can   t see a              their long and rather dirty hair blowing in the wind           with split ends  i expect .     said rincewind sourly .      are you trying to be funny .         me .         and here   s me without a weapon     said conina  sweeping back across the deck .     i bet there isn   t a decent sword anywhere on this boat .         never mind .  perhaps they   ve just come for a quick shampoo .      while conina rummaged frantically in her pack rincewind sidled over to the archchancellor   s hatbox and cautiously raised the lid .      there   s nothing out there  is there .     he asked .   how should i know .  put me on .      what .  on my head .      good grief .      but i   m not an archchancellor .     said rincewind .     i mean  i   ve heard of cool headed  but        i need to use your eyes .  now put me on .  on your head .      um .      trust me .   rincewind couldn   t disobey .  he gingerly removed his battered gray hat  looked longingly at its disheveled star  and lifted the archchancellor   s hat out of its box .  it felt rather heavier than he   d expected .  the octarines around the crown were glowing faintly .   he lowered it carefully onto his new hairstyle  clutching the brim tightly in case he felt the first icy chill .   in fact he simply felt incredibly light .  and there was a feeling of great knowledge and power   not actually present  but just  mentally speaking  on the tip of his metaphorical tongue .   odd scraps of memory flickered across his mind  and they weren   t any memories he remembered remembering before .  he probed gently  as one touches a hollow tooth with the tongue  and there they were     two hundred dead archchancellors  dwindling into the leaden  freezing past  one behind the other  watched him with blank gray eyes .   that   s why it   s so cold  he told himself  the warmth seeps into the dead world .  oh  no     when the hat spoke  he saw two hundred pairs of pale lips move .   who are you .   rincewind  thought rincewind .  and in the inner recesses of his head he tried to think privately to himself   help .   he felt his knees begin to buckle under the weight of centuries .   what   s it like  being dead .  he thought .   death is but a sleep  said the dead mages .   but what does it feel like .  rincewind thought .   you will have an unrivalled chance to find out when those war canoes get here  rincewind .   with a yelp of terror he thrust upwards and forced the hat off his head .  real life and sound flooded back in  but since someone was frantically banging a gong very close to his ear this was not much of an improvement .  the canoes were visible to everyone now  cutting through the water with an eerie silence .  those black clad figures manning the paddles should have been whooping and screaming  it wouldn   t have made it any better  but it would have seemed more appropriate .  the silence bespoke an unpleasant air of purpose .      gods  that was awful     he said .     mind you  so is this .      crew members scurried across the deck  cutlasses in hand .  conina tapped rincewind on the shoulder .      they   ll try to take us alive     she said .      oh     said rincewind weakly .     good .      then he remembered something else about klatchian slavers  and his throat went dry .      you   ll   you   ll be the one they   ll be after     he said .     i   ve heard about what they do           should i know .     said conina .  to rincewind   s horror she didn   t appear to have found a weapon .      they   ll throw you in a seraglio .      she shrugged .     could be worse .         but it   s got all these spikes and when they shut the door       hazarded rincewind .  the canoes were close enough now to see the determined expressions of the rowers .      that   s not a seraglio .  that   s an iron maiden .  don   t you know what a seraglio is .         um        she told him .  he went crimson .      anyway  they   ll have to capture me first     said conina primly .     it   s you who should be worrying .         why me .         you   re the only other one who   s wearing a dress .      rincewind bridled .     it   s a robe           robe  dress .  you better hope they know the difference .      a hand like a bunch of bananas with rings on grabbed rincewind   s shoulder and spun him around .  the captain  a hublander built on generous bear like lines  beamed at him through a mass of facial hair .      hah .     he said .     they know not that we aboard a wizard have .  to create in their bellies the burning green fire .  hah .        the dark forests of his eyebrows wrinkled as it became apparent that rincewind wasn   t immediately ready to hurl vengeful magic at the invaders .      hah .     he insisted  making a mere single syllable do the work of a whole string of blood congealing threats .      yes  well  i   m just   i   m just girding my loins     said rincewind .     that   s what i   m doing .  girding them .  green fire  you want .         also to make hot lead run in their bones     said the captain .     also their skins to blister and living scorpions without mercy to eat their brains from inside  and        the leading canoe came alongside and a couple of grapnels thudded into the rail .  as the first of the slavers appeared the captain hurried away  drawing his sword .  he stopped for a moment and turned to rincewind .      you gird quickly     he said .     or no loins .  hah .      rincewind turned to conina  who was leaning on the rail examining her fingernails .      you   d better get on with it     she said .     that   s fifty green fires and hot leads to go  with a side order for blisters and scorpions .  hold the mercy .         this sort of thing is always happening to me     he moaned .   he peered over the rail to what he thought of as the main floor of the boat .  the invaders were winning by sheer weight of numbers  using nets and ropes to tangle the struggling crew .  they worked in absolute silence  clubbing and dodging  avoiding the use of swords wherever possible .      musn   t damage the merchandise     said conina .  rincewind watched in horror as the captain went down under a press of dark shapes  screaming     green fire .  green fire .      rincewind backed away .  he wasn   t any good at magic  but he   d had a hundred percent success at staying alive up to now and didn   t want to spoil the record .  all he needed to do was to learn how to swim in the time it took to dive into the sea .  it was worth a try .        what are you waiting for .  let   s go while they   re occupied     he said to conina .      i need a sword     she said .      you   ll be spoiled for choice in a minute .         one will be enough .      rincewind kicked the luggage .      come on     he snarled .     you   ve got a lot of floating to do .      the luggage extended its little legs with exaggerated nonchalance  turned slowly  and settled down beside the girl .      traitor     said rincewind to its hinges .   the battle already seemed to be over .  five of the raiders stalked up the ladder to the afterdeck  leaving most of their colleagues to round up the defeated crew below .  the leader pulled down his mask and leered briefly and swarthily at conina  and then he turned and leered for a slightly longer period at rincewind .      this is a robe     said rincewind quickly .     and you   d better watch out  because i   m a wizard .     he took a deep breath .     lay a finger on me  and you   ll make me wish you hadn   t .  i warn you .         a wizard .  wizards don   t make good strong slaves     mused the leader .      absolutely right     said rincewind .     so if you   ll just see your way clear to letting me go        the leader turned back to conina and signaled to one of his companions .  he jerked a tattooed thumb toward rincewind .      do not kill him too quickly .  in fact       he paused  and treated rincewind to a smile full of teeth .     maybe   yes .  and why not .  can you sing  wizard .         i might be able to     said rincewind  cautiously .     why .         you could be just the man the seriph needs for a job in the harem .     a couple of slavers sniggered .      it could be a unique opportunity     the leader went on  encouraged by this audience appreciation .  there was more broadminded approval from behind him .     rincewind backed away .     i don   t think so     he said     thanks all the same .  i   m not cut out for that kind of thing .         oh  but you could be     said the leader  his eyes bright .     you could be .         oh  for goodness sake     muttered conina .  she glanced at the men on either side of her  and then her hands moved .  the one stabbed with the scissors was possibly better off than the one she raked with the comb  given the kind of mess a steel comb can make of a face .  then she reached down  snatched up a sword dropped by one of the stricken men  and lunged at the other two .   the leader turned at the screams  and saw the luggage behind him with its lid open .  and then rincewind cannoned into the back of him  pitching him forward into whatever oblivion lay in the multidimensional depths of the chest .   there was the start of a bellow  abruptly cut off .   then there was a click like the shooting of the bolt on the gates of hell .   rincewind backed away  trembling .     a unique opportunity     he muttered under his breath  having just got the reference .   at least he had a unique opportunity to watch conina fight .  not many men ever got to see it twice .   her opponents started off grinning at the temerity of a slight young girl in attacking them  and then rapidly passed through various stages of puzzlement  doubt  concern and abject gibbeting terror as they apparently became the center of a flashing  tightening circle of steel .   she disposed of the last of the leader   s bodyguard with a couple of thrusts that made rincewind   s eyes water and  with a sigh  vaulted the rail on the main deck .  to rincewind   s annoyance the luggage barrelled after her  cushioning its fall by dropping heavily onto a slaver  and adding to the sudden panic of the invaders because  while it was bad enough to be attacked with deadly and ferocious accuracy by a rather pretty girl in a white dress with flowers on it  it was even worse for the male ego to be tripped up and bitten by a travel accessory  it was pretty bad for all the rest of the male  too .   rincewind peered over the railing .      showoff     he muttered .   a throwing knife clipped the wood near his chin and ricocheted past his ear .  he raised his hand to the sudden stinging pain  and stared at it in horror before gently passing out .  it wasn   t blood in general he couldn   t stand the sight of  it was just his blood in particular that was so upsetting .      the market in sator square  the wide expanse of cobbles outside the black gates of the university  was in full cry .   it was said that everything in ankh morpork was for sale except for the beer and the women  both of which one merely hired .  and most of the merchandise was available in sator market  which over the years had grown  stall by stall  until the newcomers were up against the ancient stones of the university itself  in fact they made a handy display area for bolts of cloth and racks of charms .   no one noticed the gates swing back .  but a silence rolled out of the university  spreading out across the noisy  crowded square like the first fresh wavelets of the tide trickling over a brackish swamp .  in fact it wasn   t true silence at all  but a great roar of anti noise .  silence isn   t the opposite of sound  it is merely its absence .  but this was the sound that lies on the far side of silence  anti noise  its shadowy decibels throttling the market cries like a fall of velvet .   the crowds stared around wildly  mouthing like goldfish and with about as much effect .  all heads turned toward the gates .   something else was flowing out besides that cacophony of hush .  the stalls nearest the empty gateway began to grind across the cobbles  shedding merchandise .  their owners dived out of the way as the stalls hit the row behind them and scraped relentlessly onward  piling up until a wide avenue of clean  empty stones stretched the whole width of the square .     ardrothy longstaff  purveyor of pies full of personality  peered over the top of the wreckage of his stall in time to see the wizards emerge .   he knew wizards  or up until now he   d always thought he did .  they were vague old boys  harmless enough in their way  dressed like ancient sofas  always ready customers for any of his merchandise that happened to be marked down on account of age and rather more personality than a prudent housewife would be prepared to put up with .   but these wizards were something new to ardrothy .  they walked out into sator square as if they owned it .  little blue sparks flashed around their feet .  they seemed a little taller  somehow .   or perhaps it was just the way they carried themselves .   yes  that was it     ardrothy had a touch of magic in his genetic makeup  and as he watched the wizards sweep across the square it told him that the very best thing he could do for his health would be to pack his knives  and mincers in his little pack and have it away out of the city at any time in the next ten minutes .   the last wizard in the group lagged behind his colleagues and looked around the square with disdain .      there used to be fountains out here     he said .     you people   be off .      the traders stared at one another .  wizards normally spoke imperiously  that was to be expected .  but there was an edge to the voice that no one had heard before .  it had knuckles in it .   ardrothy   s eyes swivelled sideways .  arising out of the ruins of his jellied starfish and clam stall like an avenging angel  dislodging various molluscs from his beard and spitting vinegar  was miskin koble  who was said to be able to open oysters with one hand .  years of pulling limpets off rocks and wrestling the giant cockles in ankh bay had given him the kind of physical development normally associated with tectonic plates .  he didn   t so much stand up as unfold .   then he thudded his way toward the wizard and pointed a trembling finger at the ruins of his stall  from which half a dozen enterprising lobsters were making a determined bid for freedom .  muscles moved around the edges of his mouth like angry eels .      did you do that .     he demanded .      stand aside  oaf     said the wizard  three words which in the opinion of ardrothy gave him the ongoing life expectancy of a glass cymbal .      i hates wizards     said koble .     i really hates wizards .  so i am going to hit you  all right .      he brought his fist back and let fly .   the wizard raised an eyebrow  yellow fire sprang up around the shellfish salesman  there was a noise like tearing silk  and koble had vanished .  all that was left was his boots  standing forlornly on the cobbles with little wisps of smoke coming out of them .   no one knows why smoking boots always remain  no matter how big the explosion .  it seems to be just one of those things .   it seemed to the watchful eyes of ardrothy that the wizard himself was nearly as shocked as the crowd  but he rallied magnificently and gave his staff a flourish .      you people had better jolly well learn from this     he said .     no one raises their hand to a wizard  do you understand .  there are going to be a lot of changes around here .  yes  what do you want .      this last comment was to ardrothy  who was trying to sneak past unnoticed .  he scrabbled quickly in his pie tray .      i was just wondering if your honorship would care to purchase one of these finest pies     he said hurriedly .     full of nourish           watch closely  pie selling person     said the wizard .  he stretched out his hand  made a strange gesture with his fingers  and produced a pie out of the air .   it was fat  golden brown and beautifully glazed .  just by looking at it ardrothy knew it was packed edge to edge with prime lean pork  with none of those spacious areas of good fresh air under the lid that represented his own profit margin .  it was the kind of pie piglets hope to be when they grew up .   his heart sank .  his ruin was floating in front of him with short crust pastry on it .      want a taste .     said the wizard .     there   s plenty more where that came from .         wherever it came from     said ardrothy .   he looked past the shiny pastry to the face of the wizard  and in the manic gleam of those eyes he saw the world turning upside down .   he turned away  a broken man  and set out for the nearest city gate .   as if it wasn   t bad enough that wizards were killing people  he thought bitterly  they were taking away their livelihood as well .      a bucket of water splashed into rincewind   s face  jerking him out of a dreadful dream in which a hundred masked women were attempting to trim his hair with broadswords and cutting it very fine indeed .  some people  having a nightmare like that  would dismiss it as castration anxiety  but rincewind   s subconscious knew being cut to tiny bits mortal dread when it saw it .  it saw it most of the time .   he sat up .      are you all right .     said conina  anxiously .   rincewind swivelled his eyes around the cluttered deck .      not necessarily     he said cautiously .  there didn   t seem to be any black clad slavers around  at least vertically .  there were a good many crew members  all of them maintaining a respectful distance from conina .  only the captain stood reasonably close  an inane grin on his face .      they left     said conina .     took what they could and left .         they bastards     said the captain     but they paddle pretty fast .     conina winced as he gave her a ringing slap on the back .     she fight real good for a lady     he added .     yes .        rincewind got unsteadily to his feet .  the boat was scudding along cheerfully toward a distant smear on the horizon that had to be hubward klatch .  he was totally unharmed .  he began to cheer up a bit .   the captain gave them both a hearty nod and hurried off to shout orders connected with sails and ropes and things .  conina sat down on the luggage  which didn   t seem to object .      he said he   s so grateful he   ll take us all the way to al khali     she said .      i thought that   s what we arranged anyway     said rincewind .     i saw you give him money  and everything .         yes  but he was planning to overpower us and sell me as a slave when he got there .         what  not sell me .     said rincewind  and then snorted     of course  it   s the wizard   s robes  he wouldn   t dare           um .  actually  he said he   d have to give you away     said conina  picking intently at an imaginary splinter on the luggage   s lid .      give me away .         yes .  um .  sort of like  one free wizard with every concubine sold .  um .         i don   t see what vegetables have got to do with it .      conina gave him a long  hard stare  and when he didn   t break into a smile she sighed and said     why are you wizards always nervous around women .      rincewind bridled at this slur .     i like that .     he said     i   ll have you know that   look  anyway  the point is  i get along very well with women in general  it   s just women with swords that upset me .     he considered this for a while  and added     everyone with swords upset me  if it comes to that .      conina picked industriously at the splinter .  the luggage gave a contented creak .      i know something else that   ll upset you     she muttered .      hmmm .         the hat   s gone .         what .           i couldn   t help it  they just grabbed whatever they could           the slavers have made off with the hat .         don   t you take that tone with me .  i wasn   t having a quiet sleep at the time        rincewind waved his hands frantically .     nonono  don   t get excited  i wasn   t taking any tone   i want to think about this           the captain says they   ll probably go back to al khali     he heard conina say .     there   s a place where the criminal element hang out  and we can soon           i don   t see why we have to do anything     said rincewind .     the hat wanted to keep out the way of the university  and i shouldn   t think those slavers ever drop in there for a quick sherry .         you   ll let them run off with it .     said conina  in genuine astonishment .      well  someone   s got to do it .  the way i see it  why me .         but you said it   s the symbol of wizardry .  what wizards all aspire to .  you can   t just let it go like that .         you watch me .     rincewind sat back .  he felt oddly surprised .  he was making a decision .  it was his .  it belonged to him .  no one was forcing him to make it .  sometimes it seemed that his entire life consisted of getting into trouble because of what other people wanted  but this time he   d made a decision and that was that .  he   d get off the boat at al khali and find some way of going home .  someone else could save the world  and he wished them luck .  he   d made a decision .   his brow furrowed .  why didn   t he feel happy about it .   because it   s the wrong bloody decision  you idiot .   right  he thought  i   ve had enough voices in my head .  out .   but i belong here .   you mean you   re me .   your conscience .   oh .   you can   t let the hat be destroyed .  it   s the symbol        all right  i know          the symbol of magic under the lore .  magic under the control of mankind .  you don   t want to go back to those dark ians        what .      ians     do i mean aeons .   right .  aeons .  go back aeons to the time when raw magic ruled .  the whole framework of reality trembled daily .  it was pretty terrible  i can tell me .   how do i know .   racial memory .   gosh .  have i got one of those .   well .  a part of one .   yes  all right  but why me .   in your soul you know you are a true wizard .  the word    wizard    is engraved on your heart .      yes  but the trouble is i keep meeting people who might try to find out     said rincewind miserably .      what did you say .     said conina .   rincewind stared at the smudge on the horizon and sighed .      just talking to myself     he said .      carding surveyed the hat critically .  he walked around the table and stared at it from a new angle .  at last he said     it   s pretty good .  where did you get the octarines .         they   re just very good ankhstones     said spelter .     they fooled you  did they .      it was a magnificent hat .  in fact  spelter had to admit  it looked a lot better than the real thing .  the old archchancellor   s hat had looked rather battered  its gold thread tarnished and unravelling .  the replica was a considerable improvement .  it had style .      i especially like the lace     said carding .      it took ages .         why didn   t you try magic .     carding waggled his fingers  and grasped the tall cool glass that appeared in mid air .  under its paper umbrella and fruit salad it contained some sticky and expensive alcohol .      didn   t work     said spelter .     just couldn   t seem  um  to get it right .  i had to sew every sequin on by hand .     he picked up the hatbox .   carding coughed into his drink .     don   t put it away just yet     he said  and took it out of the bursar   s hands .     i   ve always wanted to try this        he turned to the big mirror on the bursar   s wall and reverently lowered the hat on his rather grubby locks .   it was the ending of the first day of the sourcery  and the wizards had managed to change everything except themselves .   they had all tried  on the quiet and when they thought no one else was looking .  even spelter had a go  in the privacy of his study .  he had managed to become twenty years younger with a torso you could crack rocks on  but as soon as he stopped concentrating he sagged  very unpleasantly  back into his old familiar shape and age .  there was something elastic about the way you were .  the harder you threw it  the faster it came back .  the worse it was when it hit  too .  spiked iron balls  broadswords and large heavy sticks with nails in were generally considered pretty fearsome weapons  but they were nothing at all compared to twenty years suddenly applied with considerable force to the back of the head .   this was because sourcery didn   t seem to work on things that were instrinsically magical .  nevertheless  the wizards had made a few important improvements .  carding   s robe  for example  had become a silk and lace confection of overpoweringly expensive tastelessness  and gave him the appearance of a big red jelly draped with antimacassars .      it suits me  don   t you think .     said carding .  he adjusted the hat brim  giving it an inappropriately rakish air .   spelter said nothing .  he was looking out of the window .   there had been a few improvements all right .  it had been a busy day .     the old stone walls had vanished .  there were some rather nice railings now .  beyond them  the city fairly sparkled  a poem in white marble and red tiles .  the river ankh was no longer the silt laden sewer he   d grown up knowing  but a glittering glass clear ribbon in which   a nice touch   fat carp mouthed and swam in water pure as snowmelt .    from the air ankh morpork must have been blinding .  it gleamed .  the detritus of millennia had been swept away .   it made spelter strangely uneasy .  he felt out of place  as though he was wearing new clothes that itched .  of course  he was wearing new clothes and they did itch  but that wasn   t the problem .  the new world was all very nice  it was exactly how it should be  and yet  and yet   had he wanted to change  he thought  or had he only wanted things rearranged more suitably .      i said  don   t you think it was made for me .     said carding .   spelter turned back  his face blank .      um .         the hat  man .         oh .  um .  very   suitable .      with a sigh carding removed the baroque headpiece and carefully replaced it in its box .     we   d better take it to him     he said .     he   s starting to ask about it .         i   m still bothered about where the real hat is     said spelter .      it   s in here     said carding firmly  tapping the lid .      i mean the  um  real one .         this is the real one .         i meant           this is the archchancellor   s hat     said carding carefully .     you should know  you made it .         yes  but       began the bursar wretchedly .      after all  you wouldn   t make a forgery  would you .           not as  um  such           it   s just a hat .  it   s whatever people think it is .  people see the archchancellor wearing it  they think it   s the original hat .  in a certain sense  it is .  things are defined by what they do .  and people  of course .  fundamental basis of wizardry  is that .     carding paused dramatically  and plonked the hatbox into spelter   s arms .     cogitum ergot hatto  you might say .      spelter had made a special study of old languages  and did his best .         i think  therefore i am a hat .        he hazarded .      what .     said carding  as they set off down the stairs to the new incarnation of the great hall .         i considered i   m a mad hat .        spelter suggested .      just shut up  all right .      the haze still hung over the city  its curtains of silver and gold turned to blood by the light of the setting sun which streamed in through the windows of the hall .   coin was sitting on a stool with his staff across his knees .  it occurred to spelter that he had never seen the boy without it  which was odd .  most wizards kept their staves under the bed  or hooked up over the fireplace .   he didn   t like this staff .  it was black  but not because that was its color  more because it seemed to be a moveable hole into some other  more unpleasant set of dimensions .  it didn   t have eyes but  nevertheless  it seemed to stare at spelter as if it knew his innermost thoughts  which at the moment was more than he did .   his skin prickled as the two wizards crossed the floor and felt the blast of a raw magic flowing outward from the seated figure .   several dozen of the most senior wizards were clustered around the stool  staring in awe at the floor .   spelter craned to see  and saw     the world .   it floated in a puddle of black night somehow set into the floor itself  and spelter knew with a terrible certainty that it was the world  not some image or simple projection .  there were cloud patterns and everything .  there were the frosty wastes of the hublands  the counterweight continent  the circle sea  the rimfall  all tiny and pastel colored but nevertheless real     someone was speaking to him .      um .     he said  and the sudden drop in metaphorical temperature jerked him back into reality .  he realized with horror that coin had just directed a remark at him .      i   m sorry .     he corrected himself .     it was just that the world   so beautiful           our spelter is an aesthete     said coin  and there was a brief chuckle from one or two wizards who knew what the word meant     but as to the world  it could be improved .  i had said  spelter  that everywhere we look we can see cruelty and inhumanity and greed  which tell us that the world is indeed governed badly  does it not .      spelter was aware of two dozen pairs of eyes turning to him .      um     he said .     well  you can   t change human nature .      there was dead silence .   spelter hesitated .     can you .     he said .      that remains to be seen     said carding .     but if we change the world  then human nature also will change .  is that not so  brothers .         we have the city     said one of the wizards .     i myself have created a castle           we rule the city  but who rules the world .     said carding .     there must be a thousand petty kings and emperors and chieftains down there .         not one of whom can read without moving his lips     said a wizard .      the patrician could read     said spelter .      not if you cut off his index finger     said carding .     what happened to the lizard  anyway .  never mind .  the point is  the world should surely be run by men of wisdom and philosophy .  it must be guided .  we   ve spent centuries fighting amongst ourselves  but together   who knows what we could do .         today the city  tomorrow the world     said someone at the back of the crowd .   carding nodded .      tomorrow the world  and       he calculated quickly      on friday the universe .      that leaves the weekend free  thought spelter .  he recalled the box in his arms  and held it out toward coin .  but carding floated in front of him  seized the box in one fluid movement and offered it to the boy with a flourish .      the archchancellor   s hat     he said .     rightfully yours  we think .      coin took it .  for the first time spelter saw uncertainty cross his face .      isn   t there some sort of formal ceremony .     he said .   carding coughed .      i   er  no     he said .     no  i don   t think so .     he glanced up at the other senior mages  who shook their heads .     no .  we   ve never had one .  apart from the feast  of course .  er .  you see  it   s not like a coronation  the archchancellor  you see  he leads the fraternity of wizards  he   s     carding   s voice ran down slowly in the light of that golden gaze     he   s you see   he   s the   first   among   equals        he stepped back hurriedly as the staff moved eerily until it pointed toward him .  once again coin seemed to be listening to an inner voice .      no     he said eventually  and when he spoke next his voice had that wide  echoing quality that  if you are not a wizard  you can only achieve with a lot of very expensive audio equipment .     there will be a ceremony .  there must be a ceremony  people must understand that wizards are ruling  but it will not be here .  i will select a place .  and all the wizards who have passed through these gates will attend  is that understood .           some of them live far off     said carding  carefully .     it will take them some time to travel  so when were you thinking of           they are wizards .     shouted coin .     they can be here in the twinkling of an eye .  i have given them the power .  besides     his voice dropped back to something like normal pitch     the university is finished .  it was never the true home of magic  only its prison .  i will build us a new place .      he lifted the new hat out of its box  and smiled at it .  spelter and carding held their breath .      but        they looked around .  hakardly the lore master had spoken  and now stood with his mouth opening and shutting .   coin turned to him  one eyebrow raised .      you surely don   t mean to close the university .     said the old wizard  his voice trembling .      it is no longer necessary     said coin .     it   s a place of dust and old books .  it is behind us .  is that not so   brothers .      there was a chorus of uncertain mumbling .  the wizards found it hard to imagine life without the old stones of uu .  although  come to think of it  there was a lot of dust  of course  and the books were pretty old        after all   brothers   who among you has been into your dark library these past few days .  the magic is inside you now  not imprisoned between covers .  is that not a joyous thing .  is there not one among you who has done more magic  real magic  in the past twenty four hours than he has done in the whole of his life before .  is there one among you who does not  in his heart of hearts  truly agree with me .      spelter shuddered .  in his heart of hearts an inner spelter had woken  and was struggling to make himself heard .  it was a spelter who suddenly longed for those quiet days  only hours ago  when magic was gentle and shuffled around the place in old slippers and always had time for a sherry and wasn   t like a hot sword in the brain and  above all  didn   t kill people .     terror seized him as he felt his vocal chords twang to attention and prepare  despite all his efforts  to disagree .   the staff was trying to find him .  he could feel it searching for him .  it would vanish him  just like poor old billias .  he clamped his jaws together  but it wouldn   t work .  he felt his chest heave .  his jaw creaked .   carding  shifting uneasily  stood on his foot .  spelter yelped .      sorry     said carding .      is something the matter  spelter .     said coin .   spelter hopped on one leg  suddenly released  his body flooding with relief as his toes flooded with agony  more grateful than anyone in the entire history of the world that seventeen stones of wizardry had chosen his instep to come down heavily on .   his scream seemed to have broken the spell .  coin sighed  and stood up .      it has been a good day     he said .      it was two o   clock in the morning .  river mists coiled like snakes through the streets of ankh morpork  but they coiled alone .  wizards did not hold with other people staying up after midnight  and so no one did .  they slept the troubled sleep of the enchanted  instead .   in the plaza of broken moons  once the boutique of mysterious pleasures from whose flare lit and curtain hung stalls the late night reveller could obtain anything from a plate of jellied eels to the venereal disease of his choice  the mists coiled and dripped into chilly emptiness .   the stalls had gone  replaced by gleaming marble and a statue depicting the spirit of something or other  surrounded by illuminated fountains .  their dull splashing was the only sound that broke the cholesterol of silence that had the heart of the city in its grip .   silence reigned too in the dark bulk of unseen university .  except       spelter crept along the shadowy corridors like a two legged spider  darting   or at least limping quickly   from pillar to archway  until he reached the forbidding doors of the library .  he peered nervously at the darkness around him and  after some hesitation  tapped very  very lightly .   silence poured from the heavy woodwork .  but  unlike the silence that had the rest of the city under its thrall  this was a watchful  alert silence  it was the silence of a sleeping cat that had just opened one eye .   when he could bear it no longer spelter dropped to his hands and knees and tried to peer under the doors .  finally he put his mouth as close as he could to the drafty  dusty gap under the bottommost hinge and whispered     i say .  um .  can you hear me .      he felt sure that something moved  far back in the darkness .   he tried again  his mood swinging between terror and hope with every erratic thump of his heart .      i say .  it   s me  um  spelter .  you know .  could you speak to me  please .      perhaps large leathery feet were creeping gently across the floor in there  or maybe it was only the creaking of spelter   s nerves .  he tried to swallow away the dryness in his throat  and had another go .      look  all right  but  look  they   re talking about shutting the library .      the silence grew louder .  the sleeping cat had cocked an ear .      what is happening is all wrong .     the bursar confided  and clapped his hand over his mouth at the enormity of what he had said .      oook .      it was the faintest of noises  like the eructation of cockroaches .   suddenly emboldened  spelter pressed his lips closer to the crack .        have you got the  um  patrician in there .         oook .         what about the little doggie .         oook .         oh .  good .      spelter lay full length in the comfort of the night  and drummed his fingers on the chilly floor .      you wouldn   t care to  um  let me in too .     he ventured .      oook .      spelter made a face in the gloom .      well  would you  um  let me come in for a few minutes .  we need to discuss something urgently  man to man .         eeek .         i meant ape .         oook .         look  won   t you come out  then .         oook .      spelter sighed .     this show of loyalty is all very well  but you   ll starve in there .         oook oook .         what other way in .         oook .         oh  have it your way     spelter sighed .  but  somehow  he felt better for the conversation .  everyone else in the university seemed to be living in a dream  whereas the librarian wanted nothing more in the whole world than soft fruit  a regular supply of index cards and the opportunity  every month or so  to hop over the wall of the patrician   s private menagerie .   it was strangely reassuring .      so you   re all right for bananas and so forth .     he inquired  after another pause .      oook .         don   t let anyone in  will you .  um .  i think that   s frightfully important .           oook .         good .     spelter stood up and dusted off his knees .  then he put his mouth to the keyhole and added     don   t trust anyone .         oook .      it was not completely dark in the library  because the serried rows of magical books gave off a faint octarine glow  caused by thaumaturgical leakage into a strong occult field .  it was just bright enough to illuminate the pile of shelves wedged against the door .   the former patrician had been carefully decanted into a jar on the librarian   s desk .  the librarian himself sat under it  wrapped in his blanket and holding wuffles on his lap .   occasionally he would eat a banana .   spelter  meanwhile  limped back along the echoing passages of the university  heading for the security of his bedroom .  it was because his ears were nervously straining the tiniest of sounds out of the air that he heard  right on the cusp of audibility  the sobbing .   it wasn   t a normal noise up here .  in the carpeted corridors of the senior wizards    quarters there were a number of sounds you might hear late at night  such as snoring  the gentle clinking of glasses  tuneless singing and  once in a while  the zip and sizzle of a spell gone wrong .  but the sound of someone quietly crying was such a novelty that spelter found himself edging down the passage that led to the archchancellor   s suite .   the door was ajar .  telling himself that he really shouldn   t  tensing himself for a hurried dash  spelter peered inside .      rincewind stared .      what is it .     he whispered .      i think it   s a temple of some sort     said conina .   rincewind stood and gazed upwards  the crowds of al khali bouncing off and around him in a kind of human brownian motion .  a temple  he thought .  well  it was big  and it was impressive  and the architect had used every trick in the book to make it look even bigger and even more impressive than it was  and to impress upon everyone looking at it that they  on the other hand  were very small and ordinary and didn   t have as many domes .  it was the kind of place that looked exactly as you were always going to remember it .   but rincewind felt he knew holy architecture when he saw it  and the frescoes on the big and  of course  impressive walls above him didn   t look at all religious .  for one thing  the participants were enjoying themselves .  almost certainly  they were enjoying themselves .  yes  they must be .  it would be pretty astonishing if they weren   t .      they   re not dancing  are they .     he said  in a desperate attempt not to believe the evidence of his own eyes .     or maybe it   s some sort of acrobatics .      conina squinted upwards in the hard  white sunlight .      i shouldn   t think so     she said  thoughtfully .   rincewind remembered himself .     i don   t think a young woman like you should be looking at this sort of thing     he said sternly .   conina gave him a smile .     i think wizards are expressly forbidden to     she said sweetly .     it   s supposed to turn you blind .      rincewind turned his face upwards again  prepared to risk maybe one eye .  this sort of thing is only to be expected  he told himself .  they don   t know any better .  foreign countries are  well  foreign countries .  they do things differently there .   although some things  he decided  were done in very much the same way  only with rather more inventiveness and  by the look of it  far more often .      the temple frescoes of al khali are famous far and wide     said conina  as they walked through crowds of children who kept trying to sell rincewind things and introduce him to nice relatives .      well  i can see they would be     rincewind agreed .     look  push off  will you .  no  i don   t want to buy whatever it is .  no  i don   t want to meet her .  or him  either .  or it  you nasty little boy .  get off  will you .        the last scream was to the group of children riding sedately on the luggage  which was plodding along patiently behind rincewind and making no attempt to shake them off .  perhaps it was sickening for something  he thought  and brightened up a bit .      how many people are there on this continent  do you think .     he said .      i don   t know     said conina  without turning round .     millions  i expect .         if i were wise  i wouldn   t be here     said rincewind  with feeling .   they had been in al khali  gateway to the whole mysterious continent of klatch  for several hours .  he was beginning to suffer .   a decent city should have a bit of fog about it  he considered  and people should live indoors  not spend all their time out on the streets .  there shouldn   t be all this sand and heat .  as for the wind     ankh morpork had its famous smell  so full of personality that it could reduce a strong man to tears .  but al khali had its wind  blowing from the vastness of the deserts and continents nearer the rim .  it was a gentle breeze  but it didn   t stop and eventually it had the same effect on visitors that a cheese grater achieves on a tomato .  after a while it seemed to have worn away your skin and was rasping directly across the nerves .   to conina   s sensitive nostrils it carried aromatic messages from the heart of the continent  compounded of the chill of deserts  the stink of lions  the compost of jungles and the flatulence of wildebeest .   rincewind  of course  couldn   t smell any of this .  adaptation is a wonderful thing  and most morporkians would be hard put to smell a burning feather mattress at five feet .      where to next .     he said .     somewhere out of the wind .         my father spent some time in khali when he was hunting for the lost city of ee     said conina .     and i seem to remember he spoke very highly of the soak .  it   s a kind of bazaar .         i suppose we just go and look for the second hand hat stalls     said rincewind .     because the whole idea is totally           what i was hoping was that maybe we could be attacked .  that seems the most sensible idea .  my father said that very few strangers who entered the soak ever came out again .  some very murderous types hang out there  he said .      rincewind gave this due consideration .      just run that by me again  will you .     he said .     after you said we should be attacked i seemed to hear a ringing in my ears .         well  we want to meet the criminal element  don   t we .         not exactly want     said rincewind .     that wasn   t the phrase i would have chosen .         how would you put it  then .         er .  i think the phrase    not want    sums it up pretty well .         but you agreed that we should get the hat .         but not die in the process     said rincewind  wretchedly .     that won   t do anyone any good .  not me  anyway .         my father always said that death is but a sleep     said conina .      yes  the hat told me that     said rincewind  as they turned down a narrow  crowded street between white adobe walls .     but the way i see it  it   s a lot harder to get up in the morning .         look     said conina     there   s not much risk .  you   re with me .         yes  and you   re looking forward to it  aren   t you     said rincewind accusingly  as conina piloted them along a shady alley  with their retinue of pubescent entrepreneurs at their heels .     it   s the old herrydeterry at work .         just shut up and try to look like a victim  will you .         i can do that all right     said rincewind  beating off a particularly stubborn member of the junior chamber of commerce     i   ve had a lot of practice .  for the last time  i don   t want to buy anyone  you wretched child .        he looked gloomily at the walls around them .  at least there weren   t any of those disturbing pictures here  but the hot breeze still blew the dust around him and he was sick and tired of looking at sand .  what he wanted was a couple of cool beers  a cold bath and a change of clothing  it probably wouldn   t make him feel better  but it would at least make feeling awful more enjoyable .  not that there was any beer here  probably .  it was a funny thing  but in chilly cities like ankh morpork the big drink was beer  which cooled you down  but in places like this  where the whole sky was an over with the door left open  people drank tiny little sticky drinks which set fire to the back of your throat .  and the architecture was all wrong .  and they had statues in their temples that  well  just weren   t suitable .  this wasn   t the right kind of place for wizards .  of course  they had some local grown alternative  enchanters or some such  but not what you   d call decent magic     conina strolled ahead of him  humming to herself .   you rather like her  don   t you .  i can tell  said a voice in his head .   oh blast  thought rincewind  you   re not my conscience again  are you .   your libido .  it   s a bit stuffy in here  isn   t it .  you haven   t had it done up since the last time i was around .   look  go away  will you .  i   m a wizard .  wizards are ruled by their heads  not by their hearts .   and i   m getting votes from your glands  and they   re telling me that as far as your body is concerned your brain is in a minority of one .   yes .  but it   s got the casting vote  then .   hah .  that   s what you think .  your heart has got nothing to do with this  by the way  it   s merely a muscular organ which powers the circulation of the blood .  but look at it like this   you quite like her  don   t you .   well   rincewind hesitated .  yes  he thought  er     she   s pretty good company  eh .  nice voice .     well  of course     you   d like to see more of her .   well   rincewind realized with some surprise that  yes  he would .  it wasn   t that he was entirely unused to the company of women  but it always seemed to cause trouble and  of course  it was a well known fact that it was bad for the magical abilities  although he had to admit that his particular magical abilities  being approximately those of a rubber hammer  were shaky enough to start with .   then you   ve got nothing to lose  have you .  his libido put in  in an oily tone of thought .   it was at this point rincewind realized that something important was missing .  it took him a little while to realize what it was .   no one had tried to sell him anything for several minutes .  in al khali  that probably meant you were dead .   he  conina and the luggage were alone in a long  shady alley .  he could hear the bustle of the city some way away  but immediately around them there was nothing except a rather expectant silence .      they   ve run off     said conina .      are we going to be attacked .         could be .  there   s been three men following us on the rooftops .      rincewind squinted upwards at almost the same time as three men  dressed in flowing black robes  dropped lightly into the alleyway in front of them .  when he looked around two more appeared from around a corner .  all five were holding long curved swords and  although the lower halves of their faces were masked  it was almost certain that they were grinning evilly .   rincewind rapped sharply on the luggage   s lid .      kill     he suggested .  the luggage stood stock still for a moment  and then plodded over and stood next to conina .  it looked slightly smug and  rincewind realized with jealous horror  rather embarrassed .        why  you       he growled  and gave it a kick      you handbag .      he sidled closer to the girl  who was standing there with a thoughtful smile on her face .      what now .     he said .     are you going to offer them all a quick perm .      the men edged a little closer .  they were  he noticed  only interested in conina .      i   m not armed     she said .      what happened to your legendary comb .         left it on the boat .         you   ve got nothing .      conina shifted slightly to keep as many of the men as possible in her field of vision .      i   ve got a couple of hairclips     she said out of the corner of her mouth .      any good .         don   t know .  never tried .         you got us into this .         relax .  i think they   ll just take us prisoner .         oh  that   s fine for you to say .  you   re not marked down as this week   s special offer .      the luggage snapped its lid once or twice  a little uncertain about things .  one of the men gingerly extended his sword and prodded rincewind in the small of the back .      they want to take us somewhere  see .     said conina .  she gritted her teeth .     oh  no     she muttered .      what   s the matter now .         i can   t do it .         what .      conina put her head in her hands .     i can   t let myself be taken prisoner without a fight .  i can feel a thousand barbarian ancestors accusing me of betrayal .     she hissed urgently .      pull the other one .         no  really .  this won   t take a minute .      there was a sudden blur and the nearest man collapsed in a small gurgling heap .  then conina   s elbows went back and into the stomachs of the men behind her .  her left hand rebounded past rincewind   s ear with a noise like tearing silk and felled the man behind him .  the fifth made a run for it and was brought down by a flying tackle  hitting his head heavily on the wall .   conina rolled off him and sat up  panting  her eyes bright .      i don   t like to say this  but i feel better for that     she said .     it   s terrible to know that i betrayed a fine hairdressing tradition  of course .  oh .         yes     said rincewind somberly     i wondered if you   d noticed them .      conina   s eyes scanned the line of bowmen who had appeared along the opposite wall .  they had that stolid  impassive look of people who have been paid to do a job  and don   t much mind if the job involves killing people .      time for those hairclips     said rincewind .   conina didn   t move .      my father always said that it was pointless to undertake a direct attack against an enemy extensively armed with efficient projectile weapons     she said .   rincewind  who knew cohen   s normal method of speech  gave her a look of disbelief .      well  what he actually said     she added     was never enter an arse kicking contest with a porcupine .         spelter couldn   t face breakfast .   he wondered whether he ought to talk to carding  but he had a chilly feeling that the old wizard wouldn   t listen and wouldn   t believe him anyway .  in fact he wasn   t quite sure he believed it himself     yes he was .  he   d never forget it  although he intended to make every effort .   one of the problems about living in the university these days was that the building you went to sleep in probably wasn   t the same building when you woke up .  rooms had a habit of changing and moving around  a consequence of all this random magic .  it built up in the carpets  charging up the wizards to such an extent that shaking hands with somebody was a sure fire way of turning them into something .  the build up of magic  in fact  was overflowing the capacity of the area to hold it .  if something wasn   t done about it soon  then even the common people would be able to use it   a chilling thought but  since spelter   s mind was already so full of chilling thoughts you could use it as an ice tray  not one he was going to spend much time worrying about .   mere household geography wasn   t the only difficulty  though .  sheer pressure of thaumaturgical inflow was even affecting the food .  what was a forkful of kedgeree when you lifted it off the plate might well have turned into something else by the time it entered your mouth .  if you were lucky  it was inedible .  if you were unlucky  it was edible but probably not something you liked to think you were about to eat or  worse  had already eaten half of .   spelter found coin in what had been  late last night  a broom cupboard .  it was a lot bigger now .  it was only because spelter had never heard of aircraft hangars that he didn   t know what to compare it with  although  to be fair  very few aircraft hangars have marble floors and a lot of statuary around the place .  a couple of brooms and a small battered bucket in one corner looked distinctly out of place  but not as out of place as the crushed tables in the former great hall which  owing to the surging tides of magic now flowing through the place  had shrunk to the approximate size of what spelter  if he had ever seen one  would have called a small telephone booth .   he sidled into the room with extreme caution and took his place among the council of wizards .  the air was greasy with the feel of power .   spelter created a chair beside carding and leaned across to him .      you   ll never believe       he began .        quiet .     hissed carding .     this is amazing .      coin was sitting on his stool in the middle of the circle  one hand on his staff  the other extended and holding something small  white and egg like .  it was strangely fuzzy .  in fact  spelter thought  it wasn   t something small seen close to .  it was something huge  but a long way off .  and the boy was holding it in his hand .      what   s he doing .     spelter whispered .      i   m not exactly sure     murmured carding .     as far as we can understand it  he   s creating a new home for wizardry .      streamers of colored light flashed about the indistinct ovoid  like a distant thunderstorm .  the glow lit coin   s preoccupied face from below  giving it the semblance of a mask .      i don   t see how we will all fit in     the bursar said .     carding  last night i saw           it is finished     said coin .  he held up the egg  which flashed occasionally from some inner light and gave off tiny white prominences .  not only was it a long way off  spelter thought  it was also extremely heavy  it went right through heaviness and out the other side  into that strange negative realism where lead would be a vacuum .  he grabbed carding   s sleeve again .      carding  listen  it   s important  listen  when i looked in           i really wish you   d stop doing that .         but the staff  his staff  it   s not        coin stood up and pointed the staff at the wall  where a doorway instantly appeared .  he marched out through it  leaving the wizards to follow him .   he went through the archchancellor   s garden  followed by a gaggle of wizards in the same way that a comet is followed by its tail  and didn   t stop until he reached the banks of the ankh .  there were some hoary old willows here  and the river flowed  or at any rate moved  in a horseshoe bend around a small newthaunted meadow known rather optimistically as wizards pleasaunce .  on summer evenings  if the wind was blowing toward the river  it was a nice area for an afternoon stroll .     the warm silver haze still hung over the city as coin padded through the damp grass until he reached the center .  he tossed the egg  which drifted in a gentle arc and landed with a squelch .   he turned to the wizards as they hurried up .      stand well back     he commanded .     and be prepared to run .      he pointed the octiron staff at the half sunken thing .  a bolt of octarine light shot from its tip and struck the egg  exploding into a shower of sparks that left blue and purple after images .   there was a pause .  a dozen wizards watched the egg expectantly .   a breeze shook the willow trees in a totally unmysterious way .   nothing else happened .      er       spelter began .   and then came the first tremor .  a few leaves fell out of the trees and some distant water bird took off in fright .   the sound started as a low groaning  experienced rather than heard  as though everyone   s feet had suddenly become their ears .  the trees trembled  and so did one or two wizards .   the mud around the egg began to bubble .   and exploded .   the ground peeled back like lemon rind .  gouts of steaming mud spattered the wizards as they dived for the cover of the trees .  only coin  spelter and carding were left to watch the sparkling white building arise from the meadow  grass and dirt pouring off it .  other towers erupted from the ground behind them  buttresses grew through the air  linking tower with tower .   spelter whimpered when the soil flowed away from around his feet  and was replaced by flagstones flecked with silver .  he lurched as the floor rose inexorably  carrying the three high above the treetops .   the rooftops of the university went past and fell away below them .  ankh morpork spread out like a map  the river a trapped snake  the plains a misty blur .  spelter   s ears popped  but the climb went on  into the clouds .   they emerged drenched and cold into blistering sunlight with the cloud cover spreading away in every direction .  other towers were rising around them  glinting painfully in the sharpness of the day .   carding knelt down awkwardly and felt the floor gingerly .  he signalled to spelter to do the same .   spelter touched a surface that was smoother than stone .  it felt like ice would feel if ice was slightly warm  and looked like ivory .  while it wasn   t exactly transparent  it gave the impression that it would like to be .   he got the distinct feeling that  if he closed his eyes  he wouldn   t be able to feel it at all .   he met carding   s gaze .      don   t look at  um  me     he said .     i don   t know what it is either .      they looked up at coin  who said     it   s magic .         yes  lord  but what is it made of .     said carding .      it is made of magic .  raw magic .  solidified .  curdled .  renewed from second to second .  could you imagine a better substance to build the new home of sourcery .      the staff flared for a moment  melting the clouds .  the discworld appeared below them  and from up here you could see that it was indeed a disc  pinned to the sky by the central mountain of cori celesti  where the gods lived .  there was the circle sea  so close that it might even be possible to dive into it from here  there was the vast continent of klatch  squashed by perspective .  the rimfall around the edge of the world was a sparkling curve .      it   s too big     said spelter under his breath .  the world he had lived in hadn   t stretched much further than the gates of the university  and he   d preferred it that way .  a man could be comfortable in a world that size .  he certainly couldn   t be comfortable about being half a mile in the air standing on something that wasn   t  in some fundamental way  there .   the thought shocked him .  he was a wizard  and he was worrying about magic .   he sidled cautiously back toward carding  who said     it isn   t exactly what i expected .         um .         it looks a lot smaller up here  doesn   t it .         well  i don   t know .  listen  i must tell you           look at the ramtops  now .  you could almost reach out and touch them .      they stared out across two hundred leagues toward the towering mountain range  glittering and white and cold .  it was said that if you travelled hubwards through the secret valleys of the ramtops  you would find  in the frozen lands under cori celesti itself  the secret realm of the ice giants  imprisoned after their last great battle with the gods .  in those days the mountains had been mere islands in a great sea of ice  and ice lived on them still .   coin smiled his golden smile .      what did you say  carding .     he said .      it   s the clear air  lord .  and they look so close and small .  i only said i could almost touch them        coin waved him into silence .  he extended one thin arm  rolling back his sleeve in the traditional sign that magic was about to be performed without trickery .  he reached out  and then turned back with his fingers closed around what was  without any shadow of a doubt  a handful of snow .   the two wizards observed it in stunned silence as it melted and dripped onto the floor .   coin laughed .      you find it so hard to believe .     he said .     shall i pick pearls from rim most krull  or sand from the great nef .  could your old wizardry do half as much .      it seemed to spelter that his voice took on a metallic edge .  he stared intently at their faces .   finally carding sighed and said rather quietly     no .  all my life i have sought magic  and all i found was colored lights and little tricks and old  dry books .  wizardry has done nothing for the world .         and if i tell you that i intend to dissolve the orders and close the university .  although  of course  my senior advisors will be accorded all due status .      carding   s knuckles whitened  but he shrugged .      there is little to say     he said .     what good is a candle at noonday .      coin turned to spelter .  so did the staff .  the filigree carvings were regarding him coldly .  one of them  near the top of the staff  looked unpleasantly like an eyebrow .      you   re very quiet  spelter .  do you not agree .      no .  the world had sourcery once  and gave it up for wizardry .  wizardry is magic for men  not gods .  it   s not for us .  there was something wrong with it  and we have forgotten what it was .  i liked wizardry .  it didn   t upset the world .  it fitted .  it was right .  a wizard was all i wanted to be .   he looked down at his feet .      yes     he whispered .      good     said coin  in a satisfied tone of voice .  he strolled to the edge of the tower and looked down at the street map of ankh morpork far below .  the tower of art came barely a tenth of the way toward them .      i believe     he said     i believe that we will hold the ceremony next week  at full moon .         er .  it won   t be full moon for three weeks     said carding .      next week     coin repeated .     if i say the moon will be full  there will be no argument .     he continued to stare down at the model buildings of the university  and then pointed .      what   s that .      carding craned .      er .  the library .  yes .  it   s the library .  er .      the silence was so oppressive that carding felt something more was expected of him .  anything would be better than that silence .        it   s where we keep the books  you know .  ninety thousand volumes  isn   t it  spelter .         um .  oh .  yes .  about ninety thousand  i suppose .      coin leaned on the staff and stared .      burn them     he said .     all of them .         midnight strutted its black stuff along the corridors of unseen university as spelter  with rather less confidence  crept cautiously toward the impassive doors of the library .  he knocked  and the sound echoed so loudly in the empty building that he had to lean against the wall and wait for his heart to slow down a bit .   after a while he heard a sound like heavy furniture being moved about .      oook .         it   s me .         oook .         spelter .         oook .         look  you   ve got to get out .  he   s going to burn the library .      there was no reply .   spelter let himself sag to his knees .      he   ll do it  too     he whispered .     he   ll probably make me do it  it   s that staff  um  it knows everything that   s going on  it knows that i know about it   please help me           oook .         the other night  i looked into his room   the staff  the staff was glowing  it was standing there in the middle of the room like a beacon and the boy was on the bed sobbing  i could feel it reaching out  teaching him  whispering terrible things  and then it noticed me  you   ve got to help me  you   re the only one who isn   t under the        spelter stopped .  his face froze .  he turned around very slowly  without willing it  because something was gently spinning him .     he knew the university was empty .  the wizards had all moved into the new tower  where the lowliest student had a suite more splendid than any senior mage had before .   the staff hung in the air a few feet away .  it was surrounded by a faint octarine glow .   he stood up very carefully and  keeping his back to the stonework and his eyes firmly fixed on the thing  slithered gingerly along the wall until he reached the end of the corridor .  at the corner he noted that the staff  while not moving had revolved on its axis to follow him .   he gave a little cry  grasped the skirts of his robe  and ran .   the staff was in front of him .  he slid to a halt and stood there  catching his breath .      you don   t frighten me     he lied  and turned on his heel and marched off in a different direction  snapping his fingers to produce a torch that burned with a fine white flame  only its penumbra of octarine proclaimed it to be of magical origin  .   once again  the staff was in front of him .  the light of his torch was sucked into a thin  singing steam of white fire that flared and vanished with a    pop .      he waited  his eyes watering with blue after images  but if the staff was still there it didn   t seem to be inclined to take advantage of him .  when vision returned he felt he could make out an even darker shadow on his left .  the stairway down to the kitchens .   he darted for it  leaping down the unseen steps and landing heavily and unexpectedly on uneven flags .  a little moonlight filtered through a grating in the distance and somewhere up there  he knew  was a doorway into the outside world .   staggering a little  his ankles aching  the noise of his own breath booming in his ears as though he   d stuck his entire head in a seashell  spelter set off across the endless dark desert of the floor .   things clanked underfoot .  there were no rats here now  of course  but the kitchen had fallen into disuse lately   the university   s cooks had been the best in the world  but now any wizard could conjure up meals beyond mere culinary skill .  the big copper pans hung neglected on the wall  their sheen already tarnishing  and the kitchen ranges under the giant chimney arch were filled with nothing but chilly ash     the staff lay across the back door like a bar .  it spun up as spelter tottered toward it and hung  radiating quiet malevolence  a few feet away .  then  quite smoothly  it began to glide toward him .   he backed away  his feet slipping on the greasy stones .  a thump across the back of his things made him yelp  but as he reached behind him he found it was only one of the chopping blocks .   his hand groped desperately across its scarred surface and  against all hope  found a cleaver buried in the wood .  in an instinctive gesture as ancient as mankind  spelter   s fingers closed around its handle .   he was out of breath and out of patience and out of space and time and also scared  very nearly  out of his mind .   so when the staff hovered in front of him he wrenched the chopper up and around with all the strength he could muster    .   and hesitated .  all that was wizardly in him cried out against the destruction of so much power  power that perhaps even now could be used  used by him     and the staff swung around so that its axis was pointing directly at him .   and several corridors away  the librarian stood braced with his back against the library door  watching the blue and white flashes that flickered across the floor .  he heard the distant snap of raw energy  and a sound that started low and ended up in zones of pitch that even wuffles  lying with his paws over his head  could not hear .   and then there was a faint  ordinary tinkling noise  such as might be made by a fused and twisted metal cleaver dropping onto flagstones .     it was the sort of noise that makes the silence that comes after it roll forward like a warm avalanche .   the librarian wrapped the silence around him like a cloak and stood staring up at the rank on rank of books  each one pulsing faintly in the glow of its own magic .  shelf after shelf looked down  at him .  they had heard .  he could feel the fear .   the orangutan stood statue still for several minutes  and then appeared to reach a decision .  he knuckled his way across to his desk and  after much rummaging  produced a heavy key ring bristling with keys .  then he went back and stood in the middle of the floor and said  very deliberately     oook .      the books craned forward on their shelves .  now he had their full attention .         what is this place .     said conina .   rincewind looked around him  and made a guess .   they were still in the heart of al khali .  he could hear the hum of it beyond the walls .  but in the middle of the teeming city someone had cleared a vast space  walled it off  and planted a garden so romantically natural that it looked as real as a sugar pig .      it looks like someone has taken twice five miles of inner  city and girdled them around with walls and towers     he hazarded .      what a strange idea     said conina .      well  some of the religions here   well  when you die  you see  they think you go to this sort of garden  where there   s all this sort of music and  and     he continued  wretchedly     sherbet and  and   young women .      conina took in the green splendor of the walled garden  with its peacocks  intricate arches and slightly wheezy fountains .  a dozen reclining women stared back at her  impassively .  a hidden string orchestra was playing the complicated klatchian bhong music .      i   m not dead     she said .     i   m sure i would have remembered .  besides  this isn   t my idea of paradise .     she looked critically at the reclining figures  and added     i wonder who does their hair .      a sword point prodded her in the small of the back  and the two of them set out along the ornate path toward a small domed pavilion surrounded by olive trees .  she scowled .      anyway  i don   t like sherbet .      rincewind didn   t comment .  he was busily examining the state of his own mind  and wasn   t happy at the sight of it .  he had a horrible feeling that he was falling in love .   he was sure he had all the symptoms .  there were the sweaty palms  the hot sensation in the stomach  the general feeling that the skin of his chest was made of tight elastic .  there was the feeling every time conina spoke  that someone was running hot steel into his spine .   he glanced down at the luggage  tramping stoically alongside him  and recognized the symptoms .      not you  too .     he said .   possibly it was only the play of sunlight on the luggage   s battered lid  but it was just possible that for an instant it looked redder than usual .   of course  sapient pearwood has this sort of weird mental link with its owner   rincewind shook his head .  still  it   d explain why the thing wasn   t its normal malignant self .      it   d never work     he said .     i mean  she   s a female and you   re a  well  you   re a       he paused .     well  whatever you are  you   re of the wooden persuasion .  it   d never work .  people would talk .      he turned and glared at the black robed guards behind him .      i don   t know what you   re looking at     he said severely .   the luggage sidled over to conina  following her so closely that she banged an ankle on it .        push off     she snapped  and kicked it again  this time on purpose .   insofar as the luggage ever had an expression  it looked at her in shocked betrayal .   the pavilion ahead of them was an ornate onion shaped dome  studded with precious stones and supported on four pillars .  its interior was a mass of cushions on which lay a rather fat  middle aged man surrounded by three young women .  he wore a purple robe interwoven with gold thread  they  as far as rincewind could see  demonstrated that you could make six small saucepan lids and a few yards of curtain netting go a long way although   he shivered   not really far enough .   the man appeared to be writing .  he glanced up at them .      i suppose you don   t know a good rhyme for    thou    .     he said peevishly .   rincewind and conina exchanged glances .      plough .     said rincewind .     bough .         cow .     suggested conina  with forced brightness .   the man hesitated .     cow i quite like     he said     cow has got possibilities .  cow might  in fact  do .  do pull up a cushion  by the way .  have some sherbet .  why are you standing there like that .         it   s these ropes     said conina .      i have this allergy to cold steel     rincewind added .      really  how tiresome     said the fat man  and clapped a pair of hands so heavy with rings that the sound was more of a clang .  two guards stepped forward smartly and cut the bonds  and then the whole battalion melted away  although rincewind was acutely conscious of dozens of dark eyes watching them from the surrounding foliage .  animal instinct told him that  while he now appeared to be alone with the man and conina  any aggressive moves on his part would suddenly make the world a sharp and painful place .  he tried to radiate tranquillity and total friendliness .  he tried to think of something to say .        well     he ventured  looking around at the brocaded hangings  the ruby studded pillars and the gold filigree cushions     you   ve done this place up nicely .  it   s       he sought for something suitably descriptive      well  pretty much of a miracle of rare device .         one aims for simplicity     sighed the man  still scribbling busily .     why are you here .  not that it isn   t always a pleasure to meet fellow students of the poetic muse .         we were brought here     said conina .      men with swords     added rincewind .      dear fellows  they do so like to keep in practice .  would you like one of these .      he snapped his fingers at one of the girls .      not  er  right now     rincewind began  but she   d picked up a plate of golden brown sticks and demurely passed it toward him .  he tried one .  it was delicious  a sort of sweet crunchy flavor with a hint of honey .  he took two more .      excuse me     said conina     but who are you .  and where is this .         my name is creosote  seriph of al khali     said the fat man     and this is my wilderness .  one does one   s best .      rincewind coughed on his honey stick .      not creosote as in    as rich as creosote    .     he said .      that was my dear father .  i am  in fact  rather richer .  when one has a great deal of money  i am afraid  it is hard to achieve simplicity .  one does one   s best .     he sighed .      you could try giving it away     said conina .   he sighed again .     that isn   t easy  you know .  no  one just has to try to do a little with a lot .         no  no  but look     said rincewind spluttering bits of stick     they say  i mean  everything you touch turns into gold  for goodness sake .         that could make going to the lavatory a bit tricky     said conina brightly .     sorry .         one hears such stories about oneself     said creosote  affecting not to have heard .     so tiresome .  as if wealth mattered .  true riches lie in the treasure houses of literature .         the creosote i heard of     said conina slowly     was head of this band of  well  mad killers .  the original assassins  feared throughout hubward klatch .  no offense meant .         ah yes  dear father     said creosote junior .     the hashishim .  such a novel ideal .   but not really very efficient .  so we hired thugs instead .         ah .  named after a religious sect     said conina knowingly .   creosote gave her a long look .     no     he said slowly     i don   t think so .  i think we named them after the way they push people   s faces through the back of their heads .  dreadful  really .      he picked up the parchment he had been writing on  and continued     i seek a more cerebral life  which is why i had the city center converted into a wilderness .  so much better for the mental flow .  one does one   s best .  may i read you my latest oeuvre .         egg .     said rincewind  who wasn   t following this .   creosote thrust out one pudgy hand and declaimed as follows          a summer palace underneath the bough   a flask of wine  a loaf of bread  some lamb couscous  with courgettes  roast peacock tongues  kebabs  iced  sherbet  selection of sweets from the trolley and  choice of thou   singing beside me in the wilderness   and wilderness is          he paused  and picked up his pen thoughtfully .      maybe cow isn   t such a good idea     he said .     now that i come to look at it          rincewind glanced at the manicured greenery  carefully arranged rocks and high surrounding walls .  one of the thous winked at him .      this is a wilderness .     he said .      my landscape gardeners incorporated all the essential features  i believe .  they spent simply ages getting the rills sufficiently sinuous .  i am reliably informed that they contain prospects of rugged grandeur and astonishing natural beauty .         and scorpions     said rincewind  helping himself to another honey stick .      i don   t know about that     said the poet .     scorpions sound unpoetic to me .  wild honey and locusts seem more appropriate  according to the standard poetic instructions  although i   ve never really developed the taste for insects .         i always understood that the kind of locust people ate in wildernesses was the fruit of a kind of tree     said conina .     father always said it was quite tasty .         not insects .     said creosote .      i don   t think so .      the seriph nodded at rincewind .     you might as well finish them up  then     he said .     nasty crunchy things  i couldn   t see the point .         i don   t wish to sound ungrateful     said conina  over the sound of rincewind   s frantic coughing .     but why did you have us brought here .         good question .     creosote looked at her blankly for a few seconds  as if trying to remember why they were there .      you really are a most attractive young woman     he said .     you can   t play a dulcimer  by any chance .         how many blades has it got .     said conina .      pity     said the seriph     i had one specially imported .         my father taught me to play the harmonica     she volunteered .   creosote   s lips moved soundlessly as he tried out the idea .      no good     he said .     doesn   t scan .  thanks all the same  though .     he gave her another thoughtful look .     you know  you really are most becoming .  has anyone ever told you your neck is as a tower of ivory .         never     said conina .      pity     said creosote again .  he rummaged among his cushions and produced a small bell  which he rang .   after a while a tall  saturnine figure appeared from behind the pavilion .  he had the look of someone who could think his way through a corkscrew without bending  and a certain something about the eyes which would have made the average rabid rodent tiptoe away  discouraged .   that man  you would have said  has got grand vizier written all over him .  no one can tell him anything about defrauding widows and imprisoning impressionable young men in alleged jewel caves .  when it comes to dirty work he probably wrote the book or  more probably  stole it from someone else .   he wore a turban with a pointy hat sticking out of it .  he had a long thin mustache  of course .      ah  abrim     said creosote .      highness .         my grand vizier     said the seriph .      thought so     said rincewind to himself .      these people  why did we have them brought here .      the vizier twirled his mustache  probably foreclosing another dozen mortgages .      the hat  highness     he said .     the hat  if you remember .         ah  yes .  fascinating .  where did we put it .         hold on     said rincewind urgently .     this hat   it wouldn   t be a sort of battered pointy one  with lots of stuff on it .  sort of lace and stuff  and  and       he hesitated      no one   s tried to put it on  have they .         it specifically warned us not to     said creosote     so abrim got a slave to try it on  of course .  he said it gave him a headache .         it also told us that you would shortly be arriving     said the vizier  bowing slightly at rincewind     and therefore i   that is to say  the seriph felt that you might be able to tell us more about this wonderful artifact .      there is a tone of voice known as interrogative  and the vizier was using it  a slight edge to his words suggested that  if he didn   t learn more about the hat very quickly  he had various activities in mind in which further words like    red hot    and    knives    would appear .  of course  all grand viziers talk like that all the time .  there   s probably a school somewhere .      gosh  i   m glad you   ve found it     said rincewind     that hat is gngngnh           i beg your pardon .     said abrim  signalling a couple of lurking guards to step forward .     i missed the bit after the young lady       he bowed at conina      elbowed you in the ear .         i think     said conina  politely but firmly     you better take us to see it .      five minutes later  from its resting place on a table in the seriph   s treasury  the hat said  at last .  what kept you .      it is at a time like this  with rincewind and conina probably about to be the victims of a murderous attack  and coin about to address the assembled cowering wizards on the subject of treachery  and the disc about to fall under a magical dictatorship  that it is worth mentioning the subject of poetry and inspiration .   for example  the seriph  in his bijou wildernessette  has just riffled back through his pages of verse to revise the lines which begin          get up .  for morning in the cup of day   has dropped the spoon that scares the stars away .           and he has sighed  because the white hot lines searing across his imagination never seem to come out exactly as he wants them .   it is  in fact  impossible that they ever will .     sadly  this sort of thing happens all the time .   it is a well known established fact throughout the many dimensional worlds of the multiverse that most really great discoveries are owed to one brief moment of inspiration .  there   s a lot of spadework first  of course  but what clinches the whole thing is the sight of  say  a falling apple or a boiling kettle or the water slopping over the edge of the bath .  something goes click inside the observer   s head and then everything falls into place .  the shape of dna  it is popularly said  owes its discovery to the chance sight of a spiral staircase when the scientist   s mind was just at the right receptive temperature .  had he used the elevator  the whole science of genetics might have been a good deal different .    this is thought of as somehow wonderful .  it isn   t .  it is tragic .  little particles of inspiration sleet through the universe all the time traveling through the densest matter in the same way that a neutrino passes through a candyfloss haystack  and most of them miss .   even worse  most of the ones that hit the exact cerebral target hit the wrong one .   for example  the weird dream about a lead doughnut on a mile high gantry  which in the right mind would have been the catalyst for the invention of repressed gravitational electricity generation  a cheap and inexhaustible and totally non polluting form of power which the world in question had been seeking for centuries  and for the lack of which it was plunged into a terrible and pointless war  was in fact had by a small and bewildered duck .   by another stroke of bad luck  the sight of a herd of white horses galloping through a field of wild hyacinths would have led a struggling composer to write the famous flying god suite  bringing succour and balm to the souls of millions  had he not been at home in bed with shingles .  the inspiration therefore fell to a nearby frog  who was not in much of a position to make a startling contribution to the field of tone poetry .   many civilizations have recognized this shocking waste and tried various methods to prevent it  most of them involving enjoyable but illegal attempts to tune the mind into the right wavelength by the use of exotic herbage or yeast products .  it never works properly .   and so creosote  who had dreamt the inspiration for a rather fine poem about life and philosophy and how they both look much better through the bottom of a wine glass  was totally unable to do anything about it because he had as much poetic ability as a hyena .   why the gods allow this sort of thing to continue is a mystery .   actually  the flash of inspiration needed to explain it clearly and precisely has taken place  but the creature who received it   a small female bluetit   has never been able to make the position clear  even after some really strenuous coded messages on the tops of milk bottles .  by a strange coincidence  a philosopher who had been devoting some sleepless nights to the same mystery woke up that morning with a wonderful new idea for getting peanuts out of bird tables .   which brings us rather neatly onto the subject of magic .   a long way out in the dark gulfs of interstellar space  one single inspiration particle is clipping along unaware of its destiny  which is just as well  because its destiny is to strike  in a matter of hours  a tiny area of rincewind   s mind .   it would be a tough destiny even if rincewind   s creative node was a reasonable size  but the particle   s karma had handed it the problem of hitting a moving target the size of a small raisin over a distance of several hundred lightyears .  life can be very difficult for a little subatomic particle in a great big universe .   if it pulls it off  however  rincewind will have a serious philosophic idea .  if it doesn   t  a nearby brick will have an important insight which it will be totally unequipped to deal with .       the seriph   s palace  known to legend as the rhoxie  occupied most of the center of al khali that wasn   t occupied by the wilderness .  most things connected with creosote were famed in mythology and the arched  domed  many pillared palace was said to have more rooms than any man had been able to count .  rincewind didn   t know which number he was in .      it   s magic  isn   t it .     said abrim the vizier .   he prodded rincewind in the ribs .      you   re a wizard     he said .     tell me what it does .         how do you know i   m a wizard .     said rincewind desperately .      it   s written on your hat     said the vizier .      ah .         and you were on the boat with it .  my men saw you .         the seriph employs slavers .     snapped conina .     that doesn   t sound very simple .         oh  i employ the slavers .  i am the vizier  after all     said abrim .     it is rather expected of me .      he gazed thoughtfully at the girl  and then nodded at a couple of the guards .      the current seriph is rather literary in his views     he said .     i  on the other hand  am not .  take her to the seraglio  although     he rolled his eyes and gave an irritable sigh     i   m sure the only fate that awaits her there is boredom  and possibly a sore throat .      he turned to rincewind .      don   t say anything     he said .     don   t move your hands .  don   t try any sudden feats of magic .  i am protected by strange and powerful amulets .         now just hold on a minute       rincewind began  and conina said     all right .  i   ve always wondered what a harem looked like .      rincewind   s mouth went on opening and shutting  but no sounds came out .  finally he managed     have you .      she waggled an eyebrow at him .  it was probably a signal of some sort .  rincewind felt he ought to have understood it  but peculiar passions were stirring in the depths of his being .  they weren   t actually going to make him brave  but they were making him angry .  speeded up  the dialogue behind his eyes was going something like this   ugh .   who   s that .   your conscience .  i feel terrible .  look  they   re marching her off to the harem .   rather her than me  thought rincewind  but without much conviction .   do something .   there   s too many guards .  they   ll kill me .   so they   ll kill you  it   s not the end of the world .   it will be for me  thought rincewind grimly .   but just think how good you   ll feel in your next life     look  just shut up  will i .  i   ve had just about enough of me .   abrim stepped across to rincewind and looked at him curiously .      who are you talking to .     he said .      i warn you     said rincewind  between clenched teeth     i have this magical box on legs which is absolutely merciless with attackers  one word from me and           i   m impressed     said abrim .     is it invisible .      rincewind risked a look behind him .      i   m sure i had it when i came in     he said  and sagged .   it would be mistaken to say the luggage was nowhere to be seen .  it was somewhere to be seen  it was just that the place wasn   t anywhere near rincewind .   abrim walked slowly around the table on which sat the hat  twirling his mustache .      once again     he said     i ask you  this is an artifact of power  i feel it  and you must tell me what it does .         why don   t you ask it .     said rincewind .      it refuses to tell me .         well  why do you want to know .      abrim laughed .  it wasn   t a nice sound .  it sounded as though he had had laughter explained to him  probably slowly and repeatedly  but had never heard anyone actually do it .      you   re a wizard     he said .     wizardry is about power .  i have taken an interest in magic myself .  i have the talent  you know .     the vizier drew himself up stiffly .     oh  yes .  but they wouldn   t accept me at your university .  they said i was mentally unstable  can you believe that .         no     said rincewind  truthfully .  most of the wizards at unseen had always seemed to him to be several bricks short of a shilling .  abrim seemed pretty normal wizard material .   abrim gave him an encouraging smile .   rincewind looked sideways at the hat .  it said nothing .  he looked back at the vizier .  if the laughter had been weird  the smile made it sound as normal as birdsong .  it looked as though the vizier had learned it from diagrams .      wild horses wouldn   t get me to help you in any way     he said .      ah     said the vizier .     a challenge .     he beckoned to the nearest guard .      do we have any wild horses in the stables .         some fairly angry ones  master .         infuriate four of them and take them to the turnwise courtyard .  and  oh  bring several lengths of chain .         right away  master .         um .  look     said rincewind .      yes .     said abrim .      well  if you put it like that           you wish to make a point .         it   s the archchancellor   s hat  if you must know     said rincewind .     the symbol of wizardry .         powerful .      rincewind shivered .     very     he said .      why is it called the archchancellor   s hat .         the archchancellor is the most senior wizard  you see .  the leader .  but  look          abrim picked up the hat and turned it around and around in his hands .      it is  you might say  the symbol of office .         absolutely  but look  if you put it on  i   d better warn you        shut up .   abrim leapt back  the hat dropping to the floor .   the wizard knows nothing .  send him away .  we must negotiate .   the vizier stared down at the glittering octarines around the hat .      i negotiate .  with an item of apparel .      i have much to offer  on the right head .   rincewind was appalled .  it has already been indicated that he had the kind of instinct for danger usually found only in certain small rodents  and it was currently battering on the side of his skull in an attempt to run away and hide somewhere .      don   t listen .     he shouted .   put me on  said the hat beguilingly  in an ancient voice that sounded as though the speaker had a mouthful of felt .   if there really was a school for viziers  abrim had come top of the class .      we   ll talk first     he said .  he nodded at the guards  and pointed to rincewind .      take him away and throw him in the spider tank     he said .      no  not spiders  on top of everything else .     moaned rincewind .   the captain of the guard stepped forward and knuckled his forehead respectfully .      run out of spiders  master     he said .      oh .     the vizier looked momentarily blank .     in that case  lock him in the tiger cage .      the guard hesitated  trying to ignore the sudden outburst of whimpering beside him .     the tiger   s been ill  master .  backward and forward all night .           then throw this snivelling coward down the shaft of eternal fire .      a couple of the guards exchanged glances over the head of rincewind  who had sunk to his knees .      ah .  we   ll need a bit of notice of that  master              to get it going again  like .      the vizier   s fist came down hard on the table .  the captain of the guard brightened up horribly .      there   s the snake pit  master     he said .  the other guards nodded .  there was always the snake pit .   four heads turned toward rincewind  who stood up and brushed the sand off his knees .      how do you feel about snakes .     said one of the guards .      snakes .  i don   t like snakes much           the snake pit     said abrim .      right .  the snake pit     agreed the guards .         i mean  some snakes are okay       rincewind continued  as two guards grabbed him by the elbows .   in fact there was only one very cautious snake  which remained obstinately curled up in a corner of the shadowy pit watching rincewind suspiciously  possibly because he reminded it of a mongoose .      hi     it said eventually .     are you a wizard .      as a line of snake dialogue this was a considerable improvement on the normal string of esses  but rincewind was sufficiently despondent not to waste time wondering and simply replied     it   s on my hat  can   t you read .         in seventeen languages  actually .  i taught myself .         really .         i sent off for courses .  but i try not to read  of course .  it   s not in character .         i suppose it wouldn   t be .     it was certainly the most cultured snake voice that rincewind had ever heard .      it   s the same with the voice  i   m afraid     the snake added .     i shouldn   t really be talking to you now .  not like this  anyway .  i suppose i could grunt a bit .  i rather think i should be trying to kill you  in fact .         i have curious and unusual powers     said rincewind .  fair enough  he thought  an almost total inability to master any form of magic is pretty unusual for a wizard and anyway  it doesn   t matter about lying to a snake .      gosh .  well  i expect you won   t be in here long  then .         hmm .         i expect you   ll be levitating out of here like a shot  any minute .      rincewind looked up at the fifteen foot deep walls of the snake pit  and rubbed his bruises .      i might     he said cautiously .      in that case  you wouldn   t mind taking me with you  would you .         eh .         it   s a lot to ask  i know  but this pit is  well  it   s the pits .         take you .  but you   re a snake  it   s your pit .  the idea is that you stay here and people come to you .  i mean  i know about these things .      a shadow behind the snake unfolded itself and stood up .      that   s a pretty unpleasant thing to say about anyone     it said .   the figure stepped forward  into the pool of light .   it was a young man  taller than rincewind .  that is to say  rincewind was sitting down  but the boy would have been taller than him even if he was standing up .   to say that he was lean would be to miss a perfect opportunity to use the word    emaciated .     he looked as though toast racks and deckchairs had figured in his ancestry  and the reason it was so obvious was his clothes .   rincewind looked again .   he had been right the first time .   the lank haired figure in front of him was wearing the practically traditional garb for barbarian heroes   a few studded leather thongs  big furry boots  a little leather holdall and goosepimples .  there was nothing unusual about that  you   d see a score of similarly dressed adventurers in any street of ankh morpork  except that you   d never see another one wearing     the young man followed his gaze  looked down  and shrugged .      i can   t help it     he said .     i promised my mother .         woolly underwear .         strange things were happening in al khali that night .  there was a certain silveriness rolling in from the sea  which baffled the city   s astronomers  but that wasn   t the strangest thing .  there were little flashes of raw magic discharging off sharp edges  like static electricity  but that wasn   t the strangest thing .   the strangest thing walked into a tavern on the edge of the city  where the everlasting wind blew the smell of the desert through every unglazed window  and sat down in the middle of the floor .   the occupants watched it for some time  sipping their coffee laced with desert orakh .  this drink  made from cacti sap and scorpion venom  is one of the most virulent alcoholic beverages in the universe  but the desert nomads don   t drink it for its intoxicating effects .  they use it because they need something to mitigate the effect of klatchian coffee .   not because you could use the coffee to waterproof roofs .  not because it went through the untrained stomach lining like a hot ball bearing through runny butter .  what it did was worse .   it made you knurd .      the sons of the desert glanced suspiciously into their thimble sized coffee cups  and wondered whether they had overdone the orakh .  were they all seeing the same thing .  would it be foolish to pass a remark .  these are the sort of things you need to worry about if you want to retain any credibility as a steely eyed son of the deep desert .  pointing a shaking finger and saying     hey  look  a box just walked in here on hundreds of little legs  isn   t that extraordinary .     would show a terrible and possibly fatal lack of machismo .   the drinkers tried not to catch one another   s eye  even when the luggage slid up to the row of orakh jars against the far wall .  the luggage had a way of standing still that was somehow even more terrible than watching it move about .   finally one of them said     i think it wants a drink .      there was a long silence  and then one of the others said  with the precision of a chess grand master making a killing move     what does .      the rest of the drinkers gazed impassively into their glasses .   there was no sound for a while other than the plopplopping of a gecko   s footsteps across the sweating ceiling .   the first drinker said     the demon that   s just moved up behind you is what i was referring to  o brother of the sands .      the current holder of the all wadi imperturbability championship smiled glassily until he felt a tugging on his robe .  the smile stayed where it was but the rest of his face didn   t seem to want to be associated with it .   the luggage was feeling crossed in love and was doing what any sensible person would do in these circumstances  which was get drunk .  it had no money and no way of asking for what it wanted  but the luggage somehow never had much difficulty in making itself understood .   the tavern keeper spent a very long lonely night filling a saucer with orakh  before the luggage rather unsteadily walked out through one of the walls .     the desert was silent .  it wasn   t normally silent .  it was normally alive with the chirruping of crickets  the buzz of mosquitoes  the hiss and whisper of hunting wings skimming across the cooling sands .  but tonight it was silent with the thick  busy silence of dozens of nomads folding their tents and getting the hell out of it .         i promised my mother     said the boy .     i get these colds  you see .         perhaps you should try wearing  well  a bit more clothing .         oh  i couldn   t do that .  you   ve got to wear all this leather stuff .         i wouldn   t call it all     said rincewind .     there   s not enough of it to call it all .  why have you got to wear it .         so people know i   m a barbarian hero  of course .      rincewind leaned his back against the fetid walls of the snake pit and stared at the boy .  he looked at two eyes like boiled grapes  a shock of ginger hair  and a face that was a battleground between its native freckles and the dreadful invading forces of acne .   rincewind rather enjoyed times like this .  they convinced him that he wasn   t mad because  if he was mad  that left no word at all to describe some of the people he met .   barbarian hero     he murmured .      it   s all right  isn   t it .  all this leather stuff was very expensive .         yes  but  look   what   s your name  lad .         nijel           you see  nijel           nijel the destroyer     nijel added .      you see  nijel              the destroyer           all right  the destroyer       said rincewind desperately .         son of harebut the provision merchant           what .         you   ve got to be the son of someone     nijel explained .     it says it here somewhere       he half turned and fumbled inside a grubby fur bag  eventually bringing out a thin  torn and grubby book .      there   s a bit in here about selecting your name     he muttered .      how come you ended up in this pit  then .         i was intending to steal from creosote   s treasury  but i had an asthma attack     said nijel  still fumbling through the crackling pages .   rincewind looked down at the snake  which was still trying to keep out of everyone   s way .  it had a good thing going in the pit  and knew trouble when it saw it .  it wasn   t about to cause any irritation for anyone .  it stared right back up at rincewind and shrugged  which is pretty clever for a reptile with no shoulders .      how long have you been a barbarian hero .         i   m just getting started .  i   ve always wanted to be one  you see  and i thought maybe i could pick it up as i went along .     nijel peered short sightedly at rincewind .     that   s all right  isn   t it .         it   s a desperate sort of life  by all accounts     rincewind volunteered .      have you thought what it might be like selling groceries for the next fifty years .     nijel muttered darkly .   rincewind thought .      is lettuce involved .     he said .      oh yes     said nijel  shoving the mysterious book back in his bag .  then he started to pay close attention to the pit walls .   rincewind sighed .  he liked lettuce .  it was so incredibly boring .  he had spent years in search of boredom  but had never achieved it .  just when he thought he had it in his grasp his life would suddenly become full of near terminal interest .  the thought that someone could voluntarily give up the prospect of being bored for fifty years made him feel quite weak .  with fifty years ahead of him  he thought  he could elevate tedium to the status of an art form .  there would be no end to the things he wouldn   t do .      do you know any lamp wick jokes .     he said  settling himself comfortably on the sand .      i don   t think so     said nijel politely  tapping a slab .      i know hundreds .  they are very droll .  for example  do you know how many trolls it takes to change a lamp wick .         this slab moves     said nijel .     look  it   s a sort of door .  give me a hand .      he pushed enthusiastically  his biceps standing out on his arms like peas on a pencil .      i expect it   s some sort of secret passage     he added .     come on  use a bit of magic  will you .  it   s stuck .         don   t you want to hear the rest of the joke .     said rincewind  in a pained voice .  it was warm and dry down here  with no immediate danger  not counting the snake  which was trying to look inconspicuous .  some people were never satisfied .      i think not right at the moment     said nijel .     i think i would prefer a bit of magical assistance .         i   m not very good at it     said rincewind .     never got the hang of it  see  it   s more than just pointing a finger at it and saying    kazam           there was a sound like a thick bolt of octarine lightning zapping into a heavy rock slab and smashing it into a thousand bits of spitting  white hot shrapnel  and no wonder .   after a while nijel slowly got to his feet  beating out the small fires in his vest .      yes     he said  in the voice of one determined not to lose his self control .     well .  very good .  we   ll just let it cool down a bit  shall we .  and then we  then we  we might as well be going .      he cleared his throat a bit .      nnh     said rincewind .  he was starting fixedly at the end of his finger  holding it out at arm   s length in a manner that suggested he was very sorry he hadn   t got longer arms .     nijel peered into the smouldering hole .      it seems to open into some kind of room     he said .      nnh .         after you     said nijel .  he gave rincewind a gentle push .   the wizard staggered forward  bumped his head on the rock and didn   t appear to notice  and then rebounded into the hole .   nijel patted the wall  and his brow wrinkled .     can you feel something .     he said .     should the stone be trembling .         nnh .         are you all right .         nnh .      nijel put his ear to the stones .     there   s a very strange noise     he said .     a sort of humming .     a bit of dust shook itself free from the mortar over his head and floated down .   then a couple of much heavier rocks danced free from the walls of the pits and thudded into the sand .   rincewind had already staggered off down the tunnel  making little shocked noise and completely ignoring the stones that were missing him by inches and  in some cases  hitting him by kilograms .   if he had been in any state to notice it  he would have known what was happening .  the air had a greasy feel and smelled like burning tin .  faint rainbows filmed every point and edge .  a magical charge was building up somewhere very close to them  and it was a big one  and it was trying to earth itself .   a handy wizard  even one as incapable as rincewind  stood out like a copper lighthouse .   nijel blundered out of the rumbling  broiling dust and bumped into him standing  surrounded by an octarine corona  in another cave .   rincewind looked terrible .  creosote would have probably noted his flashing eyes and floating hair .   he looked like someone who had just eaten a handful of pineal glands and washed them down with a pint of adrenochrome .  he looked so high you could bounce intercontinental tv off him .   every single hair stood out from his head  giving off little sparks .  even his skin gave the impression that it was trying to get away from him .  his eyes appeared to be spinning horizontally  when he opened his mouth  peppermint sparks flashed from his teeth .  where he had trodden  stone melted or grew ears or turned into something small and scaly and purple and flew away .      i say     said nijel     are you all right .         nnh     said rincewind  and the syllable turned into a large doughnut .      you don   t look all right     said nijel with what might be called  in the circumstances  unusual perspicacity .      nnh .         why not try getting us out of here .     nijel added  and wisely flung himself flat on the floor .   rincewind nodded like a puppet and pointed his loaded digit at the ceiling  which melted like ice under a blowlamp .   still the rumbling went on  sending its disquieting harmonics dancing through the palace .  it is a well known factoid that there are frequencies that can cause panic  and frequencies that can cause embarrassing incontinence  but the shaking rock was resonating at the frequency that causes reality to melt and run out at the corners .   nijel regarded the dripping ceiling and cautiously tasted it .      lime custard     he said  and added     i suppose there   s no chance of stairs  is there .      more fire burst from rincewind   s ravaged fingers  coalescing into an almost perfect escalator  except that possibly no other moving staircase in the universe was floored with alligator skin .   nijel grabbed the gently spinning wizard and leapt aboard .   fortunately they had reached the top before the magic vanished  very suddenly .   sprouting out of the center of the palace  shattering rooftops like a mushroom bursting through an ancient pavement  was a white tower taller than any other building in al khali .   huge double doors had opened at its base and out of them  striding along as though they owned the place  were dozens of wizards .  rincewind thought he could recognize a few faces  faces which he   d seen before bumbling vaguely in lecture theaters or peering amiably at the world in the university grounds .  they weren   t faces built for evil .  they didn   t have a fang between them .  but there was some common denominator among their expressions that could terrify a thoughtful person .   nijel pulled back behind a handy wall .  he found himself looking into rincewind   s worried eyes .      hey  that   s magic .         i know     said rincewind     it   s not right .     nijel peered up at the sparkling tower .      but           it feels wrong     said rincewind .     don   t ask me why .      half a dozen of the seriph   s guards erupted from an arched doorway and plunged toward the wizards  their headlong rush made all the more sinister by their ghastly battle silences .  for a moment their swords flashed in the sunlight  and then a couple of the wizards turned  extended their hands and     nijel looked away .      urgh     he said .   a few curved swords dropped onto the cobbles .      i think we should very quietly go away     said rincewind .      but didn   t you see what they just turned them into .         dead people     said rincewind .     i know .  i don   t want to think about it .      nijel thought he   d never stop thinking about it  especially around   a . m .  on windy nights .  the point about being killed by magic was that it was much more inventive than  say  steel  there were all sorts of interesting new ways to die  and he couldn   t put out of his mind the shapes he   d seen  just for an instant  before the wash of octarine fire had mercifully engulfed them .        i didn   t think wizards were like that     he said  as they hurried down a passageway .     i thought they were more  well  more silly than sinister .  sort of figures of fun .         laugh that one off  then     muttered rincewind .      but they just killed them  without even           i wish you wouldn   t go on about it .  i saw it as well .      nijel drew back .  his eyes narrowed .      you   re a wizard  too     he said accusingly .      not that kind i   m not     said rincewind shortly .      what kind are you  then .         the non killing kind .         it was the way they looked at them as if it just didn   t matter       said nijel  shaking his head .     that was the worst bit .         yes .      rincewind dropped the single syllable heavily in front of nijel   s train of thought  like a tree trunk .  the boy shuddered  but at least he shut up .  rincewind actually began to feel sorry for him  which was very unusual   he normally felt he needed all his pity for himself .      is that the first time you   ve seen someone killed .     he said .      yes .         exactly how long have you been a barbarian hero .         er .  what year is this .      rincewind peered around a corner  but such people as were around and vertical were far too busy panicking to bother about them .          out on the road  then .     he said quietly .     lost track of time .  i know how it is .  this is the year of the hyena .         oh .  in that case  about       nijel   s lips moved soundlessly      about three days .  look     he added quickly     how can people kill like that .  without even thinking about it .         i don   t know     said rincewind  in a tone of voice that suggested he was thinking about it .      i mean  even when the vizier had me thrown in the snake pit  at least he seemed to be taking an interest .           that   s good .  everyone should have an interest .         i mean  he even laughed .         ah .  a sense of humor  too .      rincewind felt that he could see his future with the same crystal clarity that a man falling off a cliff sees the ground  and for much the same reason .  so when nijel said     they just pointed their fingers without so much as        rincewind snapped     just shut up  will you .  how do you think i feel about it .  i   m a wizard  too .         yes  well  you   ll be all right then     muttered nijel .   it wasn   t a heavy blow  because even in a rage rincewind still had muscles like tapioca  but it caught the side of nijel   s head and knocked him down more by the weight of surprise than its intrinsic energy .      yes  i   m a wizard all right     rincewind hissed .     a wizard who isn   t much good at magic .  i   ve managed to survive up till now by not being important enough to die .  and when all wizards are hated and feared  exactly how long do you think i   ll last .         that   s ridiculous .      rincewind couldn   t have been more taken aback if nijel had struck him .      what .         idiot .  all you have to do is stop wearing that silly robe and get rid of that daft had and no one will even know you   re a wizard .      rincewind   s mouth opened and shut a few times as he gave a very lifelike impression of a goldfish trying to grasp the concept of tap dancing .      stop wearing the robe .     he said .      sure .  all those tatty sequins and things  it   s a total giveaway     said nijel  struggling to his feet .      get rid of the hat .         you   ve got to admit that going around with    wizzard    written on it is a bit of a heavy hint .      rincewind gave him a worried grin .        sorry     he said     i don   t quite follow you           just get rid of them .  it   s easy enough  isn   t it .  just drop them somewhere and then you could be a  a  well  whatever .  something that isn   t a wizard .      there was a pause  broken only by the distant sounds of fighting .      er     said rincewind  and shook his head .     you   ve lost me there           good grief  it   s perfectly simple to understand .            not sure i quite catch your drift       murmured rincewind  his face ghastly with sweat .      you can just stop being a wizard .      rincewind   s lips moved soundlessly as he replayed every word  one at a time  then all at once .      what .     he said  and then he said     oh .         got it .  want to try it one more time .      rincewind nodded gloomily .      i don   t think you understand .  a wizard isn   t what you do  it   s what you are .  if i wasn   t a wizard  i wouldn   t be anything .     he took off his hat and twiddled nervously with the loose star on its point  causing a few more cheap sequins to part company .      i mean  it   s got wizard written on my hat     he said .     it   s very important        he stopped and stared at the hat .      hat     he said vaguely  aware of some importunate memory pressing its nose up against the windows of his mind .      it   s a good hat     said nijel  who felt that something was expected of him .      hat     said rincewind again  and then added     the hat .  we   ve got to get the hat .         you   ve got the hat     nijel pointed out .      not this hat  the other hat .  and conina .      he took a few random steps along a passageway  and then sidled back .      where do you suppose they are .     he said .        who .         there   s a magic hat i   ve got to find .  and a girl .         why .         it might be rather difficult to explain .  i think there might be screaming involved somewhere .      nijel didn   t have much of a jaw but  such as it was  he stuck it out .      there   s a girl needs rescuing .     he said grimly .   rincewind hesitated .     someone will probably need rescuing     he admitted .     it might possibly be her .  or at least in her vicinity .         why didn   t you say so .  this is more like it  this is what i was expecting .  this is what heroism is all about .  let   s go .      there was another crash  and the sound of people yelling .      where .     said rincewind .      anywhere .      heroes usually have an ability to rush madly around crumbling palaces they hardly know  save everyone and get out just before the whole place blows up or sinks into the swamp .  in fact nijel and rincewind visited the kitchens  assorted throne rooms  the stables  twice  and what seemed to rincewind like several miles of corridor .  occasionally groups of black clad guards would scurry past them  without so much as a second glance .      this is ridiculous     said nijel .     why don   t we ask someone .  are you all right .      rincewind leaned against a pillar decorated with embarrassing sculpture and wheezed .      you could grab a guard and torture the information out of him     he said  gulping air .  nijel gave him an odd look .      wait here     he said  and wandered off until he found a servant industriously ransacking a cupboard .      excuse me     he said     which way to the harem .         turn left three doors down     said the man  without looking around .      right .        he wandered back again and told rincewind .      yes  but did you torture him .         no .         that wasn   t very barbaric of you  was it .         well  i   m working up to it     said nijel .     i mean  i didn   t say    thank you    .      thirty seconds later they pushed aside a heavy bead curtain and entered the seraglio of the seriph of al khali .   there were gorgeous songbirds in cages of gold filigree .  there were tinkling fountains .  there were pots of rare orchids through which humming birds skimmed like tiny  brilliant jewels .  there were about twenty young women wearing enough clothes for  say  about half a dozen  huddled together in a silent crowd .   rincewind had eyes for none of this .  that is not to say that the sight of several dozen square yards of hip and thigh in every shade from pink to midnight black didn   t start certain tides flowing deep in the crevasses of his libido  but they were swamped by the considerably bigger flood of panic at the sight of four guards turning toward him with scimitars in their hands and the light of murder in their eyes .   without hesitation  rincewind took a step backwards .      over to you  friend     he said .      right .      nijel drew his sword and held it out in front of him  his arms trembling at the effort .   there were a few seconds of total silence as everyone waited to see what would happen next .  and then nijel uttered the battle cry that rincewind would never quite forget to the end of his life .      erm     he said     excuse me              it seems a shame     said a small wizard .   the others didn   t speak .  it was a shame  and there wasn   t a man among them who couldn   t hear the hot whine of guilt all down their backbones .  but  as so often happens by that strange alchemy of the soul  the guilt made them arrogant and reckless .      just shut up  will you .     said the temporary leader .  he was called benado sconner  but there is something in the air tonight that suggests that it is not worth committing his name to memory .  the air is dark and heavy and full of ghosts .   the unseen university isn   t empty  there just aren   t any people there .   but of course the six wizards sent to burn down the library aren   t afraid of ghosts  because they   re so charged with magic that they practically buzz as they walk  they   re wearing robes more splendid than any archchancellor has worn  their pointy hats are more pointed than any hats have hitherto been  and the reason they   re standing so close together is entirely coincidental .      it   s awfully dark in here     said the smallest of the wizards .      it   s midnight     said sconner sharply     and the only dangerous things in here are us .  isn   t that right  boys .      there was a chorus of vague murmurs .  they were all in awe of sconner  who was rumored to do positive thinking exercises .      and we   re not scared of a few old books  are we  lads .     he glowered at the smallest wizard .     you   re not  are you .     he added sharply .      me .  oh .  no .  of course not .  they   re just paper  like he said     said the wizard quickly .      well  then .         there   s ninety thousand of them  mind     said another wizard .      i always heard there was no end to    em     said another .     it   s all down to dimensions  i heard  like what we see is only the tip of the whatever  you know  the thing that is mostly underwater           hippopotamus .         alligator .         ocean .           look  just shut up  all of you .     shouted sconner .  he hesitated .  the darkness seemed to suck at the sound of his voice .  it packed the air like feathers .   he pulled himself together a bit .      right  then     he said  and turned toward the forbidding doors of the library .   he raised his hands  made a few complicated gestures in which his fingers  in some eye watering way  appeared to pass through each other  and shattered the doors into sawdust .   the waves of silence poured back again  strangling the sound of falling woodchips .   there was no doubt that the doors were smashed .  four forlorn hinges hung trembling from the frame  and a litter of broken benches and shelves lay in the wreckage .  even sconner was a little surprised .      there     he said .     it   s as easy as that .  you see .  nothing happened to me .  right .      there was a shuffling of curly toed boots .  the darkness beyond the doorway was limned with the indistinct  eye aching glow of thaumaturgic radiation as possibility particles exceeded the speed of reality in a strong magical field .      now then     said sconner  brightly     who would like the honor of setting the fire .      ten silent seconds later he said     in that case i will do it myself .  honestly  i might as well be talking to the wall .      he strode through the doorway and hurried across the floor to the little patch of starlight that lanced down from the glass dome high above the center of the library  although  of course  there has always been considerable debate about the precise geography of the place  heavy concentrations of magic distort time and space  and it is possible that the library doesn   t even have an edge  never mind a center  .   he stretched out his arms .      there .  see .  absolutely nothing has happened .  now come on in .      the other wizards did so  with great reluctance and a tendency to duck as they passed through the ravished arch .      okay     said sconner  with some satisfaction .     now  has everyone got their matches as instructed .  magical fire won   t work  not on these books  so i want everyone to           something moved up there     said the smallest wizard .   sconner blinked .      what .         something moved up by the dome     said the wizard  adding by way of explanation     i saw it .      sconner squinted upwards into the bewildering shadows  and decided to exert a bit of authority .      nonsense     he said briskly .  he pulled out a bundle of foul smelling yellow matches  and said     now  i want you all to pile           i did see it  you know     said the small wizard  sulkily .      all right  what did you see .         well  i   m not exactly           you don   t know  do you .     snapped sconner .      i saw someth           you don   t know .     repeated sconner     you   re just seeing shadows  just trying to undermine my authority  isn   t that it .     sconner hesitated  and his eyes glazed momentarily .     i am calm     he intoned     i am totally in control .  i will not let           it was           listen  shortarse  you can just jolly well shut up  all right .      one of the other wizards  who had been staring upwards to conceal his embarrassment  gave a strangled little cough .      er  sconner           and that goes for you too .     sconner pulled himself to his full  bristling height and flourished the matches .      as i was saying     he said     i want you to light the matches and   i suppose i   ll have to show you how to light matches  for the benefit of shortarse there   and i   m not out of the window  you know .  good grief .  look at me .  you take a match        he lit a match  the darkness blossomed into a ball of sulphurous white light  and the librarian dropped on him like the descent of man .   they all knew the librarian  in the same definite but diffused way that people know walls and floors and all the other minor but necessary scenery on the stage of life .  if they recall him at all  it was as a sort of gentle mobile sigh  sitting under his desk repairing books  or knuckling his way among the shelves in search of secret smokers .  any wizard unwise enough to hazard a clandestine rollup wouldn   t know anything about it until a soft leathery hand reached up and removed the offending homemade  but the librarian never made a fuss  he just looked extremely hurt and sorrowful about the whole sad business and then ate it .   whereas what was now attempting with considerable effort to unscrew sconner   s head by the ears was a screaming nightmare with its lips curled back to reveal long yellow fangs .   the terrified wizards turned to run and found themselves bumping into bookshelves that had unaccountably blocked the aisles .  the smallest wizard yelped and rolled under a table laden with atlases  and lay with his hands over his ears to block out the dreadful sounds as the remaining wizards tried to escape .   eventually there was nothing but silence  but it was that particularly massive silence created by something moving very stealthily  as it might be  in search of something else .  the smallest wizard ate the tip of his hat out of sheer terror .   the silent mover grabbed him by the leg and pulled him gently but firmly out into the open  where he gibbered a bit with his eyes shut and then  when ghastly teeth failed to meet in his throat  ventured a quick glance .   the librarian picked him up by the scruff of his neck and dangled him reflectively a foot off the ground  just out of reach of a small and elderly wire haired terrier who was trying to remember how to bite people   s ankles .      er       said the wizard  and was then thrown in an almost flat trajectory through the broken doorway  where his fall was broken by the floor .   after a while a shadow next to him said     well  that   s it  then .  anyone seen that daft bastard sconner .      and a shadow on the other side of him said     i think my neck   s broken .         who   s that .         that daft bastard     said the shadow  nastily .      oh .  sorry  sconner .      sconner stood up  his whole body now outlined in magical aura .  he was trembling with rage as he raised his hands .      i   ll show that wretched throwback to respect his evolutionary superiors       he snarled .      get him  lads .      and sconner was borne to the flagstones again under the weight of all five wizards .      sorry  but              you know that if you use              magic near the library  with all the magic that   s in there              get one thing wrong and it   s a critical mass and then           bang .  goodnight  world .      sconner growled .  the wizards sitting on him decided that getting up was not the wisest thing they could do at this point .   eventually he said     right .  you   re right .  thank you .  it was wrong of me to lose my temper like that .  clouded my judgment .  essential to be dispassionate .  you   re absolutely right .  thank you .  get off .      they risked it .  sconner stood up .      that monkey     he said     has eaten its last banana .  fetch           er .  ape  sconner     said the smallest wizard  unable to stop himself .     it   s an ape  you see .  not a monkey        he wilted under the stare .      who cares .  ape  monkey  what   s the difference .     said sconner .     what   s the difference  mr .  zoologist .           i don   t know  sconner     said the wizard meekly .     i think it   s a class thing .         shut up .         yes  sconner .         you ghastly little man     said sconner .   he turned and added  in a voice as level as a sawblade     i am perfectly controlled .  my mind is as cool as a bald mammoth .  my intellect is absolutely in charge .  which one of you sat on my head .  no  i must not get angry .  i am not angry .  i am thinking positively .  my faculties are fully engaged   do any of you wish to argue .         no  sconner     they chorused .      then get me a dozen barrels of oil and all the kindling you can find .  that ape   s gonna fry .      from high in the library roof  home of owls and bats and other things  there was a clink of chain and the sound of glass being broken as respectfully as possible .         they don   t look very worried     said nijel  slightly affronted .      how can i put this .     said rincewind .     when they come to write the list of great battle cries of the world     erm  excuse me    won   t be one of them .      he stepped to one side .     i   m not with him     he said earnestly to a grinning guard .     i just met him  somewhere .  in a pit .     he gave a little laugh .     this sort of thing happens to me all the time     he said .   the guards stared through him .      erm     he said .      okay     he said .   he sidled back to nijel .      are you any good with that sword .      without taking his eyes off the guards  nijel fumbled in his pack and handed rincewind the book .      i   ve read the whole of chapter three     he said .     it   s got illustrations .      rincewind turned over the crumpled pages .  the book had been used so hard you could have shuffled it  but what was probably once the front cover showed a rather poor woodcut of a muscular man .  he had arms like two bags full of footballs  and he was standing knee deep in languorous women and slaughtered victims with a smug expression on his face .   about him was the legend  inne juste   dayes i wille make you a barbearian hero .  below it  in a slightly smaller type  was the name  cohen the barbarean .  rincewind rather doubted it .  he had met cohen and  while he could read after a fashion  the old boy had never really mastered the pen and still signed his name with an    x     which he usually spelled wrong .  on the other hand  he gravitated rapidly to anything with money in it .   rincewind looked again at the illustration  and then at nijel .      seven days .         well  i   m a slow reader .         ah     said rincewind .      and i didn   t bother with chapter six  because i promised my mother i   d stick with just the looting and pillaging  until i find the right girl .         and this book teaches you how to be a hero .         oh  yes .  it   s very good .     nijel gave him a worried glance .     that   s all right  isn   t it .  it cost a lot of money .         well  er .  i suppose you   d better get on with it  then .      nijel squared his  for want of a better word  shoulders  and waved his sword again .      you four had better just jolly well watch out     he said     or   hold on a moment .     he took the book from rincewind and riffled through the pages until he found what he was looking for  and continued     yes  or    the chill winds of fate will blow through your bleached skeletons the legions of hell will drown your living soul in acid .     there .  how d   you like them   excuse me a moment   apples .      there was a metallic chord as four men drew their swords in perfect harmony .     nijel   s sword became a blur .  it made a complicated figure eight in the air in front of him  spun over his arm  flicked from hand to hand behind his back  seemed to orbit his chest twice  and leapt like a salmon .   one or two of the harem ladies broke into spontaneous applause .  even the guards looked impressed .     that   s a triple orcthrust with extra flip     said nijel proudly .     i broke a lot of mirrors learning that .  look  they   re stopping .         they   ve never seen anything like it  i imagine     said rincewind weakly  judging the distance to the doorway .      i should think not .         especially the last bit  where it stuck in the ceiling .      nijel looked upwards .      funny     he said     it always did that at home  too .  i wonder what i   m doing wrong .         search me .         gosh  i   m sorry     said nijel  as the guards seemed to realize that the entertainment was over and closed in for the kill .      don   t blame yourself       said rincewind  as nijel reached up and tried unsuccessfully to free the blade .      thank you .            i   ll do it for you .      rincewind considered his next step .  in fact  he considered several steps .  but the door was too far away and anyway  by the sound of it  things were not a lot healthier out there .   there was only one thing for it .  he   d have to try magic .   he raised his hand and two of the men fell over .  he raised his other hand and the other two fell over .   just as he was beginning to wonder about this  conina stepped daintily over the prone bodies  idly rubbing the sides of her hands .      i thought you   d never turn up     she said .     who   s your friend .         as has already been indicated  the luggage seldom shows any sign of emotion  or at least any emotion less extreme than blind rage and hatred  and therefore it is hard to gauge its feelings when it woke up  a few miles outside al khali  on its lid in a dried up wadi with its legs in the air .   even a few minutes after dawn the air was like the breath of a furnace .  after a certain amount of rocking the luggage managed to get most of its feet pointing the right way  and stood doing a complicated slow motion jig to keep as few of them on the burning sand as possible .   it wasn   t lost .  it always knew exactly where it was .  it was always here .   it was just that everywhere else seemed to have been temporarily mislaid .   after some deliberation the luggage turned and walked very slowly  into a boulder .   it backed away and sat down  rather puzzled .  it felt as though it had been stuffed with hot feathers  and it was dimly aware of the benefits of shade and a nice cool drink .   after a few false starts it walked to the top of a nearby sand dune  which gave it an unrivalled view of hundreds of other dunes .   deep in its heartwood the luggage was troubled .  it had been spurned .  it had been told to go away .  it had been rejected .  it had also drunk enough orakh to poison a small country .   if there is one thing a travel accessory needs more than anything else  it is someone to belong to .  the luggage set off unsteadily across the scorching sand  full of hope .         i don   t think we   ve got time for introductions     said rincewind  as a distant part of the palace collapsed with a thump that vibrated the floor .     it   s time we were        he realized he was talking to himself .   nijel let go of the sword .   conina stepped forward .      oh  no     said rincewind  but it was far too late .  the world had suddenly separated into two parts   the bit which contained nijel and conina  and the bit which contained everything else .  the air between them crackled .  probably  in their half  a distant orchestra was playing  bluebirds were tweeting  little pink clouds were barrelling through the sky  and all the other things that happen at times like this .  when that sort of thing is going on  mere collapsing palaces in the next world don   t stand a chance .      look  perhaps we can just get the introductions over with     said rincewind desperately .     nijel              the destroyer       said nijel dreamily .      all right  nijel the destroyer     said rincewind  and added     son of harebut the           mighty     said nijel .  rincewind gaped a bit  and then shrugged .      well  whoever     he conceded .     anyway  this is conina .  which is rather a coincidence  because you   ll be interested to know that her father was mmph .      conina  without turning her gaze  had extended a hand and held rincewind   s face in a gentle grip which  with only a slight increase in finger pressure  could have turned his head into a bowling ball .      although i could be mistaken     he added  when she took her hand away .     who knows .  who cares .  what does it matter .      they didn   t take any notice .      i   ll just go and see if i can find the hat  shall i .     he said .      good idea     murmured conina .      i expect i shall get murdered  but i don   t mind     said rincewind .      jolly good     said nijel .      i don   t expect anyone will even notice i   m gone     said rincewind .      fine  fine     said conina .      i shall be chopped into small pieces  i expect     said rincewind  walking toward the door at the speed of a dying snail .   conina blinked .        what hat .     she said  and then     oh  that hat .         i suppose there   s no possible chance that you two might be of some assistance .     rincewind ventured .   somewhere inside conina and nijel   s private world the bluebirds went to roost  the little pink clouds drifted away and the orchestra packed up and sneaked off to do a private gig at a nightclub somewhere .  a bit of reality reasserted itself .   conina dragged her admiring gaze away from nijel   s rapt face and turned it onto rincewind  where it grew slightly cooler .   she sidled across the floor and grabbed the wizard by the arm .      look     she said     you won   t tell him who i really am  will you .  only boys get funny ideas and   well  anyway  if you do i will personally break all your           i   ll be far too busy     said rincewind     what with you helping me get the hat and everything .  not that i can imagine what you see in him     he added  haughtily .      he   s nice .  i don   t seem to meet many nice people .         yes  well           he   s looking at us .         so what .  you   re not frightened of him  are you .         suppose he talks to me .      rincewind looked blank .  not for the first time in his life  he felt that there were whole areas of human experience that had passed him by  if areas could pass by people .  maybe he had passed them by .  he shrugged .      why did you let them take you off to the harem without a fight .     he said .      i   ve always wanted to know what went on in one .      there was a pause .     well .     said rincewind .      well  we all sat round  and then after a bit the seriph came in  and then he asked me over and said that since i was new it would be my turn  and then  you   ll never guess what he wanted me to do .  the girls said it   s the only thing he   s interested in .           er .         are you all right .         fine  fine     rincewind muttered .      your face has gone all shiny .         no  i   m fine  fine .         he asked me to tell him a story .         what about .     said rincewind suspiciously .      the other girls said he prefers something with rabbits in it .         ah .  rabbits .         small fluffy white ones .  but the only stories i know are the ones father taught me when i was little  and i don   t think they   re really suitable .         not many rabbits .         lots of arms and legs being chopped off     said conina  and sighed .     that   s why you mustn   t tell him about me you see .  i   m just not cut out for a normal life .         telling stories in a harem isn   t bloody normal     said rincewind .     it   ll never catch on .         he   s looking at us again .     conina grabbed rincewind   s arm .   he shook her off .     oh  good grief     he said  and hurried across the room to nijel  who grabbed his other arm .      you haven   t been telling her about me  have you .     he demanded .     i   ll never live it down if you   ve told her that i   m only just learning how           nonono .  she just wants you to help us .  it   s a sort of quest .      nijel   s eyes gleamed .      you mean a geas .     he said .      pardon .         it   s in the book .  to be a proper hero it says you   ve got to labor under a geas .      rincewind   s forehead wrinkled .     is it a sort of bird .         i think it   s more a sort of obligation  or something     said nijel  but without much certainty .        sounds more like a kind of bird to me     said rincewind     i   m sure i read it in a bestiary once .  large .  couldn   t fly .  big pink legs  it had .     his face went blank as his ears digested what they had just heard his lips say .   five seconds later they were out of the room  leaving behind four prone guards and the harem ladies themselves  who settled down for a bit of story telling .      the desert rimwards of al khali is bisected by the river tsort  famed in myth and lies  which insinuates its way through the brown landscapes like a long damp descriptive passage punctuated with sandbanks .  and every sandbank is covered with sunbaked logs  and most of the logs are the kind of logs that have teeth  and most of the logs opened one lazy eye at the distant sounds of splashing from upstream  and suddenly most of the logs had legs .  a dozen scaly bodies slipped into the turbid waters  which rolled over them again .  the dark waters were unruffled  except for a few inconsequential v shaped ripples .   the luggage paddled gently down the stream .  the water was making it feel a little better .  it spun gently in the weak current  the focus of several mysterious little swirls that sped across the surface of the water .   the ripples converged .   the luggage jerked .  its lid flew open .  it shot under the surface with a brief  despairing creak .   the chocolate colored waters of the tsort rolled back again .  they were getting good at it .      and the tower of sourcery loomed over al khali like a vast and beautiful fungus  the kind that appear in books with little skull and crossbones symbols beside them .   the seriph   s guard had fought back  but there were now quite a lot of bewildered frogs and newts around the base of the tower  and they were the fortunate ones .  they still had arms and legs  of a sort  and most of their essential organs were still on the inside .  the city was under the rule of sourcery   martial lore .   some of the buildings nearest the base of the tower were already turning into the bright white marble that the wizards obviously preferred .   the trio stared out through a hole in the palace walls .      very impressive     said conina critically .     your wizards are more powerful than i thought .         not my wizards     said rincewind .     i don   t know whose wizards they are .  i don   t like it .  all the wizards i knew couldn   t stick one brick on another .         i don   t like the idea of wizards ruling everybody     said nijel .     of course  as a hero i am philosophically against the whole idea of wizardry in any case .  the time will come when     his eyes glazed slightly  as if he was trying to remember something he   d seen somewhere     the time will come when all wizardry has gone from the face of the world and the sons of  of   anyway  we can all be a bit more practical about things     he added lamely .      read it in a book  did you .     said rincewind sourly .     any geas in it .         he   s got a point     said conina .     i   ve nothing against wizards  but it   s not as if they do much good .  they   re just a bit of decoration  really .  up to now .      rincewind pulled off his hat .  it was battered  stained and covered with rock dust  bits of it had been sheared off  the point was dented and the star was shedding sequins like pollen  but the word    wizzard    was still just readable under the grime .      see this .     he demanded  red in the face .     do you see it .  do you .  what does it tell you .         that you can   t spell .     said nijel .      what .  no .  it says i   m a wizard  that   s what .  twenty years behind the staff  and proud of it .  i   ve done my time  i have .  i   ve pas   i   ve sat dozens of exams .  if all the spells i   ve read were piled on top of one another  they   d   it   d   you   d have a lot of spells .           yes  but       conina began .      yes .         you   re not actually very good at them  are you .      rincewind glared at her .  he tried to think of what to say next  and a small receptor area opened in his mind at the same time as an inspiration particle  its path bent and skewed by a trillion random events  screamed down through the atmosphere and burst silently just at the right spot .      talent just defines what you do     he said .     it doesn   t define what you are .  deep down  i mean .  when you know what you are  you can do anything .      he thought a bit more and added     that   s what makes sourcerers so powerful .  the important thing is to know what you really are .      there was a pause full of philosophy .      rincewind .     said conina  kindly .      hmm .     said rincewind  who was still wondering how the words got into his head .      you really are an idiot .  do you know that .         you will all stand very still .      abrim the vizier stepped out of a ruined archway .  he was wearing the archchancellor   s hat .      the desert fried under the flame of the sun .  nothing moved except the shimmering air  hot as a stolen volcano  dry as a skull .   a basilisk lay panting in the baking shade of a rock  dribbling corrosive yellow slime .  for the last five minutes its ears had been detecting the faint thump of hundreds of little legs moving unsteadily over the dunes  which seemed to indicate that dinner was on the way .   it blinked its legendary eyes and uncoiled twenty feet of hungry body  winding out and onto the sand like fluid death .   the luggage staggered to a halt and raised its lid threateningly .  the basilisk hissed  but a little uncertainly  because it had never seen a walking box before  and certainly never one with lots of alligator teeth stuck in its lid .  there were also scraps of leathery hide adhering to it  as though it had been involved in a fight in a handbag factory  and in a way that the basilisk wouldn   t have been able to describe even if it could talk  it appeared to be glaring .   right  the reptile thought  if that   s the way you want to play it .   it turned on the luggage a stare like a diamond drill  a stare that nipped in via the staree   s eyeballs and flayed the brain from the inside  a stare that tore the frail net curtains on the windows of the soul  a stare that     the basilisk realized something was very wrong .  an entirely new and unwelcome sensation started to arise just behind its saucer shaped eyes .  it started small  like the little itch in those few square inches of back that no amount of writhing will allow you to scratch  and grew until it became a second  red hot  internal sun .   the basilisk was feeling a terrible  overpowering and irresistible urge to blink     it did something incredibly unwise .   it blinked .         he   s talking through his hat     said rincewind .      eh .     said nijel  who was beginning to realize that the world of the barbarian hero wasn   t the clean  simple place he had imagined in the days when the most exciting thing he had ever done was stack parsnips .      the hat   s talking through him  you mean     said conina  and she backed away too  as one tends to do in the presence of horror .      eh .         i will not harm you .  you have been of some service     said abrim  stepping forward with his hands out .     but you are right .  he thought he could gain power through wearing me .  of course  it is the other way around .  an astonishingly devious and clever mind .           so you tried his head on for size .     said rincewind .  he shuddered .  he   d worn the hat .  obviously he didn   t have the right kind of mind .  abrim did have the right kind of mind  and now his eyes were gray and colorless  his skin was pale and he walked as though his body was hanging down from his head .   nijel had pulled out his book and was riffling feverishly through the pages .      what on earth are you doing .     said conina  not taking her eyes off the ghastly figure .      i   m looking up the index of wandering monsters     said nijel .     do you think it   s an undead .  they   re awfully difficult to kill  you need garlic and           you won   t find this in there     said rincewind slowly .     it   s   it   s a vampire hat .         of course  it might be a zombie     said nijel  running his finger down a page .     it says here you need black pepper and sea salt  but           you   re supposed to fight the bloody things  not eat them     said conina .      this is a mind i can use     said the hat .     now i can fight back .  i shall rally wizardry .  there is room for only one magic in this world  and i embody it .  sourcery beware .         oh  no     said rincewind under his breath .      wizardry has learned a lot in the last twenty centuries .  this upstart can be beaten .  you three will follow me .      it wasn   t a request .  it wasn   t even an order .  it was a sort of forecast .  the voice of the hat went straight to the hindbrain without bothering to deal with the consciousness  and rincewind   s legs started to move of their own accord .   the other two also jerked forward  walking with the awkward doll like jerking that suggested that they  too  were on invisible strings .      why the oh  no .     said conina     i mean     oh  no    on general principles i can understand  but was there any particular reason .         if we get a chance we must run     said rincewind .        did you have anywhere in mind .         it probably won   t matter .  we   re doomed anyway .         why .     said nijel .      well     said rincewind     have you ever heard of the mage wars .         there were a lot of things on the disc that owed their origin to the mage wars .  sapient pearwood was one of them .   the original tree was probably perfectly normal and spent its days drinking groundwater and eating sunshine in a state of blessed unawareness and then the magic wars broke around it and pitchforked its genes into a state of acute perspicacity .   it also left it ingrained  as it were  with a bad temper .  but sapient pearwood got off lightly .   once  when the level of background magic on the disc was young and high and found every opportunity to burst on the world  wizards were all as powerful as sourcerers and built their towers on every hilltop .  and if there was one thing a really powerful wizard can   t stand  it is another wizard .  his instinctive approach to diplomacy is to hex    em till they glow  then curse them in the dark .   that could only mean one thing .  all right  two things .  three things .   all out .  thaumaturgical .  war .   and there were of course no alliances  no sides  no deals  no mercy  no cease .  the skies twisted  the seas boiled .  the scream and whizz of fireballs turned the night into day  but that was all right because the ensuing clouds of black smoke turned the day into night .  the landscape rose and fell like a honeymoon duvet  and the very fabric of space itself was tied in multidimensional knots and bashed on a flat stone down by the river of time .  for example  a popular spell at the time was pelepel   s temporal compressor  which on one occasion resulted in a race of giant reptiles being created  evolving  spreading  flourishing and then being destroyed in the space of about five minutes  leaving only its bones in the earth to mislead forthcoming generations completely .  trees swam  fishes walked  mountains strolled down to the shops for a packet of cigarettes  and the mutability of existence was such that the first thing any cautious person would do when they woke up in the mornings was count their arms and legs .   that was  in fact  the problem .  all the wizards were pretty evenly matched and in any case lived in high towers well protected with spells  which meant that most magical weapons rebounded and landed on the common people who were trying to scratch an honest living from what was  temporarily  the soil  and lead ordinary  decent  but rather short  lives .   but still the fighting raged  battering the very structure of the universe of order  weakening the walls of reality and threatening to topple the whole rickety edifice of time and space into the darkness of the dungeon dimensions     one story said that the gods stepped in  but the gods don   t usually take a hand in human affairs unless it amuses them .  another one   and this was the one that the wizards themselves told  and wrote down in their books   was that the wizards themselves got together and settled their differences amicably for the good of mankind .  and this was generally accepted as the true account  despite being as internally likely as a lead lifebelt .   the truth isn   t easily pinned to a page .  in the bathtub of history the truth is harder to hold than the soap  and much more difficult to find           what happened  then .     said conina .      it doesn   t matter     said rincewind  mournfully .     it   s going to start all over again .  i can feel it .  i   ve got this instinct .  there   s too much magic flowing into the world .  there   s going to be a horrible war .  it   s all going to happen .  the disc is too old to take it this time .  everything   s been worn too thin .  doom  darkness and destruction bear down on us .  the apocralypse is nigh .         death walks abroad     added nijel helpfully .        what .     snapped rincewind  angry at being interrupted .      i said  death walks abroad     said nijel .      abroad i don   t mind     said rincewind .     they   re all foreigners .  it   s death walking around here i   m not looking forward to .         it   s only a metaphor     said conina .      that   s all you know .  i   ve met him .         what did he look like .     said nijel .      put it like this           yes .         he didn   t need a hairdresser .         now the sun was a blowlamp nailed to the sky  and the only difference between the sand and red hot ash was the color .   the luggage plodded erratically across the burning dunes .  there were a few traces of yellow slime rapidly drying on its lid .   the lonely little oblong was watched  from atop of a stone pinnacle the shape and temperature of a firebrick  by a chimera .   the chimera was an extremely rare species  and this particular one wasn   t about to do anything to help matters .   it judged its moment carefully  kicked away with its talons  folded its leathery wings and plummeted down toward its victim .   the chimera   s technique was to swoop low over the prey  lightly boiling it with its fiery breath  and then turn and rend its dinner with its teeth .  it managed the fire part but then  at the point where experience told the creature it should be facing a stricken and terrified victim  found itself on the ground in the path of a scorched and furious luggage .     the only thing incandescent about the luggage was its rage .  it had spent several hours with a headache  during which it had seemed the whole world had tried to attack it .  it had had enough .   when it had stamped the unfortunate chimera into a greasy puddle on the sand it paused for a moment  apparently considering its future .  it was becoming clear that not belonging to anyone was a lot harder than it had thought .  it had vague  comforting recollections of service and a wardrobe to call its own .   it turned around very slowly  pausing frequently to open its lid .  it might have been sniffing the air  if it had a nose .  at last it made up its mind  if it had a mind .      the hat and its wearer also strode purposefully across the rubble that had been the legendary rhoxie to the foot of the tower of sourcery  their unwilling entourage straggling along behind them .   there were doors at the foot of the tower .  unlike those of unseen university  which were usually propped wide open  they were tightly shut .  they seemed to glow .      you three are privileged to be here     said the hat through abrim   s slack mouth .     this is the moment when wizardry stops running     he glanced witheringly at rincewind     and starts fighting back .  you will remember it for the rest of your lives .         what  until lunchtime .     said rincewind weakly .      watch closely     said abrim .  he extended his hands .      if we get a chance     whispered rincewind to nijel     we run  right .         where to .         from     said rincewind     the important word is from .         i don   t trust this man     said nijel .     i try not to judge from first impressions  but i definitely think he   s up to no good .         he had you thrown in a snake pit .         perhaps i should have taken the hint .        the vizier started to mutter .  even rincewind  whose few talents included a gift for languages  didn   t recognize it  but it sounded like the kind of language designed specifically for muttering  the words curling out like scythes at ankle height  dark and red and merciless .  they made complicated swirls in the air  and then drifted gently toward the doors of the tower .   where they touched the white marble it turned black and crumbled .   as the remains drifted to the ground a wizard stepped through and looked abrim up and down .   rincewind was used to the dressy ways of wizards  but this one was really impressive  his robe so padded and crenellated and buttressed in fantastic folds and creases that it had probably been designed by an architect .  the matching hat looked like a wedding cake that had collided intimately with a christmas tree .   the actual face  peering through the small gap between the baroque collar and the filigreed fringe of the brim  was a bit of a disappointment .  at some time in the past it had thought its appearance would be improved by a thin  scruffy mustache .  it had been wrong .      that was our bloody door .     it said .     you   re really going to regret this .      abrim folded his arms .   this seemed to infuriate the other wizard .  he flung up his arms  untangled his hands from the lace on his sleeves  and sent a flare screaming across the gap .   it struck abrim in the chest and rebounded in a gout of incandescence  but when the blue after images allowed rincewind to see he saw abrim  unharmed .   his opponent frantically patted out the last of the little fires in his own clothing and looked up with murder in his eyes .      you don   t seem to understand     he rasped .     it   s sourcery you   re dealing with now .  you can   t fight sourcery .         i can use sourcery     said abrim .     the wizard snarled and lofted a fireball  which burst harmlessly inches from abrim   s dreadful grin .   a look of acute puzzlement passed across the other one   s face .  he tried again  sending lines of blue hot magic lancing straight from infinity toward abrim   s heart .  abrim waved them away .      your choice is simple     he said .     you can join me  or you can die .      it was at this point that rincewind became aware of a regular scraping sound close to his ear .  it had an unpleasant metallic ring .   he half turned  and felt the familiar and very uncomfortable prickly feeling of time slowing down around him .   death paused in the act of running a whetstone along the edge of his scythe and gave him a nod of acknowledgment  as between one professional and another .   he put a bony digit to his lips  or rather  to the place where his lips would have been if he   d had lips .   all wizards can see death  but they don   t necessarily want to .   there was a popping in rincewind   s ears and the specter vanished .   abrim and the rival wizard were surrounded by a corona of randomized magic  and it was evidently having no effect on abrim .  rincewind drifted back into the land of the living just in time to see the man reach out and grab the wizard by his tasteless collar .      you cannot defeat me     he said in the hat   s voice .     i have had two thousand years of harnessing power to my own ends .  i can draw my power from your power .  yield to me or you won   t even have time to regret it .      the wizard struggled and  unfortunately  let pride win over caution .      never .     he said .      die     suggested abrim .   rincewind had seen many strange things in his life  most of them with extreme reluctance  but he had never seen anyone actually killed by magic .   wizards didn   t kill ordinary people because a  they seldom noticed them and b  it wasn   t considered sporting and c  besides  who   d do all the cooking and growing food and things .  and killing a brother wizard with magic was well nigh impossible on account of the layers of protective spells that any cautious wizard maintained about his person at all times .   the first thing a young wizard learns at unseen university   apart from where his peg is  and which way to the lavatory   is that he must protect himself at all times .   some people think this is paranoia  but it isn   t .  paranoids only think everyone is out to get them .  wizards know it .   the little wizard was wearing the psychic equivalent of three feet of tempered steel and it was being melted like butter under a blowlamp .  it streamed away  vanished .   if there are words to describe what happened to the wizard next then they   re imprisoned inside a wild thesaurus in the unseen university library .  perhaps it   s best left to the imagination  except that anyone able to imagine the kind of shape that rincewind saw writhing painfully for a few seconds before it mercifully vanished must be a candidate for the famous white canvas blazer with the optional long sleeves .      so perish all enemies     said abrim .   he turned his face up to the heights of the tower .      i challenge     he said .     and those who will not face me must follow me  according to the lore .      there was a long  thick pause caused by a lot of people listening very hard .  eventually  from the top of the tower  a voice called out uncertainly     whereabouts in the lore .         i embody the lore .      there was a distant whispering and then the same voice called out     the lore is dead .  sourcery is above the lo        the sentence ended in a scream because abrim raised his left hand and sent a thin beam of green light in the precise direction of the speaker .   it was at about this moment that rincewind realized that he could move his limbs himself .  the hat had temporarily lost interest in them .  he glanced sideways at conina .  in instant  unspoken agreement they each grasped one of nijel   s arms and turned and ran  and didn   t stop until they   d put several walls between them and the tower .  rincewind ran expecting something to hit him in the back of the neck .  possibly the world .   all three landed in the rubble and lay there panting .      you needn   t have done that     muttered nijel .     i was just getting ready to really give him a seeing to .  how can i ever        there was an explosion behind them and shafts of multi colored fire screamed overhead  striking sparks off the masonry .  then there was a sound like an enormous cork being pulled out of a small bottle  and a peal of laughter that  somehow  wasn   t very amusing .  the ground shook .      what   s going on .     said conina .      magical war     said rincewind .      is that good .         no .         but surely you want wizardry to triumph .     said nijel .   rincewind shrugged  and ducked as something unseen and big whirred overhead making a noise like a partridge .      i   ve never seen wizards fight     said nijel .  he started to scramble up the rubble and screamed as conina grabbed him by the leg .      i don   t think that would be a good idea     she said .     rincewind .      the wizard shook his head gloomily  and picked up a pebble .  he tossed it up above the ruined wall  where it turned into a small blue teapot .  it smashed when it hit the ground .      the spells react with one another     he said .     there   s no telling what they   ll do .           but we   re safe behind this wall .     said conina .   rincewind brightened a bit .     are we .     he said .      i was asking you .         oh .  no .  i shouldn   t think so .  it   s just ordinary stone .  the right spell and   phooey .         phooey .         right .         shall we run away again .         it   s worth a try .      they made it to another upright wall a few seconds before a randomly spitting ball of yellow fire landed where they had been lying and turned the ground into something awful .  the whole area around the tower was a tornado of sparkling air .      we need a plan     said nijel .      we could try running again     said rincewind .      that doesn   t solve anything .         solves most things     said rincewind .      how far do we have to go to be safe .     said conina .   rincewind risked a look around the wall .      interesting philosophical question     he said .     i   ve been a long way  and i   ve never been safe .      conina sighed and stared at a pile of rubble nearby .  she stared at it again .  there was something odd there  and she couldn   t quite put her finger on it .      i could rush at them     said nijel  vaguely .  he stared yearningly at conina   s back .      wouldn   t work     said rincewind .     nothing works against magic .  except stronger magic .  and then the only thing that beats stronger magic is even stronger magic .  and next thing you know           phooey .     suggested nijel .      it happened before     said rincewind .     went on for thousands of years until not a           do you know what   s odd about that heap of stone .     said conina .     rincewind glanced at it .  he screwed up his eyes .      what  apart from the legs .     he said .   it took several minutes to dig the seriph out .  he was still clutching a wine bottle  which was almost empty  and blinked at them all in vague recognition .      powerful     he said  and then after some effort added     stuff  this vintage .  felt     he continued     as though the place fell on me .         it did     said rincewind .      ah .  that would be it  then .     creosote focused on conina  after several attempts  and rocked backwards .     my word     he said     the young lady again .  very impressive .         i say       nijel began .      your hair     said the seriph  rocking slowly forward again     is like  is like a flock of goats that graze upon the side of mount gebra .         look here           your breasts are like  like     the seriph swayed sideways a little  and gave a brief  sorrowful glance at the empty bottle     are like the jewelled melons in the fabled gardens of dawn .      conina   s eyes widened .     they are .     she said .      no     said the seriph     doubt about it .  i know jewelled melons when i see them .  as the white does in the meadows of the water margin are your thighs  which           erm  excuse me       said nijel  clearing his throat with malice aforethought .   creosote swayed in his direction .      hmm .     he said .      where i come from     said nijel stonily     we don   t talk to ladies like that .      conina sighed as nijel shuffled protectively in front of her .  it was  she reflected  absolutely true .      in fact     he went on  sticking out his jaw as far as possible  which still made it appear like a dimple     i   ve a jolly good mind           open to debate     said rincewind  stepping forward .     er  sir  sire  we need to get out .  i suppose you wouldn   t know the way .         thousands of rooms     said the seriph     in here  you know .  not been out in years .     he hiccuped .     decades .  ians .  never been out  in fact .     his face glazed over in the act of composition .     the bird of time has but  um  a little way to walk and lo .  the bird is on its feet .         it   s a geas     muttered rincewind .   creosote swayed at him .     abrim does all the ruling  you see .  terrible hard work .         he   s not     said rincewind     making a very good job of it just at present .         and we   d sort of like to get away     said conina  who was still turning over the phrase about the goats .      and i   ve got this geas     said nijel  glaring at rincewind .   creosote patted him on the arm .      that   s nice     he said .     everyone should have a pet .      so if you happen to know if you own any stables or anything       prompted rincewind .      hundreds     said creosote .     i own some of the finest  most   finest horses in the world .     his brow wrinkled .     so they tell me .         but you wouldn   t happen to know where they are .         not as such     the seriph admitted .  a random spray of magic turned the nearby wall into arsenic meringue .      i think we might have been better off in the snake pit     said rincewind  turning away .   creosote took another sorrowful glance at his empty wine bottle .      i know where there   s a magic carpet     he said .      no     said rincewind  raising his hands protectively .     absolutely not .  don   t even           it belonged to my grandfather           a real magic carpet .     said nijel .      listen     said rincewind urgently .     i get vertigo just listening to tall stories .           oh  quite     the seriph burped gently     genuine .  very pretty pattern .     he squinted at the bottle again  and sighed .     it was a lovely blue color     he added .      and you wouldn   t happen to know where it is .     said conina slowly  in the manner of one creeping up very carefully to a wild animal that might take fright at any moment .      in the treasury .  i know the way there .  i   m extremely rich  you know .  or so they tell me .     he lowered his voice and tried to wink at conina  eventually managing it with both eyes .     we could sit on it     he said  breaking into a sweat .     and you could tell me a story        rincewind tried to scream through gritted teeth .   his ankles were already beginning to sweat .      i   m not going to ride on a magic carpet .     he hissed .     i   m afraid of grounds .         you mean heights     said conina .     and stop being silly .         i know what i mean .  it   s the grounds that kill you .         the battle of al khali was a hammer headed cloud  in whose roiling depths weird shapes could be heard and strange sounds were seen .  occasional misses seared across the city .  where they landed things were   different .   for example  a large part of the soak had turned into an impenetrable forest of giant yellow mushrooms .  no one knew what effect this had on its inhabitants  although possibly they hadn   t noticed .   the temple of offler the crocodile god  patron deity of the city  was now a rather ugly sugary thing constructed in five dimensions .  but this was no problem because it was being eaten by a herd of giant ants .   on the other hand  not many people were left to appreciate this statement against uncontrolled civic alteration  because most of them were running for their lives .  they fled across the fertile fields in a steady stream .  some had taken to boats  but this method of escape had ceased when most of the harbor area turned into a swamp in which  for no obvious reason  a couple of small pink elephants were building a nest .   down below the panic on the roads the luggage paddled slowly up one of the reed lined drainage ditches .  a little way ahead of it a moving wave of small alligators  rats and snapping turtles was pouring out of the water and scrambling frantically up the bank  propelled by some vague but absolutely accurate animal instinct .   the luggage   s lid was set in an expression of grim determination .  it didn   t want much out of the world  except for the total extinction of every other lifeform  but what it needed more than anything else now was its owner .      it was easy to see that the room was a treasury by its incredible emptiness .  doors hung off hooks .  barred alcoves had been smashed in .  lots of smashed chests lay around  and this gave rincewind a pang of guilt and he wondered  for about two seconds  where the luggage had got to .   there was a respectful silence  as there always is when large sums of money have just passed away .  nijel wandered off and prodded some of the chests in a forlorn search for secret drawers  as per the instructions in chapter eleven .   conina reached down and picked up a small copper coin .      how horrible     said rincewind eventually .     a treasury with no treasure in it .      the seriph stood and beamed .     not to worry     he said .      but all your money has been stolen .     said conina .      the servants  i expect     said creosote .     very disloyal of them .      rincewind gave him an odd look .     doesn   t it worry you .         not much .  i never really spent anything .  i   ve often wondered what being poor was like .         you   re going to get a huge opportunity to find out .         will i need training .         it comes naturally     said rincewind .     you pick it up as you go along .     there was a distant explosion and part of the ceiling turned to jelly .        erm  excuse me     said nijel     this carpet           yes     said conina     the carpet .      creosote gave them a benevolent  slightly tipsy smile .      ah  yes .  the carpet .  push the nose of the statue behind you  peach buttocked jewel of the desert dawn .      conina  blushing  performed this act of minor sacrilege on a large green statue of offler the crocodile god .   nothing happened .  secret compartments assiduously failed to open .      um .  try the left hand .      she gave it an experimental twist .  creosote scratched his head .      maybe it was the right hand           i should try and remember  if i were you     said conina sharply  when that didn   t work either .     there aren   t many bits left that i   d care to pull .         what   s that thing there .     said rincewind .      you   re really going to hear about it if it isn   t the tail     said conina  and gave it a kick .   there was a distant metallic groaning noise  like a saucepan in pain .  the statue shuddered .  it was followed by a few heavy clonks somewhere inside the wall  and offler the crocodile god grated ponderously aside .  there was a tunnel behind him .      my grandfather had this built for our more interesting treasure     said creosote .     he was very      he groped for a word      ingenious .         if you think i   m setting foot in there       rincewind began .      stand aside     said nijel  loftily .     i will go first .         there could be traps       said conina doubtfully .  she shot the seriph a glance .      oh  probably  o gazelle of heaven     he said .     i haven   t been in there since i was six .  there were some slabs you shouldn   t tread on  i think .         don   t worry about that     said nijel  peering into the gloom of the tunnel .     i shouldn   t think there   s a booby trap that i couldn   t spot .           had a lot of experience at this sort of thing  have you .     said rincewind sourly .      well  i know chapter fourteen by heart .  it had illustrations     said nijel  and ducked into the shadows .   they waited for several minutes in what would have been a horrified hush if it wasn   t for the muffled grunts and occasional thumping noises from the tunnel .  eventually nijel   s voice echoed back down to them from a distance .      there   s absolutely nothing     he said .     i   ve tried everything .  it   s as steady as a rock .  everything must have seized up  or something .      rincewind and conina exchanged glances .      he doesn   t know the first thing about traps     she said .     when i was five  my father made me walk all the way down a passage that he   d rigged up  just to teach me           he got through  didn   t he .     said rincewind .   there was a noise like a damp finger dragged across glass  but amplified a billion times  and the floor shook .      anyway  we haven   t got a lot of choice     he added  and ducked into the tunnel .  the others followed him .  many people who had gotten to know rincewind had come to treat him as a sort of two legged miner   s canary  and tended to assume that if rincewind was still upright and not actually running then some hope remained .      this is fun     said creosote .     me  robbing my own treasury .  if i catch myself i can have myself flung into the snake pit .         but you could throw yourself on your mercy     said conina  running a paranoid eye over the dusty stonework .      oh  no .  i think i would have to teach me a lesson  as an example to myself .      there was a little click above them .  a small slab slid aside and a rusty metal hook descended slowly and jerkily .  another bar creaked out of the wall and tapped rincewind on the shoulder .  as he swung around  the first hook hung a yellowing notice on his back and retracted into the roof .      what   d it do .  what   d it do .     screamed rincewind  trying to read his own shoulderblades .      it says  kick me     said conina .   a section of wall slid up beside the petrified wizard .  a large boot on the end of a complicated series of metal joints gave a half hearted wobble and then the whole thing snapped at the knee .   the three of them looked at it in silence .  then conina said     we   re dealing here with a warped brain  i can tell .      rincewind gingerly unhooked the sign and let it drop .  conina pushed past him and stalked along the passage with an air of angry caution  and when a metal hand extended itself on a spring and waggled in a friendly fashion she didn   t shake it but instead traced its moulting wiring to a couple of corroded electrodes in a big glass jar .      your grandad was a man with a sense of humor .     she said .      oh  yes .  always liked a chuckle     said creosote .      oh  good     said conina .  she prodded gingerly at a flagstone which  to rincewind  looked no different to any of its fellows .  with a sad little springy noise a moulting feather duster wobbled out of the wall at armpit height .      i think i would have quite liked to meet the old seriph     she said  through gritted teeth     although not to shake him by the hand .  you   d better give me a leg up here  wizard .         pardon .      conina pointed irritably to a half open stone doorway just ahead of them .      i want to look up there     she said .     you just put your hands together for me to stand on  right .  how do you manage to be so useless .         being useful always gets me into trouble     muttered rincewind  trying to ignore the warm flesh brushing against his nose .   he could hear her rooting around above the door .        i thought so     she said .      what is it .  fiendishly sharp spears poised to drop .         no .         spiked grill ready to skewer    .         it   s a bucket     said conina flatly  giving it a push .      what  of scalding  poisonous    .         whitewash .  just a lot of old  dried up whitewash .     conina jumped down .      that   s grandfather for you     said creosote .     never a dull moment .         well  i   ve just about had enough     conina said firmly  and pointed to the far end of the tunnel .     come on  you two .      they were about three feet from the far end when rincewind felt a movement in the air above him .  conina struck him in the small of the back  shoving him forward into the room beyond .  he rolled when he hit the floor  and something nicked his foot at the same time as a loud thump deafened him .   the entire roof  a huge block of stone four feet thick  had dropped into the tunnel .   rincewind crawled forward through the dust clouds and  with a trembling finger  traced the lettering on the side of the slab .      laugh this one off  he said   he sat back .      that   s grandad     said creosote happily     always a        he intercepted conina   s gaze  which had the force of a lead pipe  and wisely shut up .   nijel emerged from the clouds  coughing .      i say  what happened .     he said .     is everyone all right .  it didn   t do that when i went through .      rincewind sought for a reply  and couldn   t find anything better than     didn   t it .      light filtered into the deep room from tiny barred windows up near the roof .  there was no way out except by walking through the several hundred tons of stone that blocked the tunnel or  to put it in another way  which was the way rincewind put it  they were undoubtedly trapped .  he relaxed a bit .   at least there was no mistaking the magic carpet .  it lay rolled up on a raised slab in the middle of the room .  next to it was a small  sleek oil lamp and   rincewind craned to see   a small gold ring .  he groaned .  a faint octarine corona hung over all three items  indicating that they were magical .   when conina unrolled the carpet a number of small objects tumbled onto the floor  including a brass herring  a wooden ear  a few large square sequins and a lead box with a preserved soap bubble in it .      what on earth are they .     said nijel .      well     said rincewind     before they tried to eat that carpet  they were probably moths .         gosh .         that   s what you people never understand     said rincewind  wearily .     you think magic is just something you can pick up and use  like a  a           parsnip .     said nijel .      wine bottle .     said the seriph .      something like that     said rincewind cautiously  but rallied somewhat and went on     but the truth is  is           not like that .         more like a wine bottle .     said the seriph hopefully .      magic uses people     said rincewind hurriedly .     it affects you as much as you affect it  sort of thing .  you can   t mess around with magical things without it affecting you .  i just thought i   d better warn you .         like a wine bottle     said creosote     that              drinks you back     said rincewind .     so you can put down that lamp and ring for a start  and for goodness    sake don   t rub anything .         my grandfather built up the family fortunes with them     said creosote wistfully .     his wicked uncle locked him in a cave  you know .  he had to set himself up with what came to hand .  he had nothing in the whole world but a magic carpet  a magic lamp  a magic ring and a grotto full of assorted jewels .           came up the hard way  did he .     said rincewind .   conina spread the carpet on the floor .  it had a complex pattern of golden dragons on a blue background .  they were extremely complicated dragons  with long beards  ears and wings  and they seemed to be frozen in motion  caught in transition from one state to another  suggesting that the loom which wove them had rather more dimensions than the usual three  but the worst thing about it was that if you looked at it long enough the pattern became blue dragons on a gold background  and a terrible feeling stole over you that if you kept on trying to see both types of dragon at once your brains would trickle out of your ears .   rincewind tore his gaze away with some difficulty as another distant explosion rocked the building .      how does it work .     he said .   creosote shrugged .     i   ve never used it     he said .     i suppose you just say    up    and    down    and things like that .         how about    fly through the wall    .     said rincewind .   all three of them looked up at the high  dark and  above all  solid walls of the room .      we could try sitting on it and saying    rise        nijel volunteered .     and then  before we hit the roof  we could say  well     stop .        he considered this for a bit  and then added     if that   s the word .         or     drop        said rincewind     or    descend        dive        fall        sink .     or    plunge .               plummet        suggested conina gloomily .      of course     said nijel     with all this wild magic floating around  you could try using some of it .         ah       said rincewind  and     well           you   ve got    wizzard    written on your hat     said creosote .      anyone can write things on their hat     said conina .     you don   t want to believe everything you read .         now hold on a minute     said rincewind hotly .   they held on a minute .   they held on for a further seventeen seconds .        look  it   s a lot harder than you think     he said .      what did i tell you .     said conina .     come on  let   s dig the mortar out with our fingernails .      rincewind waved her into silence  removed his hat  pointedly blew the dust off the star  put the hat on again  adjusted the brim  rolled up his sleeves  flexed his fingers and panicked .   in default of anything better to do  he leaned against the stone .   it was vibrating .  it wasn   t that it was being shaken  it felt like the throbbing was coming from inside the wall .   it was very much the same sort of trembling he had felt back at the university  just before the sourcerer arrived .  the stone was definitely very unhappy about something .   he sidled along the wall and put his ear to the next stone  which was a smaller  wedge shaped stone cut to fit an angle of the wall  not a big  distinguished stone  but a bantam stone  patiently doing its bit for the greater good of the wall as a whole .  it was also shaking .      shh .     said conina .      i can   t hear anything     said nijel loudly .  nijel was one of those people who  if you say    don   t look now     would immediately swivel his head like an owl on a turntable .  these are the same people who  when you point out  say  an unusual crocus just beside them  turn around aimlessly and put their foot down with a sad little squashy noise .  if they were lost in a trackless desert you could find them by putting down  somewhere on the sand  something small and fragile like a valuable old mug that had been in your family for generations  and then hurrying back as soon as you heard the crash .   anyway .      that   s the point .  what happened to the war .      a little cascade of mortar poured down from the ceiling onto rincewind   s hat .      something   s acting on the stones     he said quietly .     they   re trying to break free .           we   re right underneath quite a lot of them     observed creosote .   there was a grinding noise above them and a shaft of daylight lanced down .  to rincewind   s surprise it wasn   t accompanied by sudden death from crushing .  there was another silicon creak  and the hole grew .  the stones were falling out  and they were falling up .      i think     he said     that the carpet might be worth a try at this point .      the wall beside him shook itself like a dog and drifted apart  its masonry giving rincewind several severe blows as it soared away .   the four of them landed on the blue and gold carpet in a storm of flying rock .      we   ve got to get out of here     said nijel  keeping up his reputation for acute observation .      hang on     said rincewind .     i   ll say           you won   t     snapped conina  kneeling beside him .     i   ll say .  i don   t trust you .         but you   ve           shut up     said conina .  she patted the carpet .      carpet   rise     she commanded .   there was a pause .      up .         perhaps it doesn   t understand the language     said nijel .      lift .  levitate .  fly .         or it could be  say  sensitive to one particular voice           shut .  up .         you tried up     said nijel .     try ascend .         or soar     said creosote .  several tons of flagstone swooped past an inch from his head .      if it was going to answer to them it would have done so  wouldn   t it .     said conina .  the air around her was thick with dust as the flying stones ground together .  she thumped the carpet .      take off  you blasted mat .  arrgh .        a piece of cornice clipped her shoulder .  she rubbed the bruise irritably  and turned to rincewind  who was sitting with his knees under his chin and his hat pulled down over his head .      why doesn   t it work .     she said .      you   re not saying the right words     he said .      it doesn   t understand the language .         language hasn   t got anything to do with it .  you   ve neglected something fundamental .         well .         well what .     sniffed rincewind .      look  this isn   t the time to stand on your dignity .         you keep on trying  don   t you mind me .         make it fly .      rincewind pulled his hat further over his ears .      please .     said conina .   the hat rose a bit .      we   d all be terribly bucked     said nijel .      hear  hear     said creosote .   the hat rose some more .     you   re quite sure .     said rincewind .      yes .      rincewind cleared his throat .      down     he commanded .   the carpet rose from the ground and hovered expectantly a few feet over the dust .      how did       conina began  but nijel interrupted her .      wizards are privy to arcane knowledge  that   s probably what it is     he said .     probably the carpet   s got a geas on it to do the opposite of anything that   s said .  can you make it go up further .         yes  but i   m not going to     said rincewind .  the carpet drifted slowly forward and  as happens so often at times like this  a rolling of masonry bounced right across the spot where it had lain .   a moment later they were out in the open air  the storm of stone behind them .     the palace was pulling itself to pieces  and the pieces were funnelling up into the air like a volcanic eruption in reverse .  the sourcerous tower had completely disappeared  but the stones were dancing toward the spot where it had stood and        they   re building another tower .     said nijel .      out of my palace  too     said creosote .      the hat   s won     said rincewind .     that   s why it   s building its own tower .  it   s a sort of reaction .  wizards always used to build a tower around themselves  like those   what do you call those things you find at the bottom of rivers .         frogs .         stones .         unsuccessful gangsters .         caddis flies is what i meant     said rincewind .     when a wizard set out to fight  the first thing he always did was build a tower .         it   s very big     said nijel .   rincewind nodded glumly .      where are we going .     said conina .   rincewind shrugged .      away     he said .   the outer palace wall drifted just below them .  as they passed over it began to shake  and small bricks began to loop toward the storm of flying rock that buzzed around the new tower .   eventually conina said     all right .  how did you get the carpet to fly .  does it really do the opposite of what you command .         no .  i just paid attention to certain fundamental details of laminar and spatial arrangements .         you   ve lost me there     she admitted .      you want it in non wizard talk .         yes .         you put it on the floor upside down     said rincewind .   conina sat very still for a while .  then she said     i must say this is very comfortable .  it   s the first time i   ve ever flown on a carpet .         it   s the first time i   ve ever flown one     said rincewind vaguely .      you do it very well     she said .      thank you .         you said you were frightened of heights .         terrified .         you don   t show it .         i   m not thinking about it .      rincewind turned and looked at the tower behind them .  it had grown quite a lot in the last minute  blossoming at the top into a complexity of turrets and battlements .  a swarm of tiles was hovering over it  individual tiles swooping down and clinking into place like ceramic bees on a bombing run .  it was impossibly high   the stones at the bottom would have been crushed if it wasn   t for the magic that crackled through them .   well  that was just about it as far as organized wizardry was concerned .  two thousand years of peaceful magic had gone down the drain  the towers were going up again  and with all this new raw magic floating around something was going to get very seriously hurt .  probably the universe .  too much magic could wrap time and space around itself  and that wasn   t good news for the kind of person who had grown used to things like effects following things like causes .   and  of course  it would be impossible to explain things to his companions .  they didn   t seem to grasp ideas properly  more particularly  they didn   t seem able to get the hang of doom .  they suffered from the terrible delusion that something could be done .  they seemed prepared to make the world the way they wanted it or die in the attempt  and the trouble with dying in the attempt was that you died in the attempt .   the whole point about the old university organization was that it kept a sort of peace between wizards who got along with one another about as easily as cats in a sack  and now the gloves were off anyone who tried to interfere was going to end up severely scratched .  this wasn   t the old  gentle  rather silly magic that the disc was used to  this was magic war  white hot and searing .   rincewind wasn   t very good at precognition  in fact he could barely see into the present .  but he knew with weary certainty that at some point in the very near future  like thirty seconds or so  someone would say     surely there   s something we could do .      the desert passed below them  lit by the low rays of the setting sun .      there don   t seem to be many stars     said nijel .     perhaps they   re scared to come out .      rincewind looked up .  there was a silver haze high in the air .      it   s raw magic settling out of the atmosphere     he said .     it   s saturated .      twenty seven  twenty eight  twen        surely there   s       conina began .      there isn   t     said rincewind flatly  but with just the faintest twinge of satisfaction .     the wizards will fight each other until there   s one victor .  there isn   t anything anyone else can do .         i could do with a drink     said creosote .     i suppose we couldn   t stop somewhere where i could buy an inn .         what with .     said nijel .     you   re poor  remember .         poor i don   t mind     said the seriph .     it   s sobriety that is giving me difficulties .      conina prodded rincewind gently in the ribs .      are you steering this thing .     she said .      no .         then where is it going .      nijel peered downwards .      by the look of it     he said     it   s going hubwards .  towards the circle sea .         someone must be guiding it .      hallo  said a friendly voice in rincewind   s head .     you   re not my conscience again  are you .  thought rincewind .   i   m feeling really bad .   well  i   m sorry  rincewind thought  but none of this is my fault .  i   m just a victim of circuses .  i don   t see why i should take the blame .   yes  but you could do something about it .   like what .   you could destroy the sourcerer .  all this would collapse then .   i wouldn   t stand a chance .   then at least you could die in the attempt .  that might be preferable to letting magical war break out .      look  just shut up  will you .     said rincewind .      what .     said conina .      um .     said rincewind  vaguely .  he looked down blankly at the blue and gold pattern underneath him  and added     you   re flying this  aren   t you .  through me .  that   s sneaky .         what are you talking about .         oh .  sorry .  talking to myself .         i think     said conina     that we   d better land .      they glided down toward a crescent of beach where the desert reached the sea .  in a normal light it would have been blinding white with a sand made up of billions of tiny shell fragments  but at this time of day it was blood red and primordial .  ranks of driftwood  carved by the waves and bleached by the sun  were piled up on the tideline like the bones of ancient fish or the biggest floral art accessory counter in the universe .  nothing stirred  apart from the waves .  there were a few rocks around  but they were firebrick hot and home to no mollusc or seaweed .   even the sea looked arid .  if any proto amphibian emerged onto a beach like this  it would have given up there and then  gone back into the water and told all its relatives to forget the legs  it wasn   t worth it .  the air felt as though it had been cooked in a sock .     even so  nijel insisted that they light a fire .      it   s more friendly     he said .     besides  there could be monsters .      conina looked at the oily wavelets  rolling up the beach in what appeared to be a half hearted attempt to get out of the sea .      in that .     she said .      you never can tell .      rincewind mooched along the waterline  distractedly picking up stones and throwing them in the sea .  one or two were thrown back .   after a while conina got a fire going  and the bone dry  salt saturated wood sent blue and green flames roaring up under a fountain of sparks .  the wizard went and sat in the dancing shadows  his back against a pile of whitened wood  wrapped in a cloud of such impenetrable gloom that even creosote stopped complaining of thirst and shut up .   conina woke up after midnight .  there was a crescent moon on the horizon and a thin  chilly mist covered the sand .  creosote was snoring on his back .  nijel  who was theoretically on guard  was sound asleep .   conina lay perfectly still  every sense seeking out the thing that had awaken her .   finally she heard it again .  it was a tiny  diffident clinking noise  barely audible above the muted slurp of the sea .   she got up  or rather  she slid into the vertical as bonelessly as a jellyfish  and flicked nijel   s sword out of his unresisting hand .  then she sidled through the mist without causing so much as an extra swirl .   the fire sank down further into its bed of ash .  after a while conina came back  and shook the other two awake .      warrizit .         i think you ought to see this     she hissed .     i think it could be important .         i just shut my eyes for a second       nijel protested .      never mind about that .  come on .        creosote squinted around the impromptu campsite .      where   s the wizard fellow .         you   ll see .  and don   t make a noise .  it could be dangerous .      they stumbled after her knee deep in vapor  toward the sea .   eventually nijel said     why dangerous           shh .  did you hear it .      nijel listened .      like a sort of ringing noise .         watch        rincewind walked jerkily up the beach  carrying a large round rock in both hands .  he walked past them without a word  his eyes staring straight ahead .   they followed him along the cold beach until he reached a bare area between the dunes  where he stopped and  still moving with all the grace of a clothes horse  dropped the rock .  it made a clinking noise .   there was a wide circle of other stones .  very few of them had actually stayed on top of another one .   the three of them crouched down and watched him .      is he asleep .     said creosote .   conina nodded .      what   s he trying to do .         i think he   s trying to build a tower .      rincewind lurched back into the ring of stones and  with great care  placed another rock on empty air .  it fell down .      he   s not very good at it  is he     said nijel .      it is very sad     said creosote .      maybe we ought to wake him up     said conina .     only i heard that if you wake up sleepwalkers their legs fall off  or something .  what do you think .         could be risky  with wizards     said nijel .   they tried to make themselves comfortable on the chilly sand .      it   s rather pathetic  isn   t it .     said creosote .     it   s not as if he   s really a proper wizard .        conina and nijel tried to avoid one another   s gaze .  finally the boy coughed  and said     i   m not exactly a barbarian hero  you know .  you may have noticed .      they watched the toiling figure of rincewind for a while  and then conina said     if it comes to that  i think i lack a certain something when it comes to hairdressing .      they both stared fixedly at the sleepwalker  busy with their own thoughts and red with mutual embarrassment .   creosote cleared his throat .      if it makes anyone feel better     he said     i sometimes perceive that my poetry leaves a lot to be desired .      rincewind carefully tried to balance a large rock on a small pebble .  it fell off  but he appeared to be happy with the result .      speaking as a poet     said conina carefully     what would you say about this situation .      creosote shifted uneasily .     funny old thing  life     he said .      pretty apt .      nijel lay back and looked up at the hazy stars .  then he sat bolt upright .      did you see that .     he demanded .      what .         it was a sort of flash  a kind of        the hubward horizon exploded into a silent flower of color  which expanded rapidly through all the hues of the conventional spectrum before flashing into brilliant octarine .  it etched itself on their eyeballs before fading away .   after a while there was a distant rumble .      some sort of magical weapon     said conina  blinking .  a gust of warm wind picked up the mist and streamed it past them .      blow this     said nijel  getting to his feet .     i   m going to wake him up  even if it means we end up carrying him .      he reached out for rincewind   s shoulder just as something went past very high overhead  making a noise like a flock of geese on nitrous oxide .  it disappeared into the desert behind them .  then there was a sound that would have set false teeth on edge  a flash of green light  and a thump .      i   ll wake him up     said conina .     you get the carpet .      she clambered over the ring of rocks and took the sleeping wizard gently by the arm  and this would have been a textbook way of waking a somnambulist if rincewind hadn   t dropped the rock he was carrying on his foot .   he opened his eyes .      where am i .     he said .      on the beach .  you   ve been   er   dreaming .      rincewind blinked at the mist  the sky  the circle of stones  conina  the circle of stones again  and finally back at the sky .      what   s been happening .     he said .      some sort of magical fireworks .         oh .  it   s started  then .      he lurched unsteadily out of the circle  in a way that suggested to conina that perhaps he wasn   t quite awake yet  and staggered back toward the remains of the fire .  he walked a few steps and then appeared to remember something .   he looked down at his foot  and said     ow .      he   d almost reached the fire when the blast from the last spell reached them .  it had been aimed at the tower in al khali  which was twenty miles away  and by now the wavefront was extremely diffuse .  it was hardly affecting the nature of things as it surged over the dunes with a faint sucking noise  the fire burned red and green for a second  one of nijel   s sandals turned into a small and irritated badger  and a pigeon flew out of the seriph   s turban .   then it was past and boiling out over the sea .      what was that .     said nijel .  he kicked the badger  who was sniffing at his foot .      hmm .     said rincewind .      that .         oh  that     said rincewind .     just the backwash of a spell .  they probably hit the tower in al khali .         it must have been pretty big to affect us here .         it probably was .           hey  that was my palace     said creosote weakly .     i mean  i know it was a lot  but it was all i had .         sorry .         but there were people in the city .         they   re probably all right     said rincewind .      good .         whatever they are .         what .      conina grabbed his arm .     don   t shout at him     she said .     he   s not himself .         ah     said creosote dourly     an improvement .         i say  that   s a bit unfair     nijel protested .     i mean  he got me out of the snake pit and  well  he knows a lot           yes  wizards are good at getting you out of the sort of trouble that only wizards can get you into     said creosote .     then they expect you to thank them .         oh  i think           it   s got to be said     said creosote  waving his hands irritably .  he was briefly illuminated by the passage of another spell across the tormented sky .      look at that .     he snapped .     oh  he means well .  they all mean well .  they probably all think the disc would be a better place if they were in charge .  take it from me  there   s nothing more terrible than someone out to do the world a favor .  wizards .  when all   s said and done  what good are they .  i mean  can you name me something worthwhile any wizard   s done .         i think that   s a bit cruel     said conina  but with an edge in her voice that suggested that she could be open to persuasion on the subject .      well  they make me sick     muttered creosote  who was feeling acutely sober and didn   t like it much .      i think we   ll all feel better if we try to get a bit more sleep     said nijel diplomatically .     things always look better by daylight .  nearly always  anyway .           my mouth feels all horrible  too     muttered creosote  determined to cling onto the remnant of his anger .   conina turned back to the fire  and became aware of a gap in the scenery .  it was rincewind shaped .      he   s gone .      in fact rincewind was already half a mile out over the dark sea  squatting on the carpet like an angry buddha  his mind a soup of rage  humiliation and fury  with a side order of outrage .   he hadn   t wanted much  ever .  he   d stuck with wizardry even though he wasn   t any good at it  he   d always done his best  and now the whole world was conspiring against him .  well  he   d show them .  precisely who    they    were and what they were going to be shown was merely a matter of detail .   he reached up and touched his hat for reassurance  even as it lost its last few sequins in the slipstream .      the luggage was having problems of its own .   the area around the tower of al khali  under the relentless magical bombardment  was already drifting beyond that reality horizon where time  space and matter lose their separate identities and start wearing one another   s clothes .  it was quite impossible to describe .   here is what it looked like .   it looked like a piano sounds shortly after being dropped down a well .  it tasted yellow  and felt paisley .  it smelled like a total eclipse of the moon .  of course  nearer to the tower it got really weird .   expecting anything unprotected to survive in that would be like expecting snow on a supernova .  fortunately the luggage didn   t know this  and slid through the maelstrom with raw magic crystallizing on its lid and hinges .  it was in a foul mood but  again  there was nothing very unusual about this  except that the crackling fury earthing itself spectacularly all over the luggage in a multi colored corona gave it the appearance of an early and very angry amphibian crawling out of a burning swamp .   it was hot and stuffy inside the tower .  there were no internal floors  just a series of walkways around the walls .  they were lined with wizards  and the central space was a column of octarine light that creaked loudly as they poured their power into it .  at its base stood abrim  the octarine gems on the hat blazing so brightly that they looked more like holes cut through into a different universe where  in defiance of probability  they had come out inside a sun .   the vizier stood with his hands out  fingers splayed  eyes shut  mouth a thin line of concentration  balancing the forces .  usually a wizard could control power only to the extent of his own physical capability  but abrim was learning fast .   you made yourself the pinch in the hourglass  the fulcrum on the balance  the roll around the sausage .   do it right and you were the power  it was part of you and you were capable of     has it been pointed out that his feet were several inches off the ground .  his feet were several inches off the ground .   abrim was pulling together the potency for a spell that would soar away into the sky and beset the ankh tower with a thousand screaming demons when there came a thunderous knock at the door .   there is a mantra to be said on these occasions .  it doesn   t matter if the door is a tent flap  a scrap of hide on a windblown yurt  three inches of solid oak with great iron nails in it or a rectangle of chipboard with mahogany veneer  a small light over it made of horrible bits of colored glass and a bell push that plays a choice of twenty popular melodies that no music lover would want to listen to even after five years    sensory deprivation .   one wizard turned to another and duly said     i wonder who that can be at this time of night .      there was another series of thumps on the woodwork .      there can   t be anyone alive out there     said the other wizard  and he said it nervously  because if you ruled out the possibility of it being anyone alive that always left the suspicion that perhaps it was someone dead .   this time the banging rattled the hinges .      one of us had better go out     said the first wizard .      good man .         ah .  oh .  right .      he set off slowly down the short  arched passage .      i   ll just go and see who it is  then .     he said .      first class .      it was a strange figure that made its hesitant way to the door .  ordinary robes weren   t sufficient protection in the high energy field inside tower  and over his brocade and velvet the wizard wore a thick  padded overall stuffed with rowan shavings and embroidered with industrial grade sigils .  he   d affixed a smoked glass visor to his pointy hat and his gauntlets  which were extremely big  suggested that he was a wicket keeper in a game of cricket played at supersonic speeds .  the actinic flashes and pulsations from the great work in the main hall cast harsh shadows around him as he fumbled for the bolts .   he pulled down the visor and opened the door a fraction .      we don   t want any       he began  and ought to have chosen his words better  because they were his epitaph .   it was some time before his colleague noticed his continued absence  and wandered down the passage to find him .  the door had been thrown wide open  the thaumatic inferno outside roaring against the web of spells that held it in check .  in fact the door hadn   t been pushed completely back  he pulled it aside to see why  and gave a little whimper .   there was a noise behind him .  he turned around .      wha       he began  which is a pretty poor syllable on which to end a life .      high over the circle sea rincewind was feeling like a bit of an idiot .     this happens to everyone sooner or later .   for example  in a tavern someone jogs your elbow and you turn around quickly and give a mouthful of abuse to  you become slowly aware  the belt buckle of a man who  it turns out  was probably hewn rather than born .   or a little car runs into the back of yours and you rush out to show a bunch of fives to the driver who  it becomes apparent as he goes on unfolding more body like some horrible conjuring trick  must have been sitting on the back seat .   or you might be leading your mutinous colleagues to the captain   s cabin and you hammer on the door and he sticks his great head out with a cutlass in either hand and you say    we   re taking over the ship  you scum  and the lads are right with me .     and he says    what lads .     and you suddenly feel a great emptiness behind you and you say    um        in other words  it   s the familiar hot sinking feeling experienced by everyone who has let the waves of their own anger throw them far up on the beach of retribution  leaving them  in the poetic language of the everyday  up shit creek .   rincewind was still angry and humiliated and so forth  but these emotions had died down a bit and something of his normal character had reasserted itself .  it was not very pleased to find itself on a few threads of blue and gold wool high above the phosphorescent waves .   he   d been heading for ankh morpork .  he tried to remember why .   of course  it was where it had all started .  perhaps it was the presence of the university  which was so heavy with magic it lay like a cannonball on the incontinence blanket of the universe  stretching reality very thin .  ankh was where things started  and finished .   it was also his home  such as it was  and it called to him .   it has already been indicated that rincewind appeared to have a certain amount of rodent in his ancestry  and in times of stress he felt an overpowering urge to make a run for his burrow .     he let the carpet drift for a while on the air currents while dawn  which creosote would probably have referred to as pink fingered  made a ring of fire around the edge of the disc .  it spread its lazy light over a world that was subtly different .   rincewind blinked .  there was a weird light .  no  now he came to think about it  not weird but wyrd  which was much weirder .  it was like looking at the world through a heat haze  but a haze that had a sort of life of its own .  it danced and stretched  and gave more than a hint that it wasn   t just an optical illusion but that it was reality itself that was being tensed and distended  like a rubber balloon trying to contain too much gas .   the wavering was greatest in the direction of ankh morpork  where flashes and fountains of tortured air indicated that the struggle hadn   t abated .  a similar column hung over al khali  and then rincewind realized that it wasn   t the only one .   wasn   t that a tower over in quirm  where the circle sea opened onto the great rim ocean .  and there were others .   it had all gone critical .  wizardry was breaking up .  goodbye to the university  the levels  the orders  deep in his heart  every wizard knew that the natural unit of wizardry was one wizard .  the towers would multiply and fight until there was one tower left  and then the wizards would fight until there was one wizard .   by then  he   d probably fight himself .   the whole edifice that operated as the balance wheel of magic was falling to bits .  rincewind resented that  deeply .  he   d never been any good at magic  but that wasn   t the point .  he knew where he fitted .  it was right at the bottom  but at least he fitted .  he could look up and see the whole delicate machine ticking away  gently  browsing off the natural magic generated by the turning of the disc .   all he had was nothing  but that was something  and now it had been taken away .   rincewind turned the carpet until it was facing the distant gleam that was ankh morpork  which was a brilliant speck in the early morning light  and a part of his mind that wasn   t doing anything else wondered why it was so bright .  there also seemed to be a full moon  and even rincewind  whose grasp of natural philosophy was pretty vague  was sure there had been one of those only the other day .   well  it didn   t matter .  he   d had enough .  he wasn   t going to try to understand anything anymore .  he was going home .   except that wizards can never go home .   this is one of the ancient and deeply meaningful sayings about wizards and it says something about most of them that they have never been able to work out what it means .  wizards aren   t allowed to have wives but they are allowed to have parents  and many of them go back to the old home town for hogswatch night or soul cake thursday  for a bit of a sing song and the heart warming sight of all their boyhood bullies hurriedly avoiding them in the street .   it   s rather like the other saying they   ve never been able to understand  which is that you can   t cross the same river twice .  experiments with a long legged wizard and a small river say you can cross the same river thirty  thirty five times a minute .   wizards don   t like philosophy very much .  as far as they are concerned  one hand clapping makes a noise like    cl .      in this particular case  though  rincewind couldn   t go home because it actually wasn   t there anymore .  there was a city straddling the river ankh  but it wasn   t one he   d ever seen before  it was white and clean and didn   t smell like a privy full of dead herrings .   he landed in what had once been the plaza of broken moons  and also in a state of some shock .  there were fountains .  there had been fountains before  of course  but they had oozed rather than played and they had looked like thin soup .  there were milky flagstones underfoot  with little glittery bits in them .  and  although the sun was sitting on the horizon like half a breakfast grapefruit  there was hardly anyone around .  normally ankh was permanently crowded  the actual shade of the sky being a mere background detail .     smoke drifted over the city in long greasy coils from the crown of boiling air above the university .  it was the only movement  apart from the fountains .   rincewind had always been rather proud of the fact that he always felt alone  even in the teeming city  but it was even worse being alone when he was by himself .   he rolled up the carpet and slung it over one shoulder and padded through the haunted streets toward the university .   the gates hung open to the wind .  most of the building looked half ruined by misses and ricochets .  the tower of sourcery  far too high to be real  seemed to be unscathed .  not so the old tower of art .  half the magic aimed at the tower next door seemed to have rebounded on it .  parts of it had melted and started to run  some parts glowed  some parts had crystalized  a few parts seemed to have twisted partly out of the normal three dimensions .  it made you feel sorry even for stone that it should have to undergo such treatment .  in fact nearly everything had happened to the tower except actual collapse .  it looked so beaten that possibly even gravity had given up on it .   rincewind sighed  and padded around the base of the tower toward the library .   towards where the library had been .   there was the arch of the doorway  and most of the walls were still standing  but a lot of the roof had fallen in and everything was blackened by soot .   rincewind stood and stared for a long time .   then he dropped the carpet and ran  stumbling and sliding through the rubble that half blocked the doorway .  the stones were still warm underfoot .  here and there the wreckage of a bookcase still smouldered .   anyone watching would have seen rincewind dart backward and forward across the shimmering heaps  scrabbling desperately among them  throwing aside charred furniture  pulling aside lumps of fallen roof with less than superhuman strength .   they would have seen him pause once or twice to get his breath back  then dive in again  cutting his hands on shards of half molten glass from the dome of the roof .  they would have noticed that he seemed to be sobbing .   eventually his questing fingers touched something warm and soft .   the frantic wizard heaved a charred roof beam aside  scrabbled through a drift of fallen tiles and peered down .   there  half squashed by the beam and baked brown by the fire  was a large bunch of overripe  squashy bananas .   he picked one up  very carefully  and sat and watched it for some time until the end fell off .   then he ate it .         we shouldn   t have let him go like that     said conina .      how could we have stopped him  oh  beauteous doe eyed eaglet .         but he may do something stupid .         i should think that is very likely     said creosote primly .      while we do something clever and sit on a baking beach with nothing to eat or drink  is that it .         you could tell me a story     said creosote  trembling slightly .      shut up .      the seriph ran his tongue over his lips .      i suppose a quick anecdote is out of the question .     he croaked .   conina sighed .     there   s more to life than narrative  you know .         sorry .  i lost control a little  there .      now that the sun was well up the crushed shell beach glowed like a salt flat .  the sea didn   t look any better by daylight .  it moved like thin oil .   away on either side the beach stretched in long  excruciatingly flat curves  supporting nothing but a few clumps of withered dune grass which lived off the moisture in the spray .  there was no sign of any shade .      the way i see it     said conina     this is a beach  and that means sooner or later we   ll come to a river  so all we have to do is keep walking in one direction .         and yet  delightful snow on the slopes of mount eritor  we do not know which one .      nijel sighed  and reached into his bag .      erm     he said     excuse me .  would this be any good .  i stole it .  sorry .      he held out the lamp that had been in the treasury .      it   s magic  isn   t it .     he said hopefully .     i   ve heard about them  isn   t it worth a try .      creosote shook his head .      but you said your grandfather used it to make his fortune .     said conina .      a lamp     said the seriph     he used a lamp .  not this lamp .  no  the real lamp was a battered old thing  and one day this wicked pedlar came around offering new lamps for old and my great grandmother gave it to him for this one .  the family kept it in the vault as a sort of memorial to her .  a truly stupid woman .  it doesn   t work  of course .         you tried it .         no  but he wouldn   t have given it away if it was any good  would he .         give it a rub     said conina .     it can   t do any harm .         i wouldn   t     warned creosote .   nijel held the lamp gingerly .  it had a strangely sleek look  as if someone had set out to make a lamp that could go fast .   he rubbed it .   the effects were curiously unimpressive .  there was a half hearted pop and a puff of wispy smoke near nijel   s feet .  a line appeared in the beach several feet away from the smoke .  it spread quickly to outline a square of sand  which vanished .   a figure barrelled out of the beach  jerked to a stop  and groaned .   it was wearing a turban  an expensive tan  a small gold medallion  shiny shorts and advanced running shoes with curly toes .   it said     i want to get this absolutely straight .  where am i .        conina recovered first .      it   s a beach     she said .      yah     said the genie .     what i mean was  which lamp .  what world .         don   t you know .      the creature took the lamp out of nijel   s unresisting grasp .      oh  this old thing     he said .     i   m on time share .  two weeks every august but  of course  usually one can never get away .         got a lot of lamps  have you .     said nijel .      i am somewhat over committed on lamps     the genie agreed .     in fact i am thinking of diversifying into rings .  rings are looking big at the moment .  there   s a lot of movement in rings .  sorry  people  what can i do you for .     the last phrase was turned in that special voice which people use for humorous self parody  in the mistaken hope that it will make them sound less like a prat .          we       conina began .      i want a drink     snapped creosote .     and you are supposed to say that my wish is your command .         oh  absolutely no one says that sort of thing anymore     said the genie  and produced a glass out of nowhere .  he treated creosote to a brilliant smile lasting a small percentage of one second .      we want you to take us across the sea to ankh morpork     said conina firmly .   the genie looked blank .  then he pulled a very thick book  from the empty air and consulted it .        it sounds a really neat concept     he said eventually .     let   s do lunch next tuesday  okay .         do what .         i   m a little energetic right now .         you   re a little    .     conina began .      great     said the genie  sincerely  and glanced at his wrist .     hey  is that the time .     he vanished .   the three of them looked at the lamp in thoughtful silence  and then nijel said     whatever happened to  you know  the fat guys with the baggy trousers and i hear and obey o master .      creosote snarled .  he   d just drunk his drink .  it had turned out to be water with bubbles in it and a taste like warm flatirons .      i   m bloody well not standing for it     snarled conina .  she snatched the lamp from his hand and rubbed it as if she was sorry she wasn   t holding a handful of emery cloth .   the genie reappeared at a different spot  which still managed to be several feet away from the weak explosion and obligatory cloud of smoke .   he was now holding something curved and shiny to his ear  and listening intently .  he looked hurriedly at conina   s angry face and contrived to suggest  by waggling his eyebrows and waving his free hand urgently  that he was currently and inconveniently tied up by irksome matters which  regretfully  prevented him giving her his full attention as of now but  as soon as he had disentangled himself from this importunate person  she could rest assured that her wish  which was certainly a wish of tone and brilliance  would be his command .      i shall smash the lamp     she said quietly .   the genie flashed her a smile and spoke hastily into the thing he was cradling between his chin and his shoulder .      fine     he said .     great .  it   s a slice  believe me .  have your people call my people .  stay beyond  okay .  bye .     he lowered the instrument .     bastard     he said vaguely .      i really shall smash the lamp     said conina .        which lamp is this .     said the genie hurriedly .      how many have you got .     said nijel .     i always thought genies had just the one .      the genie explained wearily that in fact he had several lamps .  there was a small but well appointed lamp where he lived during the week  another rather unique lamp in the country  a carefully restored peasant rushlight in an unspoilt wine growing district near quirm  and just recently a set of derelict lamps in the docks area of ankh morpork that had great potential  once the smart crowd got there  to become the occult equivalent of a suite of offices and a wine bar .   they listened in awe  like fish who had inadvertently swum into a lecture on how to fly .      who are your people the other people have got to call .     said nijel  who was impressed  although he didn   t know why or by what .      actually  i don   t have any people yet     said the genie  and gave a grimace that was definitely upwardly mobile at the corners .     but i will .         everyone shut up     said conina firmly     and you  take us to ankh morpork .         i should  if i were you     said creosote .     when the young lady   s mouth looks like a letter box  it   s best to do what she says .      the genie hesitated .      i   m not very deep on transport     he said .      learn     said conina .  she was tossing the lamp from hand to hand .      teleportation is a major headache     said the genie  looking desperate .     why don   t we do lun           right  that   s it     said conina .     now i just need a couple of big flat rocks           okay  okay .  just hold hands  will you .  i   ll give it my best shot  but this could be one big mistake        the astro philosophers of krull once succeeded in proving conclusively that all places are one place and that the distance between them is an illusion  and this news was an embarrassment to all thinking philosophers because it did not explain  among other things  signposts .  after years of wrangling the whole thing was then turned over to ly tin wheedle  arguably the disc   s greatest philosopher  who after some thought proclaimed that although it was indeed true that all places were one place  that place was very large .   and so psychic order was restored .  distance is  however  an entirely subjective phenomenon and creatures of magic can adjust it to suit themselves .   they are not necessarily very good at it .      rincewind sat dejectedly in the blackened ruins of the library  trying to put his finger on what was wrong with them .   well  everything  for a start .  it was unthinkable that the library should be burned .  it was the largest accumulation of magic on the disc .  it underpinned wizardry .  every spell ever used was written down in it somewhere .  burning them was  was  was     there weren   t any ashes .  plenty of wood ashes  lots of chains  lots of blackened stone  lots of mess .  but thousands of books don   t burn easily .  they would leave bits of cover and piles of feathery ash .  and there wasn   t any .   rincewind stirred the rubble with his toe .   there was only the one door into the library .  then there were the cellars   he could see the stairs down to them  choked with garbage   but you couldn   t hide all the books down there .  you couldn   t teleport them out either  they would be resistant to such magic  anyone who tried something like that would end up wearing his brains outside his hat .   there was an explosion overhead .  a ring of orange fire formed about halfway up the tower of sourcery  ascended quickly and soared off toward quirm .     rincewind slid around on his makeshift seat and stared up at the tower of art .  he got the distinct impression that it was looking back at him .  it was totally without windows  but for a moment he thought he saw a movement up among the crumbling turrets .   he wondered how old the tower really was .  older than the university  certainly .  older than the city  which had formed about it like screen around a mountain .  maybe older than geography .  there had been a time when the continents were different  rincewind understood  and then they   d sort of shuffled more comfortably together like puppies in a basket .  perhaps the tower had been washed up on the waves of rock  from somewhere else .  maybe it had been there before the disc itself  but rincewind didn   t like to consider that  because it raised uncomfortable questions about who built it and what for .   he examined his conscience .   it said  i   m out of options .  please yourself .   rincewind stood up and brushed the dust and ash off his robe  removing quite a lot of the moulting red plush as well .  he removed his hat  made a preoccupied attempt at straightening the point  and replaced it on his head .   then he walked unsteadily toward the tower of art .   there was a very old and quite small door at the base .  he wasn   t at all surprised when it opened as he approached .         strange place     said nijel .     funny curve to the walls .         where are we .     said conina .      and is there any alcohol .     said creosote .     probably not     he added .      and why is it rocking .     said conina .     i   ve never been anywhere with metal walls before .     she sniffed .     can you smell oil .     she added  suspiciously .   the genie reappeared  although this time without the smoke and erratic trapdoor effects .  it was noticeable that he tried to keep as far away from conina as politely possible .        everyone okay .     he said .      is this ankh .     she said .     only when we wanted to go there  we rather hoped you   d put us somewhere with a door .         you   re on your way     said the genie .      in what .      something about the way in which the spirit hesitated caused nijel   s mind to leap a tall conclusion from a standing start .  he looked down at the lamp in his hands .   he gave it an experimental jerk .  the floor shook .      oh  no     he said .     it   s physically impossible .         we   re in the lamp .     said conina .   the room trembled again as nijel tried to look down the spout .      don   t worry about it     said the genie .     in fact  don   t think about it if possible .      he explained   although    explained    is probably too positive a word  and in this case really means failed to explain but at some length   that it was perfectly possible to travel across the world in a small lamp being carried by one of the party  the lamp itself moving because it was being carried by one of the people inside it  because of a  the fractal nature of reality  which meant that everything could be thought of as being inside everything else and b  creative public relations .  the trick relied on the laws of physics failing to spot the flaw until the journey was complete .      in the circumstances it is best not to think about it  yuh .     said the genie .      like not thinking about pink rhinoceroses     said nijel  and gave an embarrassed laugh as they stared at him .      it was a sort of game we had     he said .     you had to avoid thinking of pink rhinoceroses .     he coughed .     i didn   t say it was a particularly good game .      he squinted down the spout again .      no     said conina     not very .         uh     said the genie     would anyone like coffee .  some sounds .  a quick game of significant quest .       drink .     said creosote .      white wine .         foul muck .      the genie looked shocked .      red is bad for       it began .         but any port in a storm     said creosote hurriedly .     or sauterne  even .  but no umbrella in it .     it dawned on the seriph that this wasn   t the way to talk to the genie .  he pulled himself together a bit .     no umbrella  by the five moons of nasreem .  or bits of fruit salad or olives or curly straws or ornamental monkeys  i command thee by the seventeen siderites of sarudin .         i   m not an umbrella person     said the genie sulkily .      it   s pretty sparse in here     said conina     why don   t you furnish it .         what i don   t understand     said nijel     is  if we   re all in the lamp i   m holding  then the me in the lamp is holding a smaller lamp and in that lamp        the genie waved his hands urgently .      don   t talk about it .     he commanded .     please .      nijel   s honest brow wrinkled .     yes  but     he said     is there a lot of me  or what .         it   s all cyclic  but stop drawing attention to it  yuh .    oh  shit .      there was the subtle  unpleasant sound of the universe suddenly catching on .      it was dark in the tower  a solid core of antique darkness that had been there since the dawn of time and resented the intrusion of the upstart daylight that nipped in around rincewind .   he felt the air move as the door shut behind him and the dark poured back  filling up the space where the light had been so neatly that you couldn   t have seen the join even if the light had still been there .   the interior of the tower smelled of antiquity  with a slight suspicion of raven droppings .   it took a great deal of courage to stand there in that dark .  rincewind didn   t have that much  but stood there anyway .   something started to snuffle around his feet  and rincewind stood very still .  the only reason he didn   t move was for fear of treading on something worse .   then a hand like an old leather glove touched his  very gently  and a voice said     oook .      rincewind looked up .   the dark yielded  just once  to a vivid flash of light .  and rincewind saw .   the whole tower was lined with books .  they were squeezed on every step of the rotting spiral staircase that wound up inside .  they were piled up on the floor  although something about the way in which they were piled suggested that the word    huddled    would be more appropriate .  they had lodged   all right  they had perched   on every crumbling ledge .   they were observing him  in some covert way that had nothing to do with the normal six senses .  books are pretty good at conveying meaning  not necessarily their own personal meanings of course  and rincewind grasped the fact that they were trying to tell him something .   there was another flash .  he realized that it was magic from the sourcerer   s tower  reflected down from the distant hole that led onto the roof .   at least it enabled him to identify wuffles  who was wheezing at his right foot .  that was a bit of a relief .  now if he could just put a name to the soft  repetitive slithering noise near his left ear       there was a further obliging flash  which found him looking directly into the little yellow eyes of the patrician  who was clawing patiently at the side of his glass jar .  it was a gentle  mindless scrabbling  as if the little lizard wasn   t particularly trying to get out but was just vaguely interested in seeing how long it would take to wear the glass away .   rincewind looked down at the pear shaped bulk of the librarian .      there   s thousands of them     he whispered  his voice being sucked away and silenced by the massed ranks of books .     how did you get them all in here .         oook oook .         they what .         oook     repeated the librarian  making vigorous flapping motions with his bald elbows .      fly .         oook .         can they do that .         oook     nodded the librarian .      that must have been pretty impressive .  i   d like to see that one day .         oook .      not every book had made it .  most of the important grimoires had got out but a seven volume herbal had lost its index to the flames and many a trilogy was mourning for its lost volume .  quite a few books had scorch marks on their bindings  some had lost their covers and trailed their stitching unpleasantly on the floor .   a match flared  and pages rippled uneasily around the walls .  but it was only the librarian  who lit a candle and shambled across the floor at the base of a menacing shadow big enough to climb skyscrapers .  he had set up a rough table against one wall and it was covered with arcane tools  pots of rare adhesives and a bookbinder   s vice which was already holding a stricken folio .  a few weak lines of magic fire crawled across it .     the ape pushed the candlestick into rincewind   s hand  picked up a scalpel and a pair of tweezers  and bent low over the trembling book .  rincewind went pale .      um     he said     er  do you mind if i go away .  i faint at the sight of glue .      the librarian shook his head and jerked a preoccupied thumb toward a tray of tools .      oook     he commanded .  rincewind nodded miserably and obediently handed him a pair of long nosed scissors .  the wizard winced as a couple of damaged pages were snipped free and dropped to the floor .      what are you doing to it .     he managed .      oook .         an appendectomy .  oh .      the ape jerked his thumb again  without looking up .  rincewind fished a needle and thread out of the ranks on the tray and handed them over .  there was silence broken only by the scritching sound of thread being pulled through paper until the librarian straightened up and said      oook .      rincewind pulled out his handkerchief and mopped the ape   s brow .      oook .         don   t mention it .  is it   going to be all right .      the librarian nodded .  there was also a general  almost inaudible sigh of relief from the tier of books above them .   rincewind sat down .  the books were frightened .  in fact they were terrified .  the presence of the sourcerer made their spines creep  and the pressure of their attention closed in around him like a vise .      all right     he mumbled     but what can i do about it .         oook .     the librarian gave rincewind a look that would have been exactly like a quizzical look over the top of a pair of half moon spectacles  if he had been wearing any  and reached for another broken book .      i mean  you know i   m no good at magic .           oook .         the sourcery that   s about now  it   s terrible stuff .  i mean  it   s the original stuff  from right back in the dawn of time .  or around breakfast  at any rate .         oook .         it   ll destroy everything eventually  won   t it .         oook .         it   s about time someone put a stop to this sourcery  right .         oook .         only it can   t be me  you see .  when i came here i thought i could do something  but that tower .  it   s so big .  it must be proof against all magic .  if really powerful wizards won   t do anything about it  how can i .         oook     agreed the librarian  sewing a ruptured spine .      so  you see  i think someone else can save the world this time .  i   m no good at it .      the ape nodded  reached across and lifted rincewind   s hat from his head .      hey .      the librarian ignored him  picked up a pair of shears .      look  that   s my hat  if you don   t mind don   t you dare do that to my        he leapt across the floor and was rewarded with a thump across the side of the head  which would have astonished him if he   d had time to think about it  the librarian might shuffle around the place like a good natured wobbly balloon  but underneath that oversized skin was a framework of superbly cantilevered bone and muscle that could drive a fistful of calloused knuckles through a thick oak plank .  running into the librarian   s arm was like hitting a hairy iron bar .   wuffles started to bounce up and down  yelping with excitement .   rincewind screamed a hoarse  untranslatable yell of fury  bounced off the wall  snatched up a fallen rock as a crude club  kicked forward and stopped dead .     the librarian was crouched in the center of the floor with the shears touching   but not yet cutting   the hat .   and he was grinning at rincewind .   they stood like a frozen tableau for some seconds .  then the ape dropped the shears  flicked several imaginary flecks of dust off the hat  straightened the point  and placed it on rincewind   s head .   a few shocked moments after this rincewind realized that he was holding up  at arm   s length  a very large and extremely heavy rock .  he managed to force it away on one side before it recovered from the shock and remembered to fall on him .      i see     he said  sinking back against the wall and rubbing his elbows .     and all that   s supposed to tell me something  is it .  a moral lesson  let rincewind confront his true self  let him work out what he   s really prepared to fight for .  eh .  well  it was a very cheap trick .  and i   ve news for you .  if you think it worked       he snatched the hat brim      if you think it worked .  if you think i   ve .  you   ve got another thought .  listen  it   s .  if you think .      his voice stuttered into silence .  then he shrugged .      all right .  but when you get down to it  what can i actually do .      the librarian replied with an expansive gesture that indicated  as clearly as if he had said    oook     that rincewind was a wizard with a hat  a library of magical books and a tower .  this could be regarded as everything a magical practitioner could need .  an ape  a small terrier with halitosis and a lizard in a jar were optional extras .   rincewind felt a slight pressure on his foot .  wuffles  who was extremely slow on the uptake  had fastened his toothless gums on the toe of rincewind   s boot and was giving it a vicious suck .   he picked the little dog up by the scruff of its neck and the bristly stub that  for the want of a better word  it called its tail  and gently lifted it sideways .        okay     he said .     you   d better tell me what   s been happening here .         from the carrack mountains  overlooking the vast cold sto plain in the middle of which ankh morpork sprawled like a bag of dropped groceries  the view was particularly impressive .  mishits and ricochets from the magical battle were expanding outward and upwards  in a bowl shaped cloud of curdled air at the heart of which strange lights flashed and sparkled .   the roads leading away from it were packed with refugees  and every inn and wayside tavern was crowded out .  or nearly every one .   no one seemed to want to stop at the rather pleasant little pub nestling among trees just off the road to quirm .  it wasn   t that they were frightened to go inside  it was just that  for the moment  they weren   t being allowed to notice it .   there was a disturbance in the air about half a mile away and three figures dropped out of nowhere into a thicket of lavender .   they lay supine in the sunshine among the broken  fragrant branches  until their sanity came back .  then creosote said     where are we  do you suppose .         it smells like someone   s underwear drawer     said conina .      not mine     said nijel  firmly .   he eased himself up gently and added     has anyone seen the lamp .         forget it .  it   s probably been sold to build a wine bar     said conina .   nijel scrabbled around among the lavender stems until his hands found something small and metallic .      got it .     he declared .      don   t rub it .     said the other two  in harmony .  they were too late anyway  but that didn   t much matter  because all that happened when nijel gave it a cautious buff was the appearance of some small smoking red letters in mid air .         hi        nijel read aloud .        do not put down the lamp  because your custom is important to us .  please leave a wish after the tone and  very shortly  it will be our command .  in the meantime  have a nice eternity .        he added     you know  i think he   s a bit over committed .      conina said nothing .  she was staring out across the plains to the broiling storm of magic .  occasionally some of it would detach and soar away to some distant tower .  she shivered  despite the growing heat of the day .      we ought to get down there as soon as possible     she said .     it   s very important .         why .     said creosote .  one glass of wine hadn   t really restored him to his former easygoing nature .   conina opened her mouth  and   quite unusually for her   shut it again .  there was no way to explain that every gene in her body was dragging her onward  telling her that she should get involved  visions of swords and spiky balls on chains kept invading the hairdressing salons of her consciousness .   nijel  on the other hand  felt no such pounding .  all he had to drive him onward was imagination  but he did have enough of that to float a medium sized war galley .  he looked toward the city with what would have been  but for his lack of chin  an expression of set jawed determination .   creosote realized that he was outnumbered .      do they have any drink down there .     he said .      lots     said nijel .      that might do for a start     the seriph conceded .     all right  lead on  o peach breasted daughter of           and no poetry .      they untangled themselves from the thicket and walked down the hillside until they reached the road which  before very long  went past the aforementioned tavern or  as creosote persisted in calling it  caravanserai .   they hesitated about going in .  it didn   t seem to welcome visitors .  but conina  who by breeding and upbringing tended to skulk around the back of buildings  found four horses tethered in the yard .     they considered them carefully .      it would be stealing     said nijel  slowly .   conina opened her mouth to agree and the words    why not .     slid past her lips .  she shrugged .      perhaps we should leave some money       nijel suggested .      don   t look at me     said creosote .         or maybe write a note and leave it under the bridle .  or something .  don   t you think .      by way of an answer conina vaulted up onto the largest horse  which by the look of it belonged to a soldier .  weaponry was slung all over it .   creosote hoisted himself uneasily onto the second horse  a rather skittish bay  and sighed .      she   s got that letter box look     he said .     i should do what she says .      nijel regarded the other two horses suspiciously .  one of them was very large and extremely white  not the offwhite which was all that most horses could manage  but a translucent  ivory white tone which nijel felt an unconscious urge to describe as    shroud .     it also gave him a distinct impression that it was more intelligent than he was .   he selected the other one .  it was a bit thin  but docile  and he managed to get on after only two tries .   they set off .   the sound of their hoofbeats barely penetrated the gloom inside the tavern .  the innkeeper moved like someone in a dream .  he knew he had customers  he   d even spoken to them  he could even see them sitting around a table by the fire  but if asked to describe who he   d talked to and what he had seen he   d have been at a loss .  this is because the human brain is remarkably good at shutting out things it doesn   t want to know .  his could currently have shielded a bank vault .   and the drinks .  most of them he   d never heard of  but strange bottles kept appearing on the shelves above the beer barrels .  the trouble was that whenever he tried to think about it  his thoughts just slid away       the figures around the table looked up from their cards .   one of them raised a hand .  it   s stuck on the end of his arm and it   s got five fingers  the innkeeper   s mind said .  it must be a hand .   one thing the innkeeper   s brain couldn   t shut out was the sound of the voices .  this one sounded as though someone was hitting a rock with a roll of sheet lead .   bar person .   the innkeeper groaned faintly .  the thermic lances of horror were melting their way steadily through the steel door of his mind .   let me see  now .  that   s a   what was it again .      a bloody mary .     this voice made a simple drinks order sound like the opening of hostilities .   oh  yes .  and        mine was a small egg nog     said pestilence .   an egg nog .      with a cherry in it .      good  lied the heavy voice .  and that   ll be a small port wine for me and  the speaker glanced across the table at the fourth member of the quartet and sighed  you   d better bring another bowl of peanuts .   about three hundred yards down the road the horse thieves were trying to come to terms with a new experience .      certainly a smooth ride     nijel managed eventually .      and a lovely   a lovely view     said creosote  his voice lost in the slipstream .      but i wonder     said nijel     if we have done exactly the right thing .         we   re moving  aren   t we .     demanded conina .     don   t be petty .         it   s just that  well  looking at cumulus clouds from above is           shut up .         sorry .         anyway  they   re stratus .  strato cumulus at most .           right     said nijel miserably .      does it make any difference .     said creosote  who was lying flat on his horse   s neck with his eyes shut .      about a thousand feet .         oh .         could be seven hundred and fifty     conceded conina .      ah .         the tower of sourcery trembled .  colored smoke rolled through its vaulted rooms and shining corridors .  in the big room at the very tip  where the air was thick and greasy and tasted of burning tin  many wizards had passed out with the sheer mental effort of the battle .  but enough remained .  they sat in a wide circle  locked in concentration .   it was just possible to see the shimmering in the air as the raw sourcery swirled out of the staff in coin   s hand and into the center of the octogram .   outlandish shapes appeared for a brief instant and vanished .  the very fabric of reality was being put through the wringer in there .   carding shuddered and turned away in case he saw anything he really couldn   t ignore .   the surviving senior wizards had a simulacrum of the disc hovering in front of them .  as carding looked at it again the little red glow over the city of quirm flared and went out .   the air creaked .      there goes quirm     murmured carding .      that just leaves al khali     said one of the others .      there   s some clever power there .      carding nodded glumly .  he   d quite liked quirm  which was a   had been a pleasant little city overlooking the rim ocean .   he dimly recalled being taken there  once  when he was small .  for a moment he gazed sadly into the past .  it had wild geraniums  he recalled  filling the sloping cobbled streets with their musky fragrance .        growing out of the walls     he said out loud .     pink .  they were pink .      the other wizards looked at him oddly .  one or two  of a particularly paranoid frame of mind even for wizards  glanced suspiciously at the walls .      are you all right .     said one of them .      um .     said carding .     oh .  yes  sorry .  miles away .      he turned back to look at coin  who was sitting off to one side of the circle with the staff across his knees .  the boy appeared to be asleep .  perhaps he was .  but carding knew in the tormented pit of his soul that the staff didn   t sleep .  it was watching him  testing his mind .   it knew .  it even knew about the pink geraniums .      i never wanted it to be like this     he said softly .     all we really wanted was a bit of respect .         are you sure you   re all right .      carding nodded vaguely .  as his colleagues resumed their concentration he glanced sideways at them .   somehow  all his old friends had gone .  well  not friends .  a wizard never had friends  at least not friends who were wizards .  it needed a different word .  ah yes  that was it .  enemies .  but a very decent class of enemies .  gentlemen .  the cream of their profession .  not like these people  for all that they seemed to have risen in the craft since the sourcerer had arrived .   other things besides the cream floated to the top  he reflected sourly .   he turned his attention to al khali  probing with his mind  knowing that the wizards there were almost certainly doing the same  seeking constantly for a point of weakness .   he thought  am i a point of weakness .  spelter tried to tell me something .  it was about the staff .  a man should lean on his staff  not the other way around   it   s steering him  leading him   i wish i   d listened to spelter   this is wrong  i   m a point of weakness     he tried again  riding the surges of power  letting them carry his mind into the enemy tower .  even abrim was making use of sourcery  and carding let himself modulate the wave  insinuating himself past the defenses erected against him .   the image of the interior of the al khali tower appeared  focused        the luggage trundled along the glowing corridors .  it was exceedingly angry now .  it had been awoken from hibernation  it had been scorned  it had been briefly attacked by a variety of mythological and now extinct lifeforms  it had a headache and now  as it entered the great hall  it detected the hat .  the horrible hat  the cause of everything it was currently suffering .  it advanced purposefully     carding  testing the resistance of abrim   s mind  felt the man   s attention waver .  for a moment he saw through the enemy   s eyes  saw the squat oblong cantering across the stone .  for a moment abrim attempted to shift his concentration and then  no more able to help himself than is a cat when it sees something small and squeaky run across the floor  carding struck .   not much .  it didn   t need much .  abrim   s mind was attempting to balance and channel huge forces  and it needed hardly any pressure to topple it from its position .   abrim extended his hands to blast the luggage  gave the merest beginnings of a scream  and imploded .   the wizards around him thought they saw him grow impossibly small in a fraction of a second and vanish  leaving a black after image     the more intelligent of them started to run     and the magic he had been controlling surged back out and flooded free in one great  randomized burst that blew the hat to bits  took out the entire lower levels of the tower and quite a large part of what remained of the city .   so many wizards in ankh had been concentrating on the hall that the sympathetic resonance blew them across the room .  carding ended up on his back  his hat over his eyes .     they hauled him out and dusted him off and carried him to coin and the staff  amid cheers   although some of the older wizards forbore to cheer .  but he didn   t seem to pay any attention .   he stared sightlessly down at the boy  and then slowly raised his hands to his ears .      can   t you hear them .     he said .   the wizards fell silent .  carding still had power  and the tone of his voice would have quelled a thunderstorm .   coin   s eyes glowed .      i hear nothing     he said .   carding turned to the rest of the wizards .      can   t you hear them .      they shook their heads .  one of them said     hear what  brother .      carding smiled  and it was a wide  mad smile .  even coin took a step backwards .      you   ll hear them soon enough     he said .     you   ve made a beacon .  you   ll all hear them .  but you won   t hear them for long .     he pushed aside the younger wizards who were holding his arms and advanced on coin .      you   re pouring sourcery into the world and other things are coming with it     he said .     others have given them a pathway but you   ve given them an avenue .      he sprang forward and snatched the black staff out of coin   s hands and swung it up in the air to smash it against the wall .   carding went rigid as the staff struck back .  then his skin began to blister     most of the wizards managed to turn their heads away .  a few   and there are always a few like that   watched in obscene fascination .   coin watched  too .  his eyes widened in wonder .  one hand went to his mouth .  he tried to back away .  he couldn   t .          they   re cumulus .         marvelous     said nijel weakly .      weight doesn   t come into it .  my steed has carried armies .  my steed has carried cities .  yea  he hath carried all things in their due time  said death .  but he   s not going to carry you three .      why not .      it   s a matter of the look of the thing .      it   s going to look pretty good  then  isn   t it     said war testily     the one horseman and three pedestrians of the apocralypse .         perhaps you could ask them to wait for us .     said pestilence  his voice sounding like something dripping out of the bottom of a coffin .   i have things to attend to  said death .  he made a little clicking noise with his teeth .  i   m sure you   ll manage .  you normally do .   war watched the retreating horse .      sometimes he really gets on my nerves .  why is he always so keen to have the last word .     he said .      force of habit  i suppose .      they turned back to the tavern .  neither spoke for some time  and then war said     where   s famine .         went to find the kitchen .         oh .     war scuffed one armored foot in the dust  and thought about the distance to ankh .  it was a very hot afternoon .  the apocralypse could jolly well wait .      one for the road .     he suggested .      should we .     said pestilence  doubtfully .     i thought we were expected .  i mean  i wouldn   t like to disappoint people .         we   ve got time for a quick one  i   m sure     war insisted .     pub clocks are never right .  we   ve got bags of time .  all the time in the world .          carding slumped forward and thudded on the shining white floor .  the staff rolled out of his hands and upended itself .   coin prodded the limp body with his foot .      i did warn him     he said .     i told him what would happen if he touched it again .  what did he mean  them .      there was an outbreak of coughing and a considerable inspection of fingernails .      what did he mean .     coin demanded .   ovin hakardly  lecturer in lore  once again found that the wizards around him were parting like morning mist .  without moving he appeared to have stepped forward .  his eyes swivelled backwards and forward like trapped animals .      er     he said .  he waved his thin hands vaguely .     the world  you see  that is  the reality in which we live  in fact  it can be thought of as  in a manner of speaking  a rubber sheet .     he hesitated  aware that the sentence was not going to appear in anyone   s book of quotable quotes .      in that     he added hurriedly     it is distorted  uh  distended by the presence of magic in any degree and  if i may make a point here  too much magical potentiality  if foregathered in one spot  forces our reality  um  downwards  although of course one should not take the term literally  because in no sense do i seek to suggest a physical dimension  and it has been postulated that a sufficient exercise of magic can  shall we say  um  break through the actuality at its lowest point and offer  perhaps  a pathway to the inhabitants or  if i may use a more correct term  denizens of the lower plane  which is called by the loose tongued the dungeon dimensions  who  because perhaps of the difference in energy levels  are naturally attracted to the brightness of this world .  our world .      there was the typical long pause which usually followed hakardly   s speeches  while everybody mentally inserted commas and stitched the fractured clauses together .   coin   s lips moved silently for a while .     do you mean magic attracts these creatures .     he said eventually .   his voice was quite different now .  it lacked its former edge .  the staff hung in the air above the prone body of carding  rotating slowly .  the eyes of every wizard in the place were on it .      so it appears     said hakardly .     students of such things say their presence is heralded by a coarse susurration .      coin looked uncertain .      they buzz     said one of the other wizards helpfully .   the boy knelt down and peered closely at carding .      he   s very still     he said cautiously .     is anything bad happening to him .         it may be     said hakardly  guardedly .     he   s dead .         i wish he wasn   t .         it is a view  i suspect  which he shares .         but i can help him     said coin .  he held out his hands and the staff glided into them .  if it had a face  it would have smirked .   when he spoke next his voice once again had the cold distant tones of someone speaking in a steel room .      if failure had no penalty success would not be a prize     he said .      sorry .     said hakardly .     you   ve lost me there .      coin turned on his heel and strode back to his chair .      we can fear nothing     he said  and it sounded more like a command .     what of these dungeon dimensions .  if they should trouble us  away with them .  a true wizard will fear nothing .  nothing .      he jerked to his feet again and strode to the simulacrum of the world .  the image was perfect in every detail  down to a ghost of great a   tuin paddling slowly through the interstellar deeps a few inches above the floor .   coin waved his hand through it disdainfully .      ours is a world of magic     he said .     and what can be found in it that can stand against us .      hakardly thought that something was expected of him .      absolutely no one     he said .     except for the gods  of course .      there was a dead silence .        the gods .     said coin quietly .      well  yes .  certainly .  we don   t challenge the gods .  they do their job  we do ours .  no sense in           who rules the disc .  wizards or gods .      hakardly thought quickly .      oh  wizards .  of course .  but  as it were  under the gods .      when one accidentally puts one boot in a swamp it is quite unpleasant .  but not as unpleasant as pushing down with the other boot and hearing that  too  disappear with a soft sucking noise .  hakardly pressed on .      you see  wizardry is more           are we not more powerful than the gods  then .     said coin .   some of the wizards at the back of the crowd began to shuffle their feet .      well .  yes and no     said hakardly  up to his knees in it now .   the truth was that wizards tended to be somewhat nervous about the gods .  the beings who dwelt on cori celesti had never made their feelings plain on the subject of ceremonial magic  which after all had a certain godness about it  and wizards tended to avoid the whole subject .  the trouble with gods was that if they didn   t like something they didn   t just drop hints  so common sense suggested that it was unwise to put the gods in a position where they had to decide .      there seems to be some uncertainty .     said coin .      if i may counsel       hakardly began .   coin waved a hand .  the walls vanished .  the wizards stood at the top of the tower of sourcery  and as one man their eyes turned to the distant pinnacle of cori celesti  home of the gods .      when you   ve beaten everyone else  there   s only the gods left to fight     said coin .     have any of you seen the gods .      there was a chorus of hesitant denials .      i will show them to you .            you   ve got room for another one in there  old son     said war .   pestilence swayed unsteadily .     i   m sure we should be getting along     he muttered  without much conviction .      oh  go on .         just a half  then .  and then we really must be going .      war slapped him on the back and glared at famine .      and we   d better have another fifteen bags of peanuts     he added .         oook     the librarian concluded .      oh     said rincewind .     it   s the staff that   s the problem  then .         oook .         hasn   t anyone tried to take it away from him .         oook .         what happened to them  then .         eeek .      rincewind groaned .   the librarian had put his candle out because the presence of the naked flame was unsettling the books  but now that rincewind had grown accustomed to the dark  he realized it wasn   t dark at all .  the soft octarine glow from the books filled the inside of the tower with something that  while it wasn   t exactly light  was a blackness you could see by .  now and again the ruffle of stiff pages floated down from the gloom .      so  basically  there   s no way our magic could defeat him  isn   t that right .      the librarian oooked disconsolate agreement and continued to spin around gently on his bottom .      pretty pointless  then .  it may have struck you that i am not exactly gifted in the magical department .  i mean  any duel is going to go on the lines of    hallo  i   m rincewind    closely followed by bazaam .         oook .         basically  what you   re saying is that i   m on my own .         oook .         thanks .      by their own faint glow rincewind regarded the books that had stacked themselves around the inner walls of the ancient tower .   he sighed and marched briskly to the door  but slowed down noticeably as he reached it .      i   ll be off  then     he said .      oook .         to face who knows what dreadful perils     rincewind added .     to lay down my life in the service of mankind           eeek .         all right  bipeds           woof .            and quadrapeds  all right .     he glanced at the patrician   s jamjar  a beaten man .      and lizards     he added .     can i go now .         a gale was howling down out of a clear sky as rincewind toiled toward the tower of sourcery .  its high white doors were shut so tightly it was barely possible to see their outline in the milky surface of the stone .   he hammered on it for a bit  but nothing much happened .  the doors seemed to absorb the sound .      fine thing     he muttered to himself  and remembered the carpet .  it was lying where he had left it  which was another sign that ankh had changed .  in the thieving days before the sourcerer nothing stayed for long where you left it .  nothing printable  anyway .   he rolled it out on the cobbles so that the golden dragons writhed against the blue ground  unless of course the blue dragons were flying against a golden sky .   he sat down .   he stood up .   he sat down again and hitched up his robe and  with some effort  unrolled one of his socks .  then he replaced his boot and wandered around for a bit until he found  among the rubble  a half brick .  he inserted the half brick into the sock and gave the sock a few thoughtful swings .     rincewind had grown up in morpork .  what a morpork citizen liked to have on his side in a fight was odds of about twenty to one  but failing that a sockful of half brick and a dark alley to lurk in was generally considered a better bet than any two magic swords you cared to name .   he sat down again .      up     he commanded .   the carpet did not respond .  rincewind peered at the pattern  then lifted a corner of the carpet and tried to make out if the underside was any better .      all right     he conceded     down .  very  very carefully .  down .            sheep     slurred war .     it was sheep .     his helmeted head hit the bar with a clang .  he raised it again .     sheep .         nonono     said famine  raising a thin finger unsteadily .     some other domess   dummist   tame animal .  like pig .  heifer .  kitten .  like that .  not sheep .         bees     said pestilence  and slid gently out of his seat .      okay     said war  ignoring him     right .  once again  then .  from the top .     he rapped the side of his glass for the note .      we are poor little   unidentified domesticated animals   that have lost our way       he quavered .      baabaabaa     muttered pestilence  from the floor .   war shook his head .     it isn   t the same  you know     he said .     not without him .  he used to come in beautifully on the bass .         baabaabaa     pestilence repeated .      oh  shut up     said war  and reached uncertainly for a bottle .      the gale buffeted the top of the tower  a hot  unpleasant wind that whispered with strange voices and rubbed the skin like fine sandpaper .   in the center of it coin stood with the staff over his head .  as dust filled the air the wizards saw the lines of magic force pouring from it .     they curved up to form a vast bubble that expanded until it must have been larger than the city .  and shapes appeared in it .  they were shifting and indistinct  wavering horribly like visions in a distorting mirror  no more substantial than smoke rings or pictures in the clouds  but they were dreadfully familiar .   there  for a moment  was the fanged snout of offler .  there  clear for an instant in the writhing storm  was blind io  chief of the gods  with his orbiting eyes .   coin muttered soundlessly and the bubble began to contract .  it bulged and jerked obscenely as the things inside fought to get out  but they could not stop the contraction .   now it was bigger than the university grounds .   now it was taller than the tower .   now it was twice the height of a man  and smoke gray .   now it was an iridescent pearl  the size of   well  the size of a large pearl .   the gale had gone  replaced by a heavy  silent calm .  the very air groaned with the strain .  most of the wizards were flat on the floor  pressed there by the unleashed forces that thickened the air and deadened sound like a universe of feathers  but every one of them could hear his own heart beating loud enough to smash the tower .      look at me     coin commanded .   they turned their eyes upwards .  there was no way they could disobey .   he held the glistening thing in one hand .  the other held the staff  which had smoke pouring from its ends .      the gods     he said .     imprisoned in a thought .  and perhaps they were never more than a dream .      his voice become older  deeper .     wizards of unseen university     it said     have i not given you absolute dominion .      behind them the carpet rose slowly over the side of the tower  with rincewind trying hard to keep his balance .  his eyes were wide with the sort of terror that comes naturally to anyone standing on a few threads and several hundred feet of empty air .   he lurched off the hovering thing and onto the tower  swinging the loaded sock around his head in wide  dangerous sweeps .   coin saw him reflected in the astonished stares of the assembled wizards .  he turned carefully and watched the wizard stagger erratically toward him .      who are you .     he said .      i have come     said rincewind thickly     to challenge the sourcerer .  which one is he .      he surveyed the prostrate wizardry  hefting the half brick in one hand .   hakardly risked a glance upwards and made frantic eyebrow movements at rincewind who  even at the best of times  wasn   t much good at interpreting non verbal communication .  this wasn   t the best of times .      with a sock .     said coin .     what good is a sock .      the arm holding the staff rose .  coin looked down at it in mild astonishment .      no  stop     he said .     i want to talk to this man .     he stared at rincewind  who was swaying back and forth under the influence of sleeplessness  horror and the after effects of an adrenaline overdose .      is it magical .     he said  curiously .     perhaps it is the sock of an archchancellor .  a sock of force .      rincewind focused on it .      i don   t think so     he said .     i think i bought it in a shop or something .  um .  i   ve got another one somewhere .         but in the end it has something heavy .         um .  yes     said rincewind .  he added     it   s a half brick .         but it has great power .         er .  you can hold things up with it .  if you had another one  you   d have a brick .     rincewind spoke slowly .  he was assimilating the situation by a kind of awful osmosis  and watching the staff turn ominously in the boy   s hand .        so .  it is a brick of ordinariness  within a sock .  the whole becoming a weapon .         um .  yes .         how does it work .         um .  you swing it  and then you .  hit something with it .  or sometimes the back of your hand  sometimes .         and then perhaps it destroys a whole city .     said coin .   rincewind stared into coin   s golden eyes  and then at his sock .  he had pulled it on and off several times a year for years .  it had darns he   d grown to know and lo   well  know .  some of them had whole families of darns of their own .  there were a number of descriptions that could be applied to the sock  but slayer of cities wasn   t among them .      not really     he said at last .     it sort of kills people but leaves buildings standing .      rincewind   s mind was operating at the speed of continental drift .  parts of it were telling him that he was confronting the sourcerer  but they were in direct conflict with other parts .  rincewind had heard quite a lot about the power of the sourcerer  the staff of the sourcerer  the wickedness of the sourcerer and so on .  the only thing no one had mentioned was the age of the sourcerer .   he glanced toward the staff .      and what does that do .     he said slowly .   and the staff said  you must kill this man .   the wizards  who had been cautiously struggling upright  flung themselves flat again .   the voice of the hat had been bad enough  but the voice of the staff was metallic and precise  it didn   t sound as though it was offering advice but simply stating the way the future had to be .  it sounded quite impossible to ignore .   coin half raised his arm  and hesitated .      why .     he said .   you do not disobey me .      you don   t have to     said rincewind hurriedly .     it   s only a thing .           i do not see why i should hurt him     said coin .     he looks so harmless .  like an angry rabbit .      he defies us .      not me     said rincewind  thrusting the arm with the sock behind his back and trying to ignore the bit about the rabbit .      why should i do everything you tell me .     said coin to the staff .     i always do everything you tell me  and it doesn   t help people at all .      people must fear you .  have i taught you nothing .      but he looks so funny .  he   s got a sock     said coin .   he screamed  and his arm jerked oddly .  rincewind   s hair stood on end .   you will do as you are commanded .      i won   t .      you know what happens to boys who are bad .   there was a crackle and a smell of scorched flesh .  coin dropped to his knees .      here  hang on a minute       rincewind began .   coin opened his eyes .  they were gold still  but flecked with brown .   rincewind swung his sock around in a wide humming arc that connected with the staff halfway along its length .  there was a brief explosion of brick dust and burnt wool and the staff spun out of the boy   s hand .  wizards scattered as it tumbled end over end across the floor .   it reached the parapet  bounced upwards and shot over the edge .   but  instead of falling  it steadied itself in the air  spun in its own length and sped back again trailing octarine sparks and making a noise like a buzzsaw .   rincewind pushed the stunned boy behind him  threw away the ravaged sock and whipped his hat off  flailing wildly as the staff bored toward him .  it caught him on the side of the head  delivering a shock that almost welded his teeth together and toppled him like a thin and ragged tree .     the staff turned again in mid air  glowing red hot now  and swept back for another and quite definitely final run .   rincewind struggled up on his elbows and watched in horrified fascination as it swooped through the chilly air which  for some reason he didn   t understand  seemed to be full of snowflakes .   and became tinged with purple  blotched with blue .  time slowed and ground to a halt like an underwound phonograph .   rincewind looked up at the tall black figure that had appeared a few feet away .   it was  of course  death .   he turned his glowing eyesockets toward rincewind and said  in a voice like the collapse of undersea chasms  good afternoon .   he turned away as if he had completed all necessary business for the time being  stared at the horizon for a while  and started to tap one foot idly .  it sounded like a bagful of maracas .      er     said rincewind .   death appeared to remember him .  i   m sorry .  he said politely .      i always wondered how it was going to be     said rincewind .   death took an hourglass out from the mysterious folds of his ebon robes and peered at it .   did you .  he said  vaguely .      i suppose i can   t complain     said rincewind virtuously .     i   ve had a good life .  well  quite good .     he hesitated .     well  not all that good .  i suppose most people would call it pretty awful .     he considered it further .     i would     he added  half to himself .   what are you talking about  man .   rincewind was nonplussed .     don   t you make an appearance when a wizard is about to die .      of course .  and i must say you people are giving me a busy day .        how do you manage to be in so many places at the same time .      good organization .   time returned .  the staff  which had been hanging in the air a few feet away from rincewind  started to scream forward again .   and there was a metallic thud as coin caught it one handedly in mid flight .   the staff uttered a noise like a thousand fingernails dragging across glass .  it thrashed wildly up and down  flailing at the arm that held it  and bloomed into evil green flame along its entire length .   so .  at the last  you fail me .   coin groaned but held on as the metal under his fingertips went red  then white .   he thrust the arm out in front of him  and the force streaming from the staff roared past him and drew sparks from his hair and whipped his robe up into weird and unpleasant shapes .  he screamed and whirled the staff around and smashed it on the parapet  leaving a long bubbling line in the stone .   then he threw it away .  it clattered against the stones and rolled to a halt  wizards scattering out of its path .   coin sagged to his knees  shaking .      i don   t like killing people     he said .     i   m sure it can   t be right .         hold onto that thought     said rincewind fervently .      what happens to people after they   re dead .     said coin .   rincewind glanced up at death .      i think this one   s for you     he said .   he cannot see or hear me  said death  until he wants to .   there was a little clinking noise .  the staff was rolling back toward coin  who looked down at it in horror .   pick me up .        you don   t have to     said rincewind again .   you cannot resist me .  you cannot defeat yourself  said the staff .   coin reached out very slowly  and picked it up .   rincewind glanced at his sock .  it was a stub of burnt wool  its brief career as a weapon of war having sent it beyond the help of any darning needle .   now kill him .   rincewind held his breath .  the watching wizards held their breath .  even death  who had nothing to hold but his scythe  held it tensely .      no     said coin .   you know what happens to boys who are bad .   rincewind saw the sourcerer   s face go pale .   the staff   s voice changed .  now it wheedled .   without me  who would there be to tell you what to do .      that is true     said coin slowly .   see what you have achieved .   coin stared slowly around at the frightened faces .      i am seeing     he said .   i taught you everything i know .      i am thinking     said coin     that you do not know enough .      ingrate .  who gave you your destiny .      you did     said the boy .  he raised his head .      i realize that i was wrong     he added  quietly .   good        i did not throw you far enough .      coin got to his feet in one movement and swung the staff over his head .  he stood still as a statue  his hand lost in a ball of light that was the color of molten copper .  it turned green  ascended through shades of blue  hovered in the violet and then seared into pure octarine .   rincewind shaded his eyes against the glare and saw coin   s hand  still whole  still gripping tight  with beads of molten metal glittering between his fingers .     he slithered away  and bumped into hakardly .  the old wizard was standing like a statue  with his mouth open .      what   ll happen .     said rincewind .      he   ll never beat it     said hakardly hoarsely .     it   s his .  it   s as strong as him .  he   s got the power  but it knows how to channel it .         you mean they   ll cancel each other out .         hopefully .      the battle was hidden in its own infernal glow .  then the floor began to tremble .      they   re drawing on everything magical     said hakardly .     we   d better leave the tower .         why .         i imagine it will vanish soon enough .      and  indeed  the white flagstones around the glow looked as though they were unravelling and disappearing into it .   rincewind hesitated .      aren   t we going to help him .     he said .   hakardly stared at him  and then at the iridescent tableau .  his mouth opened and shut once or twice .      i   m sorry     he said .      yes  but just a bit of help on his side  you   ve seen what that thing is like           i   m sorry .         he helped you .     rincewind turned on the other wizards  who were scurrying away .     all of you .  he gave you what you wanted  didn   t he .         we may never forgive him     said hakardly .   rincewind groaned .      what will be left when it   s all over .     he said .     what will be left .      hakardly looked down .      i   m sorry     he repeated .   the octarine light had grown brighter and was beginning to turn black around the edge .  it wasn   t the black that is merely the opposite of light  though  it was the grainy  shifting blackness that glows beyond the glare and has no business in any decent reality .  and it buzzed .   rincewind did a little dance of uncertainty as his feet  legs  instincts and incredibly well developed sense of self preservation overloaded his nervous system to the point where  just as it was on the point of fusing  his conscience finally got its way .   he leapt into the fire and reached the staff .   the wizards fled .  several of them levitated down from the tower .   they were a lot more perspicacious than those that used the stairs because  about thirty seconds later  the tower vanished .   the snow continued to fall around a column of blackness  which buzzed .   and the surviving wizards who dared to look back saw  tumbling slowly down the sky  a small object trailing flames behind it .  it crashed into the cobbles  where it smouldered for a bit before the thickening snow put it out .   pretty soon it became just a small mound .   a little while later a squat figure swung itself across the courtyard on its knuckles  scrabbled in the snow  and hauled the thing out .   it was  or rather it had been  a hat .  life had not been kind to it .  a large part of the wide brim had been burned off  the point was entirely gone  and the tarnished silver letters were almost unreadable .  some of them had been torn off in any case .  those that were left spelled out  wizd .   the librarian turned around slowly .  he was entirely alone  except for the towering column of burning blackness and the steadily falling flakes .   the ravaged campus was empty .  there were a few other pointy hats that had been trampled by terrified feet  and no other sign that people had been there .   all the wizards were wazards .         war .         wazzat .           wasn   t there     pestilence groped for his glass     something .         wazzat .         we ought to be   there   s something we ought to be doing     said famine .      s   right .  got an appointment .         the       pestilence gazed reflectively into his drink .     thingy .      they stared gloomily at the bar counter .  the innkeeper had long ago fled .  there were several bottles still unopened .      okra     said famine  eventually .     that was it .         nah .         the apos   the apostrophe     said war  vaguely .   they shook their heads .  there was a lengthy pause .      what does    apocrustic    mean .     said pestilence  gazing intently into some inner world .      astringent     said war     i think .         it   s not that  then .         shouldn   t think so     said famine  glumly .   there was another long  embarrassed silence .      better have    nother drink     said war  pulling himself together .      s   right .         about fifty miles away and several thousand feet up  conina at last managed to control her stolen horse and brought it to a gentle trot on the empty air  displaying some of the most determined nonchalance the disc had ever seen .      snow .     she said .   clouds were roaring soundlessly from the direction of the hub .  they were fat and heavy and shouldn   t be moving so fast .  blizzards trailed beneath them  covering the landscape like a sheet .   it didn   t look like the kind of snow that whispers down gently in the pit of the night and in the morning turns the landscape into a glittering wonderland of uncommon and ethereal beauty .  it looked like the kind of snow that intends to make the world as bloody cold as possible .      bit late in the year     said nijel .  he glanced downwards  and then immediately closed his eyes .   creosote watched in delighted astonishment .     is that how it happens .     he said .     i   ve only heard about it in stories .  i thought it sprouted out of the ground somehow .  bit like mushrooms  i thought .         those clouds aren   t right     said conina .      do you mind if we go down now .     said nijel weakly .     somehow it didn   t look so bad when we were moving .      conina ignored this .     try the lamp     she commanded .     i want to know about this .      nijel fumbled in his pack and produced the lamp .   the voice of the genie sounded rather tinny and far off  and said     if you would care to relax a little   trying to connect you .     there then followed some tinkly little music  the kind that perhaps a swiss chalet would make if you could play it  before a trapdoor outlined itself in the air and the genie himself appeared .  he looked around him  and then at them .      oh  wow     he said .      something   s happening to the weather     said conina .     why .         you mean you don   t know .     said the genie .      we   re asking you  aren   t we .         well  i   m no judge  but it rather looks like the apocralypse  yuh .         what .      the genie shrugged .     the gods have vanished  okay .     he said .     and according to  you know  legend  that means           the ice giants     said nijel  in a horrified whisper .      speak up     said creosote .      the ice giants     nijel repeated loudly  with a trace of irritation .     the gods keep them imprisoned  see .  at the hub .  but at the end of the world they   ll break free at last  and ride out on their dreadful glaciers and regain their ancient domination  crushing out the flames of civilization until the world lies naked and frozen under the terrible cold stars until time itself freezes over .  or something like that  apparently .         but it isn   t time for the apocralypse     said conina desperately .     i mean  a dreadful ruler has to arise  there must be a terrible war  the four dreadful horsemen have to ride  and then the dungeon dimensions will break into the world       she stopped  her face nearly as white as the snow .      being buried under a thousand foot ice sheet sounds awfully like it  anyway     said the genie .  he reached forward and snatched his lamp out of nijel   s hands .      mucho apologies     he said     but it   s time to liquidize my assets in this reality .  see you around .  or something .     he vanished up to the waist  and then with a faint last cry of    shame about lunch     disappeared entirely .   the three riders peered through the veils of driving snow toward the hub .      it may be my imagination     said creosote     but can either of you hear a sort of creaking and groaning .         shut up     said conina distractedly .   creosote leaned over and patted her hand .      cheer up     he said     it   s not the end of the world .     he thought about this statement for a bit  and then added     sorry .  just a figure of speech .         what are we going to do .     she wailed .   nijel drew himself up .      i think     he said     that we should go and explain .      they turned toward him with the kind of expression normally reserved for messiahs or extreme idiots .      yes     he said  with a shade more confidence .     we should explain .         explain to the ice giants .     said conina .      yes .         sorry     said conina     have i got this right .  you think we should go and find the terrifying ice giants and sort of tell them that there are a lot of warm people out here who would rather they didn   t sweep across the world crushing everyone under mountains of ice  and could they sort of reconsider things .  is that what you think we should do .         yes .  that   s right .  you   ve got it exactly .      conina and creosote exchanged glances .  nijel remained sitting proudly in the saddle  a faint smile on his face .      is your geese giving you trouble .     said the seriph .      geas     said nijel calmly .     it   s not giving me trouble  it   s just that i must do something brave before i die .         that   s it though     said creosote .     that   s the whole rather sad point .  you   ll do something brave  and then you   ll die .         what alternative have we got .     said nijel .   they considered this .      i don   t think i   m much good at explaining     said conina  in a small voice .      i am     said nijel  firmly .     i   m always having to explain .         the scattered particles of what had been rincewind   s mind pulled themselves together and drifted up through the layers of dark unconsciousness like a three day corpse rising to the surface .   it probed its most recent memories  in much the same way that one might scratch a fresh scab .   he could recall something about a staff  and a pain so intense that it appeared to insert a chisel between every cell in his body and hammer on it repeatedly .   he remembered the staff fleeing  dragging him after it .  and then there had been that dreadful bit where death had appeared and reached past him  and the staff had twisted and become suddenly alive and death had said  ipslore the red  i have you now .   and now there was this .   by the feel of it rincewind was lying on sand .  it was very cold .   he took the risk of seeing something horrible and opened his eyes .     the first thing he saw was his left arm and  surprisingly  his hand .  it was its normal grubby self .  he had expected to see a stump .   it seemed to be nighttime .  the beach  or whatever it was  stretched on toward a line of distant low mountains  under night sky frosted with a million stars .   a little closer to him there was a rough line in the silvery sand .  he lifted his head slightly and saw the scatter of molten droplets .  they were octiron  a metal so intrinsically magical that no forge on the disc could even warm it up .      oh     he said .     we won  then .      he flopped down again .   after a while his right hand came up automatically and patted the top of his head .  then it patted the sides of his head .  then it began to grope  with increasing urgency  in the sand around him .   eventually it must have communicated its concern to the rest of rincewind  because he pulled himself upright and said     oh  bugger .      there seemed to be no hat anywhere .  but he could see a small white shape lying very still in the sand a little way away and  further off     a column of daylight .   it hummed and swayed in the air  a three dimensional hole into somewhere else .  occasional flurries of snow blew out of it .  he could see skewed images in the light  that might be buildings or landscapes warped by the weird curvature .  but he couldn   t see them very clearly  because of the tall  brooding shadows that surrounded it .   the human mind is an astonishing thing .  it can operate on several levels at once .  and  in fact  while rincewind had been wasting his intellect in groaning and looking for his hat  an inner part of his brain had been observing  assessing  analyzing and comparing .   now it crept up to his cerebellum  tapped it on the shoulder  thrust a message into its hand and ran for it .     the message ran something like this  i hope i find me well .  the last trial of magic has been too much for the tortured fabric of reality .  it has opened a hole .  i am in the dungeon dimensions .  and the things in front of me are   the things .  it has been nice knowing me .   the particular thing nearest rincewind was at least twenty feet high .  it looked like a dead horse that had been dug up after three months and then introduced to a range of new experiences  at least one of which had included an octopus .   it hadn   t noticed rincewind .  it was too busy concentrating on the light .   rincewind crawled back to the still body of coin and nudged it gently .      are you alive .     he said .     if you   re not  i   d prefer it if you didn   t answer .      coin rolled over and stared up at him with puzzled eyes .  after a while he said     i remember           best not to     said rincewind .   the boy   s hand groped vaguely in the sand beside him .      it isn   t here anymore     said rincewind  quietly .  the hand stopped its searching .   rincewind helped coin to sit up .  he looked blankly at the cold silver sand  then at the sky  then at the distant things  and then at rincewind .      i don   t know what to do     he said .      no harm in that .  i   ve never known what to do     said rincewind with hollow cheerfulness .     been completely at a loss my whole life .     he hesitated .     i think it   s called being human  or something .         but i   ve always known what to do .      rincewind opened his mouth to say that he   d seen some of it  but changed his mind .  instead he said     chin up .  look on the bright side .  it could be worse .      coin took another look around .      in what respect  exactly .     he said  his voice a shade more normal .        um .         what is this place .         it   s a sort of other dimension .  the magic broke through and we went with it  i think .         and those things .      they regarded the things .      i think they   re things .  they   re trying to get back through the hole     said rincewind .     it isn   t easy .  energy levels  or something .  i remember we had a lecture on them once .  er .      coin nodded  and reached out a thin pale hand toward rincewind   s forehead .      do you mind    .     he began .   rincewind shuddered at the touch .     mind what .     he said .      if i have a look in your head .      aargh .      it   s rather a mess in here .  no wonder you can   t find things .      ergh .      you ought to have a clear out .      oogh .         ah .      rincewind felt the presence retreat .  coin frowned .      we can   t let them get through     he announced .     they have horrible powers .  they   re trying to will the hole bigger  and they can do it .  they   ve been waiting to break into our world for       he frowned      ians .         aeons     said rincewind .   coin opened his other hand  which had been tightly clenched  and showed rincewind the small gray pearl .      do you know what this is .     he said .      no .  what is it .         i   can   t remember .  but we should put it back .         okay .  just use sourcery .  blow them to bits and let   s go home .         no .  they live on magic .  it   d only make them worse .  i can   t use magic .         are you sure .     said rincewind .        i   m afraid your memory was very clear on the subject .         then what shall we do .         i don   t know .      rincewind thought about this and then  with an air of finality  started to take off his last sock .      no half bricks     he said  to no one in particular .     have to use sand .         you   re going to attack them with a sockful of sand .         no .  i   m going to run away from them .  the sockful of sand is for when they follow .         people were returning to al khali  where the ruined tower was a smoking heap of stones .  a few brave souls turned their attention to the wreckage  on the basis that there might be survivors who could be rescued or looted or both .   and  among the rubble  the following conversation might have been heard      there   s something moving under here .         under that .  by the two beards of imtal  you are mishearing .  it must weigh a ton .         over here  brothers .      and then sounds of much heaving would have been heard  and then      it   s a box .         it could be treasure  do you think .         it   s growing legs  by the seven moons of nasreem .         five moons           where   d it go .  where   d it go .         never mind about that  it   s not important .  let   s get this straight  according to the legend it was five moons        in klatch they take their mythology seriously .  it   s only real life they don   t believe .      the three horsepersons sensed the change as they descended through the heavy snowclouds at the hub end of the sto plain .  there was a sharp scent in the air .        can   t you smell it .     said nijel     i remember it when i was a boy  when you lay in bed on that first morning in winter  and you could sort of taste it in the air and        the clouds parted below them and there  filling the high plains country from end to end  were the herds of the ice giants .   they stretched for miles in every direction  and the thunder of their stampede filled the air .   the bull glaciers were in the lead  bellowing their vast creaky calls and throwing up great sheets of earth as they plowed relentlessly forward .  behind them pressed the great mass of cows and their calves  skimming over land already ground down to the bedrock by the leaders .   they bore as much resemblance to the familiar glaciers the world thought it knew as a lion dozing in the shade bears to three hundred pounds of wickedly coordinated muscle bounding toward you with its mouth open .         and   and   when you went to the window     nijel   s mouth  lacking any further input from his brain  ran down .   moving  jostling ice packed the plain  roaring forward under a great cloud of clammy steam .  the ground shook as the leaders passed below  and it was obvious to the onlookers that whoever was going to stop this would need more than a couple of pounds of rock salt and a shovel .      go on  then     said conina     explain .  i think you   d better shout .   nijel looked distractedly at the herd .      i think i can see some figures     said creosote helpfully .     look  on top of the leading   things .      nijel peered through the snow .  there were indeed beings moving around on the backs of the glaciers .  they were human  or humanoid  or at least humanish .  they didn   t look very big .   that turned out to be because the glaciers themselves were very big  and nijel wasn   t very good at perspective .  as the horses flew lower over the leading glacier  a huge bull heavily crevassed and scarred by moraine  it became apparent that one reason why the ice giants were known as the ice giants was because they were  well  giants .   the other was that they were made of ice .   a figure the size of a large house was crouched at the crest of the bull  urging it to greater efforts by means of a spike on a long pole .  it was craggy  in fact it was more nearly faceted  and glinted green and blue in the light  there was a thin band of silver in its snowy locks  and its eyes were tiny and black and deep set  like lumps of coal .    there was a splintering crash ahead as the leading glaciers smacked into a forest .  birds rattled up in panic .  snow and splinters rained down around nijel as he galloped on the air alongside the giant .   he cleared his throat .      erm     he said     excuse me .      ahead of the boiling surf of earth  snow and smashed timber a herd of caribou was running in blind panic  their rear hooves a few feet from the tumbling mess .   nijel tried again .      i say .     he shouted .   the giant   s head turned toward him .      vot you vant .     it said .     go avay  hot person .         sorry  but is this really necessary .      the giant looked at him in frozen astonishment .  it turned around slowly and regarded the rest of the herd  which seemed to stretch all the way to the hub .  it looked at nijel again .      yarss     it said     i tink so .  othervise  why ve do it .         only there   s a lot of people out there who would prefer you not to  you see     said nijel  desperately .  a rock spire loomed briefly ahead of the glacier  rocked for a second and then vanished .   he added     also children and small furry animals .         they vill suffer in the cause of progress .  now is the time ve reclaim the vorld     rumbled the giant .     whole vorld of ice .  according to inevitability of history and triumph of thermodynamics .         yes  but you don   t have to     said nijel .      ve vant to     said the giant .     the gods are gone  ve throw off shackles of outmoded superstition .         freezing the whole world solid doesn   t sound very progressive to me     said nijel .      ve like it .         yes  yes     said nijel  in the maniacally glazed tones of one who is trying to see all sides of the issue and is certain that a solution will be found if people of goodwill will only sit around a table and discuss things rationally like sensible human beings .     but is this the right time .  is the world ready for the triumph of ice .         it bloody vell better be     said the giant  and swung his glacier prod at nijel .  it missed the horse but caught him full in the chest  lifting him clean out of the saddle and flicking him onto the glacier itself .  he spun  spreadeagled  down its freezing flanks  was carried some way by the boil of debris  and rolled into the slush of ice and mud between the speeding walls .   he staggered to his feet  and peered hopelessly into the freezing fog .  another glacier bore down directly on him .   so did conina .  she leaned over as her horse swept down out of the fog  caught nijel by his leather barbarian harness  and swung him up in front of her .   as they rose again he wheezed     cold hearted bastard .  i really thought i was getting somewhere for a moment there .  you just can   t talk to some people .        the herd breasted another hill  scraping off quite a lot of it  and the sto plain  studded with cities  lay helpless before it .      rincewind sidled toward the nearest thing  holding coin with one hand and swinging the loaded sock in the other .      no magic  right .     he said .      yes     said the boy .      whatever happens  you musn   t use magic .         that   s it .  not here .  they haven   t got much power here  if you don   t use magic .  once they break through  though        his voice trailed away .      pretty awful     rincewind nodded .      terrible     said coin .   rincewind sighed .  he wished he still had his hat .  he   d just have to do without it .      all right     he said .     when i shout  you make a run for the light .  do you understand .  no looking back or anything .  no matter what happens .         no matter what .     said coin uncertainly .      no matter what .     rincewind gave a brave little smile .     especially no matter what you hear .      he was vaguely cheered to see coin   s mouth become an    o    of terror .      and then     he continued     when you get back to the other side           what shall i do .      rincewind hesitated .     i don   t know     he said .     anything you can .  as much magic as you like .  anything .  just stop them .  and   um           yes .      rincewind gazed up at the thing  which was still staring into the light .      if it   you know   if anyone gets out of this  you know  and everything is all right after all  sort of thing  i   d like you to sort of tell people i sort of stayed here .  perhaps they could sort of write it down somewhere .  i mean  i wouldn   t want a statue or anything     he added virtuously .   after a while he added     i think you ought to blow your nose .      coin did so  on the hem of his robe  and then shook rincewind   s hand solemnly .      if ever you       he began     that is  you   re the first   it   s been a great   you see  i never really       his voice trailed off  and then he said     i just wanted you to know that .         there was something else i was trying to say     said rincewind  letting go of the hand .  he looked blank for a moment  and then added     oh  yes .  it   s vital to remember who you really are .  it   s very important .  it isn   t a good idea to rely on other people or things to do it for you  you see .  they always get it wrong .         i   ll try and remember     said coin .      it   s very important     rincewind repeated  almost to himself .     and now i think you   d better run .      rincewind crept closer to the thing .  this particular one had chicken legs  but most of the rest of it was mercifully hidden in what looked like folded wings .   it was  he thought  time for a few last words .  what he said now was likely to be very important .  perhaps they would be words that would be remembered  and handed down  and maybe even carved deeply in slabs of granite .   words without too many curly letters in  therefore .      i really wish i wasn   t here     he muttered .   he hefted the sock  whirled it once or twice  and smashed the thing on what he hoped was its kneecap .   it gave a shrill buzz  spun wildly with its wings creaking open  lunged vaguely at rincewind with its vulture head and got another sockful of sand on the upswing .   rincewind looked around desperately as the thing staggered back  and saw coin still standing where he had left him .  to his horror he saw the boy begin to walk toward him  hands raised instinctively to fire the magic which  here  would doom both of them .      run away  you idiot .     he screamed  as the thing began to gather itself for a counter attack .  from out of nowhere he found the words     you know what happens to boys who are bad .      coin went pale  turned and ran toward the light .  he moved as though through treacle  fighting against the entropy slope .  the distorted image of the world turned inside out hovered a few feet away  then inches  wavering uncertainly     a tentacle curled around his leg  tumbling him forward .   he flung his hands out as he fell  and one of them touched snow .  it was immediately grabbed by something else that felt like a warm  soft leather glove  but under the gentle touch was a grip as tough as tempered steel and it tugged him forward  also dragging whatever it was that had caught him .   light and grainy dark flicked around him and suddenly he was sliding over cobbles slicked with ice .   the librarian let go his hold and stood over coin with a length of heavy wooden beam in his hand .  for a moment the ape reared against the darkness  the shoulder  elbow and wrist of his right arm unfolding in a poem of applied leverage  and in a movement as unstoppable as the dawn of intelligence brought it down very heavily .  there was a squashy noise and an offended screech  and the burning pressure on coin   s leg vanished .   the dark column wavered .  there were squeals and thumps coming from it  distorted by distance .   coin struggled to his feet and started to run back into the dark  but this time the librarian   s arm blocked his path .      we can   t just leave him in there .      the ape shrugged .   there was another crackle from the dark  and then a moment of almost complete silence .   but only almost complete .  both of them thought they heard  a long way off but very distinct  the sound of running feet fading into the distance .   they found an echo in the outside world .  the ape glanced around  and then pushed coin hurriedly to one side as something squat and battered and with hundreds of little legs barrelled across the stricken courtyard and  without so much as pausing in its stride  leapt into the disappearing darkness  which flickered for one last time and vanished .   there was a sudden flurry of snow across the air where it had been .   coin wrenched free of the librarian   s grip and ran into the circle  which was already turning white .  his feet scuffed up a sprinkle of fine sand .      he didn   t come out .     he said .      oook     said the librarian  in a philosophic manner .      i thought he   d come out .  you know  just at the last minute .         oook .      coin looked closely at the cobbles  as if by mere concentration he could change what he saw .     is he dead .         oook     observed the librarian  contriving to imply that rincewind was in a region where even things like time and space were a bit iffy  and that it was probably not very useful to speculate as to his exact state at this point in time  if indeed he was at any point in time at all  and that  all in all  he might even turn up tomorrow or  for that matter  yesterday  and finally that if there was any chance at all of surviving then rincewind almost certainly would .      oh     said coin .   he watched the librarian shuffle around and head back for the tower of art  and a desperate loneliness overcame him .      i say .     he yelled .      oook .         what should i do now .         oook .      coin waved vaguely at the desolation .        you know  perhaps i could do something about all this .     he said in a voice tilting on the edge of terror .     do you think that would be a good idea .  i mean  i could help people .  i   m sure you   d like to be human again  wouldn   t you .      the librarian   s everlasting smile hoisted itself a little further up his face  just enough to reveal his teeth .      okay  perhaps not     said coin hurriedly     but there   s other things i could do  isn   t there .      the librarian gazed at him for some time  then dropped his eyes to the boy   s hand .  coin gave a guilty start  and opened his fingers .   the ape caught the little silver ball neatly before it hit the ground and held it up to one eye .  he sniffed it  shook it gently  and listened to it for a while .   then he wound up his arm and flung it away as hard as possible .      what       coin began  and landed full length in the snow when the librarian pushed him over and dived on top of him .   the ball curved over at the top of its arc and tumbled down  its perfect path interrupted suddenly by the ground .  there was a sound like a harp string breaking  a brief babble of incomprehensible voices  a rush of hot wind  and the gods of the disc were free .   the were very angry .         there is nothing we can do  is there .     said creosote .      no     said conina .      the ice is going to win  isn   t it .     said creosote .      yes     said conina .      no     said nijel .   he was trembling with rage  or possibly with cold  and was nearly as pale as the glaciers that rumbled past below them .   conina sighed .     well  just how do you think       she began .      take me down somewhere a few minutes ahead of them     said nijel .      i really don   t see how that would help .           i wasn   t asking your opinion     said nijel  quietly .     just do it .  put me down a little way ahead of them so i   ve got a while to get sorted out .         get what sorted out .      nijel didn   t answer .      i said     said conina     get what           shut up .         i don   t see why           look     said nijel  with the patience that lies just short of axe murdering .     the ice is going to cover the whole world  right .  everyone   s going to die  okay .  except for us for a little while  i suppose  until these horses want their  their  their oats or the lavatory or whatever  which isn   t much use to us except maybe creosote will just about have time to write a sonnet or something about how cold it is all of a sudden  and the whole of human history is about to be scraped up and in these circumstances i would like very much to make it completely clear that i am not about to be argued with  is that absolutely understood .      he paused for breath  trembling like a harpstring .   conina hesitated .  her mouth opened and shut a few times  as though she was considering arguing  and then she thought better of it .   they found a small clearing in a pine forest a mile or two ahead of the herd  although the sound of it was clearly audible and there was a line of steam above the trees and the ground was dancing like a drumtop .   nijel strolled to the middle of the clearing and made a few practice swings with his sword .  the others watched him thoughtfully .      if you don   t mind     whispered creosote to conina     i   ll be off .  it   s at times like this that sobriety loses its attractions and i   m sure the end of the world will look a lot better through the bottom of a glass  if it   s all the same to you .  do you believe in paradise  o peach cheeked blossom .         not as such  no .           oh     said creosote .     well  in that case we probably won   t be seeing each other again .     he sighed .     what a waste .  all this was just because of a geas .  um .  of course  if by some unthinkable chance           goodbye     said conina .   creosote nodded miserably  wheeled the horse and disappeared over the treetops .   snow was shaking down from the branches around the clearing .  the thunder of the approaching glaciers filled the air .   nijel started when she tapped him on the shoulder  and dropped his sword .      what are you doing here .     he snapped  fumbling desperately in the snow .      look  i   m not prying or anything     said conina meekly     but what exactly do you have in mind .      she could see a rolling heap of bulldozed snow and soil bearing down on them through the forest  the mind numbing sound of the leading glaciers now overlaid with the rhythmic snapping of tree trunks .  and  advancing implacably above the treeline  so high that the eye mistook them at first for sky  the blue green prows .      nothing     said nijel     nothing at all .  we   ve just got to resist them  that   s all there is to it .  that   s what we   re here for .         but it won   t make any difference     she said .      it will to me .  if we   re going to die anyway  i   d rather die like this .  heroically .         is it heroic to die like this .     said conina .      i think it is     he said     and when it comes to dying  there   s only one opinion that matters .         oh .      a couple of deer blundered into the clearing  ignored the humans in their blind panic  and rocketed away .      you don   t have to stay     said nijel .     i   ve got this geas  you see .      conina looked at the backs of her hands .        i think i should     she said  and added     you know  i thought maybe  you know  if we could just get to know one another better           mr .  and mrs .  harebut  was that what you had in mind .     he said bluntly .   her eyes widened .     well       she began .      which one did you intend to be .     he said .   the leading glacier smashed into the clearing just behind its bow wave  its top lost in a cloud of its own creation .   at exactly the same time the trees opposite it bent low as a hot wind blew from the rim .  it was loaded with voices   petulant  bickering voices   and tore into the clouds like a hot iron into water .   conina and nijel threw themselves down into snow which turned to warm slush under them .  something like a thunderstorm crashed overhead  filled with shouting and what they at first thought were screams although  thinking about them later  they seemed more like angry arguments .  it went on for a long time  and then began to fade in the direction of the hub .   warm water flooded down the front of nijel   s vest .  he lifted himself cautiously  and then nudged conina .   together they scrambled through the slush and mud to the top of the slope  climbed through a logjam of smashed timber and boulders  and stared at the scene .   the glaciers were retreating  under a cloud stuffed with lightning .  behind them the landscape was a network of lakes and pools .      did we do that .     said conina .      it would be nice to think so  wouldn   t it .     said nijel .      yes  but did       she began .      probably not .  who knows .  let   s just find a horse     he said .         the apogee     said war     or something .  i   m pretty sure .      they had staggered out of the inn and were sitting on a bench in the afternoon sunshine .  even war had been persuaded to take off some of his armor .        dunno     said famine     don   t think so .      pestilence shut his crusted eyes and leaned back against the warm stones .      i think     he said     it was something about the end of the world .      war sat and thoughtfully scratched his chin .  he hiccuped .      what  the whole world .     he said .      i reckon .      war gave this some further consideration .     i reckon we   re well out of it  then     he said .      people were returning to ankh morpork  which was no longer a city of empty marble but was once again its old self  sprawling as randomly and colorfully as a pool of vomit outside the all night takeaway of history .   and the university had been rebuilt  or had rebuilt itself  or in some strange way had never been unbuilt  every strand of ivy  every rotting casement  was back in place .  the sourcerer had offered to replace everything as good as new  all wood sparkling  all stone unstained  but the librarian had been very firm on the subject .  he wanted everything replaced as good as old .   the wizards came creeping back with the dawn  in ones or twos  scuttling for their old rooms  trying to avoid one another   s gaze  trying to remember a recent past that was already becoming unreal and dream like .   conina and nijel arrived around breakfast time and  out of kindness  found a livery stable for war   s horse .   it was conina who insisted that they look for rincewind at the university  and who  therefore  first saw the books .   they were flying out of the tower of art  spiraling around the university buildings and swooping through the door of the reincarnated library .  one or two of the more impudent grimoires were chasing sparrows  or hovering hawk like over the quad .   the librarian was leaning against the doorway  watching his charges with a benevolent eye .  he waggled his eyebrows at conina  the nearest he ever got to a conventional greeting .      is rincewind here .     she said .      oook .         sorry .      the ape didn   t answer but took them both by the hand and  walking between them like a sack between two poles  led them across the cobbles to the tower .   there were a few candles alight inside  and they saw coin seated on a stool .  the librarian bowed them into his presence like an ancient retainer in the oldest family of all  and withdrew .   coin nodded at them .     he knows when people don   t understand him     he said .     remarkable  isn   t he .         who are you .     said conina .      coin     said coin .      are you a student here .         i   m learning quite a lot  i think .      nijel was wandering around the walls  giving them the occasional prod .  there had to be some good reason why they didn   t fall down  but if there was it didn   t lie in the realms of civil engineering .      are you looking for rincewind .     said coin .   conina frowned .     how did you guess that .         he told me some people would come looking for him .      conina relaxed .     sorry     she said     we   ve had a bit of a trying time .  i thought perhaps it was magic  or something .  he   s all right  isn   t he .  i mean  what   s been happening .  did he fight the sourcerer .         oh  yes .  and he won .  it was very   interesting .  i saw it all .  but then he had to go     said coin  as though reciting .      what  just like that .     said nijel .        yes .         i don   t believe it     said conina .  she was beginning to crouch  her knuckles whitening .      it is true     said coin .     everything i say is true .  it has to be .         i want to       conina began  and coin stood up  extended a hand and said     stop .      she froze .  nijel stiffened in mid frown .      you will leave     said coin  in a pleasant  level voice     and you will ask no more questions .  you will be totally satisfied .  you have all your answers .  you will live happily ever after .  you will forget hearing these words .  you will go now .      they turned slowly and woodenly  like puppets  and trooped to the door .  the librarian opened it for them  ushered them through and shut it behind them .   then he stared at coin  who sagged back onto the stool .      all right  all right     said the boy     but it was only a little magic .  i had to .  you said yourself people had to forget .         oook .         i can   t help it .  it   s too easy to change things .     he clutched his head .     i   ve only got to think of something .  i can   t stay  everything i touch goes wrong  it   s like trying to sleep on a heap of eggs .  this world is too thin .  please tell me what to do .      the librarian spun around on his bottom a few times  a sure sign of deep thought .   exactly what he said is not recorded  but coin smiled  nodded  shook the librarian   s hand  and opened his own hands and drew them up and around him and stepped into another world .  it had a lake in  and some distant mountains  and a few pheasants watching him suspiciously from under the trees .  it was the magic all sourcerers learned  eventually .   sourcerers never become part of the world .  they merely wear it for a while .   he looked back  halfway across the turf  and waved at the librarian .  the ape gave him an encouraging nod .   and then the bubble shrank inside itself  and the last sourcerer vanished from this world and into a world of his own .      although it has nothing much to do with the story  it is an interesting fact that  about five hundred miles away  a small flock  or rather in this case a herd  of birds were picking their way cautiously through the trees .  they had heads like a flamingo  bodies like a turkey  and legs like a sumo wrestler  they walked in a jerky  bobbing fashion  as though their heads were attached to their feet by elastic bands .  they belonged to a species unique even among disc fauna  in that their prime means of defense was to cause a predator to laugh so much that they could run away before it recovered .   rincewind would have been vaguely satisfied to know that they were geas .      custom was slow in the mended drum .  the troll chained to the doorpost sat in the shade and reflectively picked someone out of his teeth .   creosote was singing softly to himself .  he had discovered been and wasn   t having to pay for it  because the coinage of compliments   rarely employed by the swains of ankh   was having an astonishing effect on the landlord   s daughter .  she was a large  good natured girl  with a figure that was the color and  not to put too fine a point on it  the same shape as unbaked bread .  she was intrigued .  no one had ever referred to her breasts as jewelled melons before .      absolutely     said the seriph  sliding peacefully off his bench     no doubt about it .     either the big yellow sort or the small green ones with huge warty veins  he told himself virtuously .      and what was that about my hair .     she said encouragingly  hauling him back and refiling his glass .      oh .     the seriph   s brow wrinkled .     like a goat of flocks that grazes on the slopes of mount wossname  and no mistake .  and as for your ears     he added quickly     no pink hued shells that grace the sea kissed sands of             exactly how like a flock of goats .     she said .   the seriph hesitated .  he   d always considered it one of his best lines .  now it was meeting ankh morpork   s famous literal mindedness head on for the first time .  strangely enough  he felt rather impressed .      i mean  in size  shape or smell .     she went on .      i think     said the seriph     that perhaps the phrase i had in mind was exactly not like a flog of gits .         ah .     the girl pulled the flagon toward her .      and i think perhaps i would like another drink     he said indistinctly     and then   and then       he looked sideways at the girl  and took the plunge .     are you much of a raconteur .         what .      he licked his suddenly dry lips .     i mean  do you know many stories .     he croaked .      oh  yes .  lots .         lots .     whispered creosote .  most of his concubines only knew the same old one or two .      hundreds .  why  do you want to hear one .         what  now .         if you like .  it   s not very busy in here .      perhaps i did die  creosote thought .  perhaps this is paradise .  he took her hands .     you know     he said     it   s ages since i   ve had a good narrative .  but i wouldn   t want you to do anything you don   t want to .      she patted his arm .  what a nice old gentleman  she thought .  compared to some we get in here .      there   s one my granny used to tell me .  i know it backwards     she said .   creosote sipped his beer and watched the wall in a warm glow .  hundreds  he thought .  and she knows some of them backwards .   she cleared her throat  and said  in a sing song voice that made creosote   s pulse fuse .     there was a man and he had eight sons            the patrician sat by his window  writing .  his mind was full of fluff as far as the last week or two was concerned  and he didn   t like that much .   a servant had lit a lamp to dispel the twilight  and a few early evening moths were orbiting it .  the patrician watched them carefully .  for some reason he felt very uneasy in the presence of glass but that  as he stared fixedly at the insects  wasn   t what bothered him most .   what bothered him was that he was fighting a terrible urge to catch them with his tongue .   and wuffles lay on his back at his master   s feet  and barked in his dreams .      lights were going on all over the city  but the last few strands of sunset illuminated the gargoyles as they helped one another up the long climb to the roof .   the librarian watched them from the open door  while giving himself a philosophic scratch .  then he turned and shut out the night .   it was warm in the library .  it was always warm in the library  because the scatter of magic that produced the glow also gently cooked the air .   the librarian looked at his charges approvingly  made his last rounds of the slumbering shelves  and then dragged his blanket underneath his desk  ate a goodnight banana  and fell asleep .   silence gradually reclaimed the library .  silence drifted around the remains of a hat  heavily battered and frayed and charred around the edges  that had been placed with some ceremony in a niche in the wall .  no matter how far a wizard goes  he will always come back for his hat .   silence filled the university in the same way that air fills a hole .  night spread across the disk like plum jam  or possibly blackberry preserve .   but there would be a morning .  there would always be another morning .       about the author   terry pratchett lives in england  an island off the coast of france  where he spends his time writing discworld novels in accordance

like this .  you mows it and you rolls it for five hundred years and then a bunch of bastards walks across it .        in most old libraries the books are chained to the shelves to prevent them being damaged by people .  in the library of unseen university  of course  it   s more or less the other way about .     at least  by anyone who wanted to wake up the same shape  or even the same species  as they went to bed .     the vermine is a small black and white relative of the lemming  found in the cold hublandish regions .  its skin is rare and highly valued  especially by the vermine itself  the selfish little bastard will do anything rather than let go of it .     this was because gritoller had swallowed the jewels for safe keeping .     the ankh morpork merchants    guild publication wellcome to ankh morporke  citie of one thousand surprises describes the area of old morpork known as the shades as    a folklorique network of old alleys and picturesque streets  wherre exitment and romans lurkes arounde everry corner and much may be heard the traditinal street cries of old time also the laughing visages of the denuizens as they goe about their business private .     in other words  you have been warned .     the study of genetics on the disc had failed at an early stage  when wizards tried the experimental crossing of such well known subjects as fruit flies and sweet peas .  unfortunately they didn   t quite grasp the fundamentals  and the resultant offspring   a sort of green bean thing that buzzed   led a short sad life before being eaten by a passing spider .     the overwhelming majority of citizens being defined in this case as everyone not currently hanging upside down over a scorpion pit .     wizards    tastes in the matter of puns are about the same as their taste in glittery objects .     of course  ankh morpork   s citizens had always claimed that the river water was incredibly pure in any case .  any water that had passed through so many kidneys  they reasoned  had to be very pure indeed .     no one ever had the courage to ask him what he did there .     or up  or obliquely .  the layout of the library of unseen university was a topographical nightmare  the sheer presence of so much stored magic twisting dimensions and gravity into the kind of spaghetti that would make m .  c .  escher go for a good lie down  or possibly sideways .     the hashishim  who derived their name from the vast quantities of hashish they consumed  were unique among vicious killers in being both deadly and  at the same time  inclined to giggle  groove to interesting patterns of light and shade on their terrible knife blades and  in extreme cases  fall over .     although  possibly  quicker .  and only licensed to carry fourteen people .     in a truly magical universe everything has its opposite .  for example  there   s anti light .  that   s not the same as darkness  because darkness is merely the absence of light .  anti light is what you get if you pass through darkness and out the other side .  on the same basis  a state of knurdness isn   t like sobriety .  by comparison  sobriety is like having a bath in cotton wool .  knurdness strips away all illusion  all the comforting pink fog in which people normally spend their lives  and lets them see and think clearly for the first time ever .  then  after they   ve screamed a bit  they make sure they never get knurd again .     for a description of the chimera we shall turn to broomfog   s famous bestiary anima unnaturale     it have thee legges of an mermade  the hair of an tortoise  the teeth of an fowel  and the winges of an snake .  of course  i have only my worde for it  the beast having the breathe of an furnace and the temperament of an rubber balloon in a hurricane .        of course  wizards often killed one another by ordinary  nonmagical means  but this was perfectly allowable and death by assassination was considered natural causes for a wizard .     all right .  but you   ve got the general idea .     it was a fullomyth  an invaluable aid for all whose business is with the arcane and hermetic .  it contained lists of things that didn   t exist and  in a very significant way  weren   t important .  some of its pages could only be read after midnight  or by strange and improbable illuminations .  there were descriptions of underground constellations and wines as yet unfermented .  for the really up to the epoch occultist  who could afford the version bound in spider skin  there was even an insert showing the london underground with the three stations they never dare show on the public maps .     he always argued that he was .         very popular among gods  demi gods  daemons and other supernatural creatures  who feel at home with questions like    what is it all about .     and    where will it all end .        although this was the only way in which they resembled the idols built  in response to ancient and unacknowledged memories  by children in snowy weather  it was extremely unlikely that this ice giant would be a small mound of grubby ice with a carrot in it by the morning .     which wisely decided not to fly again  was never claimed  and lived out the rest of its days as the carriage horse of an elderly lady .  what war did about this is unrecorded  it is pretty certain that he got another one .
