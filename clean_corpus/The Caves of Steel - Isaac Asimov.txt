    chapter     conversation with a commissioner   lije baley had just reached his desk when he became aware of r .  sammy watching him expectantly .   the dour lines of his long face hardened .     what do you want .         the boss wants you  lije .  right away .  soon as you come in .         all right .      r .  sammy stood there blankly .   baley said     i said  all right .  go away .      r .  sammy turned on his heel and left to go about his duties .  baley wondered irritably why those same duties couldn   t be done by a man .   he paused to examine the contents of his tobacco pouch and make a mental calculation .  at two pipefuls a day  he could stretch it to next quota day .   then he stepped out from behind his railing  he   d rated a railed corner two years ago  and walked the length of the common room .   simpson looked up from a merc pool file as he passed .     boss wants you  lije .         i know .  r .  sammy told me .      a closely coded tape reeled out of the merc pool   s vitals as the small instrument searched and analyzed its    memory    for the desired information stored in the tiny vibration patterns of the gleaming mercury surface within .      i   d kick r .  sammy   s behind if i weren   t afraid i   d break a leg     said simpson .     i saw vince barrett the other day .         oh .         he was looking for his job back .  or any job in the department .  the poor kid   s desperate  but what could i tell him .  r .  sammy   s doing his job and that   s all .  the kid has to work a delivery tread on the yeast farms now .  he was a bright boy  too .  everyone liked him .      baley shrugged and said in a manner stiffer than he intended or felt     it   s a thing we   re all living through .      the boss rated a private office .  it said julius enderby on the clouded glass .  nice letters .  carefully etched into the fabric of the glass .  underneath  it said commissioner of police  city of new york .   baley stepped in and said     you want to see me  commissioner .      enderby looked up .  he wore spectacles because his eyes were sensitive and couldn   t take the usual contact lenses .  it was only after one got used to the sight of them that one could take in the rest of the face  which was quite undistinguished .  baley had a strong notion that the commissioner valued his glasses for the personality they lent him and suspected that his eyeballs weren   t as sensitive as all that .   the commissioner looked definitely nervous .  he straightened his cuffs  leaned back  and said  too heartily     sit down  lije .  sit down .      baley sat down stiffly and waited .   enderby said           .             said baley            fine     echoed enderby .     just fine .      it had been a false start .   baley thought  something   s wrong with his face .   aloud  he said     commissioner  i wish you wouldn   t send r .  sammy out after me .         well  you know how i feel about those things  lije .  but he   s been put here and i   ve got to use him for something .         it   s uncomfortable  commissioner .  he tells me you want me and then he stands there .  you know what i mean .  i have to tell him to go or he just keeps on standing there .         oh  that   s my fault  lije .  i gave him the message to deliver and forgot to tell him specifically to get back to his job when he was through .      baley sighed .  the fine wrinkles about his intensely brown eyes grew more pronounced .     anyway  you wanted to see me .         yes  lije     said the commissioner     but not for anything easy .      he stood up turned away  and walked  to  the wall behind his desk .   the commissioner smiled .     i had this arranged specially last year  lije .  i don   t think i   ve showed it to you before .  come over here and take a look .  in the old days  all rooms had things like this .  they were called    windows .     did you know that .      baley knew that very well  having viewed many historical novels .      i   ve heard of them     he said .      come here .      baley squirmed a bit  but did as he was told .  there was something indecent about the exposure of the privacy of a room to the outside world .  sometimes the commissioner carried his affectation of medievalism to a rather foolish extreme .   like his glasses  baley thought .   that was it .  that was what made him look wrong .   baley said     pardon me  commissioner  but you   re wearing new glasses  aren   t you .      the commissioner stared at him in mild surprise  took off his glasses  looked at them and then at baley .  without his glasses  his round face seemed rounder and his chin a trifle more pronounced .  he looked vaguer  too  as his eyes failed to focus properly .   he said     yes .      he put his glasses back on his nose  then added with real anger     i broke my old ones three days ago .  what with one thing or another i wasn   t able to replace them till this morning .  lije  those three days were hell .         on account of the glasses .         and other things  too .  i   m getting to that .      he turned to the window and so did baley .  with mild shock  baley realized it was raining .  for a minute  he was lost in the spectacle of water dropping from the sky  while the commissioner exuded a kind of pride as though the phenomenon were a matter of his own arranging .      this is the third time this month i   ve watched it rain .  quite a sight  don   t you think .      against his will  baley had to admit to himself that it was impressive .   in  his forty two years he had rarely seen rain  or any of the phenomena at nature  for that matter .   he said     it always seems a waste for all that water to come down on the city .  it should restrict itself to the reservoirs .         lije     said the commissioner     you   re a modernist .  that   s your trouble .  in medieval times  people lived in the open .  i don   t mean on the farms only .  i mean in the cities  too .  even in new york .  when it rained  they didn   t think of it as waste .  they gloried in it .  they lived close to nature .  it   s healthier  better .  the troubles of modern life come from being divorced from nature .  read up on the coal century  sometimes .      baley had .  he had heard many people moaning about the invention of the atomic pile .  he moaned about it himself when things went wrong  or when he got tired .  moaning like that was a built in facet of human nature .  back in the coal century  people moaned about the invention of the steam engine .  in one of shakespeare   s plays  a character moaned about the invention of gunpowder .  a thousand years in the future  they   d be moaning about the invention of the positronic brain .   the hell with it .   he said  grimly     look  julius .      it wasn   t his habit to get friendly with the commissioner during office hours  however many    lijes    the commissioner threw at him  but something special seemed called for here .      look  julius  you   re talking about everything except what i came in here for  and it   s worrying me .  what is it .      the commissioner said     i   ll get to it  lije .  let me do it my way .  it   s  it   s trouble .         sure .  what isn   t on this planet .  more trouble with the r   s .         in a way  yes  lije .  i stand here and wonder how much more trouble the old world can take .     when i put in this window  i wasn   t just letting in the sky once in a while .  i let in the city .  i look at it and i wonder what will become of it in another century .      baley felt repelled by the other   s sentimentality  but he found himself staring outward in fascination .  even dimmed by the weather  the city was a tremendous thing to see .  the police department was in the upper levels of city hall  and city hall reached high .  from the commissioner   s window  the neighboring towers fell short and the tops were visible .  they were so many fingers  groping upward .  their walls were blank  featureless .  they were the outer shells of human hives .      in a way     said the commissioner     i   m sorry it   s raining .  we can   t see spacetown .      baley looked westward  but it was as the commissioner said .  the horizon closed down .  new york   s towers grew misty and came to an end against blank whiteness .      i know what spacetown is like     said baley .      i like the picture from here     said the commissioner .     it can just be made out in the gap between the two brunswick sectors .  low domes spread out .  it   s the difference between us and the spacers .  we reach high and crowd close .  with them  each family has a dome for itself .  one family  one house .  and land between each dome .  have you ever spoken to any of the spacers  lije .         a few times .  about a month ago  i spoke to one right here on your intercom     baley said  patiently .      yes  i remember .  but then  i   m just getting philosophical .  we and they .  different ways of life .      baley   s stomach was beginning to constrict a little .  the more devious the commissioner   s approach  the deadlier he thought might be the conclusion .   he said     all right .  but what   s so surprising about it .  you can   t spread eight billion people over earth in little domes .  they   ve got space on their worlds  so let them live their way .      the commissioner walked to his chair and sat down .  his eyes looked unblinkingly at baley  shrunken a bit by the concave lenses in his spectacles .  he said     not everyone is that tolerant about differences in culture .  either among us or among the spacers .         all right .  so what .         so three days ago  a spacer died .      now it was coming .  the corners of baley   s thin lips raised a trifle  but the effect upon his long  sad face was unnoticeable .  he said     too bad .  something contagious  i hope .  a virus .  a cold  perhaps .      the commissioner looked startled     what are you talking about .     baley didn   t care to explain .  the precision with which the spacers had bred disease out of their societies was well known .  the care with which they avoided  as far as possible  contact with disease riddled earthmen was even better known .  but then  sarcasm was lost on the commissioner .   baley said     i   m just talking .  what did he die of .     he turned back to the window .   the commissioner said     he died of a missing chest .  someone had used a blaster on him .      baley   s back grew rigid .  he said  without turning     what are you talking about .         i   m talking about murder     said the commissioner  softly .     you   re a plain clothes man .  you know what murder is .      and now baley turned .     but a spacer .  three days ago .         yes .         but who did it .  how .         the spacers say it was an earthman .         it can   t be .         why not .  you don   t like the spacers .  i don   t .  who on earth does .  someone didn   t like them a little too much  that   s all .         sure  but          there was the fire at the los angeles factories .  there was the berlin r smashing .  there were the riots in shanghai .         all right .         it all points to rising discontent .  maybe to some sort of organization .      baley said     commissioner  i don   t get this .  are you testing me for some reason .         what .     the commissioner looked honestly bewildered .   baley watched him .     three days ago a spacer was murdered and the spacers think the murderer is an earthman .  till now     his finger tapped the desk     nothing   s come out .  is that right .  commissioner  that   s unbelievable .  jehoshaphat  commissioner  a thing like this would blow new york off the face of the planet if it really happened .      the commissioner shook his head .     it   s not as simple as that .  look  lije  i   ve been out three days .  i   ve been in conference with the mayor .  i   ve been out to spacetown .  i   ve been down in washington  talking to the terrestrial bureau of investigation .         oh .  and what do the terries have to say .         they say it   s our baby .  it   s inside city limits .  spacetown is under new york jurisdiction .         but with extraterritorial rights .         i know .  i   m coming to that .     the commissioner   s eyes fell away from baley   s flinty stare .  he seemed to regard himself as having been suddenly demoted to the position of baley   s underling  and baley behaved as though he accepted the fact .      the spacers can run the show     said baley .      wait a minute  lije     pleaded the commissioner .     don   t rush me .  i   m trying to talk this over  friend to friend .  i want you to know my position .  i was there when the news broke .  i had an appointment with him  with roj nemennuh sarton .         the victim .         the victim .     the commissioner groaned .     five minutes more and i  myself  would have discovered the body .  what a shock that would have been .  as it was  it was brutal  brutal .  they met me and told me .  it started a three day nightmare  lije .  that on top of having everything blur on me and having no time to replace my glasses for days .  that won   t happen again  at least .  i   ve ordered three pairs .      baley considered the picture he conjured up of the event .  he could see the tall  fair figures of the spacers approaching the commissioner with the news and breaking it to him in their unvarnished emotionless way .  julius would remove his glasses and polish them .  inevitably  under the impact of the event  he would drop them  then look down at the broken remnants with a quiver of his soft  full lips .  baley was quite certain that  for five minutes anyway  the commissioner was much more disturbed over his glasses than over the murder .   the commissioner was saying     it   s a devil of a position .  as you say  the spacers have extraterritorial rights .  they can insist on their own investigation  make whatever report they wish to their home governments .  the outer worlds could use this as an excuse to pile on indemnity charges .  you know how that would sit with the population .         it would be political suicide for the white house to agree to pay .         and another kind of suicide not to pay .         you don   t have to draw me a picture     said baley .  he had been a small boy when the gleaming cruisers from outer space last sent down their soldiers into washington  new york  and moscow to collect what they claimed was theirs .      then you see .  pay or not pay  it   s trouble .  the only way out is to find the murderer on our own and hand him over to the spacers .  it   s up to us .         why not give it to the tbi .  even if it is our jurisdiction from a legalistic viewpoint  there   s the question of interstellar relations          the tbi won   t touch it .  this is hot and it   s in our lap .     for a moment  he lifted his head and gazed keenly at his subordinate .     and it   s not good  lije .  every one of us stands the chance of being out of a job .      baley said     replace us all .  nuts .  the trained men to do it with don   t exist .         r   s     said the commissioner .     they exist .         what .         r .  sammy is just a beginning .  he runs errands .  others can patrol the expressways .  damn it  man  i know the spacers better than you do  and i know what they   re doing .  there are r   s that can do your work and mine .  we can be declassified .  don   t think differently .  and at our age  to hit the labor pool  .  .  .      baley said  gruffly     all right .      the commissioner looked abashed .     sorry  lije .      baley nodded and tried not to think of his father .  the commissioner knew the story  of course .   baley said     when did all this replacement business come up .         look  you   re being naive  lije .  it   s been happening all along .  it   s been happening for twenty five years  ever since the spacers came .  you know that .  it   s just beginning to reach higher  that   s all .  if we muff this case  it   s a big  long step toward the point where we can stop looking forward to collecting our pension tab booklets .  on the other hand  lije  if we handle the matter well  it can shove that point far into the future .  and it would be a particular break for you .         for me .     said baley .      you   ll be the operative in charge  lije .         i don   t rate it  commissioner .  i   m a c    that   s all .         you want a c   rating  don   t you .      did he .  baley knew the privileges a c   rating carried .  a seat on the expressway in the rush hour  not just from ten to four .  higher up on the list of choice at the section kitchens .  maybe even a chance at a better apartment and a quota ticket to the solarium levels for jessie .      i want it     he said .     sure .  why wouldn   t i .  but what would i get if i couldn   t break the case .         why wouldn   t you break it  lije .     the commissioner wheedled .     you   re a good man .  you   re one of the best we have .         but there are half a dozen men with higher ratings in my department section .  why should they be passed over .      baley did not say out loud  though his bearing implied it strongly  that the commissioner did not move outside protocol in this fashion except in cases of wild emergency .   the commissioner folded his hands .     two reasons .  you   re not just another detective to me  lije .  we   re friends  too .  i   m not forgetting we were in college together .  sometimes it may look as though i have forgotten  but that   s the fault of rating .  i   m commissioner  and you know what that means .  but i   m still your friend and this is a tremendous chance for the right person .  i want you to have it .         that   s one reason     said baley  without warmth .      the second reason is that i think you   re my friend .  i need a favor .         what sort of favor .         i want you to take on a spacer partner in this deal .  that was the condition the spacers made .  they   ve agreed not to report the murder  they   ve agreed to leave the investigation in our hands .  in return  they insist one of their own agents be in on the deal  the whole deal .         it sounds like they don   t trust us altogether .         surely you see their point .  if this is mishandled  a number of them will be in trouble with their own governments .  i   ll give them the benefit of the doubt  lije .  i   m willing to believe they mean well .         i   m sure they do  commissioner .  that   s the trouble with them .     the commissioner looked blank at that  but went on .     are you willing to take on a spacer partner  lije .         you   re asking that as a favor .         yes  i   m asking you to take the job with all the conditions the spacers have set up .         i   ll take a spacer partner  commissioner .         thanks  lije .  he   ll have to live with you .         oh  now  hold on .         i know .  i know .  but you   ve got a large apartment  lije .  three rooms .  only one child .  you can put him up .  he   ll be no trouble .  no trouble at all .  and it   s necessary .         jessie won   t like it .  i know that .         you tell jessie     the commissioner was earnest  so earnest that his eyes seemed to bore holes through the glass discs blocking his stare     that if you do this for me  i   ll do what i can when this is all over to jump you a grade .  c    lije .  c   .         all right  commissioner  it   s a deal .      baley half rose from his chair  caught the look on enderby   s face  and sat down again .      there   s something else .      slowly  the commissioner nodded .     one more item .         which is .         the name of your partner .         what difference does that make .         the spacers     said the commissioner     have peculiar ways .  the partner they   re supplying isn   t  isn   t  .  .  .      baley   s eyes opened wide .     just a minute .         you   ve got to  lije .  you   ve got to .  there   s no way out .         stay at my apartment .  a thing like that .         as a friend  please .         no .  no .         lije  i can   t trust anyone else in this .  do i have to spell it out for you .  we   ve got to work with the spacers .  we   ve got to succeed  if we   re to keep the indemnity ships away from earth .  but we can   t succeed just any old way .  you   ll be partnered with one of their r   s .  if he breaks the case  if he can report that we   re incompetent  we   re ruined  anyway .  we  as a department .  you see that  don   t you .  so you   ve got a delicate job on your hands .  you   ve got to work with him  but see to it that you solve the case and not he .  understand .         you mean co operate with him     per cent  except that i cut his throat .  pat him on the back with a knife in my hand .         what else can we do .  there   s no other way out .      lije baley stood irresolute .     i don   t know what jessie will say .         i   ll talk to her  if you want me to .         no  commissioner .     he drew a deep  sighing breath .     what   s my partner   s name .         r .  daneel olivaw .      baley said  sadly     this isn   t a time for euphemism  commissioner .  i   m taking the job  so let   s use his full name .  robot daneel olivaw .          chapter     round trip on an expressway   there was the usual  entirely normal crowd on the expressway  the standees on the lower level and those with seat privileges above .  a continuous trickle of humanity filtered off the expressway  across the decelerating strips to localways or into the stationaries that led under arches or over bridges into the endless mazes of the city sections .  another trickle  just as continuous  worked inward from the other side  across the accelerating strips and onto the expressway .   there were the infinite lights  the luminous walls and ceilings that seemed to drip cool  even phosphorescence  the flashing advertisements screaming for attention  the harsh  steady gleam of the    lightworms    that directed   this way to jersey sections  follow arrows to east river shuttle  upper level for all ways to long island sections  most of all there was the noise that was inseparable from life  the sound of millions talking  laughing  coughing  calling  humming  breathing .   no directions anywhere to spacetown  thought baley .   he stepped from strip to strip with the ease of a lifetime   s practice .  children learned to    hop the strips    as soon as they learned to walk .  baley scarcely felt the jerk of acceleration as his velocity increased with each step .  he was not even aware that he leaned forward against the force .  in thirty seconds he had reached the final sixty mile an hour strip and could step aboard the railed and glassed in moving platform that was the expressway .   no directions to spacetown  he thought .   no need for directions .  if you   ve business there  you know the way .  if you don   t know the way  you   ve no business there .  when spacetown was first established some twenty five years earlier  there was a strong tendency to make a showplace out of it .  the hordes of the city herded in that direction .   the spacers put a stop to that .  politely  they were always polite   but without any compromise with tact  they put up a force barrier between themselves and the city .  they established a combination immigration service and customs inspection .  if you had business  you identified yourself  allowed yourself to be searched  and submitted to a medical examination and a routine disinfection .   it gave rise to dissatisfaction .  naturally .  more dissatisfaction than it deserved .  enough dissatisfaction to put a serious spoke in the program of modernization .  baley remembered the barrier riots .  he had been part of the mob that had suspended itself from the rails of the expressways  crowded onto the seats in disregard of rating privileges  run recklessly along and across the strips at the risk of a broken body  and remained just outside the spacetown barrier for two days  shouting slogans and destroying city property out of sheer frustration .   baley could still sing the chants of the time if he put his mind to it .  there was    man was born on mother earth  do you hear .     to an old folk tune with the gibberish refrain     hinky dinky parley voo .           man was born on mother earth  do you hear .   earth   s the world that gave him birth  do you hear .   spacer  get you off the face  of mother earth and into space .   dirty spacer  do you hear .        there were hundreds of verses .  a few were witty  most were stupid  many were obscene .  every one  however  ended with    dirty spacer  do you hear .     dirty  dirty .  it was the futile throwing back in the face of the spacers their most keenly felt insult  their insistence on considering the natives of earth as disgustingly diseased .   the spacers didn   t leave  of course .  it wasn   t even necessary for them to bring any of their offensive weapons into play .  earth   s outmoded fleet had long since learned that it was suicide to venture near any outer world ship .  earth planes that had ventured over the spacetown area in the very early days of its establishment had simply disappeared .  at the most  a shredded wing tip might tumble down to earth .   and no mob could be so maddened as to forget the effect of the subetheric hand disruptors used on earthmen in the wars of a century ago .   so the spacers sat behind their barrier  which itself was the product of their own advanced science  and that no method existed on earth of breaking .  they just waited stolidly on the other side of the barrier until the city quieted the mob with somno vapor and retch gas .  the below level penitentiaries rattled afterward with ringleaders  malcontents  and people who had been picked up simply because they were nearest at hand .  after a while they were all set free .   after a proper interval  the spacers eased their restrictions .  the barrier was removed and the city police entrusted with the protection of spacetown   s isolation .  most important of all  the medical examination was more unobtrusive .   now  thought baley  things might take a reverse trend .  if the spacers seriously thought that an earthman had entered spacetown and committed murder  the barrier might go up again .  it would be bad .  he lifted himself onto the expressway platform  made his way through the standees to the tight spiral ramp that led to the upper level  and there sat down .  he didn   t put his rating ticket in his hatband till they passed the last of the hudson sections .  a c   had no seat rights east of the hudson and west of long island  and although there was ample seating available at the moment  one of the way guards would have automatically ousted him .  people were increasingly petty about rating privileges and  in all honesty  baley lumped himself in with    people .      the air made the characteristic whistling noise as it frictioned off the curved windshields set up above the back of every seat .  it made talking a chore  but it was no bar to thinking when you were used to it .   most earthmen were medievalists in one way or another .  it was an easy thing to be when it meant looking back to a time when earth was the world and not just one of fifty .  the misfit one of fifty at that .  baley   s head snapped to the right at the sound of a female shriek .  a woman had dropped her handbag  he saw it for an instant  a pastel pink blob against the dull gray of the strips .  a passenger hurrying from the expressway must inadvertently have kicked it in the direction of deceleration and now the owner was whirling away from her property .   a corner of baley   s mouth quirked .  she might catch up with it  if she were clever enough to hurry to a strip that moved slower still and if other feet did not kick it this way or that .  he would never know whether she would or not .  the scene was half a mile to the rear  already .   chances were she wouldn   t .  it had been calculated that  on the average  something was dropped on the strips every three minutes somewhere in the city and not recovered .  the lost and found department was a huge proposition .  it was just one more complication of modern life .   baley thought  it was simpler once .  everything was simpler .  that   s what makes medievalists .   medievalism took different forms .  to the unimaginative julius enderby  it meant the adoption of archaisms .  spectacles .  windows .   to baley  it was a study of history .  particularly the history of folkways .   the city now .  new york city in which he lived and had his being .  larger than any city but los angeles .  more populous than any but shanghai .  it was only three centuries old .   to be sure  something had existed in the same geographic area before then that had been called new york city .  that primitive gathering of population had existed for three thousand years  not three hundred  but it hadn   t been a city .   there were no cities then .  there were just huddles of dwelling places large and small  open to the air .  they were something like the spacer   s domes  only much different  of course .  these huddles  the largest barely reached ten million in population and most never reached one million  were scattered all over earth by the thousands .  by modern standards  they had been completely inefficient  economically .  efficiency had been forced on earth with increasing population .  two billion people  three billion  even five billion could be supported by the planet by progressive lowering of the standard of living .  when the population reaches eight billion  however  semi starvation becomes too much like the real thing .  a radical change had to take place in man   s culture  particularly when it turned out that the outer worlds  which had merely been earth   s colonies a thousand years before  were tremendously serious in their immigration restrictions .   the radical change had been the gradual formation of the cities over a thousand years of earth   s history .  efficiency implied bigness .  even in medieval times that had been realized  perhaps unconsciously .  home industry gave way to factories and factories to continental industries .   think of the inefficiency of a hundred thousand houses for a hundred thousand families as compared with a hundred thousand unit section  a book film collection in each house as compared with a section film concentrate  independent video for each family as compared with video piping systems .   for that matter  take the simple folly of endless duplication of kitchens and bathrooms as compared with the thoroughly efficient diners and shower rooms made possible by city culture .   more and more the villages  towns  and    cities    of earth died and were swallowed by the cities .  even the early prospects of atomic war only slowed the trend .  with the invention of the force shield  the trend became a headlong race .   city culture meant optimum distribution of food  increasing utilization of yeasts and hydroponics .  new york city spread over two thousand square miles and at the last census its population was well over twenty million .  there were some eight hundred cities on earth  average population  ten million .   each city became a semiautonomous unit  economically all but self sufficient .  it could roof itself in  gird itself about  burrow itself under .  it became a steel cave  a tremendous  self contained cave of steel and concrete .   it could lay itself out scientifically .  at the center was the enormous complex of administrative offices .  in careful orientation to one another and to the whole were the large residential sections connected and interlaced by the expressway and the localways .  toward the outskirts were the factories  the hydroponic plants  the yeast culture vats  the power plants .  through all the melee were the water pipes and sewage ducts  schools  prisons and shops  power lines and communication beams .   there was no doubt about it  the city was the culmination of man   s mastery over the environment .  not space travel  not the fifty colonized worlds that were now so haughtily independent  but the city .   practically none of earth   s population lived outside the cities .  outside was the wilderness  the open sky that few men could face with anything like equanimity .  to be sure  the open space was necessary .  it held the water that men must have  the coal and the wood that were the ultimate raw materials for plastics and for the eternally growing yeast .   petroleum had long since gone  but oil rich strains of yeast were an adequate substitute .   the land between the cities still held the mines  and was still used to a larger extent than most men realized for growing food and grazing stock .  it was inefficient  but beef  pork  and grain always found a luxury market and could be used for export purposes .   but few humans were required to run the mines and ranches  to exploit the farms and pipe the water  and these supervised at long distance .  robots did the work better and required less .   robots .  that was the one huge irony .  it was on earth that the positronic brain was invented and on earth that robots had first been put to productive use .   not on the outer worlds .  of course  the outer worlds always acted as though robots had been born of their culture .   in a way  of course  the culmination of robot economy had taken place on the outer worlds .  here on earth  robots had always been restricted to the mines and farmlands .  only in the last quarter century  under the urgings of the spacers  had robots filtered their slow way into the cities .   the cities were good .  everyone but the medievalists knew that there was no substitute  no reasonable substitute .  the only trouble was that they wouldn   t stay good .  earth   s population was still rising .  some day  with all that the cities could do  the available calories per person would simply fall below basic subsistence level .   it was all the worse because of the existence of the spacers  the descendants of the early emigrants from earth  living in luxury on their under populated robot ridden worlds out in space .  they were coolly determined to keep the comfort that grew out of the emptiness of their worlds and for that purpose they kept their birth rate down and immigrants from teeming earth out .  and this    spacetown coming up .   a nudge at baley   s unconscious warned him that he was approaching the newark section .  if he stayed where he was much longer  he   d find himself speeding southwestward to the trenton section turning of the way  through the heart of the warm and musty odored yeast country .   it was a matter of timing .  it took so long to shinny down the ramp  so long to squirm through the grunting standees  so long to slip along the railing and out an opening  so long to hop across the decelerating strips .   when he was done  he was precisely at the off shooting of the proper stationary .  at no time did he time his steps consciously .  if he had  he would probably have missed .   baley found himself in unusual semi isolation .  only a policeman was with him inside the stationary and  except for the whirring of the expressway  there was an almost uncomfortable silence .   the policeman approached  and baley flashed his badge impatiently .  the policeman lifted his hand in permission to pass on .   the passage narrowed and curved sharply three or four times .  that was obviously purposeful .  mobs of earthmen couldn   t gather in it with any degree of comfort and direct charges were impossible .   baley was thankful that the arrangements were for him to meet his partner this side of spacetown .  he didn   t like the thought of a medical examination any better for its reputed politeness .   a spacer was standing at the point where a series of doors marked the openings to the open air and the domes of spacetown .  he was dressed in the earth fashion  trousers tight at the waist  loose at the ankle  and color striped down the seam of each leg .  he wore an ordinary textron shirt  open collar  seam zipped  and ruffled at the wrist  but he was a spacer .  there was something about the way he stood  the way he held his head  the calm and unemotional lines of his broad  high cheekboned face  the careful set of his short  bronze hair lying flatly backward and without a part  that marked him off from the native earthman .   baley approached woodenly and said in a monotone     i am plain clothes man elijah baley  police department  city of new york  rating c   .      he showed his credentials and went on     i have been instructed to meet r .  daneel olivaw at spacetown approachway .     he looked at his watch .     i am a little early .  may i request the announcement of my presence .      he felt more than a little cold inside .  he was used  after a fashion  to the earth model robots .  the spacer models would be different .  he had never met one  but there was nothing more common on earth than the horrid whispered stories about the tremendous and formidable robots that worked in superhuman fashion on the far off  glittering outer worlds .  he found himself gritting his teeth .   the spacer  who had listened politely  said     it will not be necessary .  i have been waiting for you .      baley   s hand went up automatically  then dropped .  so did his long chin  looking longer in the process .  he didn   t quite manage to say anything .  the words froze .   the spacer said     i shall introduce myself .  i am r .  daneel olivaw .         yes .  am i making a mistake .  i thought the first initial          quite so .  i am a robot .  were you not told .         i was told .     baley put a damp hand to his hair and smoothed it back unnecessarily .  then he held it out .     i   m sorry  mr .  olivaw .  i don   t know what i was thinking of .  good day .  i am elijah baley  your partner .         good .     the robot   s hand closed on his with a smoothly increasing pressure that reached a comfortably friendly peak  then declined .     yet i seem to detect disturbance .  may i ask that you be frank with me .  it is best to have as many relevant facts as possible in a relationship such as ours .  and it is customary on my world for partners to call one another by the familiar name .  i trust that that is not counter to your own customs .         it   s just  you see  that you don   t look like a robot     said baley  desperately .      and that disturbs you .         it shouldn   t  i suppose  da  daneel .  are they all like you on your world .         there are individual differences  elijah  as with men .         our own robots  .  .  .  well  you can tell they   re robots  you understand .  you look like a spacer .         oh  i see .  you expected a rather crude model and were surprised .  yet it is only logical that our people use a robot of pronounced humanoid characteristics in this case if we expected to avoid unpleasantness .  is that not so .      it was certainly so .  an obvious robot roaming the city would be in quick trouble .   baley said     yes .         then let us leave now  elijah .      they made their way back to the expressway .  r .  daneel caught the purpose of the accelerating strips and maneuvered along them with a quick proficiency .  baley  who had begun by moderating his speed  ended by hastening it in annoyance .   the robot kept pace .  he showed no awareness of any difficulty .  baley wondered if r .  daneel were not deliberately moving slower than he might .  he reached the endless cars of expressway and scrambled aboard with what amounted to outright recklessness .  the robot followed easily .   baley was red .  he swallowed twice and said     i   ll stay down here with you .         down here .     the robot  apparently oblivious to both the noise and the rhythmic swaying of the platform said     is my information wrong .  i was told that a rating of c   entitled one to a seat on the upper level under certain conditions .         you   re right .  i can go up there  but you can   t .         why can i not go up with you .         it takes a c    daneel .         i am aware of that .         you   re not a c   .     talking was difficult .  the hiss of frictioning air was louder on the less shielded lower level and baley was understandably anxious to keep his voice low .   r .  daneel said     why should i not be a c   .  i am your partner and  consequently  of equal rank .  i was given this .      from an inner shirt pocket he produced a rectangular credential card  quite genuine .  the name given was daneel olivaw  without the all important initial .  the rating was  c    .      come on up     said baley  woodenly .   baley looked straight ahead  once seated  angry with himself  very conscious of the robot sitting next to him .  he had been caught twice .  first he had not recognized r .  daneel as a robot  secondly  he had not guessed the logic that demanded r .  daneel be given c   rating .   the trouble was  of course  that he was not the plain clothes man of popular myth .  he was not incapable of surprise  imperturbable of appearance  infinite of adaptability  and lightning of mental grasp .  he had never supposed he was  but he had never regretted the lack before .   what made him regret it was that  to all appearances  r .  daneel olivaw was that very myth  embodied .   he had to be .  he was a robot .   baley began to find excuses for himself .  he was accustomed to the robots like r .  sammy at the office .  he had expected a creature with a skin of a hard and glossy plastic  nearly dead white in color .  he had expected an expression fixed at an unreal level of inane good humor .  he had expected jerky  faintly uncertain motions .   r .  daneel was none of it .   baley risked a quick side glance at the robot .  r .  daneel turned simultaneously to meet his eye and nod gravely .  his lips had moved naturally when he had spoken and did not simply remain parted as those of earth robots did .  there had been glimpses of an articulating tongue .   baley thought  why does he have to sit there so calmly .  this must be something completely new to him .  noise  lights  crowds .   baley got up  brushed past r .  daneel  and said     follow me .      off the expressway  down the decelerating strips .   baley thought  good lord  what do i tell jessie  anyway .   the coming of the robot had rattled that thought out of his head  but it was coming back with sickening urgency now that they were heading down the localway that led into the very jaws of the lower bronx section .   he said     this is all one building  you know  daneel  everything you see  the whole city .  twenty million people live in it .  the expressways go continuously  night and day  at sixty miles an hour .  there are two hundred and fifty miles of it altogether and hundreds of miles of localways .      any minute now  baley thought  i   ll be figuring out how many tons of yeast product new york eats per day and how many cubic feet of water we drink and how many megawatts of power the atomic piles deliver per hour .   daneel said     i was informed of this and other similar data in my briefing .      baley thought  well  that covers the food  drink  and power situation  too  i suppose .  why try to impress a robot .   they were at east    nd street and in not more than two hundred yards they would be at the elevator banks that fed those steel and concrete layers of apartments that included his own .   he was on the point of saying     this way     when he was stopped by a knot of people gathering outside the brilliantly lighted force door of one of the many retail departments that lined the ground levels solidly in this section .   he asked of the nearest person in an automatic tone of authority     what   s going on .      the man he addressed  who was standing on tiptoe  said     damned if i know .  i just got here .      someone else said  excitedly     they got those lousy r   s in there .  i think maybe they   ll throw them out here .  boy  i   d like to take them apart .      baley looked nervously at daneel  but  if the latter caught the significance of the words or even heard them  he did not show it by any outward sign .   baley plunged into the crowd .     let me through .  let me through .  police .      they made way .  baley caught words behind him .       .  .  .  take them apart .  nut by nut .  split them down the seams slowlike  .  .  .     and someone else laughed .   baley turned a little cold .  the city was the acme of efficiency  but it made demands of its inhabitants .  it asked them to live in a tight routine and order their lives under a strict and scientific control .  occasionally  built up inhibitions exploded .   he remembered the barrier riots .   reasons for anti robot rioting certainly existed .  men who found themselves faced with the prospect of the desperate minimum involved in declassification  after half a lifetime of effort  could not decide cold bloodedly that individual robots were not to blame .  individual robots could at least be struck at .   one could not strike at something called    governmental policy    or at a slogan like    higher production with robot labor .      the government called it growing pains .  it shook its collective head sorrowfully and assured everyone that after a necessary period of adjustment  a new and better life would exist for all .   but the medievalist movement expanded along with the declassification process .  men grew desperate and the border between bitter frustration and wild destruction is sometimes easily crossed .   at this moment  minutes could be separating the pent up hostility of the crowd from a flashing orgy of blood and smash .   baley writhed his way desperately to the force door .       chapter     incident at a shoe counter   the interior of the store was emptier than the street outside .  the manager  with commendable foresight  had thrown the force door early in the game  preventing potential troublemakers from entering .  it also kept the principles in the argument from leaving  but that was minor .   baley got through the force door by using his officer   s neutralizer .  unexpectedly  he found r .  daneel still behind him .  the robot was pocketing a neutralizer of his own  a slim one  smaller and neater than the standard police model .   the manager ran to them instantly  talking loudly .     officers  my clerks have been assigned me by the city .  i am perfectly within my rights .      there were three robots standing rodlike at the rear of the department .  six humans were standing near the force door .  they were all women .      all right  now     said baley  crisply .     what   s going on .  what   s all the fuss about .      one of the women said  shrilly     i came in for shoes .  why can   t i have a decent clerk .  ain   t i respectable .     her clothing  especially her hat  were just sufficiently extreme to make it more than a rhetorical question .  the angry flush that covered her face masked imperfectly her overdone makeup .   the manager said     i   ll wait on her myself if i have to  but i can   t wait on all of them  officer .  there   s nothing wrong with my men .  they   re registered clerks .  i have their spec charts and guarantee slips          spec charts     screamed the woman .  she laughed shrilly  turning to the rest .     listen to him .  he calls them men .  what   s the matter with you anyway .  they ain   t men .  they   re ro bots .     she stretched out the syllables .     and i tell you what they do  in case you don   t know .  they steal jobs from men .  that   s why the government always protects them .  they work for nothin    and  on account o    that  families gotta live out in the barracks and eat raw yeast mush .  decent hard working families .  we   d smash up all the ro bots  if i was boss .  i tell you that .      the others talked confusedly and there was always the growing rumble from the crowd just beyond the force door .   baley was conscious  brutally conscious  of r .  daneel olivaw standing at his elbow .  he looked at the clerks .  they were earthmade  and even on that scale  relatively inexpensive models .  they were just robots made to know a few simple things .  they would know all the style numbers  their prices  the sizes available in each .  they could keep track of stock fluctuations  probably better than humans could  since they would have no outside interests .  they could compute the proper orders for the next week .  they could measure the customer   s foot .   in themselves  harmless .  as a group  incredibly dangerous .   baley could sympathize with the woman more deeply than he would have believed possible the day before .  no  two hours before .  he could feel r .  daneel   s nearness and he wondered if r .  daneel could not replace an ordinary plain clothes man  c    .  he could see the barracks  as he thought that .  he could taste the yeast mush .  he could remember his father .   his father had been a nuclear physicist  with a rating that had put him in the top percentile of the city .  there had been an accident at the power plant and his father had borne the blame .  he had been declassified .  baley did not know the details  it had happened when he was a year old .   but he remembered the barracks of his childhood  the grinding communal existence just this side of the edge of bearability .  he remembered his mother not at all  she had not survived long .  his father he recalled well  a sodden man  morose and lost  speaking sometimes of the past in hoarse  broken sentences .   his father died  still declassified  when lije was eight .  young baley and his two older sisters moved into the section orphanage .  children   s level  they called it .  his mother   s brother  uncle boris  was himself too poor to prevent that .   so it continued hard .  and it was hard going through school  with no father derived status privileges to smooth the way .   and now he had to stand in the middle of a growing riot and beat down men and women who  after all  only feared declassification for themselves and those they loved  as he himself did .   tonelessly  he said to the woman who had already spoken     let   s not have any trouble  lady .  the clerks aren   t doing you any harm .         sure they ain   t done me no harm     sopranoed the woman .     they ain   t gonna  either .  think i   ll let their cold  greasy fingers touch me .  i came in here expecting to get treated like a human being .  i   m a citizen .  i got a right to have human beings wait on me .  and listen  i got two kids waiting for supper .  they can   t go to the section kitchen without me  like they was orphans .  i gotta get out of here .         well  now     said baley  feeling his temper slipping     if you had let yourself be waited on  you   d have been out of here by now .  you   re just making trouble for nothing .  come on now .         well .     the woman registered shock .     maybe you think you can talk to me like i was dirt .  maybe it   s time the guv   min    reelized robots ain   t the only things on earth .  i   m a hard working woman and i   ve got rights .     she went on and on and on .   baley felt harassed and caught .  the situation was out of hand .  even if the woman would consent to be waited on  the waiting crowd was ugly enough for anything .   there must be a hundred crammed outside the display window now .  in the few minutes since the plain clothes men had entered the store  the crowd had doubled .      what is the usual procedure in such a case .     asked r .  daneel olivaw  suddenly .   baley nearly jumped .  he said     this is an unusual case in the first place .         what is the law .         the r   s have been duly assigned here .  they   re registered clerks .  there   s nothing illegal about that .      they were speaking in whispers .  baley tried to look official and threatening .  olivaw   s expression  as always  meant nothing at all .      in that case     said r .  daneel     order the woman to let herself be waited on or to leave .      baley lifted a corner of his lip briefly .     it   s a mob we have to deal with  not a woman .  there   s nothing to do but call a riot squad .         it should not be necessary for citizens to require more than one officer of the law to direct what should be done     said daneel .   he turned his broad face to the store manager .     open the force door  sir .      baley   s arm shot forward to seize r .  daneel   s shoulder  swing him about .  he arrested the motion .  if  at this moment  two law men quarreled openly  it would mean the end of all chance for a peaceful solution .   the manager protested  looked at baley .  baley did not meet his eye .   r .  daneel said  unmoved     i order you with the authority of the law .      the manager bleated     i   ll hold the city responsible for any damage to the goods or fixtures .  i serve notice that i   m doing this under orders .      the barrier went down  men and women crowded in .  there was a happy roar from them .  they sensed victory .   baley had heard of similar riots .  he had even witnessed one .  he had seen robots being lifted by a dozen hands  their heavy unresisting bodies carried backward from straining arm to straining arm .  men yanked and twisted at the metal mimicry of men .  they used hammers  force knives  needle guns .  they finally reduced the miserable objects to shredded metal and wire .  expensive positronic brains  the most intricate creation of the human mind  were thrown from hand to hand like footballs and mashed to uselessness in a trifle of time .   then  with the genius of destruction so merrily let loose  the mobs turned on anything else that could be taken apart .   the robot clerks could have no knowledge of any of this  but they squealed as the crowd flooded inward and lifted their arms before their faces as though in a primitive effort at hiding .  the woman who had started the fuss  frightened at seeing it grow suddenly so far beyond what she had expected  gasped     here  now .  here  now .      her hat was shoved down over her face and her voice became only a meaningless shrillness .   the manager was shrieking     stop them  officer .  stop them .      r .  daneel spoke .  without apparent effort  his voice was suddenly decibels higher than a human   s voice had a right to be .  of course  thought baley for the tenth time  he   s not    r .  daneel said     the next man who moves will be shot .      someone well in the back yelled     get him .      but for a moment  no one moved .   r .  daneel stepped nimbly upon a chair and from that to the top of a transtex display case .  the colored fluorescence gleaming through the slits of polarized molecular film turned his cool  smooth face into something unearthly .   unearthly  thought baley .   the tableau held as r .  daneel waited  a quietly formidable person .  r .  daneel said crisply     you are saying  this man is holding a neuronic whip  or a tickler .  if we all rush forward  we will bear him down and at most one or two of us will be hurt and even they will recover .  meanwhile  we will do just as we wish and to space with law and order .      his voice was neither harsh nor angry  but it carried authority .  it had the tone of confident command .  he went on     you are mistaken .  what i hold is not a neuronic whip  nor is it a tickler .  it is a blaster and very deadly .  i will use it and i will not aim over your heads .  i will kill many of you before you seize me  perhaps most of you .  i am serious .  i look serious  do i not .      there was motion at the outskirts  but the crowd no longer grew .  if newcomers still stopped out of curiosity  others were hurrying away .  those nearest r .  daneel were holding their breath  trying desperately not to sway forward in response to the mass pressure of the bodies behind them .   the woman with the hat broke the spell .  in a sudden whirlpool of sobbing  she yelled     he   s gonna kill us .  i ain   t done nothing .  oh  lemme outta here .      she turned  but faced an immovable wall of crammed men and women .  she sank to her knees .  the backward motion in the silent crowd grew more pronounced .   r .  daneel jumped down from the display counter and said     i will now walk to the door .  i will shoot the man or woman who touches me .   when i reach the door  i will shoot any man or woman who is not moving about his business .  this woman here          no  no     yelled the woman with the hat     i tell ya i didn   t do nothing .  i didn   t mean no harm .  i don   t want no shoes .  i just wanta go home .         this woman here     went on daneel     will remain .  she will be waited on .      he stepped forward .   the mob faced him dumbly .  baley closed his eyes .  it wasn   t his fault  he thought desperately .  there   ll be murder done and the worst mess in the world  but they forced a robot on me as partner .  they gave him equal status .   it wouldn   t do .  he didn   t believe himself .  he might have stopped r .  daneel at the start .  he might at any moment have put in the call for a squad car .  he had let r .  daneel take responsibility  instead  and had felt a cowardly relief .  when he tried to tell himself that r .  daneel   s personality simply dominated the situation  he was filled with a sudden self loathing .  a robot dominating .   there was no unusual noise  no shouting and cursing  no groans  no yells .  he opened his eyes .   they were dispersing .   the manager of the store was cooling down  adjusting his twisted jacket  smoothing his hair  muttering angry threats at the vanishing crowd .   the smooth  fading whistle of a squad car came to a halt just outside .  baley thought  sure  when it   s all over .   the manager plucked his sleeve .     let   s have no more trouble  officer .      baley said     there won   t be any trouble .      it was easy to get rid of the squad car police .  they had come in response to reports of a crowd in the street .  they knew no details and could see for themselves that the street was clear .  r .  daneel stepped aside and showed no sign of interest as baley explained to the men in the squad car  minimizing the event and completely burying r .  daneel   s part in it .   afterward  he pulled r .  daneel to one side  against the steel and concrete of one of the building shafts .      listen     he said     i   m not trying to steal your show  you understand .         steal my show .  is it one of your earth idioms .         i didn   t report your part in this .         i do not know all your customs .  on my world  a complete report is usual  but perhaps it is not so on your world .  in any case  civil rebellion was averted .  that is the important thing  is it not .         is it .  now you look here .     baley tried to sound as forceful as possible under the necessity of speaking in an angry whisper .     don   t you ever do it again .         never again insist on the observance of law .  if i am not to do that  what then is my purpose .         don   t ever threaten a human being with a blaster again .         i would not have fired under any circumstances  elijah  as you know very well .  i am incapable of hurting a human .  but  as you see  i did not have to fire .  i did not expect to have to .         that was the purest luck  your not having to fire .  don   t take that kind of chance again .  i could have pulled the grandstand stunt you did          grandstand stunt .  what is that .         never mind .  get the sense from what i   m saying .  i could have pulled a blaster on the crowd myself .  i had the blaster to do it with .  but it isn   t the kind of gamble i am justified in taking  or you  either .  it was safer to call squad cars to the scene than to try one man heroics .      r daneel considered .  he shook his head .     i think you are wrong  partner elijah .  my briefing on human characteristics here among the people of earth includes the information that  unlike the men of the outer worlds  they are trained from birth to accept authority .  apparently this is the result of your way of living .  one man  representing authority firmly enough  was quite sufficient  as i proved .  your own desire for a squad car was only an expression  really  of your almost instinctive wish for superior authority to take responsibility out of your hands .  on my own world  i admit that what i did would have been most unjustified .      baley   s long face was red with anger .     if they had recognized you as a robot          i was sure they wouldn   t .         in any case  remember that you are a robot .  nothing more than a robot .  just a robot .  like those clerks in the shoe store .         but this is obvious .         and you   re not human .     baley felt himself being driven into cruelty against his will .   r .  daneel seemed to consider that .  he said     the division between human and robot is perhaps not as significant as that between intelligence and non intelligence .         maybe on your world     said baley     but not on earth .      he looked at his watch and could scarcely make out that he was an hour and a quarter late .  his throat was dry and raw with the thought that r .  daneel had won the first round  had won when he himself had stood by helpless .   he thought of the youngster  vince barrett  the teenager whom r .  sammy had replaced .  and of himself  elijah baley  whom r .  daneel could replace .  jehoshaphat  at least his father had been thrown out because of an accident that had done damage  that had killed people .  maybe it was his fault  baley didn   t know .  suppose he had been eased out to make room for a mechanical physicist .  just for that .  for no other reason .  nothing he could do about it .   he said  curtly     let   s go now .  i   ve got to get you home .      r .  daneel said     you see  it is not proper to make any distinction of lesser meaning than the fact of intel       baley   s voice rose .     all right .  the subject is closed .  jessie is waiting for us .     he walked in the direction of the nearest intrasection communo tube .     i   d better call and tell her we   re on our way up .         jessie .         my wife .      jehoshaphat  thought baley  i   m in a fine mood to face jessie .       chapter     introduction to a family   it had been her name that had first made elijah baley really conscious of jessie .  he had met her at the section christmas party back in        over a bowl of punch .  he had just finished his schooling  just taken his first job with the city  just moved into the section .  he was living in one of the bachelor alcoves of common room    a .  not bad for a bachelor alcove .   she was handing out the punch .     i   m jessie     she said .     jessie navodny .  i don   t know you .         baley     he said     lije baley .  i   ve just moved into the section .     he took his glass of punch and smiled mechanically .  she impressed him as a cheerful and friendly person  so he stayed near her .  he was new and it is a lonely feeling to be at a party where you find yourself watching people standing about in cliques of which you aren   t a part .  later  when enough alcohol had trickled down throats  it might be better .   meanwhile  he remained at the punch bowl  watching the folks come and go and sipping thoughtfully .      i helped make the punch .     the girl   s voice broke in upon him .     i can guarantee it .  do you want more .      baley realized his little glass was empty .  he smiled and said     yes .     the girl   s face was oval and not precisely pretty  mostly because of a slightly overlarge nose .  her dress was demure and she wore her light brown hair in a series of ringlets over her forehead .   she joined him in the next punch and he felt better .      jessie     he said  feeling the name with his tongue .     it   s nice .  do you mind if i use it when i   m talking to you .         certainly .  if you want to .  do you know what it   s short for .         jessica .         you   ll never guess .         i can   t think of anything else .      she laughed and said archly     my full name is jezebel .      that was when his interest flared .  he put his punch glass down and said  intently     no  really .         honestly .  i   m not kidding .  jezebel .  it   s my real for true name on all my records .  my parents liked the sound of it .      she was quite proud of it  even though there was never a less likely jezebel in the world .   baley said  seriously     my name is elijah  you know .  my full name  i mean .      it didn   t register with her .   he said     elijah was jezebel   s great enemy .         he was .         why  sure .  in the bible .         oh .  i didn   t know that .  now isn   t that funny .  i hope that doesn   t mean you   ll have to be my enemy in real life .      from the very beginning there was no question of that .  it was the coincidence of names at first that made her more than just a pleasant girl at the punch bowl .  but afterward he had grown to find her cheerful  tender hearted  and  finally  even pretty .  he appreciated her cheerfulness particularly .  his own sardonic view of life needed the antidote .   but jessie never seemed to mind his long grave face .      oh  goodness     she said     what if you do look like an awful lemon .  i know you   re not really  and i guess if you were always grinning away like clockwork  the way i do  we   d just explode when we got together .  you stay the way you are  lije  and keep me from floating away .      and she kept lije baley from sinking down .  he applied for a small couples apartment and got a contingent admission pending marriage .   he showed it to her and said     will you fix it so i can get out of bachelor   s  jessie .  i don   t like it there .      maybe it wasn   t the most romantic proposal in the world  but jessie liked it .   baley could only remember one occasion on which jessie   s habitual cheer deserted her completely and that  too  had involved her name .  it was in their first year of marriage  and their baby had not yet come .   in fact  it had been the very month in which bentley was conceived .    their i . q .  rating  genetic values status  and his position in the department entitled him to two children  of which the first might be conceived during the first year .   maybe  as baley thought back upon it  bentley   s beginnings might explain part of her unusual skittishness .  jessie had been drooping a bit because of baley   s consistent overtime .   she said     it   s embarrassing to eat alone at the kitchen every night .      baley was tired and out of sorts .  he said     why should it be .  you can meet some nice single fellows there .      and of course she promptly fired up .     do you think i can   t make an impression on them  lije baley .      maybe it was just because he was tired  maybe because julius enderby  a classmate of his  had moved up another notch on the c scale rating while he himself had not .  maybe it was simply because he was a little tired of having her try to act up to the name she bore when she was nothing of the sort and never could be anything of the sort .   in any case  he said bitingly     i suppose you can  but i don   t think you   ll try .  i wish you   d forget your name and be yourself .         i   ll be just what i please .         trying to be jezebel won   t get you anywhere .  if you must know the truth  the name doesn   t mean what you think  anyway .  the jezebel of the bible was a faithful wife and a good one according to her lights .  she had no lovers that we know of  cut no high jinks  and took no moral liberties at all .      jessie stared angrily at him .     that isn   t so .  i   ve heard the phrase     a painted jezebel .     i know what that means .         maybe you think you do  but listen .  after jezebel   s husband  king ahab died  her son  jehoram  became king .  one of the captains of his army  jehu  rebelled against him and assassinated him .  jehu then rode to jezreel where the old queen mother  jezebel  was residing .  jezebel heard of his coming and knew that he could only mean to kill her .  in her pride and courage  she painted her face and dressed herself in her best clothes so that she could meet him as a haughty and defiant queen .  he had her thrown from the window of the palace and killed  but she made a good end  according to my notions .  and that   s what people refer to when they speak of    a painted jezebel     whether they know it or not .      the next evening jessie said in a small voice     i   ve been reading the bible  lije .         what .     for a moment  baley was honestly bewildered .      the parts about jezebel .         oh .  jessie  i   m sorry if i hurt your feelings .  i was being childish .         no .  no .     she pushed his hand from her waist and sat on the couch  cool and upright  with a definite space between them .     it   s good to know the truth .  i don   t want to be fooled by not knowing .  so i read about her .  she was a wicked woman  lije .         well  her enemies wrote those chapters .  we don   t know her side .         she killed all the prophets of the lord she could lay her hands on .         so they say she did .     baley felt about in his pocket for a stick of chewing gum .   in later years he abandoned that habit because jessie said that with his long face and sad  brown eyes  it made him look like an old cow stuck with an unpleasant wad of grass it couldn   t swallow and wouldn   t spit out .   he said     if you want her side  i could think of some arguments for you .  she valued the religion of her ancestors who had been in the land long before the hebrews came .  the hebrews had their own god  and  what   s more  it was an exclusive god .  they weren   t content to worship him themselves  they wanted everyone in reach to worship him as well .      jezebel was a conservative  sticking to the old beliefs against the new ones .  after all  if the new beliefs had a higher moral content  the old ones were more emotionally satisfying .  the fact that she killed priests just marks her as a child of her times .  it was the usual method of proselytization in those days .  if you read i kings  you must remember that elijah  my namesake this time  had a contest with     prophets of baal to see which could bring down fire from heaven .  elijah won and promptly ordered the crowd of onlookers to kill the     baalites .  and they did .      jessie bit her lip .     what about naboth   s vineyard  lije .  here was this naboth not bothering anybody  except that he refused to sell the king his vineyard .  so jezebel arranged to have people perjure themselves and say that naboth had committed blasphemy or something .         he was supposed to have blasphemed god and the king     said baley .      yes .  so they confiscated his property after they executed him .         that was wrong .  of course  in modern times  naboth would have been handled quite easily .  if the city wanted his property or even if one of the medieval nations had wanted his property  the courts would have ordered him off  had him removed by force if necessary  and paid him whatever they considered a fair price .  king ahab didn   t have that way out .  still  jezebel   s solution was wrong .  the only excuse for her is that ahab was sick and unhappy over the situation and she felt that her love for her husband came ahead of naboth   s welfare .  i keep telling you  she was the model of a faithful wi       jessie flung herself away from him  red faced and angry .     i think you   re mean and spiteful .      he looked at her with complete dismay .     what have i done .  what   s the matter with you .      she left the apartment without answering and spent the evening and half the night at the subetheric video levels  traveling petulantly from showing to showing and using up a two month supply of her quota allowance  and her husband   s  to boot  .   when she came back to a still wakeful lije baley  she had nothing further to say to him .   it occurred to baley later  much later  that he had utterly smashed an important part of jessie   s life .  her name had signified something intriguingly wicked to her .  it was a delightful makeweight for her prim  over respectable past .  it gave her an aroma of licentiousness  and she adored that .   but it was gone .  she never mentioned her full name again  not to lije  not to her friends  and maybe  for all baley knew  not even to herself .  she was jessie and took to signing her name so .   as the days passed she began speaking to him again  and after a week or so their relationship was on the old footing and  with all subsequent quarrels  nothing ever reached that one bad spot of intensity .  only once was there even an indirect reference to the matter .  it was in her eighth month of pregnancy .  she had left her own position as dietitian   s assistant in section kitchen a    and with unaccustomed time on her hands was amusing herself in speculation and preparation for the baby   s birth .   she said  one evening     what about bentley .         pardon me  dear .     said baley  looking up from a sheaf of work he had brought home with him .   with an additional mouth soon to feed and jessie   s pay stopped and his own promotions to the non clerical levels as far off  seemingly  as ever  extra work was necessary .       i mean if the baby   s a boy .  what about bentley as a name .      baley pulled down the corners of his mouth .     bentley baley .  don   t you think the names are too similar .         i don   t know .  it has a swing  i think .  besides  the child can always pick out a middle name to suit himself when he gets older .         well  it   s all right with me .         are you sure .  i mean  .  .  .  maybe you wanted him to be named elijah .         and be called junior .  i don   t think that   s a good idea .  he can name his son elijah  if he wants to .      then jessie said     there   s just one thing     and stopped .  after an interval  he looked up .     what one thing .      she did not quite meet his eye  but she said  forcefully enough     bentley isn   t a bible name  is it .         no     said baley     i   m quite sure it isn   t .         all right  then .  i don   t want any bible names .      and that was the only harking back that took place from that time to the day when elijah baley was coming home with robot daneel olivaw  when he had been married for more than eighteen years and when his son bentley baley  middle name still unclose  was past sixteen .   baley paused before the large double door on which there glowed in large letters personal men .  in smaller letters were written subsections  a  e .  in still smaller letters  just above the key slit  it stated        in case of loss of key  communicate at once with           .        a man inched past them  inserted an aluminum sliver into the key slit  and walked in .  he closed the door behind him  making no attempt to hold it open for baley .  had he done so  baley would have been seriously offended .  by strong custom men disregarded one another   s presence entirely either within or just outside the personals .  baley remembered one of the more interesting marital confidences to have been jessie   s telling him that the situation was quite different at women   s personals .   she was always saying     i met josephine greely at personal and she said  .  .  .      it was one of the penalties of civic advancement that when the baleys were granted permission for the activation of the small washbowl in their bedroom  jessie   s social life suffered .   baley said  without completely masking his embarrassment     please wait out here  daneel .         do you intend washing .     asked r .  daneel .   baley squirmed and thought  damned robot .  if they were briefing him on everything under steel  why didn   t they teach him manners .  i   ll be responsible if he ever says anything like this to anyone else .  he said     i   ll shower .  it gets crowded evenings .  i   ll lose time then .  if i get it done now we   ll have the whole evening before us .      r .  daneel   s face maintained its repose .     is it part of the social custom that i wait outside .      baley   s embarrassment deepened .     why need you go in for  for no purpose .         oh  i understand you .  yes  of course .  nevertheless  elijah  my hands grow dirty  too  and i will wash them .      he indicated his palms  holding them out before him .  they were pink and plump  with the proper creases .  they bore every mark of excellent and meticulous workmanship and were as clean as need be .  baley said     we have a washbasin in the apartment  you know .     he said it casually .  snobbery would be lost on a robot .      thank you for your kindness .  on the whole  however  i think it would be preferable to make use of this place .  if i am to live with you men of earth  it is best that i adopt as many of your customs and attitudes as i can .         come on in  then .      the bright cheerfulness of the interior was a sharp contrast to the busy utilitarianism of most of the rest of the city  but this time the effect was lost on baley   s consciousness .   he whispered to daneel     i may take up to half an hour or so .  wait for me .     he started away  then returned to add     and listen  don   t talk to anybody and don   t look at anybody .  not a word  not a glance .  it   s a custom .      he looked hurriedly about to make certain that his own small conversation had not been noted  was not being met by shocked glances .  nobody  fortunately  was in the antecorridor  and after all it was only the antecorridor .   he hurried down it  feeling vaguely dirty  past the common chambers to the private stalls .  it had been five years now since he had been awarded one  large enough to contain a shower  a small laundry  and other necessities .  it even had a small projector that could be keyed in for the news films .      a home away from home     he had joked when it was first made available to him .  but now  he often wondered how he would bear the adjustment back to the more spartan existence of the common chambers if his stall privileges were ever canceled .   he pressed the button that activated the laundry and the smooth face of the meter lighted .   r .  daneel was waiting patiently when baley returned with a scrubbed body  clean underwear  a freshened shirt  and  generally  a feeling of greater comfort .      no trouble .     baley asked  when they were well outside the door and able to talk .      none at all  elijah     said r .  daneel .   jessie was at the door  smiling nervously .  baley kissed her .      jessie     he mumbled     this is my new partner  daneel olivaw .      jessie held out a hand  which r .  daneel took and released .  she turned to her husband  then looked timidly at r .  daneel .   she said     won   t you sit down  mr .  olivaw .  i must talk to my husband on family matters .  it   ll take just a minute .  i hope you won   t mind .      her hand was on baley   s sleeve .  he followed her into the next room .   she said  in a hurried whisper     you aren   t hurt  are you .  i   ve been so worried ever since the broadcast .         what broadcast .         it came through nearly an hour ago .  about the riot at the shoe counter .  they said two plain clothes men stopped it .  i knew you were coming home with a partner and this was right in our subsection and right when you were coming home and i thought they were making it better than it was and you were          please  jessie .  you see i   m perfectly all right .      jessie caught hold of herself with an effort .  she said  shakily     your partner isn   t from your division  is he .         no     replied baley miserably .     he   s  a complete stranger .         how do i treat him .         like anybody else .  he   s just my partner  that   s all .      he said it so unconvincingly  that jessie   s quick eyes narrowed .     what   s wrong .         nothing .  come  let   s go back into the living room .  it   ll begin to look queer .      lije baley felt a little uncertain about the apartment now .  until this very moment  he had felt no qualms .  in fact  he had always been proud of it .  it had three large rooms  the living room  for instance  was an ample fifteen feet by eighteen .  there was a closet in each room .  one of the main ventilation ducts passed directly by .  it meant a little rumbling noise on rare occasions  but  on the other hand  assured first rate temperature control and well conditioned air .  nor was it too far from either personal  which was a prime convenience .   but with the creature from worlds beyond space sitting in the midst of it  baley was suddenly uncertain .  the apartment seemed mean and cramped .   jessie said  with a gaiety that was slightly synthetic     have you and mr .  olivaw eaten  lije .         as a matter of fact     said baley  quickly     daneel will not be eating with us .  i   ll eat  though .      jessie accepted the situation without trouble .  with food supplies so narrowly controlled and rationing tighter than ever  it was good form to refuse another   s hospitality .   she said     i hope you won   t mind our eating  mr .  olivaw .  lije  bentley  and i generally eat at the community kitchen .  it   s much more convenient and there   s more variety  you see  and just between you and me  bigger helpings  too .  but then  lije and i do have permission to eat in our apartment three times a week if we want to  lije is quite successful at the bureau and we have very nice status  and i thought that just for this occasion  if you wanted to join us  we would have a little private feast of our own  though i do think that people who overdo their privacy privileges are just a bit anti social  you know .      r .  daneel listened politely .   baley said  with an undercover    shushing    wiggle of his fingers     jessie  i   m hungry .      r .  daneel said     would i be breaking a custom  mrs .  baley  if i addressed you by your given name .         why  no  of course not .     jessie folded a table out of the wall and plugged the plate warmer into the central depression on the table top .     you just go right ahead and call me jessie all you feel like  uh  daneel .     she giggled .   baley felt savage .  the situation was getting rapidly more uncomfortable .  jessie thought r .  daneel a man .  the thing would be someone to boast of and talk about in women   s personal .  he was good looking in a wooden way  too  and jessie was pleased with his deference .  anyone could see that .   baley wondered about r .  daneel   s impression of jessie .  she hadn   t changed much in eighteen years  or at least not to lije baley .  she was heavier  of course  and her figure had lost much of its youthful vigor .  there were lines at the angles of the mouth and a trace of heaviness about her cheeks .  her hair was more conservatively styled and a dimmer brown than it had once been .   but that   s all beside the point  thought baley  somberly .  on the outer worlds the women were tall and as slim and regal as the men .  or  at least  the book films had them so and that must be the kind of women r .  daneel was used to .   but r .  daneel seemed quite unperturbed by jessie   s conversation  her appearance  or her appropriation of his name .  he said     are you sure that is proper .  the name  jessie  seems to be a diminutive .  perhaps its use is restricted to members of your immediate circle and i would be more proper if i used your full given name .      jessie  who was breaking open the insulating wrapper surrounding the dinner ration  bent her head over the task in sudden concentration .      just jessie     she said  tightly .     everyone calls me that .  there   s nothing else .         very well  jessie .      the door opened and a youngster entered cautiously .  his eyes found r .  daneel almost at once .      dad .     said the boy  uncertainly .      my son  bentley     said baley  in a low voice .     this is mr .  olivaw  ben .         he   s your partner  huh  dad .  how d   ya do  mr .  olivaw .     ben   s eyes grew large and luminous .     say  dad  what happened down in the shoe place .  the newscast said          don   t ask any questions now  ben     interposed baley sharply .   bentley   s face fell and he looked toward his mother  who motioned him to a seat .      did you do what i told you  bentley .     she asked  when he sat down .  her hands moved caressingly over his hair .  it was as dark as his father   s and he was going to have his father   s height  but all the rest of him was hers .  he had jessie   s oval face  her hazel eyes  her light hearted way of looking at life .      sure  mom     said bentley  hitching himself forward a bit to look into the double dish from which savory vapors were already rising .      what we got to eat .  not zymoveal again  mom .  huh  mom .         there   s nothing wrong with zymoveal     said jessie  her lips pressing together .     now  you just eat what   s put before you and let   s not have any comments .      it was quite obvious they were having zymoveal .   baley took his own seat .  he himself would have preferred something other than zymoveal  with its sharp flavor and definite aftertaste  but jessie had explained her problem before this .      well  i just can   t  lije     she had said .     i live right here on these levels all day and i can   t make enemies or life wouldn   t be bearable .  they know i used to be assistant dietitian and if i just walked off with steak or chicken every other week when there   s hardly anyone else on the floor that has private eating privileges even on sunday  they   d say it was pull or friends in the prep room .  it would be talk  talk  talk  and i wouldn   t be able to put my nose out the door or visit personal in peace .  as it is  zymoveal and protoveg are very good .  they   re well balanced nourishment with no waste and  as a matter of fact  they   re full of vitamins and minerals and everything anyone needs and we can have all the chicken we want when we eat in community on the chicken tuesdays .      baley gave in easily .  it was as jessie said  the first problem of living is to minimize friction with the crowds that surround you on all sides .  bentley was a little harder to convince .   on this occasion  he said     gee  mom  why can   t i use dad   s ticket and eat in community myself .  i   d just as soon .      jessie shook her head in annoyance and said     i   m surprised at you  bentley .  what would people say if they saw you eating by yourself as though your own family weren   t good enough for you or had thrown you out of the apartment .         well  gosh  it   s none of people   s business .      baley said  with a nervous edge in his voice     do as your mother tells you  bentley .      bentley shrugged  unhappily .   r .  daneel said  suddenly  from the other side of the room     have i the family   s permission to view these book films during your meal .         oh  sure     said bentley  slipping away from the table  a look of instant interest upon his face .     they   re mine .  i got them from the library on special school permit .  i   ll get you my viewer .  it   s a pretty good one .  dad gave it to me for my last birthday .      he brought it to r .  daneel and said     are you interested in robots  mr .  olivaw .      baley dropped his spoon and bent to pick it up .   r .  daneel said     yes  bentley .  i am quite interested .         then you   ll like these .  they   re all about robots .  i   ve got to write an essay on them for school  so i   m doing research .  it   s quite a complicated subject     he said importantly .     i   m against them myself .         sit down  bentley     said baley  desperately     and don   t bother mr .  olivaw .         he   s not bothering me  elijah .  i   d like to talk to you about the problem  bentley  another time .  your father and i will be very busy tonight .         thanks  mr .  olivaw .     bentley took his seat and  with a look of distaste in his mother   s direction  broke off a portion of the crumbly pink zymoveal with his fork .   baley thought  busy tonight .   then  with a resounding shock  he remembered his job .  he thought of a spacer lying dead in spacetown and realized that for hours he had been so involved with his own dilemma that he had forgotten the cold fact of murder .       chapter     analysis of a murder   jessie said good by to them .  she was wearing a formal hat and a little jacket of keratofiber as she said     i hope you   ll excuse me  mr .  olivaw .  i know you have a great deal to discuss with lije .      she pushed her son ahead of her as she opened the door .      when will you be back  jessie .     asked baley .   she paused .     when do you want me to be back .         well  .  .  .  no use staying out all night .  why don   t you come back your usual time .  midnight or so .     he looked doubtfully at r .  daneel .   r .  daneel nodded .     i regret having to drive you from your home .         don   t worry about that  mr .  olivaw .  you   re not driving me out at all .  this is my usual evening out with the girls anyway .  come on  ben .      the youngster was rebellious .     aw  why the dickens do i have to go  anyway .  i   m not going to bother them .  nuts .         now  do as i say .         well  why can   t i go to the etherics along with you .         because i   m going with some friends and you   ve got other things       the door closed behind them .   and now the moment had come .  baley had put it off in his mind .  lie had thought  first let   s meet the robot and see what he   s like .  then it was  let   s get him home .  and then  let   s eat .   but now it was all over and there was no room for further delay .  it was down at last to the question of murder  of interstellar complications  of possible raises in ratings  of possible disgrace .  and he had no way of even beginning except to turn to the robot for help .   his fingernails moved aimlessly on the table  which had not been returned to its wall recess .   r .  daneel said     how secure are we against being overheard .      baley looked up  surprised .     no one would listen to what   s proceeding in another man   s apartment .         it is not your custom to eavesdrop .         it just isn   t done  daneel .  you might as well suppose they   d  i don   t know  that they   d look in your plate while you   re eating .         or that they would commit murder .         what .         it is against your customs to kill  is it not  elijah .      baley felt anger rising .     see here  if we   re going to be partners  don   t try to imitate spacer arrogance .  there   s no room for it in you  r .  daneel .     he could not resist emphasizing the    r .         i am sorry if i have hurt your feelings  elijah .  my intention was only to indicate that  since human beings are occasionally capable of murder in defiance of custom  they may be able to violate custom for the smaller impropriety of eavesdropping .         the apartment is adequately insulated     said baley  still frowning .     you haven   t heard anything from the apartments on any side of us  have you .  well  they won   t hear us  either .  besides  why should anyone think anything of importance is going on here .         let us not underestimate the enemy .      baley shrugged .     let   s get started .  my information is sketchy  so i can spread out my hand without much trouble .  i know that a man named roj nemennuh sarton  a citizen of the planet aurora  and a resident of spacetown  has been murdered by person or persons unknown .  i understand that it is the opinion of the spacers that this is not an isolated event .  am i right .         you are quite right  elijah .         they tie it up with recent attempts to sabotage the spacer sponsored project of converting us to an integrated human robot society on the model of the outer worlds  and assume the murder was the product of a well organized terrorist group .         yes .         all right .  then to begin with  is this spacer assumption necessarily true .  why can   t the murder have been the work of an isolated fanatic .  there is strong anti robot sentiment on earth  but there are no organized parties advocating violence of this sort .         not openly  perhaps .  no .         even a secret organization dedicated to the destruction of robots and robot factories would have the common sense to realize that the worst thing they could do would be to murder a spacer .  it seems much more likely to have been the work of an unbalanced mind .      r .  daneel listened carefully  then said     i think the weight of probability is against the    fanatic    theory .  the person killed was too well chosen and the time of the murder too appropriate for anything but deliberate planning on the part of an organized group .         well  then  you   ve got more information than i have .  spill it .         your phraseology is obscure  but i think i understand .  i will have to explain some of the background to you .  as seen from spacetown  elijah  relations with earth are unsatisfactory .         tough     muttered baley .      i have been told that when spacetown was first established  it was taken for granted by most of our people that earth would be willing to adopt the integrated society that has worked so well on the outer worlds .  even after the first riots  we thought that it was only a matter of your people getting over the first shock of novelty .      that has not proven to be the case .  even with the co operation of the terrestrial government and of most of the various city governments  resistance has been continuous and progress has been very slow .  naturally  this has been a matter of great concern to our people .         out of altruism  i suppose     said baley .      not entirely     said r .  daneel     although it is good of you to attribute worthy motives to them .  it is our common belief that a healthy and modernized earth would be of great benefit to the whole galaxy .  at least  it is the common belief among our people at spacetown .  i must admit that there are strong elements opposed to them on the outer worlds .         what .  disagreement among the spacers .         certainly .  there are some who think that a modernized earth will be a dangerous and an imperialistic earth .  this is particularly true among the populations of those older worlds which are closer to earth and have greater reason to remember the first few centuries of interstellar travel when their worlds were controlled  politically and economically  by earth .      baley sighed .     ancient history .  are they really worried .  are they still kicking at us for things that happened a thousand years ago .         humans     said r .  daneel     have their own peculiar makeup .  they are not as reasonable  in many ways  as we robots  since their circuits are not as preplanned .  i am told that this  too  has its advantages .         perhaps it may     said baley  dryly .      you are in a better position to know     said r .  daneel .     in any case  continuing failure on earth has strengthened the nationalist parties on the outer worlds .  they say that it is obvious that earthmen are different from spacers and cannot be fitted into the same traditions .  they say that if we imposed robots on earth by superior force  we would be loosing destruction on the galaxy .  one thing they never forget  you see  is that earth   s population is eight billions  while the total population of the fifty outer worlds combined is scarcely more than five and a half billions .  our people here  particularly dr .  sarton          he was a doctor .         a doctor of sociology  specializing in robotics  and a very brilliant man .         i see .  go on .         as i said  dr .  sarton and the others realized that spacetown and all it meant would not exist much longer if such sentiments on the outer worlds were allowed to grow by feeding on our continued failure .  dr .  sarton felt that the time had come to make a supreme effort to understand the psychology of the earthman .  it is easy to say that the earth people are innately conservative and to speak tritely of    the unchanging earth    and    the inscrutable terrestrial mind     but that is only evading the problem .      dr .  sarton said it was ignorance speaking and that we could not dismiss the earthman with a proverb or a bromide .  he said the spacers who were trying to remake earth must abandon the isolation of spacetown and mingle with earthmen .  they must live as they  think as they  be as they .      baley said     the spacers .  impossible .         you are quite right     said r .  daneel .     despite his views  dr .  sarton himself could not have brought himself to enter any of the cities  and he knew it .  he would have been unable to bear the hugeness and the crowds .  even if he had been forced inside at the point of a blaster  the externals would have weighed him down so that he could never have penetrated the inner truths for which he sought .         what about the way they   re always worrying about disease .     demanded baley .     don   t forget that .  i don   t think there   s one of them that would risk entering a city on that account alone .         there is that  too .  disease in the earthly sense is unknown on the outer worlds and the fear of the unknown is always morbid .  dr .  sarton appreciated all of this  but  nevertheless  he insisted on the necessity of growing to know the earthman and his way of life intimately .         he seems to have worked himself into a corner .         not quite .  the objections to entering the city hold for human spacers .  robot spacers are another thing entirely .      baley thought  i keep forgetting  damn it .  aloud  he said     oh .         yes     said r .  daneel .     we are more flexible  naturally .  at least in this respect .  we can be designed for adaptation to an earthly life .  by being built into a particularly close similarity to the human externals  we could be accepted by earthmen and allowed a closer view of their life .         and you yourself      began baley in sudden enlightenment .      am just such a robot .  for a year  dr .  sarton had been working upon the design and construction of such robots .  i was the first of his robots and so far the only one .  unfortunately  my education is not yet complete .  i have been hurried into my role prematurely as a result of the murder .         then not all spacer robots are like you .  i mean  some look more like robots and less like humans .  right .         why  naturally .  the outward appearance is dependent on a robot   s function .  my own function requires a very manlike appearance  and i have it .  others are different  although all are humanoid .  certainly they are more humanoid than the distressingly primitive models i saw at the shoe counter .  are all your robots like that .         more or less     said baley .     you don   t approve .         of course not .  it is difficult to accept a gross parody of the human form as an intellectual equal .  can your factories do no better .         i   m sure they can  daneel .  i think we just prefer to know when we   re dealing with a robot and when we   re not .     he stared directly into the robot   s eyes as he said that .  they were bright and moist  as a human   s would be  but it seemed to baley that their gaze was steady and did not flicker slightly from point to point as a man   s would .   r .  daneel said     i am hopeful that in time i will grow to understand that point of view .      for a moment  baley thought there was sarcasm in the sentence  then dismissed the possibility .      in any case     said r .  daneel     dr .  sarton saw clearly the fact that it was a case for c fe .         see fee .  what   s that .         just the chemical symbols for the elements carbon and iron  elijah .  carbon is the basis of human life and iron of robot life .  it becomes easy to speak of c fe when you wish to express a culture that combines the best of the two on an equal but parallel basis .         see fee .  do you write it with a hyphen .  or how .         no  elijah .  a diagonal line between the two is the accepted way .  it symbolizes neither one nor the other  but a mixture of the two  without priority .      against his will  baley found himself interested .  formal education on earth included virtually no information on outer world history or sociology after the great rebellion that made them independent of the mother planet .  the popular book film romances  to be sure  had their stock outer world characters  the visiting tycoon  choleric and eccentric  the beautiful heiress  invariably smitten by the earthman   s charms and drowning disdain in love  the arrogant spacer rival  wicked and forever beaten .  these were worthless pictures  since they denied even the most elementary and well known truths  that spacers never entered cities and spacer women virtually never visited earth .   for the first time in his life  baley was stirred by an odd curiosity .  what was spacer life really like .   he brought his mind back to the issue at hand with something of an effort .  he said     i think i get what you   re driving at .  your dr .  sarton was attacking the problem of earth   s conversion to c fe from a new and promising angle .  our conservative groups or medievalists  as they call themselves  were perturbed .  they were afraid he might succeed .  so they killed him .  that   s the motivation that makes it an organized plot and not an isolated outrage .  right .         i would put it about like that  elijah .  yes .      baley whistled thoughtfully under his breath .  his long fingers tapped lightly against the table .  then he shook his head .     it won   t wash .  it won   t wash at all .         pardon me .  i do not understand you .         i   m trying to get the picture .  an earthman walks into spacetown  walks up to dr .  sarton  blasts him  and walks out .  i just don   t see it .  surely the entrance to spacetown is guarded .      r .  daneel nodded .     i think it is safe to say that no earthman can possibly have passed through the entrance illegally .         then where does that leave you .         it would leave us in a confusing position  elijah  if the entrance were the only way of reaching spacetown from new york city .      baley watched his partner thoughtfully .     i don   t get you .  it   s the only connection between the two .         directly between the two  yes .     r .  daneel waited a moment  then said     you do not follow me .  is that not so .         that is so .  i don   t get you at all .         well  if it will not offend you  i will try to explain myself .  may i have a piece of paper and a writer .  thank you .  look here  partner elijah .  i will draw a big circle and label it    new york city .     now  tangent to it  i will draw a small circle and label it    spacetown .     here  where they touch  i draw an arrowhead and label it    barrier .     now do you see no other connection .      baley said     of course not .  there is no other connection .         in a way     said the robot     i am glad to hear you say this .  it is in accordance with what i have been taught about terrestrial ways of thinking .  the barrier is the only direct connection .  but both the city and spacetown are open to the countryside in all directions .  it is possible for a terrestrial to leave the city at any of numerous exits and strike out cross country to spacetown  where no barrier will stop him .      the tip of baley   s tongue touched his upper lip and for a moment stayed there .  then he said     cross country .         yes .         cross country .  alone .         why not .         walking .         undoubtedly walking .  walking would offer the least chance of detection .  the murder took place early in the working day and the trip was undoubtedly negotiated in the hours before dawn .         impossible .  there isn   t a man in the city who would do it .  leave the city .  alone .         ordinarily  it would seem unlikely .  yes .  we spacers know that .  it is why we guard only the entrance .  even in the great riot  your people attacked only at the barrier that then protected the entrance .  not one left the city .         well  then .         but now we are dealing with an unusual situation .  it is not the blind attack of a mob following the line of least resistance  but the organized attempt of a small group to strike  deliberately  at the unguarded point .  it explains why  as you say  a terrestrial could enter spacetown  walk up to his victim  kill him  and walk away .  the man attacked through a complete blind spot on our part .      baley shook his head .     it   s too unlikely .  have your people done anything to check that theory .         yes  we have .  your commissioner of police was present almost at the time of the murder          i know .  he told me so .         that  elijah  is another example of the timeliness of the murder .  your commissioner has co operated with dr .  sarton in the past and he was the earthman with whom dr .  sarton planned to make initial arrangements concerning the infiltration of your city by r   s such as myself .  the appointment for that morning was to concern that .  the murder  of course  stopped those plans  at least temporarily  and the fact that it happened when your own commissioner of police was actually within spacetown made the entire situation more difficult and embarrassing for earth  and for our own people  too .      but that is not what i started to say .  your commissioner was present .  we said to him     the man must have come cross country .     like you  he said     impossible     or perhaps     unthinkable .     he was quite disturbed  of course  and perhaps that may have made it difficult for him to see the essential point .  nevertheless  we forced him to begin checking that possibility almost at once .      baley thought of the commissioner   s broken glasses and  even in the middle of somber thoughts  a corner of his mouth twitched .  poor julius .  yes  he would be disturbed .  of course  there would be no way for enderby to have explained the situation to the lofty spacers  who looked upon physical disability as a peculiarly disgusting attribute of the non genetically selected earthmen .  at least  he couldn   t without losing face  and face was valuable to police commissioner julius enderby .  well  earthmen had to stick together in some respects .  the robot would never find out about enderby   s nearsightedness from baley .   r .  daneel continued     one by one  the various exit points from the city were investigated .  do you know how many there are  elijah .      baley shook his head  then hazarded     twenty .         five hundred and two .         what .         originally  there were many more .  five hundred and two are all that remain functional .  your city represents a slow growth  elijah .  it was once open to the sky and people crossed from city to country freely .         of course .  i know that .         well  when it was first enclosed  there were many exits left .  five hundred and two still remain .  the rest are built over or blocked up .  we are not counting  of course  the entrance points for air freight .         well  what of the exit points .         it was hopeless .  they are unguarded .  we could find no official who was in charge or who considered them under his jurisdiction .  it seemed as though no one even knew they existed .  a man could have walked out of any of them at any time and returned at will .  he would never have been detected .         anything else .  the weapon was gone  i suppose .         oh  yes .         any clues of any sort .         none .  we have investigated the grounds surrounding spacetown thoroughly .  the robots on the truck farms were quite useless as possible witnesses .  they are little more than automatic farm machinery  scarcely humanoid .  and there were no humans .         uh huh .  what next .         having failed  so far  at one end  spacetown  we will work at the other  new york city .  it will be our duty to track down all possible subversive groups  to sift all dissident organizations          how much time do you intend to spend .     interrupted baley .      as little as possible  as much as necessary .         well     said baley  thoughtfully     i wish you had another partner in this mess .         i do not     said r .  daneel .     the commissioner spoke very highly of your loyalty and ability .         it was nice of him     said baley sardonically .  he thought  poor julius .  i   m on his conscience and he tries hard .      we didn   t rely entirely on him     said r .  daneel .     we checked your records .  you have expressed yourself openly against the use of robots in your department .         oh .  do you object .         not at all .  your opinions are  obviously  your own .  but it made it necessary for us to check your psychological profile very closely .  we know that  although you dislike r   s intensely  you will work with one if you conceive it to be your duty .  you have an extraordinarily high loyalty aptitude and a respect for legitimate authority .  it is what we need .  commissioner enderby judged you well .         you have no personal resentment toward my anti robot sentiments .      r .  daneel said     if they do not prevent you from working with me and helping me do what is required of me  how can they matter .      baley felt stopped .  he said  belligerently     well  then  if i pass the test  how about you .  what makes you a detective .         i do not understand you .         you were designed as an information gathering machine .  a manimitation to record the facts of human life for the spacers .         that is a good beginning for an investigator  is it not .  to be an information gathering machine .         a beginning  maybe .  but it   s not all there is  by a long shot .         to be sure  there has been a final adjustment of my circuits .         i   d be curious to hear the details of that  daneel .         that is easy enough .  a particularly strong drive has been inserted into my motivation banks  a desire for justice .         justice .     cried baley .  the irony faded from his face and was replaced by a look of the most earnest distrust .   but r .  daneel turned swiftly in his chair and stared at the door .     someone is out there .      someone was .  the door opened and jessie  pale and thin lipped  walked in .   baley was startled .     why  jessie .  is anything wrong .      she stood there  eyes not meeting his .     i   m sorry .  i had to  .  .  .  her voice trailed off .      where   s bentley .         he   s to stay the night in the youth hall .      baley said     why .  i didn   t tell you to do that .         you said your partner would stay the night .  i felt he would need bentley   s room .      r .  daneel said     there was no necessity  jessie .      jessie lifted her eyes to r .  daneel   s face  staring at it earnestly .   baley looked at his fingertips  sick at what might follow  somehow unable to interpose .  the momentary silence pressed thickly on his eardrums and then  far away  as though through folds of plastex  he heard his wife say     i think you are a robot  daneel .      and r .  daneel replied  in a voice as calm as ever     i am .          chapter     whispers in a bedroom   on the uppermost levels of some of the wealthiest subsections of the city are the natural solariums  where a partition of quartz with a movable metal shield excludes the air but lets in the sunlight .  there the wives and daughters of the city   s highest administrators and executives may tan themselves .  there a unique thing happens every evening .   night falls .   in the rest of the city  including the uv solariums  where the millions  in strict sequence of allotted time  may occasionally expose themselves to the artificial wavelengths of arc lights  there are only the arbitrary cycles of hours .   the business of the city might easily continue in three eight hour or four six hour shifts  by    day    and    night    alike .  light and work could easily proceed endlessly .  there are always civic reformers who periodically suggest such a thing in the interests of economy and efficiency .   the notion is never accepted .   much of the earlier habits of earthly society have been given up in the interests of that same economy and efficiency  space  privacy  even much of free will .  they are the products of civilization  however  and not more than ten thousand years old .   the adjustment of sleep to night  however  is as old as man  a million years .  the habit is not easy to give up .  although the evening is unseen  apartment lights dim as the hours of darkness pass and the city   s pulse sinks .  though no one can tell noon from midnight by any cosmic phenomenon along the enclosed avenues of the city  mankind follows the mute partitionings of the hour hand .   the expressways empty  the noise of life sinks  the moving mob among the colossal alleys melts away  new york city lies in earth   s unnoticed shadow  and its population sleeps .   elijah baley did not sleep .  he lay in bed and there was no light in his apartment  but that was as far as it went .   jessie lay next to him  motionless in the darkness .  he had not felt nor heard her move .   on the other side of the wall sat  stood  lay  baley wondered which  r .  daneel olivaw .   baley whispered     jessie .     then again     jessie .      the dark figure beside him stirred slightly under the sheet .     what do you want .         jessie  don   t make it worse for me .         you might have told me .         how could i .  i was planning to  when i could think of a way .  jehoshaphat  jessie       baley   s voice returned to its whisper .     how did you find out .  won   t you tell me .      jessie turned toward him .  he could sense her eyes looking through the darkness at him .      lije .     her voice was scarcely more than a stirring of air .     can he hear us .  that thing .         not if we whisper .         how do you know .  maybe he has special ears to pick up tiny sounds .  spacer robots can do all sorts of things .      baley knew that .  the pro robot propaganda was forever stressing the miraculous feats of the spacer robots  their endurance  their extra senses  their service to humanity in a hundred novel ways .  personally  he thought that approach defeated itself .  earthmen hated the robots all the more for their superiority .   he whispered     not daneel .  they made him human type on purpose .  they wanted him to be accepted as a human being  so he must have only human senses .         how do you know .         if he had extra senses  there would be too much danger of his giving himself away as non human by accident .  he would do too much  know too much .         well  maybe .      silence fell again .   a minute passed and baley tried a second time .     jessie  if you   ll just let things be until  until  .  .  .  look  dear  it   s unfair of you to be angry .         angry .  oh  lije  you fool .  i   m not angry .  i   m scared  i   m scared clean to death .      she made a gulping sound and clutched at the neck of his pajamas .  for a while  they clung together  and baley   s growing sense of injury evaporated into a troubled concern .      why  jessie .  there   s nothing to be worried about .  he   s harmless .  i swear he is .         can   t you get rid of him  lije .         you know i can   t .  it   s department business .  how can i .         what kind of business  lije .  tell me .         now  jessie  i   m surprised at you .     he groped for her cheek in the darkness and patted it .  it was wet .  using his pajama sleeve  he carefully wiped her eyes .      now  look     he said tenderly     you   re being a baby .         tell them at the department to have someone else do it  whatever it is .  please  lije .      baley   s voice hardened a bit .     jessie  you   ve been a policeman   s wife long enough to know an assignment is an assignment .         well  why did it have to be you .         julius enderby       she stiffened in his arms .     i might have known .  why can   t you tell julius enderby to have someone else do the dirty work just once .  you stand for too much  lije  and this is just          all right  all right     he said  soothingly .   she subsided  quivering .   baley thought  she   ll never understand .   julius enderby had been a fighting word with them since their engagement .  enderby had been two classes ahead of baley at the city school of administrative studies .  they had been friends .  when baley had taken his battery of aptitude tests and neuroanalysis and found himself in line for the police force  he found enderby there ahead of him .  enderby had already moved into the plain clothes division .   baley followed enderby  but at a continually greater distance .  it was no one   s fault  precisely .  baley was capable enough  efficient enough  but he lacked something that enderby had .  enderby fit the administrative machine perfectly .  he was one of those persons who was born for a hierarchy  who was just naturally comfortable in a bureaucracy .  the commissioner wasn   t a great brain  and baley knew it .  he had his childish peculiarities  his intermittent rash of ostentatious medievalism  for instance .  but he was smooth with others  he offended no one  he took orders gracefully  he gave them with the proper mixture of gentleness and firmness .  he even got along with the spacers .  he was perhaps over obsequious to them  baley himself could never have dealt with them for half a day without getting into a state of bristle  he was sure of that  even though he had never really spoken to a spacer   but they trusted him  and that made him extremely useful to the city .  so  in a civil service where smooth and sociable performance was more useful than an individualistic competence  enderby went up the scale quickly  and was at the commissioner level when baley himself was nothing more than a c   .  baley did not resent the contrast  though he was human enough to regret it .  enderby did not forget their earlier friendship and  in his queer way  tried to make up for his success by doing what he could for baley .   the assignment of partnership with r .  daneel was an example of it .   it was tough and unpleasant  but there was no question that it carried within it the germs of tremendous advance .  the commissioner might have given the chance to someone else .  his own talk  that morning  of needing a favor masked but did not hide that fact .   jessie never saw things that way .  on similar occasions in the past  she had said     it   s your silly loyalty index .  i   m so tired of hearing everyone praise you for being so full of a sense of duty .  think of yourself once in a while .  i notice the ones on top don   t bring up the topic of their own loyalty index .      baley lay in bed in a state of stiff wakefulness  letting jessie calm down .  he had to think .  he had to be certain of his suspicions .  little things chased one another and fitted together in his mind .  slowly  they were building into a pattern .   he felt the mattress give as jessie stirred .      lije .     her lips were at his ear .      what .         why don   t you resign .         don   t be crazy .         why not .     she was suddenly almost eager .     you can get rid of that horrible robot that way .  just walk in and tell enderby you   re through .      baley said coldly     i can   t resign in the middle of an important case .  i can   t throw the whole thing down the disposal tube just any time i feel like it .  a trick like that means declassification for cause .         even so .  you can work your way up again .  you can do it  lije .  there are a dozen places where you   d fit into service .         civil service doesn   t take men who are declassified for cause .  manual labor is the only thing i can do  the only thing you could do .  bentley would lose all inherited status .  for god   s sake  jessie  you don   t know what it   s like .         i   ve read about it .  i   m not afraid of it     she mumbled .      you   re crazy .  you   re plain crazy .     baley could feel himself trembling .  there was a familiar  flashing picture of his father in his mind   s eye .  his father  moldering away toward death .   jessie sighed heavily .   baley   s mind turned savagely away from her .  in desperation  it returned to the pattern it was constructing .   he said  tightly     jessie  you   ve got to tell me .  how did you find out daneel was a robot .  what made you decide that .      she began     well  .  .  .     and just ran down .  it was the third time she had begun to explain and failed .   he crushed her hand in his  willing her to speak .     please  jessie .  what   s frightening you .      she said     i just guessed he was a robot  lije .      he said     there wasn   t anything to make you guess that  jessie .  you didn   t think he was a robot before you left  now did you .         no o  but i got to thinking  .  .  .         come on  jessie .  what was it .         well   look  lije  the girls were talking in the personal .  you know how they are .  just talking about everything .      women .  thought baley .      anyway     said jessie .     the rumor is all over town .  it must be .         all over town .     baley felt a quick and savage touch of triumph  or nearly that .  another piece in place .      it was the way they sounded .  they said there was talk about a spacer robot loose in the city .  he was supposed to look just like a man and to be working with the police .  they even asked me about it .  they laughed and said     does your lije know anything about it  jessie .     and i laughed  and said     don   t be silly .         then we went to the etherics and i got to thinking about your new partner .  do you remember those pictures you brought home  the ones julius enderby took in spacetown  to show me what spacers looked like .  well  i got to thinking that   s what your partner looked like .  it just came to me that that   s what he looked like and i said to myself  oh  my god  someone must   ve recognized him in the shoe department and he   s with lije and i just said i had a headache and i ran       baley said     now  jessie  stop  stop .  get hold of yourself .  now why are you afraid .  you   re not afraid of daneel himself .  you faced up to him when you came home .  you faced up to him fine .  so       he stopped speaking .  he sat up in bed  eyes uselessly wide in the darkness .   he felt his wife move against his side .  his hand leaped  found her lips and pressed against them .  she heaved against his grip  her hands grasping his wrist and wrenching  but he leaned down against her the more heavily .   then  suddenly  he released her .  she whimpered .   he said  huskily     sorry  jessie .  i was listening .      he was getting out of bed  pulling warm plastofilm over the soles of his feet .      lije  where are you going .  don   t leave me .         it   s all right .  i   m just going to the door .      the plastofilm made a soft  shuffling noise as he circled the bed .  he cracked the door to the living room and waited a long moment .  nothing happened .  it was so quiet  he could hear the thin whistle of jessie   s breath from their bed .  he could hear the dull rhythm of blood in his ears .   baley   s hand crept through the opening of the door  snaking out to the spot he needed no light to find .  his fingers closed upon the knob that controlled the ceiling illumination .  he exerted the smallest pressure he could and the ceiling gleamed dimly  so dimly that the lower half of the living room remained in semidusk .   he saw enough  however .  the main door was closed and the living room lay lifeless and quiet .   he turned the knob back into the off position and moved back to bed .   it was all he needed .  the pieces fit .  the pattern was complete .  jessie pleaded with him .     lije  what   s wrong .         nothing   s wrong  jessie .  everything   s all right .  he   s not here .         the robot .  do you mean he   s gone .  for good .         no  no .  he   ll be back .  and before he does  answer my question .         what question .         what are you afraid of .     jessie said nothing .   baley grew more insistent .     you said you were scared to death .         of him .         no  we went through that .  you weren   t afraid of him and  besides  you know quite well a robot cannot hurt a human being .      her words came slowly .     i thought if everyone knew he was a robot there might be a riot .  we   d be killed .         why kill us .         you know what riots are like .         they don   t even know where the robot is  do they .         they might find out .         and that   s what you   re afraid of  a riot .         well          sh .     he pressed jessie down to the pillow .   then he put his lips to her ear .     he   s come back .  now listen and don   t say a word .  everything   s fine .  he   ll be gone in the morning and he won   t be back .  there   ll be no riot  nothing .      he was almost contented as he said that  almost completely contented .  he felt he could sleep .   he thought again  no riot  nothing .  and no declassification .  and just before he actually fell asleep  he thought  not even a murder investigation .  not even that .  the whole thing   s solved  .  .  .   he slept .       chapter     excursion into spacetown   police commissioner julius enderby polished his glasses with exquisite care and placed them upon the bridge of his nose .   baley thought  it   s a good trick .  keeps you busy while you   re thinking what to say  and it doesn   t cost money the way lighting up a pipe does .   and because the thought had entered his mind  he drew out his pipe and dipped into his pinched store of rough cut .  one of the few luxury crops still grown on earth was tobacco  and its end was visibly approaching .  prices had gone up  never down  in baley   s lifetime  quotas down  never up .   enderby  having adjusted his glasses  felt for the switch at one end of his desk and flicked his door into one way transparency for a moment .     where is he now  by the way .         he told me he wanted to be shown through the department  and i let jack tobin do the honors .     baley lit his pipe and tightened its baffle carefully .  the commissioner  like most non indulgers  was petty about tobacco smoke .      i hope you didn   t tell him daneel was a robot .         of course i didn   t .      the commissioner did not relax .  one hand remained aimlessly busy with the automatic calendar on his desk .      how is it .     he asked  without looking at baley .      middling rough .         i   m sorry  lije .      baley said  firmly     you might have warned me that he looked completely human .      the commissioner looked surprised .     i didn   t .     then  with sudden petulance     damn it  you should have known .  i wouldn   t have asked you to have him stay at your house if he looked like r .  sammy .  now would i .         i know  commissioner  but i   d never seen a robot like that and you had .  i didn   t even know such things were possible .  i just wish you   d mentioned it  that   s all .         look  lije  i   m sorry .  i should have told you .  you   re right .  it   s just that this job  this whole deal  has me so on edge that half the time i   m just snapping at people for no reason .  he  i mean this daneel thing  is a new type robot .  it   s still in the experimental stage .         so he explained himself .         oh .  well  that   s it  then .      baley tensed a little .  this was it  now .  he said  casually  teeth clenched on pipestem .     r .  daneel has arranged a trip to spacetown for me .         to spacetown .     enderby looked up with instant indignation .     yes .  it   s the logical next move  commissioner .  i   d like to see the scene of the crime  ask a few questions .      enderby shook his head decidedly .     i don   t think that   s a good idea  lije .  we   ve gone over the ground .  i doubt there   s anything new to be learned .  and they   re strange people .  kid gloves .  they   ve got to be handled with kid gloves .  you don   t have the experience .      he put a plump hand to his forehead and added  with unexpected fervor     i hate them .      baley inserted hostility into his voice .     damn it  the robot came here and i should go there .  it   s bad enough sharing a front seat with a robot  i hate to take a back seat .  of course  if you don   t think i   m capable of running this investigation  commissioner          it isn   t that  lije .  it   s not you  it   s the spacers .  you don   t know what they   re like .      baley deepened his frown .     well  then  commissioner  suppose you come along .     his right hand rested on his knee  and two of his fingers crossed automatically as he said that .   the commissioner   s eyes widened .     no  lije .  i won   t go there .  don   t ask me to .     he seemed visibly to catch hold of his runaway words .  more quietly  he said  with an unconvincing smile     lots of work here  you know .  i   m days behind .      baley regarded him thoughtfully .     i tell you what  then .  why not get into it by trimension later on .  just for a while  you understand .  in case i need help .         well  yes .  i suppose i can do that .     he sounded unenthusiastic .      good .     baley looked at the wall clock  nodded  and got up .     i   ll be in touch with you .      baley looked back as he left the office  keeping the door open for part of an additional second .  he saw the commissioner   s head begin bending down toward the crook of one elbow as it rested on the desk .  the plain clothes man could almost swear he heard a sob .   jehoshaphat .  he thought  in outright shock .   he paused in the common room and sat on the corner of a nearby desk  ignoring its occupant  who looked up  murmured a casual greeting  and returned to his work .   baley unclipped the baffle from the bowl of the pipe and blew into it .  he inverted the pipe itself over the desk   s small ash vacuum and let the powdery white tobacco ash vanish .  he looked regretfully at the empty pipe  readjusted the baffle  and put it away .  another pipeful gone forever .   he reconsidered what had just taken place .  in one way  enderby had not surprised him .  he had expected resistance to any attempt on his own part to enter spacetown .  he had heard the commissioner talk often enough about the difficulties of dealing with spacers  about the dangers of allowing any but experienced negotiators to have anything to do with them  even over trifles .   he had not expected  however  to have the commissioner give in so easily .  he had supposed  at the very least  that enderby would have insisted on accompanying him .  the pressure of other work was meaningless in the face of the importance of this problem .   and that was not what baley wanted .  he wanted exactly what he had gotten .  he wanted the commissioner to be present by trimensional personification so that he could witness the proceedings from a point of safety .   safety was the key word .  baley would need a witness that could not be put out of the way immediately .  he needed that much as the minimum guarantee of his own safety .   the commissioner had agreed to that at once .  baley remembered the parting sob  or ghost of one  and thought  jehoshaphat  the man   s into this past his depth .   a cheerful  slurring voice sounded just at baley   s shoulder and baley started .      what the devil do you want .     he demanded savagely .   the smile on r .  sammy   s face remained foolishly fixed .     jack says to tell you daneel is ready  lije .         all right .  now get out of here .      he frowned at the robot   s departing back .  there was nothing so irritating as having that clumsy metal contraption forever making free with your front name .  he   d complained about that when r .  sammy first arrived and the commissioner had shrugged his shoulders and said     you can   t have it both ways  lije .  the public insists that city robots be built with a strong friendship circuit .  all right  then .  he is drawn to you .  he calls you by the friendliest name he knows .      friendship circuit .  no robot built  of any type  could possibly hurt a human being .  that was the first law of robotics      a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .      no positronic brain was ever built without that injunction driven so deeply into its basic circuits that no conceivable derangement could displace it .  there was no need for specialized friendship circuits .   yet the commissioner was right .  the earthman   s distrust for robots was something quite irrational and friendship circuits had to be incorporated  just as all robots had to be made smiling .  on earth  at any rate .   r .  daneel  now  never smiled .   sighing  baley rose to his feet .  he thought  spacetown  next stop   or  maybe  last stop .   the police forces of the city  as well as certain high officials  could still make use of individual squad cars along the corridors of the city and even along the ancient underground motorways that were barred to foot traffic .  there were perennial demands on the part of the liberals that these motorways be converted to children   s playgrounds  to new shopping areas  or to expressway or localway extensions .   the strong pleas of    civic safety .     remained unvanquished  however .  in cases of fires too large to be handled by local devices  in cases of massive breakdowns in power lines or ventilators  most of all in cases of serious riot  there had to be some means whereby the forces of the city could be mobilized at the stricken point in a hurry .  no substitute for the motorways existed or could exist .   baley had traveled along a motorway several times before in his life  but its indecent emptiness always depressed him .  it seemed a million miles from the warm  living pulsation of the city .  it stretched out like a blind and hollow worm before his eyes as he sat at the controls of the squad car .  it opened continuously into new stretches as he moved around this gentle curve or that .  behind him  he knew without looking  another blind and hollow worm continually contracted and closed .  the motorway was well lit  but lighting was meaningless in the silence and emptiness .   r .  daneel did nothing to break that silence or fill that emptiness .  he looked straight ahead  as unimpressed by the empty motorway as by the bulging expressway .   in one sounding moment  to the tune of a wild whine of the squad car   s siren  they popped out of the motorway and curved gradually into the vehicular lane of a city corridor .   the vehicular lanes were still conscientiously marked down each major corridor in reverence for one vestigial portion of the past .  there were no vehicles any longer  except for squad cars  fire engines  and maintenance trucks  and pedestrians used the lanes in complete self assurance .  they scattered in indignant hurry before the advance of baley   s squealing car .   baley  himself  drew a freer breath as noise surged in about him  but it was an interval only .  in less than two hundred yards they turned into the subdued corridors that led to spacetown entrance .   they were expected .  the guards obviously knew r .  daneel by sight and  although themselves human  nodded to him without the least self consciousness .   one approached baley and saluted with perfect  if frigid  military courtesy .  he was tall and grave  though not the perfect specimen of spacer physique that r .  daneel was .   he said     your identification card  if you please  sir .      it was inspected quickly but thoroughly .  baley noticed that the guard wore flesh colored gloves and had an all but unnoticeable filter in each nostril .   the guard saluted again and returned the card .  he said     there is a small men   s personal here which we would be pleased to have you use if you wish to shower .      it was in baley   s mind to deny the necessity  but r .  daneel plucked gently at his sleeve  as the guard stepped back to his place .   r .  daneel said     it is customary  partner elijah  for city dwellers to shower before entering spacetown .  i tell you this since i know you have no desire  through lack of information on this matter  to render yourself or ourselves uncomfortable .  it is also advisable for you to attend to any matters of personal hygiene you may think advisable .  there will be no facilities within spacetown for that purpose .         no facilities .     said baley  strenuously .     but that   s impossible .         i mean  of course     said r .  daneel     none for use by city dwellers .      baley   s face filled with a clearly hostile astonishment .   r .  daneel said     i regret the situation  but it is a matter of custom .      wordlessly  baley entered the personal .  he felt  rather than saw  r .  daneel entering behind him .   he thought  checking on me .  making sure i wash the city dust off myself .   for a furious moment  he reveled in the thought of the shock he was preparing for spacetown .  it seemed to him suddenly minor that he might  in effect  be pointing a blaster at his own chest .   the personal was small  but it was well appointed and antiseptic in its cleanliness .  there was a trace of sharpness in the air .  baley sniffed at it  momentarily puzzled .   then he thought  ozone .  they   ve got ultraviolet radiation flooding the place .   a little sign blinked on and off several times  then remained steadily lit .  it said     visitor will please remove all clothing  including shoes  and place it in the receptacle below .      baley acquiesced .  he unhitched his blaster and blaster strap and recircled it about his naked waist .  it felt heavy and uncomfortable .   the receptacle closed and his clothing was gone .  the lighted sign blanked out .  a new sign flashed ahead .   it said     visitor will please tend to personal needs  then make use of the shower indicated by arrow .      baley felt like a machine tool being shaped by long distance force edges on an assembly line .   his first act upon entering the small shower cubicle was to draw up the moisture proof flap on his blaster holster and clip it down firmly all about .  he knew by long standing test that he could still draw and use it in less than five seconds .   there was no knob or hook on which to hang his blaster .  there was not even a visible shower head .  he placed it in a corner away from the cubicle   s entrance door .   another sign flashed     visitor will please hold arms directly out from his body and stand in the central circle with feet in the indicated positions .      as he placed his feet in the small depressions allowed for them  the sign blanked out .  as it did so  a stinging  foaming spray hit him from ceiling  floor  and four walls .  he felt the water welling up even beneath the soles of his feet .  for a full minute it lasted  his skin reddening under the combined force of the heat and pressure and his lungs gasping for air in the warm dampness .  there followed another minute of cool  low pressure spray  and then finally a minute of warm air that left him dry and refreshed .   he picked up his blaster and blaster strap and found that they  too  were dry and warm .  he strapped them on and stepped out of the cubicle in time to see r .  daneel emerge from a neighboring shower .  of course .  r .  daneel was not a city dweller  but he had accumulated city dust .   quite automatically  baley looked away .  then  with the thought that  after all  r .  daneel   s customs were not city customs  he forced his unwilling eyes back for one moment .  his lips quirked in a tiny smile .  r .  daneel   s resemblance to humanity was not restricted to his face and hands but had been carried out with painstaking accuracy over the entire body .   baley stepped forward in the direction he had been traveling continuously since entering the personal .  he found his clothes waiting for him  neatly folded .  they had a warm  clean odor to them .   a sign said     visitor will please resume his clothing and place his hand in the indicated depression .      baley did so .  he felt a definite tingling in the ball of his middle finger as he laid it down upon the clean  milky surface .  he lifted his hand hastily and found a little drop of blood oozing out .  as he watched  it stopped flowing .   he shook it off and pinched the finger .  no more blood was flowing even then .   obviously  they were analyzing his blood .  he felt a definite pang of anxiety .  his own yearly routine examination by department doctors  he felt sure  was not carried on with the thoroughness or  perhaps  with the knowledge of these cold robot makers from outer space .  he was not sure he wanted too probing an inquiry into the state of his health .   the time of waiting seemed long to baley  but when the light flashed again  it said simply     visitor will proceed .      baley drew a long breath of relief .  he walked onward and stepped through an archway .  two metal rods closed in before him and  written in luminous air  were the words     visitor is warned to proceed no further .         what the devil      called out baley  forgetting in his anger the fact that he was still in the personal .   r .  daneel   s voice was in his ear .     the sniffers have detected a power source  i imagine .  are you carrying your blaster  elijah .      baley whirled  his face a deep crimson .  he tried twice  then managed to croak out     a police officer has his blaster on him or in easy reach at all times  on duty and off .      it was the first time he had spoken in a personal  proper  since he was ten years old .  that had been in his uncle boris   s presence and had merely been an automatic complaint when he stubbed his toe .  uncle boris had beaten him well when he reached home and had lectured him strongly on the necessities of public decency .   r .  daneel said     no visitor may be armed .  it is our custom  elijah .  even your commissioner leaves his blaster behind on all visits .      under almost any other circumstances  baley would have turned on his heel and walked away  away from spacetown and away from that robot .  now  however  he was almost mad with desire to go through with his exact plan and have his revenge to the brim in that way .  this  he thought  was the unobtrusive medical examination that had replaced the more detailed one of the early days .  he could well understand  he could understand to overflowing  the indignation and anger that had led to the barrier riots of his youth .   in black anger  baley unhitched his blaster belt .  r .  daneel took it from him and placed it within a recess in the wall .  a thin metal plate slithered across it .      if you will put your thumb in the depression     said r .  daneel     only your thumb will open it later on .      baley felt undressed  far more so  in fact  than he had felt in the shower .  he stepped across the point at which the rods had lately barred him  and  finally  out of the personal .   he was back in a corridor again  but there was an element of strangeness about it .  up ahead  the light had an unfamiliar quality to it .  he felt a whiff of air against his face and  automatically  he thought a squad car had passed .   r .  daneel must have read his uneasiness in his face .  he said     you are essentially in open air now  elijah .  it is unconditioned .      baley felt faintly sick .  how could the spacers be so rigidly careful of a human body  merely because it came from the city  and then breathe the dirty air of the open fields .  he tightened his nostrils  as though by pulling them together he could the more effectively screen the ingoing air .   r .  daneel said     i believe you will find that open air is not deleterious to human health .         all right     said baley  faintly .   the air currents hit annoyingly against his face .  they were gentle enough  but they were erratic .  that bothered him .   worse came .  the corridor opened into blueness and as they approached its end  strong white light washed down .  baley had seen sunlight .  he had been in a natural solarium once in the line of duty .  but there  protecting glass had enclosed the place and the sun   s own image had been refracted into a generalized glow .  here  all was open .   automatically  he looked up at the sun  then turned away .  his dazzled eyes blinked and watered .   a spacer was approaching .  a moment of misgiving struck baley .   r .  daneel  however  stepped forward to greet the approaching man with a handshake .  the spacer turned to baley and said     won   t you come with me  sir .  i am dr .  han fastolfe .      things were better inside one of the domes .  baley found himself goggling at the size of the rooms and the way in which space was so carelessly distributed  but was thankful for the feel of the conditioned air .   fastolfe said  sitting down and crossing his long legs     i   m assuming that you prefer conditioning to unobstructed wind .      he seemed friendly enough .  there were fine wrinkles on his forehead and a certain flabbiness to the skin below his eyes and just under his chin .  his hair was thinning  but showed no signs of gray .  his large ears stood away from his head  giving him a humorous and homely appearance that comforted baley .   early that morning  baley had looked once again at those pictures of spacetown that enderby had taken .  r .  daneel had just arranged the spacetown appointment and baley was absorbing the notion that he was to meet spacers in the flesh .  somehow that was considerably different from speaking to them across miles of carrier wave  as he had done on several occasions before .   the spacers in those pictures had been  generally speaking  like those that were occasionally featured in the book films  tall  redheaded  grave  coldly handsome .  like r .  daneel olivaw  for instance .   r .  daneel named the spacers for baley and when baley suddenly pointed and said  in surprise     that isn   t you  is it .     r .  daneel answered     no  elijah  that is my designer  dr .  sarton .      he said it unemotionally .      you were made in your maker   s image .     asked baley  sardonically  but there was no answer to that and  in truth  baley scarcely expected one .  the bible  as he knew  circulated only to the most limited extent on the outer worlds .   and now baley looked at han fastolfe  a man who deviated very noticeably from the spacer norm in looks  and the earthman felt a pronounced gratitude for that fact .      won   t you accept food .     asked fastolfe .   he indicated the table that separated himself and r .  daneel from the earthman .  it bore nothing but a bowl of varicolored spheroids .  baley felt vaguely startled .  he had taken them for table decorations .   r .  daneel explained .     these are the fruits of natural plant life grown on aurora .  i suggest you try this kind .  it is called an apple and is reputed to be pleasant .      fastolfe smiled .     r .  daneel does not know this by personal experience  of course  but he is quite right .      baley brought an apple to his mouth .  its surface was red and green .  it was cool to the touch and had a faint but pleasant odor .  with an effort  he bit into it and the unexpected tartness of the pulpy contents hurt his teeth .   he chewed it gingerly .  city dwellers ate natural food  of course  whenever rations allowed it .  he himself had eaten natural meat and bread often .  but such food had always been processed in some way .  it had been cooked or ground  blended or compounded .  fruit  now  properly speaking  should come in the form of sauce or preserve .  what he was holding now must have come straight from the dirt of a planet   s soil .   he thought  i hope they   ve washed it at least .   again he wondered at the spottiness of spacer notions concerning cleanliness .   fastolfe said     let me introduce myself a bit more specifically .  i am in charge of the investigation of the murder of dr .  sarton at the spacetown end as commissioner enderby is at the city end .  if i can help you in any way  i stand ready to do so .  we are as eager for a quiet solution of the affair and prevention of future incidents of the sort as any of you city men can be .         thank you  dr .  fastolfe     said baley .     your attitude is appreciated .      so much  he thought  for the amenities .  he bit into the center of the apple and hard  dark little ovoids popped into his mouth .  he spat automatically .  they flew out and fell to the ground .  one would have struck fastolfe   s leg had not the spacer moved it hastily .   baley reddened  started to bend .   fastolfe said  pleasantly     it is quite all right  mr .  baley .  just leave them  please .      baley straightened again .  he put the apple down gingerly .  he had the uncomfortable feeling that once he was gone  the lost little objects would be found and picked up by suction  the bowl of fruit would be burnt or discarded far from spacetown  the very room they were sitting in would be sprayed with viricide .   he covered his embarrassment with brusqueness .  he said     i would like to ask permission to have commissioner enderby join our conference by trimensional personification .      fastolfe   s eyebrows raised .     certainly  if you wish it .  daneel  would you make the connection .      baley sat in stiff discomfort until the shiny surface of the large parallel piped in one corner of the room dissolved away to show commissioner julius enderby and part of his desk .  at that moment  the discomfort eased and baley felt nothing short of love for that familiar figure  and a longing to be safely back in that office with him  or anywhere in the city  for that matter .  even in the least prepossessing portion of the jersey yeast vat districts .   now that he had his witness  baley saw no reason for delay .  he said     i believe i have penetrated the mystery surrounding the death of dr .  sarton .      out of the corner of his eye  he saw enderby springing to his feet and grabbing wildly  and successfully  at his flying spectacles .  by standing  the commissioner thrust his head out of the limits of the trimensic receiver and was forced to sit down again  red faced and speechless .   in a much quieter way  dr .  fastolfe  head inclined to one side  was as startled .  only r .  daneel was unmoved .      do you mean     said fastolfe     that you know the murderer .         no     said baley     i mean there was no murder .         what .     screamed enderby .      one moment  commissioner enderby     said fastolfe  raising a hand .  his eyes held baley   s and he said     do you mean that dr .  sarton is alive .         yes  sir  and i believe i know where he is .         where .         right there     said baley  and pointed firmly at r .  daneel olivaw .       chapter     debate over a robot   at the moment  baley was most conscious of the thud of his own pulse .  he seemed to be living in a moment of suspended time .  r .  daneel   s expression was  as always  empty of emotion .  han fastolfe wore a look of well bred astonishment on his face and nothing more .  it was commissioner julius enderby   s reaction that most concerned baley  however .  the trimensic receiver out of which his face stared did not allow of perfect reproduction .  there was always that tiny flicker and that not quite ideal resolution .  through that imperfection and through the further masking of the commissioner   s spectacles  enderby   s eyes were unreadable .   baley thought  don   t go to pieces on me  julius .  i need you .   he didn   t really think that fastolfe would act in haste or under emotional impulse .  he had read somewhere once that spacers had no religion  but substituted  instead  a cold and phlegmatic intellectualism raised to the heights of a philosophy .  he believed that and counted on it .  they would make a point of acting slowly and then only on the basis of reason .   if he were alone among them and had said what he had said  he was certain that he would never have returned to the city .  cold reason would have dictated that .  the spacers    plans were worth more to them  many times over  than the life of a city dweller .  there would be some excuse made to julius enderby .  maybe they would present his corpse to the commissioner  shake their heads  and speak of an earthman conspiracy having struck again .  the commissioner would believe them .  it was the way he was built .  if he hated spacers  it was a hatred based on fear .  he wouldn   t dare disbelieve them .   that was why he had to be an actual witness of events  a witness  moreover  safely out of reach of the spacers    calculated safety measures .   the commissioner said  chokingly     lije  you   re all wrong .  i saw dr .  sarton   s corpse .         you saw the charred remnants of something you were told was dr .  sarton   s corpse     retorted baley  boldly .  he thought grimly of the commissioner   s broken glasses .  that had been an unexpected favor for the spacers .      no  no  lije .  i knew dr .  sarton well and his head was undamaged .  it was he .     the commissioner put his hand to his glasses uneasily  as though he  too  remembered  and added     i looked at him closely  very closely .         how about this one  commissioner .     asked baley  pointing to r .  daneel again .     doesn   t he resemble dr .  sarton .         yes  the way a statue would .         an expressionless attitude can be assumed  commissioner .  suppose that were a robot you had seen blasted to death .  you say you looked closely .  did you look closely enough to see whether the charred surface at the edge of the blast was really decomposed organic tissue or a deliberately introduced layer of carbonization over fused metal .      the commissioner looked revolted .  he said     you   re being ridiculous .      baley turned to the spacer .     are you willing to have the body exhumed for examination  dr .  fastolfe .      dr .  fastolfe smiled .     ordinarily  i would have no objection  mr .  baley  but i   m afraid we do not bury our dead .  cremation is a universal custom among us .         very convenient     said baley .      tell me  mr .  baley     said dr .  fastolfe     just how did you arrive at this very extraordinary conclusion of yours .      baley thought  he isn   t giving up .  he   ll brazen it out  if he can .  he said     it wasn   t difficult .  there   s more to imitating a robot than just putting on a frozen expression and adopting a stilted style of conversation .  the trouble with you men of the outer worlds is that you   re too used to robots .  you   ve gotten to accept them almost as human beings .  you   ve grown blind to the differences .  on earth  it   s different .  we   re very conscious of what a robot is .      now in the first place  r .  daneel is too good a human to be a robot .  my first impression of him was that he was a spacer .  it was quite an effort for me to adjust myself to his statement that he was a robot .  and of course  the reason for that was that he was a spacer and wasn   t a robot .      r .  daneel interrupted  without any sign of self consciousness at being himself so intimately the topic of debate .  he said     as i told you  partner elijah  i was designed to take a temporary place in a human society .  the resemblance to humanity is purposeful .         even     asked baley     down to the painstaking duplication of those portions of the body which  in the ordinary course of events  would always be covered by clothes .  even to the duplication of organs which  in a robot  would have no conceivable function .      enderby said suddenly     how did you find that out .      baley reddened .     i couldn   t help noticing in the  in the personal .      enderby looked shocked .   fastolfe said     surely you understand that a resemblance must be complete if it is to be useful .  for our purposes  half measures are as bad as nothing at all .      baley asked abruptly     may i smoke .      three pipefuls in one day was a ridiculous extravagance  but he was riding a rolling torrent of recklessness and needed the release of tobacco .  after all  he was talking back to spacers .  he was going to force their lies down their own throats .   fastolfe said     i   m sorry  but i   d prefer that you didn   t .      it was a    preference    that had the force of a command .  baley felt that .  he thrust back the pipe  the bowl of which he had already taken into his hand in anticipation of automatic permission .   of course not  he thought bitterly .  enderby didn   t warn me  because he doesn   t smoke himself  but it   s obvious .  it follows .  they don   t smoke on their hygienic outer worlds  or drink  or have any human vices .  no wonder they accept robots in their damned  what did r .  daneel call it .   c fe society .  no wonder r .  daneel can play the robot as well as he does .  they   re all robots out there to begin with .   he said     the too complete resemblance is just one point out of a number .  there was a near riot in my section as i was taking him home .      he had to point .  he could not bring himself to say either r .  daneel or dr .  sarton .      it was he that stopped the trouble and he did it by pointing a blaster at the potential rioters .         good lord     said enderby  energetically     the report stated that it was you          i know  commissioner     said baley .     the report was based on information that i gave .  i didn   t want to have it on the record that a robot had threatened to blast men and women .         no  no .  of course not .     enderby was quite obviously horrified .  he leaned forward to look at something that was out of the range of the trimensic receiver .   baley could guess what it was .  the commissioner was checking the power gauge to see if the transmitter were being tapped .      is that a point in your argument .     asked fastolfe .      it certainly is .  the first law of robotics states that a robot cannot harm a human being .         but r .  daneel did no harm .         true .  he even stated afterward that he wouldn   t have fired under any circumstances .  still  no robot i ever heard of could have violated the spirit of the first law to the extent of threatening to blast a man  even if he really had no intention to do so .         i see .  are you a robotics expert  mr .  baley .         no  sir .  but i   ve had a course in general robotics and in positronic analysis .  i   m not completely ignorant .         that   s nice     said fastolfe  agreeably     but you see  i am a robotics expert  and i assure you that the essence of the robot mind lies in a completely literal interpretation of the universe .  it recognizes no spirit in the first law  only the letter .  the simple models you have on earth may have their first law so overlaid with additional safeguards that  to be sure  they may well be incapable of threatening a human .  an advanced model such as r .  daneel is another matter .  if i gather the situation correctly  daneel   s threat was necessary to prevent a riot .  it was intended then to prevent harm to human beings .  he was obeying the first law  not defying it .      baley squirmed inwardly  but maintained a tight external calm .  it would go hard  but he would match this spacer at his own game .   he said     you may counter each point separately  but they add up just the same .  last evening in our discussion of the so called murder  this alleged robot claimed that he had been converted into a detective by the installation of a new drive into his positronic circuits .  a drive  if you please  for justice .         i   ll vouch for that     said fastolfe .     it was done to him three days ago under my own supervision .         a drive for justice .  justice  dr .  fastolfe  is an abstraction .  only a human being can use the term .         if you define    justice    in such a way that it is an abstraction  if you say that it is the rendering of each man his due  that it is adhering to the right  or anything of the sort  i grant you your argument  mr .  baley .  a human understanding of abstractions cannot be built into a positronic brain in the present state of our knowledge .         you admit that  then  as an expert in robotics .         certainly .  the question is  what did r .  daneel mean by using the term    justice    .         from the context of our conversation  he meant what you and i and any human being would mean  but what no robot could mean .         why don   t you ask him  mr .  baley  to define the term .      baley felt a certain loss of confidence .  he turned to r .  daneel .     well .         yes  elijah .         what is your definition of justice .         justice  elijah  is that which exists when all the laws are enforced .      fastolfe nodded .     a good definition  mr .  baley  for a robot .  the desire to see all laws enforced has been built into r .  daneel  now .  justice is a very concrete term to him since it is based on law enforcement  which is in turn based upon the existence of specific and definite laws .  there is nothing abstract about it .  a human being can recognize the fact that  on the basis of an abstract moral code  some laws may be bad ones and their enforcement unjust .  what do you say  r .  daneel .         an unjust law     said r .  daneel evenly     is a contradiction in terms .         to a robot it is  mr .  baley .  so you see  you mustn   t confuse your justice and r .  daneel   s .      baley turned to r .  daneel sharply and said     you left my apartment last night .      r .  daneel replied     i did .  if my leaving disturbed your sleep  i am sorry .         where did you go .         to the men   s personal .      for a moment  baley was staggered .  it was the answer he had already decided was the truth  but he had not expected it to be the answer r .  daneel would give .  he felt a little more of his certainty oozing away  yet he held firmly on his track .  the commissioner was watching  his lensed eyes flicking from one to the other as they spoke .  baley couldn   t back down now  no matter what sophistries they used against him .  he had to hold to his point .   he said     on reaching my section  he insisted on entering personal with me .  his excuse was a poor one .  during the night  he left to visit personal again as he has just admitted .  if he were a man  i   d say he had every reason and right to do so .  obviously .  as a robot  however  the trip was meaningless .  the conclusion can only be that he is a man .      fastolfe nodded .  he seemed not in the least put out .  he said     this is most interesting .  suppose we ask daneel why he made his trip to personal last night .      commissioner enderby leaned forward .     please  dr .  fastolfe     he muttered     it is not proper to          you need not be concerned  commissioner     said fastolfe  his thin lips curving back in something that looked like a smile but wasn   t     i am certain that daneel   s answer will not offend your sensibilities or those of mr .  baley .  won   t you tell us  daneel .      r .  daneel said     elijah   s wife  jessie  left the apartment last night on friendly terms with me .  it was quite obvious that she had no reason for thinking me to be other than human .  she returned to the apartment knowing i was a robot .  the obvious conclusion is that the information to that effect exists outside the apartment .  it followed that my conversation with elijah last night had been overheard .  in no other way could the secret of my true nature have become common knowledge .      elijah told me that the apartments were well insulated .  we spoke together in low voices .  ordinary eavesdropping would not do .  still  it was known that elijah is a policeman .  if a conspiracy exists within the city sufficiently well organized to have planned the murder of dr .  sarton  they may well have been aware that elijah had been placed in charge of the murder investigation .  it would fall within the realm of possibility then  even of probability  that his apartment had been spybeamed .      i searched the apartment as well as i could after elijah and jessie had gone to bed  but could find no transmitter .  this complicated matters .  a focused duo beam could do the trick even in the absence of a transmitter  but that requires rather elaborate equipment .      analysis of the situation led to the following conclusion .  the one place where a city dweller can do almost anything without being disturbed or questioned is in the personals .  he could even set up a duo beam .  the custom of absolute privacy in the personals is very strong and other men would not even look at him .  the section personal is quite close to elijah   s apartment  so that the distance factor is not important .  a suitcase model could be used .  i went to the personal to investigate .         and what did you find .     asked baley quickly .      nothing  elijah .  no sign of a duo beam .      dr .  fastolfe said     well  mr .  baley  does this sound reasonable to you .      but baley   s uncertainty was gone  now .  he said     reasonable as far as it goes  perhaps  but it stops short of perfection by a hell of a way .  what he doesn   t know is that my wife told me where she got the information and when .  she learned he was a robot shortly after she left the house .  even then  the rumor had been circulating for hours .  so the fact that he was a robot could not have leaked out through spying on our last evening   s conversation .         nevertheless     said dr .  fastolfe     his action last night of going to the personal stands explained  i think .         but something is brought up that is not explained     retorted baley  heatedly .     when  where  and how was the leak .  how did the news get about that there was a spacer robot in the city .  as far as i know  only two of us knew about the deal  commissioner enderby and myself  and we told no one .    commissioner  did anyone else in the department know .         no     said enderby  anxiously .     not even the mayor .  only we  and dr .  fastolfe .         and he     added baley  pointing .      i .     asked r .  daneel .      why not .         i was with you at all times  elijah .         you were not     cried baley  fiercely .     i was in personal for half an hour or more before we went to my apartment .  during that time  we two were completely out of contact with one another .  it was then that you got in touch with your group in the city .         what group .     asked fastolfe .   and    what group .     echoed commissioner enderby almost simultaneously .   baley rose from his chair and turned to the trimensic receiver .     commissioner  i want you to listen closely to this .  tell me if it doesn   t all fall into a pattern .  a murder is reported and by a curious coincidence it happens just as you are entering spacetown to keep an appointment with the murdered man .  you are shown the corpse of something supposed to be human  but the corpse has since been disposed of and is not available for close examination .      the spacers insist an earthman did the killing  even though the only way they can make such an accusation stick is to suppose that a city man had left the city and cut cross country to spacetown alone and at night .  you know damn well how unlikely that is .      next they send a supposed robot into the city  in fact  they insist on sending him .  the first thing the robot does is to threaten a crowd of human beings with a blaster .  the second is to set in motion the rumor that there is a spacer robot in the city .  in fact  the rumor is so specific that jessie told me it was known that he was working with the police .  that means that before long it will be known that it was the robot who handled the blaster .  maybe even now the rumor is spreading across the yeast vat country and down the long island hydroponic plants that there   s a killer robot on the loose .         this is impossible .  impossible .     groaned enderby .      no  it isn   t .  it   s exactly what   s happening  commissioner .  don   t you see it .  there   s a conspiracy in the city  all right  but it   s run from spacetown .  the spacers want to be able to report a murder .  they want riots .  they want an assault on spacetown .  the worse things get  the better the incident  and spacer ships come down and occupy the cities of earth .      fastolfe said  mildly     we had an excuse in the barrier riots of twenty five years ago .         you weren   t ready then .  you are now .     baley   s heart was pounding madly .      this is quite a complicated plot you   re attributing to us  mr .  baley .  if we wanted to occupy earth  we could do so in much simpler fashion .      maybe not  dr .  fastolfe .  your so called robot told me that public opinion concerning earth is by no means unified on your outer worlds .  i think he was telling the truth at that time  anyway .  maybe an outright occupation wouldn   t sit well with the people at home .  maybe an incident is an absolute necessity .  a good shocking incident .         like a murder  eh .  is that it .  you   ll admit it would have to be a pretended murder .  you won   t suggest  i hope  that we   d really kill one of ourselves for the sake of an incident .         you built a robot to look like dr .  sarton  blasted the robot  and showed the remains to commissioner enderby .         and then     said dr .  fastolfe     having used r .  daneel to impersonate dr .  sarton in the false murder  we have to use dr .  sarton to impersonate r .  daneel in the false investigation of the false murder .         exactly .  i am telling you this in the presence of a witness who is not here in the flesh and whom you cannot blast out of existence and who is important enough to be believed by the city government and by washington itself .  we will be prepared for you and we know what your intentions are .  if necessary  our government will report directly to your people  expose the situation for exactly what it is .  i doubt if this sort of interstellar rape will be tolerated .      fastolfe shook his head .     please  mr .  baley  you are being unreasonable .  really  you have the most astonishing notions .  suppose now  just quietly suppose  that r .  daneel is really r .  daneel .  suppose he is actually a robot .  wouldn   t it follow that the corpse commissioner enderby saw was really dr .  sarton .  it would be scarcely reasonable to believe that the corpse were still another robot .  commissioner enderby witnessed r .  daneel under construction and can vouch for the fact that only one existed .         if it comes to that     said baley  stubbornly     the commissioner is not a robotics expert .  you might have had a dozen such robots .         stick to the point  mr .  baley .  what if r .  daneel is really r .  daneel .  would not the entire structure of your reasoning fall to the ground .  would you have any further basis for your belief in this completely melodramatic and implausible interstellar plot you have constructed .         if he is a robot .  i say he is human .         yet you haven   t really investigated the problem  mr .  baley     said fastolfe .     to differentiate a robot  even a very humanoid robot  from a human being  it isn   t necessary to make elaborately shaky deductions from little things he says and does .  for instance  have you tried sticking a pin into r .  daneel .         what .     baley   s mouth fell open .      it   s a simple experiment .  there are others perhaps not quite so simple .  his skin and hair look real  but have you tried looking at them under adequate magnification .  then again  he seems to breathe  particularly when he is using air to talk  but have you noticed that his breathing is irregular  that minutes may go by during which he has no breath at all .  you might even have trapped some of his expired air and measured the carbon dioxide content .  you might have tried to draw a sample of blood .  you might have tried to detect a pulse in his wrist  or a heartbeat under his shirt .  do you see what i mean  mr .  baley .         that   s just talk     said baley  uneasily .     i   m not going to be bluffed .  i might have tried any of those things  but do you suppose this alleged robot would have let me bring a hypodermic to him  or a stethoscope or a microscope .         of course .  i see your point     said fastolfe .  he looked at r .  daneel and gestured slightly .   r .  daneel touched the cuff of his right shirt sleeve and the diamagnetic seam fell apart the entire length of his arm .  a smooth  sinewy  and apparently entirely human limb lay exposed .  its short  bronze hairs  both in quantity and distribution  were exactly what one would expect of a human being .   baley said     so .      r .  daneel pinched the ball of his right middle finger with the thumb and forefinger of his left hand .  exactly what the details of the manipulation that followed were  baley could not see .   but  just as the fabric of the sleeve had fallen in two when the diamagnetic field of its seam had been interrupted  so now the arm itself fell in two .   there  under a thin layer of fleshlike material  was the dull blue gray of stainless steel rods  cords  and joints .      would you care to examine daneel   s workings more closely  mr .  baley .     asked dr .  fastolfe politely .   baley could scarcely hear the remark for the buzzing in his ears and for the sudden jarring of the commissioner   s high pitched and hysterical laughter .       chapter     elucidation by a spacer   the minutes passed and the buzzing grew louder and drowned out the laughter .  the dome and all it contained wavered and baley   s time sense wavered  too .   at least  he found himself sitting in an unchanged position but with a definite feeling of lost time .  the commissioner was gone  the trimensic receiver was milky and opaque  and r .  daneel sat at his side  pinching up the skin of baley   s bared upper arm .  baley could see  just beneath the skin  the small thin darkness of a hypo sliver .  it vanished as he watched  soaking and spreading away into the intercellular fluid  from that into the blood stream and the neighboring cells  from that into all the cells of his body .   his grip on reality heightened .      do you feel better  partner elijah .     asked r .  daneel .   baley did .  he pulled at his arm and the robot let him take it away .  he rolled down his sleeve and looked about .  dr .  fastolfe sat where he had been  a small smile softening the homeliness of his face .   baley said     did i black out .      dr .  fastolfe said     in a way  yes .  you received a sizable shock  i   m afraid .      it came back to baley quite clearly .  he seized r .  daneel   s nearer arm quickly  forcing up the sleeve as far as it would go  exposing the wrist .  the robot   s flesh felt soft to his fingers  but underneath was the hardness of something more than bone .   r .  daneel let his arm rest easily in the plain clothes man   s grip .  baley stared at it  pinching the skin along the median line .  was there a faint seam .   it was logical  of course  that there should be .  a robot  covered with synthetic skin  and deliberately made to look human  could not be repaired in the ordinary fashion .  a chest plate could not be unriveted for the purpose .  a skull could not be hinged up and outward .  instead  the various parts of the mechanical body would have to be put together along a line of micromagnetic fields .  an arm  a head  an entire body  must fall in two at the proper touch  then come together again at a contrary touch .   baley looked up .     where   s the commissioner .     he mumbled  hot with mortification .      pressing business     said dr .  fastolfe .     i encouraged him to leave  i   m afraid .  i assured him we would take care of you .         you   ve taken care of me quite nicely already  thank you     said baley  grimly .     i think our business is done .      he lifted himself erect on tired joints .  he felt an old man  very suddenly .  too old to start over again .  he needed no deep insight to foresee that future .   the commissioner would be half frightened and half furious .  he would face baley whitely  taking his glasses off to wipe them every fifteen seconds .  his soft voice  julius enderby almost never shouted  would explain carefully that the spacers had been mortally offended .      you can   t talk to spacers that way  lije .  they won   t take it .      baley could hear enderby   s voice very plainly down to the finest shade of intonation .      i warned you .  no saying how much damage you   ve done .  i can see your point  mind you .  i see what you were trying to do .  if they were earthmen  it would be different .  i   d say yes  chance it .  run the risk .  smoke them out .  but spacers .  you might have told me  lije .  you might have consulted me .  i know them .  i know them inside and out .      and what would baley be able to say .  that enderby was exactly the man he couldn   t tell .  that the project was one of tremendous risk and enderby a man of tremendous caution .  that it had been enderby himself who had pointed up the supreme dangers of either outright failure or of the wrong kind of success .  that the one way of defeating declassification was to show that guilt lay in spacetown itself  .  .  .   enderby would say     there   ll have to be a report on this  lije .  there   ll be all sorts of repercussions .  i know the spacers .  they   ll demand your removal from the case  and it   ll have to be that way .  you understand that  lije  don   t you .  i   ll try to make it easy on you .  you can count on that .  i   ll protect you as far as i can  lije .      baley knew that would be exactly true .  the commissioner would protect him  but only as far as he could  not to the point  for instance  of infuriating further an angry mayor .   he could hear the mayor  too .     damn it  enderby  what is all this .  why wasn   t i consulted .  who   s running the city .  why was an unauthorized robot allowed inside the city .  and just what the devil did this baley  .  .  .      if it came to a choice between baley   s future in the department and the commissioner   s own  what possible result could baley expect .  he could find no reasonable way of blaming enderby .   the least he could expect was demotion  and that was bad enough .  the mere act of living in a modern city insured the bare possibility of existence  even for those entirely declassified .  how bare that possibility was he knew only too well .   it was the addition of status that brought the little things  a more comfortable seat here  a better cut of meat there  a shorter wait in line at the other place .  to the philosophical mind  these items might seem scarcely worth any great trouble to acquire .   yet no one  however philosophical  could give up those privileges  once acquired  without a pang .  that was the point .   what a trifling addition to the convenience of the apartment an activated washbasin was when for thirty years previously the trip to personal had been an automatic and unregarded one .  how useless it was even as a device to prove    status    when it was considered the height of ill form to parade    status .     yet were the washbasin to be deactivated  how humiliating and unbearable would each added trip to personal be .  how yearningly attractive the memory of the bedroom shave .  how filled with a sense of lost luxury .   it was fashionable for modern political writers to look back with a smug disapproval at the    fiscalism    of medieval times  when economy was based on money .  the competitive struggle for existence  they said  was brutal .  no truly complex society could be maintained because of the strains introduced by the eternal    fight for the buck .      scholars had varying interpretations of the word    buck     but there was no dispute over the meaning as a whole .    by contrast  modern    civism    was praised highly as efficient and enlightened .   maybe so .  there were historical novels both in the romantic and the sensational tradition  and the medievalists thought    fiscalism    had bred such things as individualism and initiative .   baley wouldn   t commit himself  but now he wondered sickly if ever a man fought harder for that buck  whatever it was  or felt its loss more deeply  than a city dweller fought to keep from losing his sunday night option on a chicken drumstick  a real flesh drumstick from a once living bird .   baley thought  not me so much .  there   s jessie and ben .   dr .  fastolfe   s voice broke in upon his thoughts .     mr .  baley  do you hear me .      baley blinked .     yes .     how long had he been standing there like a frozen fool .      won   t you sit down  sir .  having taken care of the matter on your mind  you may now be interested in some films we have taken of the scene of the crime and of the events immediately following .         no  thank you .  i have business in the city .         surely the case of dr .  sarton comes first .         not with me .  i imagine i   m off the case already .     suddenly  he boiled over .     damn it  if you could prove r .  daneel was a robot  why didn   t you do it at once .  why did you make such a farce of it all .         my dear mr .  baley  i was very interested in your deductions .  as for being off the case  i doubt it .  before the commissioner left  i made a special point of asking that you be retained .  i believe he will co operate .      baley sat down  not entirely voluntarily .  he said  sharply     why .     dr .  fastolfe crossed his legs and sighed .     mr .  baley  in general i have met two kinds of city dwellers  rioters and politicians .  your commissioner is useful to us  but he is a politician .  he tells us what we want to hear .  he handles us  if you know what i mean .  now you came here and boldly accused us of tremendous crimes and tried to prove your case .  i enjoyed the process .  i found it a hopeful development .         how hopeful .     asked baley sardonically .      hopeful enough .  you are someone i can deal with frankly .  last night  mr .  baley  r .  daneel reported to me by shielded subether .  some things about you interested me very much .  for instance  there was the point concerning the nature of the book films in your apartment .         what about them .         a good many dealt with historical and archaeological subjects .  it makes it appear that you are interested in human society and that you know a little about its evolution .         even policemen can spend their free time on book films  if they so choose .         quite .  i   m glad of your choice in viewing matter .  it will help me in what i am trying to do .  in the first place  i want to explain  or try to  the exclusivism of the men of the outer worlds .  we live here in spacetown  we don   t enter the city  we mingle with you city dwellers only in a very rigidly limited fashion .  we breathe the open air  but when we do  we wear filters .  i sit here now with filters in my nostrils  gloves on my hands  and a fixed determination to come no closer to you than i can help .  why do you suppose that is .      baley said     there   s no point in guessing .     let him talk now .      if you guessed as some of your people do  you would say that it was because we despised the men of earth and refused to lose caste by allowing their shadow to fall upon us .  that is not so .  the true answer is really quite obvious .  the medical examination you went through  as well as the cleansing procedures  were not matters of ritual .  they were dictated by necessity .         disease .         yes  disease .  my dear mr .  baley  the earthmen who colonized the outer worlds found themselves on planets entirely free of terrestrial bacteria and viruses .  they brought in their own  of course  but they also brought with them the latest medical and microbiological techniques .  they had a small community of micro organisms to deal with and no intermediate hosts .  there were no mosquitoes to spread malaria  no snails to spread schistosomiasis .  disease agents were wiped out and symbiotic bacteria allowed to grow .  gradually  the outer worlds became disease free .  naturally  as time went on  entrance requirements for immigrant earthmen were made more and more rigorous  since less and less could the outer worlds endure the possible introduction of disease .         you   ve never been sick  dr .  fastolfe .         not with a parasitic disease  mr .  baley .  we are all liable to degenerative diseases such as atheroschlerosis  of course  but i have never had what you would call a cold .  if i were to contract one  i might die of it .  i   ve built up no resistance to it whatsoever .  that   s what   s wrong with us here in spacetown .  those of us who come here run a definite risk .  earth is riddled with diseases to which we have no defense  no natural defense .  you yourself are carrying the germs of almost every known disease .  you are not aware of it  since you keep them all under control at almost all times through the antibodies your body has developed over the years .  i  myself  lack the antibodies .  do you wonder that i come no closer to you .  believe me  mr .  baley  i act aloof only in self defense .      baley said     if this is so  why isn   t the fact made known on earth .  i mean  that it is not just queasiness on your part  but a defense against an actual physical danger .      the spacer shook his head .     we are few  mr .  baley  and are disliked as foreigners anyway .  we maintain our own safety on the basis of a rather shaky prestige as a superior class of being .  we cannot afford to lose face by admitting that we are afraid to approach an earthman .  not at least until there is a better understanding between earthmen and spacers .         there won   t be  on present terms .  it   s your supposed superiority that we  they hate you for .         it is a dilemma .  don   t think we aren   t aware of it .         does the commissioner know of this .         we have never explained it to him flatly  as i have just done to you .  he may guess it  however .  he is quite an intelligent man .         if he guessed it  he might have told me     baley said reflectively .   dr .  fastolfe lifted his eyebrows .     if he had  then you wouldn   t have considered the possibility of r .  daneel being a human spacer .  is that it .      baley shrugged slightly  tossing the matter to one side .   but dr .  fastolfe went on     that   s quite true  you know .  putting the psychological difficulties to one side  the terrible effect of the noise and crowds upon us  the fact remains that for one of us to enter the city is the equivalent of a death sentence .  it is why dr .  sarton initiated his project of humanoid robots .  they were substitute men  designed to enter the city instead of us          yes .  r .  daneel explained this to me .         do you disapprove .         look     said baley     since we   re talking to one another so freely  let me ask a question in simple words .  why have you spacers come to earth anyway .  why don   t you leave us alone .      dr .  fastolfe said  with obvious surprise     are you satisfied with life on earth .         we get along .         yes  but for how long will that continue .  your population goes up continuously  the available calories meet the needs only as a result of greater and greater effort .  earth is in a blind alley  man .         we get along     repeated baley stubbornly .      barely .  a city like new york must spend every ounce of effort getting water in and waste out .  the nuclear power plants are kept going by uranium supplies that are constantly more difficult to obtain even from the other planets of the system  and the supply needed goes up steadily .  the life of the city depends every moment on the arrival of wood pulp for the yeast vats and minerals for the hydroponic plants .  air must be circulated unceasingly .  the balance is a very delicate one in a hundred directions  and growing more delicate each year .  what would happen to new york if the tremendous flow of input and outgo were to be interrupted for even a single hour .         it never has been .         which is no security for the future .  in primitive times  individual population centers were virtually self supporting  living on the produce of neighboring farms .  nothing but immediate disaster  a flood or a pestilence or crop failure  could harm them .  as the centers grew and technology improved  localized disasters could be overcome by drawing on help from distant centers  but at the cost of making ever larger areas interdependent .  in medieval times  the open cities  even the largest  could subsist on food stores and on emergency supplies of all sorts for a week at least .  when new york first became a city  it could have lived on itself for a day .  now it cannot do so for an hour .  a disaster that would have been uncomfortable ten thousand years ago  merely serious a thousand years ago  and acute a hundred years ago would now be surely fatal .      baley moved restlessly in his chair .     i   ve heard all this before .  the medievalists want an end to cities .  they want us to get back to the soil and to natural agriculture .  well  they   re mad  we can   t .  there are too many of us and you can   t go backward in history  only forward .  of course  if emigration to the outer worlds were not restricted          you know why it must be restricted .         then what is there to do .  you   re tapping a dead power line .         what about emigration to new worlds .  there are a hundred billion stars in the galaxy .  it is estimated that there are a hundred million planets that are inhabitable or can be made inhabitable .         that   s ridiculous .         why .     asked dr .  fastolfe  with vehemence .     why is the suggestion ridiculous .  earthmen have colonized planets in the past .  over thirty of the fifty outer worlds  including my native aurora  were directly colonized by earthmen .  is colonization no longer possible .         well  .  .  .         no answer .  let me suggest that if it is no longer possible  it is because of the development of city culture on earth .  before the cities  human life on earth wasn   t so specialized that they couldn   t break loose and start all over on a raw world .  they did it thirty times .  but now  earthmen are all so coddled  so enwombed in their imprisoning caves of steel  that they are caught forever .  you  mr .  baley  won   t even believe that a city dweller is capable of crossing country to get to spacetown .  crossing space to get to a new world must represent impossibility squared to you .  civism is ruining earth  sir .      baley said angrily     and if it does .  how does it concern you people .  it   s our problem .  we   ll solve it .  if not  it   s our own particular road to hell .         better your own road to hell than another   s road to heaven  eh .  i know how you must feel .  it is not pleasant to listen to the preaching of a stranger .  yet i wish your people could preach to us  for we  too  have a problem  one that is quite analogous to yours .      baley smiled crookedly .     overpopulation .         analogous  not identical .  ours is underpopulation .  how old would you say i was .      the earthman considered for a moment and then deliberately overestimated .     sixty  i   d say .         a hundred and sixty  you should say .         what .         a hundred and sixty three next birthday  to be exact .  there   s no trick to that .  i   m using the standard earth year as the unit .  if i   m fortunate  if i take care of myself  most of all  if i catch no disease on earth  i may double that age .  men on aurora have been known to live over three hundred and fifty years .  and life expectancy is still increasing .      baley looked to r .  daneel  who throughout the conversation had been listening in stolid silence   as though he were seeking confirmation .   he said     how is that possible .         in an underpopulated society  it is practical to concentrate study on gerontology  to do research on the aging process .  in a world such as yours  a lengthened life expectancy would be disastrous .  you couldn   t afford the resulting rise in population .  on aurora  there is room for tricentenarians .  then  of course  a long life becomes doubly and triply precious .      if you were to die now  you would lose perhaps forty years of your life  probably less .  if i were to die  i would lose a hundred fifty years  probably more .  in a culture such as ours  then  individual life is of prime importance .  our birth rate is low and population increase is rigidly controlled .  we maintain a definite robot man ratio designed to maintain the individual in the greatest comfort .  logically  developing children are carefully screened for physical and mental defects before being allowed to mature .      baley interrupted .     you mean you kill them if they don   t          if they don   t measure up .  quite painlessly  i assure you .  the notion shocks you  just as the earthman   s uncontrolled breeding shocks us .         we   re controlled  dr .  fastolfe .  each family is allowed so many children .      dr .  fastolfe smiled tolerantly .     so many of any kind of children  not so many healthy children .  and even so  there are many illegitimates and your population increases .         who   s to judge which children should live .         that   s rather complicated and not to be answered in a sentence .  some day we may talk it out in detail .         well  where   s your problem .  you sound satisfied with your society .         it is stable .  that   s the trouble .  it is too stable .      baley said     nothing pleases you .  our civilization is at the ragged edge of chaos  according to you  and your own is too stable .         it is possible to be too stable .  no outer world has colonized a new planet in two and a half centuries .  there is no prospect for colonization in the future .  our lives in the outer worlds are too long to risk and too comfortable to upset .         i don   t know about that  dr .  fastolfe .  you   ve come to earth .  you risk disease .         yes  i do .  there are some of us  mr .  baley  who feel that the future of the human race is even worth the possible loss of an extended lifetime .  too few of us  i am sorry to say .         all right .  we   re coming to the point .  how is spacetown helping matters .         in trying to introduce robots here on earth  we   re doing our best to upset the balance of your city economy .         that   s your way of helping .     baley   s lips quivered .     you mean you   re creating a growing group of displaced and declassified men on purpose .         not out of cruelty or callousness  believe me .  a group of displaced men  as you call them  are what we need to serve as a nucleus for colonization .  your ancient america was discovered by ships fitted out with men from the prisons .  don   t you see that the city   s womb has failed the displaced man .  he has nothing to lose and worlds to gain by leaving earth .         but it isn   t working .         no  it isn   t     said dr .  fastolfe  sadly .     there is something wrong .  the resentment of the earthman for the robot blocks things .  yet those very robots can accompany humans  smooth the difficulties of initial adjustment to a raw world  make colonization practical .         then what .  more outer worlds .         no .  the outer worlds were established before civism had spread over earth  before the cities .  the new colonies will be built by humans who have the city background plus the beginnings of a c fe culture .  it will be a synthesis  a crossbreeding .  as it stands now  earth   s own structure must go ricketing down in the near future  the outer worlds will slowly degenerate and decay in a somewhat further future  but the new colonies will be a new and healthy strain  combining the best of both cultures .  by their reaction upon the older worlds  including earth  we ourselves may gain new life .         i don   t know .  it   s all misty  dr .  fastolfe .         it   s a dream  yes .  think about it .     abruptly the spacer rose to his feet .     i have spent more time with you than i intended .  in fact  more time than our health ordinances allow .  you will excuse me .      baley and r .  daneel left the dome .  sunlight  at a different angle  somewhat yellower  washed down upon them once again .  in baley  there was a vague wonder whether sunlight might not seem different on another world .  less harsh and brazen perhaps .  more acceptable .  another world .  the ugly spacer with the prominent ears had filled his mind with queer imaginings .  did the doctors of aurora once look at the child fastolfe and wonder if he ought to be allowed to mature .  wasn   t he too ugly .  or did their criteria include physical appearance at all .  when did ugliness become a deformity and what deformities .   but when the sunlight vanished and they entered the first door that led to the personal  the mood became harder to maintain .   baley shook his head with exasperation .  it was all ridiculous .  forcing earthmen to emigrate  to set up a new society .  it was nonsense .  what were these spacers really after .   he thought about it and came to no conclusion .   slowly  their squad car rolled down the vehicular lane .  reality was surging all about baley .  his blaster was a warm and comfortable weight against his hip .  the noise and vibrant life of the city was just as warm  just as comfortable .   for a moment  as the city closed in  his nose tingled to a slight and fugitive pungence .   he thought wonderingly  the city smells .   he thought of the twenty million human beings crammed into the steel walls of the great cave and for the first time in his life he smelled them with nostrils that had been washed clean by outdoor air .   he thought  would it be different on another world .  less people and more air cleaner .   but the afternoon roar of the city was all around them  the smell faded and was gone  and he felt a little ashamed of himself .   he let the drive rod in slowly and tapped a larger share of the beamed power .  the squad car accelerated sharply as it slanted down into the empty motorway .      daneel     he said .      yes  elijah .         why was dr .  fastolfe telling me all he did .         it seems probable to me  elijah  that he wished to impress you with the importance of the investigation .  we are not here just to solve a murder  but to save spacetown and with it  the future of the human race .      baley said dryly     i think he   d have been better off if he   d let me see the scene of the crime and interview the men who first found the body .         i doubt if you could have added anything  elijah .  we have been quite thorough .         have you .  you   ve got nothing .  not a clue .  not a suspect .         no  you are right .  the answer must be in the city .  to be accurate  though  we did have one suspect .         what .  you said nothing of this before .         i did not feel it to be necessary  elijah .  surely it is obvious to you that one suspect automatically existed .         who .  in the devil   s name  who .         the one earthman who was on the scene .  commissioner julius enderby .          chapter      afternoon of a plain clothes man   the squad car veered to one side  halted against the impersonal concrete wall of the motorway .  with the humming of its motor stopped  the silence was dead and thick .   baley looked at the robot next to him and said in an incongruously quiet voice     what .      time stretched while baley waited for an answer .  a small and lonesome vibration rose and reached a minor peak  then faded .  it was the sound of another squad car  boring its way past them on some unknown errand  perhaps a mile away .  or else it was a fire car hurrying along toward its own appointment with combustion .   a detached portion of baley   s mind wondered if any one man any longer knew all the motorways that twisted about in new york city   s bowels .  at no time in the day or night could the entire motorway system be completely empty  and yet there must be individual passages that no man had entered in years .  with sudden  devastating clarity  he remembered a short story he had viewed as a youngster .   it concerned the motorways of london and began  quietly enough  with a murder .  the murderer fled toward a prearranged hideout in the corner of a motorway in whose dust his own shoeprints had been the only disturbance for a century .  in that abandoned hole  he could wait in complete safety till the search died .   but he took a wrong turning and in the silence and loneness of those twisting corridors he swore a mad and blaspheming oath that  in spite of the trinity and all the saints  he would yet reach his haven .  from that time on  no turning was right .  he wandered through an unending maze from the brighton sector on the channel to norwich and from coventry to canterbury .  he burrowed endlessly beneath the great city of london from end to end of its sprawl across the southeastern corner of medieval england .  his clothes were rags and his shoes ribbons  his strength wore down but never left him .  he was tired  tired  but unable to stop .  he could only go on and on with only wrong turnings ahead of him .   sometimes he heard the sound of passing cars  but they were always in the next corridor  and however fast he rushed  for he would gladly have given himself up by then  the corridors he reached were always empty .  sometimes he saw an exit far ahead that would lead to the city   s life and breath  but it always glimmered further away as he approached until he would turn and it would be gone .   occasionally  londoners on official business through the underground would see a misty figure limping silently toward them  a semitransparent arm lifted in pleading  a mouth open and moving  but soundless .  as it approached  it would waver and vanish .   it was a story that hid lost the attributes of ordinary fiction and had entered the realm of folklore .  the    wandering londoner    had become a familiar phrase to all the world .   in the depths of new york city  baley remembered the story and stirred uneasily .   r .  daneel spoke and there was a small echo to his voice .  he said     we may be overheard .         down here .  not a chance .  now what about the commissioner .         he was on the scene  elijah .  he is a city dweller .  he was inevitably a suspect .         was .  is he still a suspect .         no .  his innocence was quickly established .  for one thing  there was no blaster in his possession .  there could not very well be one .  he had entered spacetown in the usual fashion  that was quite certain  and  as you know  blasters are removed as a matter of course .         was the murder weapon found at all  by the way .         no  elijah .  every blaster in spacetown was checked and none had been fired for weeks .  a check of the radiation chambers was quite conclusive .         then whoever had committed the murder had either hidden the weapon so well          it could not have been hidden anywhere in spacetown .  we were quite thorough .      baley said impatiently     i   m trying to consider all possibilities .  it was either hidden or it was carried away by the murderer when he left .         exactly .         and if you admit only the second possibility  then the commissioner is cleared .         yes .  as a precaution  of course  he was cerebroanalyzed .         what .         by cerebroanalysis  i mean the interpretation of the electromagnetic fields of the living brain cells .         oh     said baley  unenlightened .     and what does that tell you .         it gives us information concerning the temperamental and emotional makeup of an individual .  in the case of commissioner enderby  it told us that he was incapable of killing dr .  sarton .  quite incapable .         no     agreed baley .     he isn   t the type .  i could have told you that .         it is better to have objective information .  naturally  all our people in spacetown allowed themselves to be cerebroanalyzed as well .         all incapable  i suppose .         no question .  it is why we know that the murderer must be a city dweller .         well  then  all we have to do is pass the whole city under your cute little process .         it would not be very practical  elijah .  there might be millions temperamentally capable of the deed .         millions     grunted baley  thinking of the crowds of that long ago day who had screamed at the dirty spacers  and of the threatening and slobbering crowds outside the shoe store the night before .   he thought  poor julius .  a suspect .   he could hear the commissioner   s voice describing the period after the discovery of the body     it was brutal  brutal .     no wonder he broke his glasses in shock and dismay .  no wonder he did not want to return to spacetown .     i hate them     he had ground out between his teeth .  .   poor julius .  the man who could handle spacers .  the man whose greatest value to the city lay in his ability to get along with them .  how much did that contribute to his rapid promotions .   no wonder the commissioner had wanted baley to take over .  good old loyal  close mouthed baley .  college chum .  he would keep quiet if he found out about that little incident .  baley wondered how cerebroanalysis was carried out .  he imagined huge electrodes  busy pantographs skidding inklines across graphed paper  self adjusting gears clicking into place now and then .   poor julius .  if his state of mind were as appalled as it almost had a right to be  he might already be seeing himself at the end of his career with a forced letter of resignation in the hands of the mayor .   the squad car slanted up into the sublevels of city hall .   it was       when baley arrived back at his desk .  the commissioner was out .  r .  sammy  grinning  did not know where the commissioner was .   baley spent some time thinking .  the fact that he was hungry didn   t register .   at       r .  sammy came to his desk and said     the commissioner is in now  lije .      baley said     thanks .      for once he listened to r .  sammy without being annoyed .  r .  sammy  after all  was a kind of relation to r .  daneel  and r .  daneel obviously wasn   t a person  or thing  rather  to get annoyed with .  baley wondered how it would be on a new planet with men and robots starting even in a city culture .  he considered the situation quite dispassionately .   the commissioner was going through some documents as baley entered  stopping occasionally to make notations .   he said     that was a fairly giant size blooper you pulled out in spacetown .      it flooded back strongly .  the verbal duel with fastolfe .   his long face took on a lugubrious expression of chagrin .     i   ll admit i did  commissioner .  i   m sorry .      enderby looked up .  his expression was keen through his glasses .  he seemed more himself than at any time these thirty hours .  he said     no real matter .  fastolfe didn   t seem to mind  so we   ll forget it .  unpredictable  these spacers .  you don   t deserve your luck  lije .  next time you talk it over with me before you make like a one man subether hero      baley nodded .  the whole thing rolled off his shoulders .  he had tried a grandstand stunt and it hadn   t worked .  okay .  he was a little surprised that he could be so casual about it  but there it was .   he said     look  commissioner .  i want to have a two man apartment assigned to daneel and myself .  i   m not taking him home tonight .         what   s all this .         the news is out that he   s a robot .  remember .  maybe nothing will happen  but if there is a riot  i don   t want my family in the middle of it .         nonsense  lije .  i   ve had the thing checked .  there   s no such rumor in the city .         jessie got the story somewhere  commissioner .         well  there   s no organized rumor .  nothing dangerous .  i   ve been checking this ever since i got off the trimensic at fastolfe   s dome .  it was why i left .  i had to track it down  naturally  and fast .  anyway  here are the reports .  see for yourself .  there   s doris gillid   s report .  she went through a dozen women   s personals in different parts of the city .  you know doris .  she   s a competent girl .  well  nothing showed .  nothing showed anywhere .         then how did jessie get the rumor  commissioner .         it can be explained .  r .  daneel made a show of himself in the shoe store .  did he really pull a blaster  lije  or were you stretching it a little .         he really pulled one .  pointed it  too .      commissioner enderby shook his head .     all right .  someone recognized him .  as a robot  i mean .         hold on     said baley  indignantly .     you can   t tell him for a robot .         why not .         could you .  i couldn   t .         what does that prove .  we   re no experts .  suppose there was a technician out of the westchester robot factories in the crowd .  a professional .  a man who has spent his life building and designing robots .  he notices something queer about r .  daneel .  maybe in the way he talks or holds himself .  he speculates about it .  maybe he tells his wife .  she tells a few friends .  then it dies .  it   s too improbable .  people don   t believe it .  only it got to jessie before it died .         maybe     said baley  doubtfully .     but how about an assignment to a bachelor room for two  anyway .      the commissioner shrugged  lifted the intercom .  after a while  he said     section q    is all they can do .  it   s not a very good neighborhood .         it   ll do     said baley .      where   s r .  daneel now  by the way .         he   s at our record files .  he   s trying to collect information on medievalist agitators .         good lord  there are millions .         i know  but it keeps him happy .      baley was nearly at the door  when he turned  half on impulse  and said     commissioner  did dr .  sarton ever talk to you about spacetown   s program .  i mean  about introducing the c fe culture .         the what .         introducing robots .         occasionally .     the commissioner   s tone was not one of any particular interest .      did he ever explain what spacetown   s point was .         oh  improve health  raise the standard of living .  the usual talk  it didn   t impress me .  oh  i agreed with him .  i nodded my head and all that .  what could i do .  it   s just a matter of humoring them and hoping they   ll keep within reason in their notions .  maybe some day  .  .  .      baley waited but he didn   t say what maybe  some  day might bring .   baley said     did he ever mention anything about emigration .         emigration .  never .  letting an earthman into an outer world is like finding a diamond asteroid in the rings of saturn .         i mean emigration to new worlds .      but the commissioner answered that one with a simple stare of incredulousness .   baley chewed that for a moment  then said with sudden bluntness     what   s cerebroanalysis  commissioner .  ever hear of it .      the commissioner   s round face didn   t pucker  his eyes didn   t blink .  he said evenly     no  what   s it supposed to be .         nothing .  just picked it up .      he left the office and at his desk continued thinking .  certainly  the commissioner wasn   t that good an actor .  well  then .   at       baley called jessie and told her he wouldn   t be home that night nor probably any night for a while .  it took a while after that to disengage her .      lije  is there trouble .  are you in danger .      a policeman is always in a certain amount of danger  he explained lightly .  it didn   t satisfy her .     where will you be staying .      he didn   t tell her .     if you   re going to be lonely tonight     he said     stay at your mother   s .     he broke connections abruptly  which was probably just as well .   at       he made a call to washington .  it took a certain length of time to reach the man he wanted and an almost equally long time to convince him he ought to make an air trip to new york the next day .  by        he had succeeded .   at       the commissioner left  passing him with an uncertain smile .  the day shift left en masse .  the sparser population that filled the offices in the evening and through the night made its way in and greeted him in varied tones of surprise .   r .  daneel came to his desk with a sheaf of papers .      and those are .     asked baley .      a list of men and women who might belong to a medievalist organization .         how many does the list include .         over a million     said r .  daneel .     these are just part of them .         do you expect to check them all  daneel .         obviously that would be impractical  elijah .         you see  daneel  almost all earthmen are medievalists in one way or another .  the commissioner  jessie  myself .  look at the commissioner   s       he almost said     spectacles     then remembered that earthmen must stick together and that the commissioner   s face must be protected in the figurative as well as the literal sense .   he concluded  lamely     eye ornaments .         yes     said r .  daneel     i had noticed them  but thought it indelicate  perhaps  to refer to them .  i have not seen such ornaments on other city dwellers .         it is a very old fashioned sort of thing .         does it serve a purpose of any sort .      baley said  abruptly     how did you get your list .         it was a machine that did it for me .  apparently  one sets it for a particular type of offense and it does the rest .  i let it scan all disorderly conduct cases involving robots over the past twenty five years .  another machine scanned all city newspapers over an equal period for the names of those involved in unfavorable statements concerning robots or men of the outer worlds .  it is amazing what can be done in three hours .  the machine even eliminated the names of non survivors from the lists .         you are amazed .  surely you   ve got computers on the outer worlds .         of many sorts  certainly .  very advanced ones .  still  none are as massive and complex as the ones here .  you must remember  of course  that even the largest outer world scarcely has the population of one of your cities and extreme complexity is not necessary .      baley said     have you ever been on aurora .         no     said r .  daneel     i was assembled here on earth .         then how do you know about outer world computers .         but surely that is obvious  partner elijah .  my data store is drawn from that of the late dr .  sarton .  you may take it for granted that it is rich in factual material concerning the outer worlds .         i see .  can you eat  daneel .         i am nuclear powered .  i had thought you were aware of that .         i   m perfectly aware of it .  i didn   t ask if you needed to eat .  i asked if you could eat .  if you could put food in your mouth  chew it  and swallow it .  i should think that would be an important item in seeming to be a man .         i see your point .  yes  i can perform the mechanical operations of chewing and swallowing .  my capacity is  of course  quite limited  and i would have to remove the ingested material from what you might call my stomach sooner or later .         all right .  you can regurgitate  or whatever you do  in the quiet of our room tonight .  the point is that i   m hungry .  i   ve missed lunch  damn it  and i want you with me when i eat .  and you can   t sit there and not eat without attracting attention .  so if you can eat  that   s what i want to hear .  let   s go .      section kitchens were the same all over the city .  what   s more  baley had been in washington  toronto  los angeles  london  and budapest in the way of business  and they had been the same there  too .  perhaps it had been different in medieval times when languages had varied and dietaries as well .  nowadays  yeast products were just the same from shanghai to tashkent and from winnipeg to buenos aires  and english might not be the    english    of shakespeare or churchill  but it was the final potpourri that was current over all the continents and  with some modification  on the outer worlds as well .   but language and dietary aside  there were the deeper similarities .  there was always that particular odor  undefinable but completely characteristic of    kitchen .     there was the waiting triple line moving slowly in  converging at the door and splitting up again  right  left  center .  there was the rumble of humanity  speaking and moving  and the sharper clatter of plastic on plastic .  there was the gleam of simulated wood  highly polished  highlights on glass  long tables  the touch of steam in the air .   baley inched slowly forward as the line moved  with all possible staggering of meal hours  a wait of at least ten minutes was almost unavoidable  and said to r .  daneel in sudden curiosity     can you smile .      r .  daneel  who had been gazing at the interior of the kitchen with cool absorption  said     i beg your pardon  elijah .         i   m just wondering  daneel .  can you smile .     he spoke in a casual whisper .   r .  daneel smiled .  the gesture was sudden and surprising .  his lips curled back and the skin about either end folded .  only the mouth smiled  however .  the rest of the robot   s face was untouched .   baley shook his head .     don   t bother  r .  daneel .  it doesn   t do a thing for you .      they were at the entrance .  person after person thrust his metal food tag through the appropriate slot and had it scanned .  click  click  click   someone once calculated that a smoothly running kitchen could allow the entrance of two hundred persons a minute  the tags of each one being fully scanned to prevent kitchen jumping  meal jumping  and ration stretching .  they had also calculated how long a waiting line was necessary for maximum efficiency and how much time was lost when any one person required special treatment .   it was therefore always a calamity to interrupt that smooth click click by stepping to the manual window  as baley and r .  daneel did  in order to thrust a special permit pass at the official in charge .   jessie  filled with the knowledge of an assistant dietitian  had explained it once to baley .      it upsets things completely     she had said .     it throws off consumption figures and inventory estimates .  it means special checks .  you have to match slips with all the different section kitchens to make sure the balance isn   t too unbalanced  if you know what i mean .  there   s a separate balance sheet to be made out each week .  then if anything goes wrong and you   re overdrawn  it   s always your fault .  it   s never the fault of the city government for passing out special tickets to everybody and his kid sister .  oh  no .  and when we have to say that free choice is suspended for the meal  don   t the people in line make a fuss .  it   s always the fault of the people behind the counter  .  .  .      baley had the story in the fullest detail and so he quite understood the dry and poisonous look he received from the woman behind the window .  she made a few hurried notes .  home section  occupation  reason for meal displacement     official business     a very irritating reason indeed  but quite irrefutable  .  then she folded the slip with firm motions of her fingers and pushed it into a slot .  a computer seized it  devoured the contents  and digested the information .   she turned to r .  daneel .   baley let her have the worst .  he said     my friend is out of city .      the woman looked finally and completely outraged .  she said     home city  please .      baley intercepted the ball for daneel once again .     all records are to be credited to the police department .  no details necessary .  official business .      the woman brought down a pad of slips with a jerk of her arm and filled in the necessary matter in dark light code with practiced pressings of the first two fingers of her right hand .   she said     how long will you be eating here .         till further notice     said baley .      press fingers here     she said  inverting the information blank .   baley had a short qualm as r .  daneel   s even fingers with their glistening nails pressed downward .  surely  they wouldn   t have forgotten to supply him with fingerprints .   the woman took the blank away and fed it into the all consuming machine at her elbow .  it belched nothing back and baley breathed more easily .   she gave them little metal tags that were in the bright red that meant    temporary .      she said     no free choices .  we   re short this week .  take table df .      they made their way toward df .   r .  daneel said     i am under the impression that most of your people eat in kitchens such as these regularly .         yes .  of course  it   s rather gruesome eating in a strange kitchen .  there   s no one about whom you know .  in your own kitchen  it   s quite different .  you have your own seat which you occupy all the time .  you   re with your family  your friends .  especially when you   re young  mealtimes are the bright spot of the day .     baley smiled in brief reminiscence .   table df was apparently among those reserved for transients .  those already seated watched their plates uneasily and did not talk with one another .  they looked with sneaking envy at the laughing crowds at the other tables .   there is no one so uncomfortable  thought baley  as the man eating out of section .  be it ever so humble  the old saying went  there   s no place like home kitchen .  even the food tastes better  no matter how many chemists are ready to swear it to be no different from the food in johannesburg .   he sat down on a stool and r .  daneel sat down next to him .      no free choice     said baley  with a wave of his fingers     so just close the switch there and wait .      it took two minutes .  a disc slid back in the table top and a dish lifted .      mashed potatoes  zymoveal sauce  and stewed apricots .  oh  well     said baley .   a fork and two slices of whole yeast bread appeared in a recess just in front of the low railing that went down the long center of the table .   r .  daneel said in a low voice     you may help yourself to my serving  if you wish .      for a moment  baley was scandalized .  then he remembered and mumbled     that   s bad manners .  go on .  eat .      baley ate industriously but without the relaxation that allows complete enjoyment .  carefully  he flicked an occasional glance at r .  daneel .  the robot ate with precise motions of his jaws .  too precise .  it didn   t look quite natural .   strange .  now that baley knew for a fact that r .  daneel was in truth a robot  all sorts of little items showed up clearly .  for instance  there was no movement of an adam   s apple when r .  daneel swallowed .   yet he didn   t mind so much .  was he getting used to the creature .  suppose people started afresh on a new world  how that ran through his mind ever since dr .  fastolfe had put it there   suppose bentley  for instance  were to leave earth  could he get so he didn   t mind working and living alongside robots .  why not .  the spacers themselves did it .   r .  daneel said     elijah  is it bad manners to watch another man while he is eating .         if you mean stare directly at him  of course .  that   s only common sense  isn   t it .  a man has a right to his privacy .  ordinary conversation is entirely in order  but you don   t peer at a man while he   s swallowing .         i see .  why is it then that i count eight people watching us closely  very closely .      baley put down his fork .  he looked about as though he were searching for the salt pinch dispenser .     i see nothing out of the ordinary .      but he said it without conviction .  the mob of diners was only a vast conglomeration of chaos to him .  and when r .  daneel turned his impersonal brown eyes upon him  baley suspected uncomfortably that those were not eyes he saw  but scanners capable of noting  with photographic accuracy and in split seconds of time  the entire panorama .      i am quite certain     said r .  daneel  calmly .      well  then  what of it .  it   s crude behavior  but what does it prove .         i cannot say  elijah  but is it coincidence that six of the watchers were in the crowd outside the shoe store last night .          chapter      escape along the strips   baley   s grip tightened convulsively on his fork .      are you sure .     he asked automatically  and as he said it  he realized the uselessness of the question .  you don   t ask a computer if it is sure of the answer it disgorges  not even a computer with arms and legs .   r .  daneel said     quite .         are they close to us .         not very .  they are scattered .         all right  then .     baley returned to his meal  his fork moving mechanically .  behind the frown on his long face  his mind worked furiously .   suppose the incident last night had been organized by a group of anti robot fanatics  that it had not been the spontaneous trouble it had seemed .  such a group of agitators could easily include men who had studied robots with the intensity born of deep opposition .  one of them might have recognized r .  daneel for what he was .   the commissioner had suggested that  in a way .  damn it  there were surprising depths to that man .    it worked itself out logically .  granting they had been unable to act in an organized manner on the spur of last evening   s moment  they would still have been able to plan for the future .  if they could recognize a robot such as r .  daneel  they could certainly realize that baley himself was a police officer .  a police officer in the unusual company of a humanoid robot would very likely be a responsible man in the organization .   with the wisdom of hindsight  baley followed the line of reasoning with no trouble at all .    it followed then that observers at city hall  or perhaps agents within city hall  would be bound to spot baley  r .  daneel  or both before too long a time had passed .  that they had done so within twenty four hours was not surprising .  they might have done so in less time if so much of baley   s day had not been spent in spacetown and along the motorway .   r .  daneel had finished his meal .  he sat quietly waiting  his perfect hands resting lightly on the end of the table .      had we not better do something .     he asked .      we   re safe here in the kitchen     said baley .     now leave this to me .  please .      baley looked about him cautiously and it was as though he saw a kitchen for the first time .   people .  thousands of them .  what was the capacity of an average kitchen .  he had once seen the figure .  two thousand two hundred  he thought .  this one was larger than average .   suppose the cry     robot     were sent out into the air .  suppose it were tossed among the thousands like a  .  .  .   he was at a loss for a comparison  but it didn   t matter .  it wouldn   t happen .   a spontaneous riot could flare anywhere  in the kitchens as easily as in the corridors or in the elevators .  more easily  perhaps .  there was a lack of inhibition at mealtimes  a sense of horseplay that could degenerate into something more serious at a trifle .   but a planned riot would be different .  here in the kitchen  the planners would themselves be trapped in a large and mob filled room .  once the dishes went flying and the tables cracking there would be no easy way to escape .  hundreds would certainly die and they themselves might easily be among them .   no  a safe riot would have to be planned in the avenues of the city  in some relatively narrow passageway .  panic and hysteria would travel slowly along the constriction and there would be time for the quick  prepared fadeaway along the side passage or the unobtrusive step onto an escalating localway that would move them to a higher level and disappearance .   baley felt trapped .  there were probably others waiting outside .  baley and r .  daneel were to be followed to a proper point and the fuse would be set off .   r .  daneel said     why not arrest them .         that would only start the trouble sooner .  you know their faces  don   t you .  you won   t forget .         i am not capable of forgetting .         then we   ll nab them another time .  for now  we   ll break their net .  follow me .  do exactly as i do .      he rose  turned his dish carefully upside down  centering it on the movable disc from below which it had risen .  he put his fork back in its recess .  r .  daneel  watching  matched his action .  the dishes and utensils dropped out of sight .   r .  daneel said     they are getting up  too .         all right .  it   s my feeling they won   t get too close .  not here .      the two moved into line now  drifting toward an exit where the click click click of the tags sounded ritualistically  each click recording the expenditure of a ration unit .   baley looked back through the steamy haze and the noise and  with incongruous sharpness  thought of a visit to the city zoo with ben six or seven years ago .  no  eight  because ben had just passed his eighth birthday then .   jehoshaphat .  where did the time go .    it had been ben   s first visit and he had been excited .  after all  he had never actually seen a cat or a dog before .  then  on top of that  there was the bird cage .  even baley himself  who had seen it a dozen times before  was not immune to its fascination .   there is something about the first sight of living objects hurtling through air that is incomparably startling .  it was feeding time in the sparrow cage and an attendant was dumping cracked oats into a long trough  human beings had grown used to yeast substitutes  but animals  more conservative in their way  insisted on real grain  .   the sparrows flocked down in what seemed like hundreds .  wing to wing  with an ear splitting twitter  they lined the trough  .  .  .   that was it  that was the picture that came to baley   s mind as he looked back at the kitchen he was leaving .  sparrows at the trough .  the thought repelled him .   he thought  jehoshaphat  there must be a better way .   but what better way .  what was wrong with this way .  it had never bothered him before .   he said abruptly to r .  daneel     ready  daneel .         i am ready  elijah .      they left the kitchen and escape was now clearly and flatly up to baley .   there is a game that youngsters know called    running the strips .     its rules vary in trivial fashion from city to city  but its essentials are eternal .  a boy from san francisco can join the game in cairo with no trouble .   its object is to get from point a to point b via the city   s rapid transit system in such a way that the    leader    manages to lose as many of his followers as possible .  a leader who arrives at the destination alone is skillful indeed  as is a follower who refuses to be shaken .   the game is usually conducted during the evening rush hour when the increased density of the commuters makes it at once more hazardous and more complicated .  the leader sets off  running up and down the accelerating strips .  he does his best to do the unexpected  remaining standing on a given strip as long as possible  then leaping off suddenly in either direction .  he will run quickly through several strips  then remain waiting once more .   pity the follower who incautiously careens forward one strip too far .  before he has caught his mistake  unless he is extraordinarily nimble  he has driven past the leader or fallen behind .  the clever leader will compound the error by moving quickly in the appropriate direction .   a move designed to increase the complexity of the task tenfold involves boarding the localways or the expressways themselves  and hurtling off the other side .  it is bad form to avoid them completely and also bad form to linger on them .   the attraction of the game is not easy for an adult to understand  particularly for an adult who has never himself been a teenage striprunner .  the players are roughly treated by legitimate travelers into whose path they find themselves inevitably flying .  they are persecuted bitterly by the police and punished by their parents .  they are denounced in the schools and on the subetherics .  no year passes without its four or five teenagers killed at the game  its dozens hurt  its cases of innocent bystanders meeting tragedy of varying degree .   yet nothing can be done to wipe out the strip running gangs .  the greater the danger  the more the strip runners have that most valuable of all prizes  honor in the eyes of their fellows .  a successful one may well swagger  a well known leader is cock of the walk .   elijah baley  for instance  remembered with satisfaction even now that he had been a strip runner once .  he had led a gang of twenty from the concourse sector to the borders of queens  crossing three expressways .  in two tireless and relentless hours  he had shaken off some of the most agile followers of the bronx  and arrived at the destination point alone .  they talked about that run for months .   baley was in his forties now  of course .  he hadn   t run the strips for over twenty years  but he remembered some of the tricks .  what he had lost in agility  he made up in another respect .  he was a policeman .  no one but another policeman as experienced as himself could possibly know the city as well  know where almost every metal bordered alley began and ended .   he walked away from the kitchen briskly  but not too rapidly .  each moment he expected the cry of    robot  robot    to ring out behind him .  that initial set of moments was the riskiest .  he counted the steps until he felt the first accelerating strip moving under him .   he stopped for a moment  while r .  daneel moved smoothly up beside him .      are they still behind us  daneel .     asked baley in a whisper .      yes .  they   re moving closer .         that won   t last     said baley confidently .  he looked at the strips stretching to either side  with their human cargo whipping to his left more and more rapidly as their distance from him increased .  he had felt the strips beneath his feet many times a day almost all the days of his life  but he had not bent his knees in anticipation of running them in seven thousand days and more .  he felt the old familiar thrill and his breath grew more rapid .   he quite forgot the one time he had caught ben at the game .  he had lectured him interminably and threatened to have him put under police surveillance .   lightly  quickly  at double the    safe    rate  he went up the strips .  he leaned forward sharply against the acceleration .  the localway was humming past .  for a moment  it looked as though he would mount  but suddenly he was fading backward  backward  dodging through the crowd to left and right as it thickened on the slower strips .   he stopped  and let himself be carried along at a mere fifteen miles an hour .      how many are with us  daneel .         only one  elijah .     the robot was at his side  unruffled  unbreathing .      he must have been a good one in his day  too  but he won   t last either .      full of self confidence  he felt a half remembered sensation of his younger days .  it consisted partly of the feeling of immersion in a mystic rite to which others did not belong  partly of the purely physical sensation of wind against hair and face  partly of a tenuous sense of danger .      they call this the side shuffle     he said to r .  daneel in a low voice .   his long stride ate distance  but he moved along a single strip  dodging the legitimate crowd with a minimum of effort .  he kept it up  moving always closer to the strip   s edge  until the steady movement of his head through the crowd must have been hypnotic in its constant velocity  as it was intended to be .   and then  without a break in his step  he shifted two inches sideways and was on the adjoining strip .  he felt an aching in his thigh muscles as he kept his balance .   he whipped through a cluster of commuters and was on the forty five mile strip .      how is it now  daneel .     he asked .      he is still with us     was the calm answer .   baley   s lips tightened .  there was nothing for it but to use the moving platforms themselves  and that really required co ordination  more  perhaps  than he still retained .   he looked about quickly .  exactly where were they now .   b zzd  street flashed by .  he made rapid calculations and was off .  up the remaining strips  smoothly and steadily  a swing onto the localway platform .   the impersonal faces of men and women  calloused with the ennui of way riding  were jolted into something like indignation as baley and r .  daneel clambered aboard and squeezed through the railings .      hey  now     called a woman shrilly  clutching at her hat .      sorry     said baley  breathlessly .   he forced his way through the standees and with a wriggle was off on the other side .  at the last moment  a jostled passenger thumped his back in anger .  he went staggering .   desperately he tried to regain his footing .  he lurched across a strip boundary and the sudden change in velocity forced him to his knees and then over on his side .   he had the sudden  panicky vision of men colliding with him and bowling over  of a spreading confusion on the strips  one of the dreaded    man jams    that would not fail to put dozens in the hospital with broken limbs .   but r .  daneel   s arm was under his back .  he felt himself lifted with more than a man   s strength .      thanks     gasped baley  and there was no time for more .   off he went and down the decelerating strips in a complicated pattern so designed that his feet met the v joint strips of an expressway at the exact point of crossover .  without the loss of rhythm  he was accelerating again  then up and over an expressway .      is he with us  daneel .         not one in sight  elijah .         good .  but what a strip runner you would have been  daneel .    oops  now  now .      off onto another localway in a whirl and down the strips with a clatter to a doorway  large and official in appearance .  a guard rose to his feet .   baley flashed his identification .     official business .      they were inside .      power plant     said baley  curtly .     this breaks our tracks completely .      he had been in power plants before  including this one .  familiarity did not lessen his feeling of uncomfortable awe .  the feeling was heightened by the haunting thought that once his father had been high in the hierarchy of a plant such as this .  that is  before  .  .  .   there was the surrounding hum of the tremendous generators hidden in the central well of the plant  the faint sharpness of ozone in the air  the grim and silent threat of the red lines that marked the limits beyond which no one could pass without protective clothing .   somewhere in the plant  baley had no idea exactly where  a pound of fissionable material was consumed each day .  every so often  the radioactive fission products  the so called    hot ash     were forced by air pressure through leaden pipes to distant caverns ten miles out in the ocean and a half mile below the ocean floor .  baley sometimes wondered what would happen when the caverns were filled .   he said to r .  daneel with sudden gruffness     stay away from the red lines .     then  he bethought himself and added sheepishly     but i suppose it doesn   t matter to you .         is it a question of radioactivity .     asked daneel .      yes .         then it does matter to me .  gamma radiation destroys the delicate balance of a positronic brain .  it would affect me much sooner than it would affect you .         you mean it would kill you .         i would require a new positronic brain .  since no two can be alike  i would be a new individual .  the daneel you now speak to would be  in a manner of speaking  dead .      baley looked at the other doubtfully .     i never knew that .    up these ramps .         the point isn   t stressed .  spacetown wishes to convince earthmen of the usefulness of such as myself  not of our weaknesses .         then why tell me .      r .  daneel turned his eyes full on his human companion .     you are my partner  elijah .  it is well that you know my weaknesses and shortcomings .      baley cleared his throat and had nothing more to say on the subject .      out in this direction     he said a moment later     and we   re a quarter of a mile from our apartment .      it was a grim  lower class apartment .  one small room and two beds .  two fold in chairs and a closet .  a built in subetheric screen that allowed no manual adjustment  and would be working only at stated hours  but would be working then .  no washbasin  not even an unactivated one  and no facilities for cooking or even boiling water .  a small trash disposal pipe was in one corner of the room  an ugly  unadorned  unpleasantly functional object .   baley shrugged .     this is it .  i guess we can stand it .      r .  daneel walked to the trash disposal pipe .  his shirt unseamed at a touch  revealing a smooth and  to all appearances  well muscled chest .      what are you doing .     asked baley .      getting rid of the food i ingested .  if i were to leave it  it would putrefy and i would become an object of distaste .      r .  daneel placed two fingers carefully under one nipple and pushed in a definite pattern of pressure .  his chest opened longitudinally .  r .  daneel reached in and from a welter of gleaming metal withdrew a thin  translucent sac  partly distended .  he opened it while baley watched with a kind of horror .   r .  daneel hesitated .  he said     the food is perfectly clean .  i do not salivate or chew .  it was drawn in through the gullet by suction  you know .  it is edible .         that   s all right     said baley  gently .     i   m not hungry .  you just get rid of it .      r .  daneel   s food sac was of fluorocarbon plastic  baley decided .  at least the food did not cling to it .  it came out smoothly and was placed little by little into the pipe .  a waste of good food at that  he thought .   he sat down on one bed and removed his shirt .  he said     i suggest an early start tomorrow .         for a specific reason .         the location of this apartment isn   t known to our friends yet .  or at least i hope not .  if we leave early  we are that much safer .  once in city hall  we will have to decide whether our partnership is any longer practical .         you think it is perhaps not .      baley shrugged and said dourly     we can   t go through this sort of thing every day .         but it seems to me       r .  daneel was interrupted by the sharp scarlet sliver of the door signal .   baley rose silently to his feet and unlimbered his blaster .  the door signal flashed once more .   he moved silently to the door  put his thumb on the blaster contact while he threw the switch that activated the one way transparency patch .  it wasn   t a good view patch  it was small and had a distorting effect  but it was quite good enough to show baley   s youngster  ben  outside the door .   baley acted quickly .  he flung the door open  snatched brutally at ben   s wrist as the boy raised his hand to signal a third time  and pulled him in .   the look of fright and bewilderment faded only slowly from ben   s eyes as he leaned breathlessly against the wall toward which he had been hurled .  he rubbed his wrist .      dad .     he said in grieved tones .     you didn   t have to grab me like that .      baley was staring through the view patch of the once again closed door .  as nearly as he could tell  the corridor was empty .      did you see anyone out there  ben .         no .  gee  dad  i just came to see if you were all right .         why shouldn   t i be all right .         i don   t know .  it was mom .  she was crying and all like that .  she said i had to find you .  if i didn   t go  she said she would go herself  and then she didn   t know what would happen .  she made me go  dad .      baley said     how did you find me .  did your mother know where i was .         no  she didn   t .  i called up your office .         and they told you .      ben looked startled at his father   s vehemence .  he said  in a low voice     sure .  weren   t they supposed to .      baley and daneel looked at one another .   baley rose heavily to his feet .  he said     where   s your mother now  ben .  at the apartment .         no  we went to grandma   s for dinner and stayed there .  i   m supposed to go back there now .  i mean  as long as you   re all right  dad .         you   ll stay here .  daneel  did you notice the exact location of the floor communo .      the robot said     yes .  do you intend leaving the room to use it .         i   ve got to .  i   ve got to get in touch with jessie .         might i suggest that it would be more logical to let bentley do that .  it is a form of risk and he is less valuable .      baley stared .     why  you       he thought  jehoshaphat  what am i getting angry about .   he went on more calmly     you don   t understand  daneel .  among us  it is not customary for a man to send his young son into possible danger  even if it is logical to do so .         danger .     squeaked ben in a sort of horrified pleasure .     what   s going on  dad .  huh  dad .         nothing  ben .  now  this isn   t any of your business .  understand .  get ready for bed .  i want you in bed when i get back .  you hear me .         aw  gosh .  you could tell a fellow .  i won   t say anything .         in bed .         gosh .      baley hitched his jacket back as he stood at the floor communo  so that his blaster butt was ready for snatching .  he spoke his personal number into the mouthpiece and waited while a computer fifteen miles away checked it to make sure the call was permissible .  it was a very short wait that was involved  since a plain clothes man had no limit on the number of his business calls .  he spoke the code number of his mother in law   s apartment .   the small screen at the base of the instrument lit up  and her face looked out at him .   he said  in a low voice     mother  put on jessie .      jessie must have been waiting for him .  she was on at once .  baley looked at her face and then darkened the screen deliberately .      all right  jessie .  ben   s here .  now  what   s the matter .     his eyes roved from side to side continuously  watching .      are you all right .  you aren   t in trouble .         i   m obviously all right  jessie .  now stop it .         oh  lije  i   ve been so worried .         what about .     he asked tightly .     you know .  your friend .         what about him .         i told you last night .  there   ll be trouble .         now  that   s nonsense .  i   m keeping ben with me for tonight and you go to bed .  good by  dear .      he broke connections and waited for two breaths before starting back .  his face was gray with apprehension and fear .   ben was standing in the middle of the room when baley returned .  one of his contact lenses was neatly pocketed in a little suction cup .  the other was still in his eye .   ben said     gosh  dad  isn   t there any water in the place .  mr .  olivaw says i can   t go to the personal .         he   s right .  you can   t .  put that thing back in your eye  ben .  it won   t hurt you to sleep with them for one night .         all right .     ben put it back  put away his suction cup and climbed into bed .     boy  what a mattress .      baley said to r .  daneel .     i suppose you won   t mind sitting up .         of course not .  i was interested  by the way  in the queer glass bentley wears close to his eyes .  do all earthmen wear them .         no .  just some     said baley  absently .     i don   t  for instance .         for what reason is it worn .      baley was too absorbed with his own thoughts to answer .  his own uneasy thoughts .   the lights were out .   baley remained wakeful .  he was dimly aware of ben   s breathing as it turned deep and regular and became a bit rough .  when he turned his head  he grew somehow conscious of r .  daneel  sitting in a chair with grave immobility  face turned toward the door .   then he fell asleep  and when he slept  he dreamed .   he dreamed jessie was falling into the fission chamber of a nuclear power plant  falling and falling .  she held out her arms to him  shrieking  but he could only stand frozenly just outside a scarlet line and watch her distorted figure turn as it fell  growing smaller until it was only a dot .   he could only watch her  in the dream  knowing that it was he  himself  who had pushed her .       chapter      words from an expert   elijah baley looked up as commissioner julius enderby entered the office .  he nodded wearily .   the commissioner looked at the clock and grunted     don   t tell me you   ve been here all night .      baley said     i won   t .      the commissioner said in a low voice     any trouble last night .     baley shook his head .   the commissioner said     i   ve been thinking that i could be minimizing the possibility of riots .  if there   s anything to       baley said tightly     for god   s sake  commissioner  if anything happened  i   d tell you .  there was no trouble of any sort .         all right .     the commissioner moved away  passing beyond the door that marked off the unusual privacy that became his exalted position .   baley looked after him and thought  he must have slept last night .   baley bent to the routine report he was trying to write as a cover up for the real activities of the last two days  but the words he had tapped out by finger touch blurred and danced .  slowly  he became aware of an object standing by his desk .   he lifted his head .     what do you want .      it was r .  sammy .  baley thought  julius   s private flunky .  it pays to be a commissioner .   r .  sammy said through his fatuous grin     the commissioner wants to see you  lije .  he says right away .      baley waved his hand .     he just saw me .  tell him i   ll be in later .      r .  sammy said     he says right away .         all right .  all right .  go away .      the robot backed away  saying     the commissioner wants to see you right away  lije .  he says right away .         jehoshaphat     said baley between his teeth .     i   m going .  i   m going .     he got up from his desk  headed for the office  and r .  sammy was silent .   baley said as he entered     damn it  commissioner  don   t send that thing after me  will you .      but the commissioner only said     sit down  lije .  sit down .     baley sat down and stared .  perhaps he had done old julius an injustice .  perhaps the man hadn   t slept after all .  he looked fairly beat .   the commissioner was tapping the paper before him .     there   s a record of a call you made to a dr .  gerrigel at washington by insulated beam .         that   s right  commissioner .         there   s no record of the conversation  naturally  since it was insulated .  what   s it all about .         i   m after background information .         he   s a roboticist  isn   t he .         that   s right .      the commissioner put out a lower lip and suddenly looked like a child about to pout .     but what   s the point .  what kind of information are you after .         i   m not sure  commissioner .  i just have a feeling that in a case like this  information on robots might help .     baley clamped his mouth shut after that .  he wasn   t going to be specific  and that was that .      i wouldn   t  lije .  i wouldn   t .  i don   t think it   s wise .         what   s your objection  commissioner .         the fewer the people who know about all this  the better .         i   ll tell him as little as i can .  naturally .         i still don   t think it   s wise .      baley was feeling just sufficiently wretched to lose patience .   he said     are you ordering me not to see him .         no .  no .  you do as you see fit .  you   re heading this investigation .  only  .  .  .         only what .      the commissioner shook his head .     nothing .    where is he .  you know who i mean .      baley did .  he said     daneel   s still at the files .      the commissioner paused a long moment  then said     we   re not making much progress  you know .         we   re not making any so far .  still  things may change .         all right  then     said the commissioner  but he didn   t look as though he really thought it were all right .   r .  daneel was at baley   s desk  when the latter returned .      well  and what have you got .     baley asked gruffly .      i have completed my first  rather hasty  search through the files  partner elijah  and i have located two of the people who tried to track us last night and who  moreover  were at the shoe store during the former incident .         let   s see .      r .  daneel placed the small  stamp size cards before baley .  they were mottled with the small dots that served as code .  the robot also produced a portable decoder and placed one of the cards into an appropriate slot .  the dots possessed electrical conduction properties different from that of the card as a whole .  the electric field passing through the card was therefore distorted in a highly specific manner and in response to that specification the three by six screen above the decoder was filled with words .  words which  uncoded  would have filled several sheets of standard size report paper .  words  moreover  which could not possibly be interpreted by anyone not in possession of an official police decoder .   baley read through the material stolidly .  the first person was francis clousarr  age thirty three at time of arrest two years before  cause of arrest  inciting to riot  employee at new york yeast  home address  so and so  parentage  so and so  hair  eyes  distinguishing marks  educational history  employment history  psychoanalytic profile  physical profile  data here  data there  and finally reference to a photo in the rogues    gallery .      you checked the photograph .     asked baley .     yes  elijah .      the second person was gerhard paul .  baley glanced at the material on that card and said     this is all no good .      r .  daneel said     i am sure that cannot be so .  if there is an organization of earthmen who are capable of the crime we are investigating  these are members .  is that not an obvious likelihood .  should they then not be questioned .         we   d get nothing out of them .         they were there  both at the shoe store and in the kitchen .  they cannot deny it .         just being there   s no crime .  besides which  they can deny it .  they can just say they weren   t there .  it   s as simple as that .  how can we prove they   re lying .         i saw them .         that   s no proof     said baley  savagely .     no court  if it ever came to that  would believe that you could remember two faces in a blur of a million .         it is obvious that i can .         sure .  tell them what you are .  as soon as you do that  you   re no witness .  your kind have no status in any court of law on earth .      r .  daneel said     i take it  then  that you have changed your mind .         what do you mean .         yesterday  in the kitchen  you said there was no need to arrest them .  you said that as long as i remembered their faces  we could arrest them at any time .         well  i didn   t think it through     said baley .     i was crazy .  it can   t be done .         not even for psychological reasons .  they would not know we had no legal proof of their complicity in conspiracy .      baley said  tensely     look  i am expecting dr .  gerrigel of washington in half an hour .  do you mind waiting till he   s been here and gone .  do you mind .         i will wait     said r .  daneel .   anthony gerrigel was a precise and very polite man of middle height  who looked far from being one of the most erudite roboticists on earth .  he was nearly twenty minutes late  it turned out  and quite apologetic about it .  baley  white with an anger born of apprehension  shrugged off the apologies gracelessly .  he checked his reservation on conference room d  repeated his instructions that they were not to be disturbed on any account for an hour  and led dr .  gerrigel and r .  daneel down the corridor  up a ramp  and through a door that led to one of the spy beam insulated chambers .   baley checked the walls carefully before sitting down  listening to the soft burr of the pulsometer in his hand  waiting for any fading of the steady sound which would indicate a break  even a small one  in the insulation .  he turned it on the ceiling  floor  and  with particular care  on the door .  there was no break .   dr .  gerrigel smiled a little .  he looked like a man who never smiled more than a little .  he was dressed with a neatness that could only be described as fussy .  his iron gray hair was smoothed carefully back and his face looked pink and freshly washed .  he sat with a posture of prim stiffness as though repeated maternal advice in his younger years concerning the desirability of good posture had rigidified his spine forever .   he said to baley     you make this all seem very formidable .         it   s quite important  doctor .  i need information about robots that only you can give me  perhaps .  anything we say here  of course  is top secret and the city will expect you to forget it all when you leave .     baley looked at his watch .   the little smile on the roboticist   s face winked away .  he said     let me explain why i am late .     the matter obviously weighed upon him .     i decided not to go by air .  i get airsick .         that   s too bad     said baley .  he put away the pulsometer  after checking its standard settings to make last minute certain that there was nothing wrong with it  and sat down .      or at least not exactly airsick  but nervous .  a mild agoraphobia .  it   s nothing particularly abnormal  but there it is .  so i took the expressways .      baley felt a sudden sharp interest .     agoraphobia .         i make it sound worse than it is     the roboticist said at once .     it   s just the feeling you get in a plane .  have you ever been in one  mr .  baley .         several times .         then you must know what i mean .  it   s that feeling of being surrounded by nothing  of being separated from  from empty air by a mere inch of metal .  it   s very uncomfortable .         so you took the expressway .         yes .         all the way from washington to new york .         oh  i   ve done it before .  since they built the baltimore philadelphia tunnel  it   s quite simple .      so it was .  baley had never made the trip himself  but he was perfectly aware that it was possible .  washington  baltimore  philadelphia  and new york had grown  in the last two centuries  to the point where all nearly touched .  the four city area was almost the official name for the entire stretch of coast  and there were a considerable number of people who favored administrational consolidation and the formation of a single super city .  baley disagreed with that  himself .  new york city by itself was almost too large to be handled by a centralized government .  a larger city  with over fifty million population  would break down under its own weight .      the trouble was     dr .  gerrigel was saying     that i missed a connection in chester sector  philadelphia  and lost time .  that  and a little difficulty in getting a transient room assignment  ended by making me late .         don   t worry about that  doctor .  what you say  though  is interesting .  in view of your dislike for planes  what would you say to going outside city limits on foot  dr .  gerrigel .         for what reason .     he looked startled and more than a little apprehensive .      it   s just a rhetorical question .  i   m not suggesting that you really should .  i want to know how the notion strikes you  that   s all .         it strikes me very unpleasantly .         suppose you had to leave the city at night and walk cross country for half a mile or more .         i  i don   t think i could be persuaded to .         no matter how important the necessity .         if it were to save my life or the lives of my family  i might try .   .  .  .     he looked embarrassed .     may i ask the point of these questions  mr .  baley .         i   ll tell you .  a serious crime has been committed  a particularly disturbing murder .  i   m not at liberty to give you the details .  there is a theory  however  that the murderer  in order to commit the crime  did just what we were discussing  he crossed open country at night and alone .  i was just wondering what kind of man could do that .      dr .  gerrigel shuddered .     no one i know .  certainly not i .  of course  among millions i suppose you could find a few hardy individuals .         but you wouldn   t say it was a very likely thing for a human being to do .         no .  certainly not likely .         in fact  if there   s any other explanation for the crime  any other conceivable explanation  it should be considered .      dr .  gerrigel looked more uncomfortable than ever as he sat bolt upright with his well kept hands precisely folded in his lap .     do you have an alternate explanation in mind .         yes .  it occurs to me that a robot  for instance  would have no difficulty at all in crossing open country .      dr .  gerrigel stood up .     oh  my dear sir .         what   s wrong .         you mean a robot may have committed the crime .         why not .         murder .  of a human being .         yes .  please sit down  doctor .      the roboticist did as he was told .  he said     mr .  baley  there are two acts involved  walking cross country  and murder .  a human being could commit the latter easily  but would find difficulty in doing the former .  a robot could do the former easily  but the latter act would be completely impossible .  if you   re going to replace an unlikely theory by an impossible one          impossible is a hell of a strong word  doctor .         you   ve heard of the first law of robotics  mr .  baley .         sure .  i can even quote it  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     baley suddenly pointed a finger at the roboticist and went on     why can   t a robot be built without the first law .  what   s so sacred about it .      dr .  gerrigel looked startled  then tittered     oh  mr .  baley .         well  what   s the answer .         surely  mr .  baley  if you even know a little about robotics  you must know the gigantic task involved  both mathematically and electronically  in building a positronic brain .         i have an idea     said baley .  he remembered well his visit to a robot factory once in the way of business .  he had seen their library of book films  long ones  each of which contained the mathematical analysis of a single type of positronic brain .  it took more than an hour for the average such film to be viewed at standard scanning speed  condensed though its symbolisms were .  and no two brains were alike  even when prepared according to the most rigid specifications .  that  baley understood  was a consequence of heisenberg   s uncertainty principle .  this meant that each film had to be supplemented by appendices involving possible variations .   oh  it was a job  all right .  baley wouldn   t deny that .   dr .  gerrigel said     well  then  you must understand that a design for a new type of positronic brain  even one where only minor innovations are involved  is not the matter of a night   s work .  it usually involves the entire research staff of a moderately sized factory and takes anywhere up to a year of time .  even this large expenditure of work would not be nearly enough if it were not that the basic theory of such circuits has already been standardized and may be used as a foundation for further elaboration .  the standard basic theory involves the three laws of robotics  the first law  which you   ve quoted  the second law  which states     a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law     and the third law  which states     a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .     do you understand .      r .  daneel  who  to all appearances  had been following the conversation with close attention  broke in .     if you will excuse me  elijah  i would like to see if i follow dr .  gerrigel .  what you imply  sir  is that any attempt to build a robot  the working of whose positronic brain is not oriented about the three laws  would require first the setting up of a new basic theory and that this  in turn  would take many years .      the roboticist looked very gratified .     that is exactly what i mean .      mr .  baley waited a moment  then carefully introduced r .  daneel     this is daneel olivaw  dr .  gerrigel .         good day  mr .  olivaw .     dr .  gerrigel extended his hand and shook daneel   s .  he went on     it is my estimation that it would take fifty years to develop the basic theory of a non asenion positronic brain  that is  one in which the basic assumptions of the three laws are disallowed  and bring it to the point where robots similar to modern models could be constructed .         and this has never been done .     asked baley .     i mean  doctor  that we   ve been building robots for several thousand years .  in all that time  hasn   t anybody or any group had fifty years to spare .         certainly     said the roboticist     but it is not the sort of work that anyone would care to do .         i find that hard to believe .  human curiosity will undertake anything .         it hasn   t undertaken the non asenion robot .  the human race  mr .  baley  has a strong frankenstein complex .         a what .         that   s a popular name derived from a medieval novel describing a robot that turned on its creator .  i never read the novel myself .  but that   s beside the point .  what i wish to say is that robots without the first law are simply not built .         and no theory for it even exists .         not to my knowledge  and my knowledge     he smiled self consciously     is rather extensive .         and a robot with a first law built in could not kill a man .         never .  unless such killing were completely accidental or unless it were necessary to save the lives of two or more men .  in either case  the positronic potential built up would ruin the brain past recovery .         all right     said baley .     all this represents the situation on earth .  right .         yes .  certainly .         what about the outer worlds .      some of dr .  gerrigel   s self assurance seemed to ooze away .     oh dear  mr .  baley  i couldn   t say of my own knowledge  but i   m sure that if non asenion positronic brains were ever designed or if the mathematical theory were worked out  we   d hear of it .         would we .  well  let me follow up another thought in my mind  dr .  gerrigel .  i hope you don   t mind .         no .  not at all .     he looked helplessly first at baley  then at r .  daneel .     after all  if it is as important as you say  i   m glad to do all i can .         thank you  doctor .  my question is  why humanoid robots .  i mean that i   ve been taking them for granted all my life  but now it occurs to me that i don   t know the reason for their existence .  why should a robot have a head and four limbs .  why should he look more or less like a man .         you mean  why shouldn   t he be built functionally  like any other machine .         right     said baley .     why not .      dr .  gerrigel smiled a little .     really  mr .  baley  you are born too late .  the early literature of robotics is riddled with a discussion of that very matter and the polemics involved were something frightful .  if you would like a very good reference to the disputations among the functionalists and anti functionalists  i can recommend hanford   s    history of robotics .     mathematics is kept to a minimum .  i think you   d find it very interesting .         i   ll look it up     said baley  patiently .     meanwhile  could you give me an idea .         the decision was made on the basis of economics .  look here  mr .  baley  if you were supervising a farm  would you care to buy a tractor with a positronic brain  a reaper  a harrow  a milker  an automobile  and so on  each with a positronic brain  or would you rather have ordinary unbrained machinery with a single positronic robot to run them all .  i warn you that the second alternative represents only a fiftieth or a hundredth the expense .         but why the human form .         because the human form is the most successful generalized form in all nature .  we are not a specialized animal  mr .  baley  except for our nervous systems and a few odd items .  if you want a design capable of doing a great many widely various things  all fairly well  you could do no better than to imitate the human form .  besides that  our entire technology is based on the human form .  an automobile  for instance  has its controls so made as to be grasped and manipulated most easily by human hands and feet of a certain size and shape  attached to the body by limbs of a certain length and joints of a certain type .  even such simple objects as chairs and tables or knives and forks are designed to meet the requirements of human measurements and manner of working .  it is easier to have robots imitate the human shape than to redesign radically the very philosophy of our tools .         i see .  that makes sense .  now isn   t it true  doctor  that the roboticists of the outer world manufacture robots that are much more humanoid than our own .         i believe that is true .         could they manufacture a robot so humanoid that it would pass for human under ordinary conditions .      dr .  gerrigel lifted his eyebrows and considered that .     i think they could  mr .  baley .  it would be terribly expensive .  i doubt that the return could be profitable .         do you suppose     went on baley  relentlessly     that they could make a robot that would fool you into thinking it was human .      the roboticist tittered .     oh  my dear mr .  baley .  i doubt that .  really .  there   s more to a robot than just his appear       dr .  gerrigel froze in the middle of the word .  slowly  he turned to r .  daneel  and his pink face went very pale .      oh  dear me     he whispered .     oh  dear me .      he reached out one hand and touched r .  daneel   s cheek gingerly .  r .  daneel did not move away but gazed at the roboticist calmly .      dear me     said dr .  gerrigel  with what was almost a sob in his voice     you are a robot .         it took you a long time to realize that     said baley  dryly .      i wasn   t expecting it .  i never saw one like this .  outer world manufacture .         yes     said baley .      it   s obvious now .  the way he holds himself .  the manner of his speaking .  it is not a perfect imitation  mr .  baley .         it   s pretty good though  isn   t it .         oh  it   s marvelous .  i doubt that anyone could recognize the imposture at sight .  i am very grateful to you for having me brought face to face with him .  may i examine him .     the roboticist was on his feet  eager .   baley put out a hand .     please  doctor .  in a moment .  first  the matter of the murder  you know .         is that real  then .     dr .  gerrigel was bitterly disappointed and showed it .     i thought perhaps that was just a device to keep my mind engaged and to see how long i could be fooled by          it is not a device  dr .  gerrigel .  tell me  now  in constructing a robot as humanoid as this one  with the deliberate purpose of having it pass as human  is it not necessary to make its brain possess properties as close to that of the human brain as possible .         certainly .         very well .  could not such a humanoid brain lack the first law .  perhaps it is left out accidentally .  you say the theory is unknown .  the very fact that it is unknown means that the constructors might set up a brain without the first law .  they would not know what to avoid .      dr .  gerrigel was shaking his head vigorously .     no .  no .  impossible .         are you sure .  we can test the second law  of course .    daneel  let me have your blaster .      baley   s eyes never left the robot .  his own hand  well to one side  gripped his own blaster tightly .   r .  daneel said calmly     here it is  elijah     and held it out  butt first .   baley said     a plain clothes man must never abandon his blaster  but a robot has no choice but to obey a human .         except  mr .  baley     said dr .  gerrigel     when obedience involves breaking the first law .         do you know  doctor  that daneel drew his blaster on an unarmed group of men and women and threatened to shoot .         but i did not shoot     said r .  daneel .      granted  but the threat was unusual in itself  wasn   t it  doctor .     dr .  gerrigel bit his lip .     i   d need to know the exact circumstances to judge .  it sounds unusual .         consider this  then .  r .  daneel was on the scene at the time of the murder  and if you omit the possibility of an earthman having moved across open country  carrying a weapon with him  daneel and daneel alone of all the persons on the scene could have hidden the weapon .         hidden the weapon .     asked dr .  gerrigel .      let me explain .  the blaster that did the killing was not found .  the scene of the murder was searched minutely and it was not found .  yet it could not have vanished like smoke .  there is only one place it could have been  only one place they would not have thought to look .         where  elijah .     asked r .  daneel .   baley brought his blaster into view  held its barrel firmly in the robot   s direction .      in your food sac     he said .     in your food sac  daneel .          chapter      shift to the machine      that is not so     said r .  daneel  quietly .      yes .  we   ll let the doctor decide .  dr .  gerrigel .         mr .  baley .     the roboticist  whose glance had been alternating wildly between the plain clothes man and the robot as they spoke  let it come to rest upon the human being .      i   ve asked you here for an authoritative analysis of this robot .  i can arrange to have you use the laboratories of the city bureau of standards .  if you need any piece of equipment they don   t have  i   ll get it for you .  what i want is a quick and definite answer and hang the expense and trouble .      baley rose .  his words had emerged calmly enough  but he felt a rising hysteria behind them .  at the moment  he felt that if he could only seize dr .  gerrigel by the throat and choke the necessary statements out of him  he would forgo all science .   he said     well  dr .  gerrigel .      dr .  gerrigel tittered nervously and said     my dear mr .  baley  i won   t need a laboratory .         why not .     asked baley apprehensively .  he stood there  muscles tense  feeling himself twitch .      it   s not difficult to test the first law .  i   ve never had to  you understand  but it   s simple enough .      baley pulled air in through his mouth and let it out slowly .  he said     would you explain what you mean .  are you saying that you can test him here .         yes  of course .  look  mr .  baley  i   ll give you an analogy .  if i were a doctor of medicine and had to test a patient   s blood sugar  i   d need a chemical laboratory .  if i needed to measure his basal metabolic rate  or test his cortical function  or check his genes to pinpoint a congenital malfunction  i   d need elaborate equipment .  on the other hand  i could check whether he were blind by merely passing my hand before his eyes and i could test whether he were dead by merely feeling for his pulse .      what i   m getting at is that the more important and fundamental the property being tested  the simpler the needed equipment .  it   s the same in a robot .  the first law is fundamental .  it affects everything .  if it were absent  the robot could not react properly in two dozen obvious ways .      as he spoke  he took out a flat  black object which expanded into a small book viewer .  he inserted a well worn spool into the receptacle .  he then took out a stop watch and a series of white  plastic slivers that fitted together to form something that looked like a slide rule with three independent movable scales .  the notations upon it struck no chord of familiarity to baley .   dr .  gerrigel tapped his book viewer and smiled a little  as though the prospect of a bit of field work cheered him .   he said     it   s my handbook of robotics .  i never go anywhere without it .  it   s part of my clothes .     he giggled self consciously .   he put the eyepiece of the viewer to his eyes and his finger dealt delicately with the controls .  the viewer whirred and stopped  whirred and stopped .      built in index     the roboticist said  proudly  his voice a little muffled because of the way in which the viewer covered his mouth .     i constructed it myself .  it saves a great deal of time .  but then  that   s not the point now  is it .  let   s see .  umm  won   t you move your chair near me  daneel .      r .  daneel did so .  during the roboticist   s preparations  he had watched closely and unemotionally .   baley shifted his blaster .   what followed confused and disappointed him .  dr .  gerrigel proceeded to ask questions and perform actions that seemed without meaning  punctuated by references to his triple slide rule and occasionally to the viewer .   at one time  he asked     if i have two cousins  five years apart in age  and the younger is a girl  what sex is the older .      daneel answered  inevitably  baley thought      it is impossible to say on the information given .      to which dr .  gerrigel   s only response  aside from a glance at his stop watch  was to extend his right hand as far as he could sideways and to say     would you touch the tip of my middle finger with the tip of the third finger of your left hand .      daneel did that promptly and easily .   in fifteen minutes  not more  dr .  gerrigel was finished .  he used his slide rule for a last silent calculation  then disassembled it with a series of snaps .  he put away his stop watch  withdrew the handbook from the viewer  and collapsed the latter .      is that all .     said baley  frowning .      that   s all .         but it   s ridiculous .  you   ve asked nothing that pertains to the first law .         oh  my dear mr .  baley  when a doctor hits your knee with a little rubber mallet and it jerks  don   t you accept the fact that it gives information concerning the presence or absence of some degenerative nerve disease .  when he looks closely at your eyes and considers the reaction of your iris to light  are you surprised that he can tell you something concerning your possible addiction to the use of certain alkaloids .      baley said     well  then .  what   s your decision .         daneel is fully equipped with the first law .     the roboticist jerked his head in a sharp affirmative .      you can   t be right     said baley huskily .   baley would not have thought that dr .  gerrigel could stiffen into a rigidity that was greater than his usual position .  he did so  however  visibly .  the man   s eyes grew narrow and hard .      are you teaching me my job .         i don   t mean you   re incompetent     said baley .  he put out a large  pleading hand .     but couldn   t you be mistaken .  you   ve said yourself nobody knows anything about the theory of non asenion robots .  a blind man could read by using braille or a sound scriber .  suppose you didn   t know that braille or sound scribing existed .  couldn   t you  in all honesty  say that a man had eyes because he knew the contents of a certain book film  and be mistaken .         yes     the roboticist grew genial again     i see your point .  but still a blind man could not read by use of his eyes and it is that which i was testing  if i may continue the analogy .  take my word for it  regardless of what a non asenion robot could or could not do  it is certain that r .  daneel is equipped with first law .         couldn   t he have falsified his answers .     baley was floundering  and knew it .      of course not .  that is the difference between a robot and a man .  a human brain  or any mammalian brain  cannot be completely analyzed by any mathematical discipline now known .  no response can therefore be counted upon as a certainty .  the robot brain is completely analyzable  or it could not be constructed .  we know exactly what the responses to given stimuli must be .  no robot can truly falsify answers .  the thing you call falsification just doesn   t exist in the robot   s mental horizon .         then let   s get down to cases .  r .  daneel did point a blaster at a crowd of human beings .  i saw that .  i was there .  granted that he didn   t shoot  wouldn   t the first law still have forced him into a kind of neurosis .  it didn   t  you know .  he was perfectly normal afterward .      the roboticist put a hesitant hand to his chin .     that is anomalous .         not at all     said r .  daneel  suddenly .     partner elijah  would you look at the blaster that you took from me .      baley looked down upon the blaster he held cradled in his left hand .      break open the charge chamber     urged r .  daneel .     inspect it .     baley weighed his chances  then slowly put his own blaster on the table beside him .  with a quick movement  he opened the robot   s blaster .      it   s empty     he said  blankly .      there is no charge in it     agreed r .  daneel .     if you will look closer  you will see that there has never been a charge in it .  the blaster has no ignition bud and cannot be used .      baley said     you held an uncharged blaster on the crowd .         i had to have a blaster or fail in my role as plain clothes man     said r .  daneel .     yet to carry a charged and usable blaster might have made it possible for me to hurt a human being by accident  a thing which is  of course  unthinkable .  i would have explained this at the time  but you were angry and would not listen .      baley stared bleakly at the useless blaster in his hand and said in a low voice     i think that   s all  dr .  gerrigel .  thank you for helping out .      baley sent out for lunch  but when it came  yeast nut cake and a rather extravagant slice of fried chicken on cracker  he could only stare at it .   round and round went the currents of his mind .  the lines on his long face were etched in deep gloom .   he was living in an unreal world  a cruel  topsy turvy world .   how had it happened .  the immediate past stretched behind him like a misty improbable dream dating back to the moment he had stepped into julius enderby   s office and found himself suddenly immersed in a nightmare of murder and robotics .   jehoshaphat .  it had begun only fifty hours before .   persistently  he had sought the solution in spacetown .  twice he had accused r .  daneel  once as a human being in disguise  and once as an admitted and actual robot  each time as a murderer .  twice the accusation had been bent back and broken .   he was being driven back .  against his will he was forced to turn his thoughts into the city  and since last night he dared not .  certain questions battered at his conscious mind  but he would not listen  he felt he could not .  if he heard them  he couldn   t help but answer them and  oh god  he didn   t want to face the answers .      lije .  lije .     a hand shook baley   s shoulder roughly .   baley stirred and said     what   s up  phil .      philip norris  plain clothes man c    sat down  put his hands on his knees  and leaned forward  peering at baley   s face .     what happened to you .  been living on knockout drops lately .  you were sitting there with your eyes open and  near as i could make out  you were dead .      he rubbed his thinning  pale blond hair  and his close set eyes appraised baley   s cooling lunch greedily .     chicken .     he said .     it   s getting so you can   t get it without a doctor   s prescription .         take some     said baley  listlessly .   decorum won out and norris said     oh  well  i   m going out to eat in a minute .  you keep it .    say  what   s doing with the commish .         what .      norris attempted a casual attitude  but his hands were restless .  he said     go on .  you know what i mean .  you   ve been living with him ever since he got back .  what   s up .  a promotion in the works .      baley frowned and felt reality return somewhat at the touch of office politics .  norris had approximately his own seniority and he was bound to watch most assiduously for any sign of official preference in baley   s direction .   baley said     no promotion .  believe me .  it   s nothing .  nothing .  and if it   s the commissioner you   re wanting  i wish i could give him to you .  jehoshaphat .  take him .      norris said     don   t get me wrong .  i don   t care if you get promoted .  i just mean that if you   ve got any pull with the commish  how about using it for the kid .         what kid .      there was no need of any answer to that .  vincent barrett  the youngster who had been moved out of his job to make room for r .  sammy  was shuffling up from an unnoticed corner of the room .  a skull cap turned restlessly in his hands and the skin over his high cheekbones moved as he tried to smile .      hello  mr .  baley .         oh  hello  vince .  how   re you doing .         not so good  mr .  baley .      he was looking about hungrily .  baley thought  he looks lost  half dead  declassified .   then  savagely  his lips almost moving with the force of his emotion  he thought  but what does he want from me .   he said     i   m sorry  kid .     what else was there to say .      i keep thinking  maybe something has turned up .      norris moved in close and spoke into baley   s ear .     someone   s got to stop this sort of thing .  they   re going to move out chenlow now .         what .         haven   t you heard .         no  i haven   t .  damn it  he   s a c   .  he   s got ten years behind him .         i grant that .  but a machine with legs can do his work .  who   s next .      young vince barrett was oblivious to the whispers .  he said out of the depths of his own thinking     mr .  baley .         yes  vince .         you know what they say .  they say lynane millane  the subethenics dancer  is really a robot .         that   s silly .         is it .  they say they can make robots look just like humans  with a special plastic skin  sort of .      baley thought guiltily of r .  daneel and found no words .  he shook his head .   the boy said     do you suppose anyone will mind if i just walk around .  it makes me feel better to see the old place .         go ahead  kid .      the youngster wandered off .  baley and norris watched him go .   norris said     it looks as though the medievalists are right .         you mean back to the soil .  is that it  phil .         no .  i mean about the robots .  back to the soil .  huh .  old earth has an unlimited future .  we don   t need robots  that   s all .      baley muttered     eight billion people and the uranium running out .  what   s unlimited about it .         what if the uranium does run out .  we   ll import it .  or we   ll discover other nuclear processes .  there   s no way you can stop mankind  lije .  you   ve got to be optimistic about it and have faith in the old human brain .  our greatest resource is ingenuity and we   ll never run out of that  lije .      he was fairly started now .  he went on     for one thing  we can use sunpower and that   s good for billions of years .  we can build space stations inside mercury   s orbit to act as energy accumulators .  we   ll transmit energy to earth by direct beam .      this project was not new to baley .  the speculative fringe of science had been playing with the notion for a hundred and fifty years at least .  what was holding it up was the impossibility so far of projecting a beam tight enough to reach fifty million miles without dispersal to uselessness .  baley said as much .   norris said     when it   s necessary  it   ll be done .  why worry .      baley had the picture of an earth of unlimited energy .  population could continue to increase .  the yeast farms could expand  hydroponic culture intensify .  energy was the only thing indispensable .  the raw minerals could be brought in from the uninhabited rocks of the system .  if ever water became a bottleneck  more could be brought in from the moons of jupiter .  hell  the oceans could be frozen and dragged out into space where they could circle earth as moonlets of ice .  there they would be  always available for use  while the ocean bottoms would represent more land for exploitation  more room to live .  even carbon and oxygen could be maintained and increased on earth through utilization of the methane atmosphere of titan and the frozen oxygen of umbriel .   earth   s population could reach a trillion or two .  why not .  there was a time when the current population of eight billion would have been viewed as impossible .  there was a time when a population of a single billion would have been unthinkable .  there had always been prophets of malthusian doom in every generation since medieval times and they had always proven wrong .   but what would fastolfe say .  a world of a trillion .  surely .  but they would be dependent on imported air and water and upon an energy supply from complicated storehouses fifty million miles away .  how incredibly unstable that would be .  earth would be  and remain  a feather   s weight away from complete catastrophe at the slightest failure of any part of the system wide mechanism .   baley said     i think it would be easier to ship off some of the surplus population  myself .     it was more an answer to the picture he had himself conjured up than to anything norris had said .      who   d have us .     said norris with a bitter lightness .      any uninhabited planet .      norris rose  patted baley on the shoulder .     lije  you eat your chicken  and recover .  you must be living on knockout pills .     he left  chuckling .   baley watched him leave with a humorless twist to his mouth .  norris would spread the news and it would be weeks before the humor boys of the office  every office has them  would lay off .  but at least it got him off the subject of young vince  of robots  of declassification .   he sighed as he put a fork into the now cold and somewhat stringy chicken .   baley finished the last of the yeast nut and it was only then that r .  daneel left his own desk  assigned him that morning  and approached .   baley eyed him uncomfortably .     well .      r .  daneel said     the commissioner is not in his office and it is not known when he   ll be back .  i   ve told r .  sammy we will use it and that he is to allow no one but the commissioner to enter .         what are we going to use it for .         greater privacy .  surely you agree that we must plan our next move .  after all  you do not intend to abandon the investigation  do you .      that was precisely what baley most longed to do  but obviously  he could not say so .  he rose and led the way to enderby   s office .   once in the office  baley said     all right  daneel .  what is it .     the robot said     partner elijah  since last night  you are not yourself .  there is a definite alteration in your mental aura .      a horrible thought sprang full grown into baley   s mind .  he cried     are you telepathic .      it was not a possibility he would have considered at a less disturbed moment .      no .  of course not     said r .  daneel .   baley   s panic ebbed .  he said     then what the devil do you mean by talking about my mental aura .         it is merely an expression i use to describe a sensation that you do not share with me .         what sensation .         it is difficult to explain  elijah .  you will recall that i was originally designed to study human psychology for our people back in spacetown .         yes  i know .  you were adjusted to detective work by the simple installation of a justice desire circuit .     baley did not try to keep the sarcasm out of his voice .      exactly  elijah .  but my original design remains essentially unaltered .  i was constructed for the purpose of cerebroanalysis .         for analyzing brain waves .         why  yes .  it can be done by field measurements without the necessity of direct electrode contact  if the proper receiver exists .  my mind is such a receiver .  is that principle not applied on earth .      baley didn   t know .  he ignored the question and said  cautiously     if you measure the brain waves  what do you get out of it .         not thoughts  elijah .  i get a glimpse of emotion and most of all  i can analyze temperament  the underlying drives and attitudes of a man .  for instance  it was i who was able to ascertain that commissioner enderby was incapable of killing a man under the circumstances prevailing at the time of the murder .         and they eliminated him as a suspect on your say so .         yes .  it was safe enough to do so .  i am a very delicate machine in that respect .      again a thought struck baley .     wait .  commissioner enderby didn   t know he was being cerebroanalyzed  did he .         there was no necessity of hurting his feelings .         i mean you just stood there and looked at him .  no machinery .  no electrodes .  no needles and graphs .         certainly not .  i am a self contained unit .      baley bit his lower lip in anger and chagrin .  it had been the one remaining inconsistency  the one loophole through which a forlorn stab might yet be made in an attempt to pin the crime on spacetown .   r .  daneel had stated that the commissioner had been cerebroanalyzed and one hour later the commissioner himself had  with apparent candor  denied any knowledge of the term .  certainly no man could have undergone the shattering experience of electroencephalographic measurements by electrode and graph under the suspicion of murder without an unmistakable impression of what cerebroanalysis must be .   but now that discrepancy had evaporated .  the commissioner had been cerebroanalyzed and had never known it .  r .  daneel told the truth  so had the commissioner .      well     said baley  sharply     what does cerebroanahysis tell you about me .         you are disturbed .         that   s a great discovery  isn   t it .  of course  i   m disturbed .         specifically  though  your disturbance is due to a clash between motivations within you .  on the one hand your devotion to the principles of your profession urges you to look deeply into this conspiracy of earthmen who lay siege to us last night .  another motivation  equally strong  forces you in the opposite direction .  this much is clearly written in the electric field of your cerebral cells .         my cerebral cells  nuts     said baley  feverishly .     look  i   ll tell you why there   s no point in investigating your so called conspiracy .  it has nothing to do with the murder .  i thought it might have .  i   ll admit that .  yesterday in the kitchen  i thought we were in danger .  but what happened .  they followed us out  were quickly lost on the strips  and that was that .  that was not the action of well organized and desperate men .      my own son found out where we were staying easily enough .  he called the department .  he didn   t even have to identify himself .  our precious conspirators could have done the same if they had really wanted to hurt us .         didn   t they .         obviously not .  if they had wanted riots  they could have started one at the shoe counter  and yet they backed out tamely enough before one man and a blaster .  one robot  and a blaster which they must have known you would be unable to fire once they recognized what you were .  they   re medievalists .  they   re harmless crackpots .  you wouldn   t know that  but i should have .  and i would have  if it weren   t for the fact that this whole business has me thinking in  in foolish melodramatic terms .      i tell you i know the type of people that become medievalists .  they   re soft  dreamy people who find life too hard for them here and get lost in an ideal world of the past that never really existed .  if you could cerebroanalyze a movement as you do an individual  you would find they are no more capable of murder than julius enderby himself .      r .  daneel said slowly     i cannot accept your statements at face value .         what do you mean .         your conversion to this view is too sudden .  there are certain discrepancies  too .  you arranged the appointment with dr .  gerrigel hours before the evening meal .  you did not know of my food sac then and could not have suspected me as the murderer .  why did you call him  then .         i suspected you even then .         and last night you spoke as you slept .     baley   s eyes widened .     what did i say .         merely the one word    jessie    several times repeated .  i believe you were referring to your wife .      baley let his tight muscles loosen .  he said  shakily     i had a nightmare .  do you know what that is .         i do not know by personal experience  of course .  the dictionary definition has it that it is a bad dream .         and do you know what a dream is .         again  the dictionary definition only .  it is an illusion of reality experienced during the temporary suspension of conscious thought which you call sleep .         all right .  i   ll buy that .  an illusion .  sometimes the illusions can seem damned real .  well  i dreamed my wife was in danger .  it   s the sort of dream people often have .  i called her name .  that happens under such circumstances  too .  you can take my word for it .         i am only too glad to do so .  but it brings up a thought .  how did jessie find out i was a robot .      baley   s forehead went moist again .     we   re not going into that again  are we .  the rumor          i am sorry to interrupt  partner elijah  but there is no rumor .  if there were  the city would be alive with unrest today .  i have checked reports coming into the department and this is not so .  there simply is no rumor .  therefore  how did your wife find out .         jehoshaphat .  what are you trying to say .  do you think my wife is one of the members of  of  .  .  .         yes  elijah .      baley gripped his hands together tightly .     well  she isn   t  and we won   t discuss that point any further .         this is not like you  elijah .  in the course of duty  you accused me of murder twice .         and is this your way of getting even .         i am not sure i understand what you mean by the phrase .  certainly  i approve your readiness to suspect me .  you had your reasons .  they were wrong  but they might easily have been right .  equally strong evidence points to your wife .         as a murderess .  why  damn you  jessie wouldn   t hurt her worst enemy .  she couldn   t set foot outside the city .  she couldn   t  .  .  .       why  if you were flesh and blood i   d          i merely say that she is a member of the conspiracy .  i say that she should be questioned .         not on your life .  not on whatever it is you call your life .  now  listen to me .  the medievalists aren   t after our blood .  it   s not the way they do things .  but they are trying to get you out of the city .  that much is obvious .  and they   re trying to do it by a kind of psychological attack .  they   re trying to make life unpleasant for you and for me  since i   m with you .  they could easily have found out jessie was my wife  and it was an obvious move for them to let the news leak to her .  she   s like any other human being .  she doesn   t like robots .  she wouldn   t want me to associate with one  especially if she thought it involved danger  and surely they would imply that .  i tell you it worked .  she begged all night to have me abandon the case or to get you out of the city somehow .         presumably     said r .  daneel     you have a very strong urge to protect your wife against questioning .  it seems obvious to me that you are constructing this line of argument without really believing it .         what the hell do you think you are .     ground out baley .     you   re not a detective .  you   re a cerebroanalysis machine like the electroencephalographs we have in this building .  you   ve got arms  legs  a head  and can talk  but you   re not one inch more than that machine .  putting a lousy circuit into you doesn   t make you a detective  so what do you know .  you keep your mouth shut  and let me do the figuring out .      the robot said quietly     i think it would be better if you lowered your voice  elijah .  granted that i am not a detective in the sense that you are  i would still like to bring one small item to your attention .         i   m not interested in listening .         please do .  if i am wrong  you will tell me so  and it will do no harm .  it is only this .  last night you left our room to call jessie by corridor phone .  i suggested that your son go in your place .  you told me it was not the custom among earthmen for a father to send his son into danger .  is it then the custom for a mother to do so .         no  of cour      began baley  and stopped .      you see my point     said r .  daneel .     ordinarily  if jessie feared for your safety and wished to warn you  she would risk her own life  not send her son .  the fact that she did send bentley could only mean that she felt that he would be safe while she herself would not .  if the conspiracy consisted of people unknown to jessie  that would not be the case  or at least she would have no reason to think it to be the case .  on the other hand  if she were a member of the conspiracy  she would know  she would know  elijah  that she would be watched for and recognized  whereas bentley might get through unnoticed .         wait now     said baley  sick at heart     that   s feather fine reasoning .      there was no need to wait .  the signal on the commissioner   s desk was flickering madly .  r .  daneel waited for baley to answer  but the latter could only stare at it helplessly .  the robot closed contact .      what is it .      r .  sammy   s slurring voice said     there is a lady here who wishes to see lije .  i told her he was busy  but she will not go away .  she says her name is jessie .         let her in     said r .  daneel calmly  and his brown eyes rose unemotionally to meet the panicky glare of baley   s .       chapter      power of a name   baley remained standing in a tetany of shock  as jessie ran to him  seizing his shoulders  huddling close .   his pale lips formed the word     bentley .      she looked at him and shook her head  her brown hair flying with the force of her motion .     he   s all right .         well  then  .  .  .      jessie said through a sudden torrent of sobs  in a low voice that could scarcely be made out     i can   t go on  lije .  i can   t .  i can   t sleep or eat .  i   ve got to tell you .         don   t say anything     baley said in anguish .     for god   s sake  jessie  not now .         i must .  i   ve done a terrible thing .  such a terrible thing .  oh  lije  .  .  .     she lapsed into incoherence .   baley said  hopelessly     we   re not alone  jessie .      she looked up and stared at r .  daneel with no signs of recognition .  the tears in which her eyes were swimming might easily be refracting the robot into a featureless blur .   r .  daneel said in a low murmur     good afternoon  jessie .      she gasped .     is it the  the robot .      she dashed the back of her hand across her eyes and stepped out of baley   s encircling right arm .  she breathed deeply and  for a moment  a tremulous smile wavered on her lips .     it is you  isn   t it .         yes  jessie .         you don   t mind being called a robot .         no  jessie .  it is what i am .         and i don   t mind being called a fool and an idiot and a  a subversive agent  because it   s what i am .         jessie .     groaned baley .      it   s no use  lije     she said .     he might as well know if he   s your partner .  i can   t live with it any more .  i   ve had such a time since yesterday .  i don   t care if i go to jail .  i don   t care if they send me down to the lowest levels and make me live on raw yeast and water .  i don   t care if  .  .  .  you won   t let them  will you  lije .  don   t let them do anything to me .  i   m fuh  frightened .      baley patted her shoulder and let her cry .   he said to r .  daneel .     she isn   t well .  we can   t keep her here .  what time is it .      r .  daneel said without any visible signs of consulting a timepiece     fourteen forty five .         the commissioner could be back any minute .  look  commandeer a squad car and we can talk about this in the motorway .      jessie   s head jerked upright .     the motorway .  oh  no  lije .      he said  in as soothing a tone as he could manage     now  jessie  don   t be superstitious .  you can   t go on the expressway the way you are .  be a good girl and calm down or we won   t even be able to go through the common room .  i   ll get you some water .      she wiped her face with a damp handkerchief and said drearily     oh  look at my makeup .         don   t worry about your makeup     said baley .     daneel  what about the squad car .         it   s waiting for us now  partner elijah .         come on  jessie .         wait .  wait just a minute  lije .  i   ve got to do something to my face .         it doesn   t matter now .      but she twisted away .     please .  i can   t go through the common room like this .  i won   t take a second .      the man and the robot waited  the man with little jerky clenchings of his fists  the robot impassively .   jessie rummaged through her purse for the necessary equipment .   if there were one thing  baley had once said solemnly  that had resisted mechanical improvement since medieval times  it was a woman   s purse .  even the substitution of magnetic clotures for metal clasps had not proven successful .   jessie pulled out a small mirror and the silver cased cosmetokit that baley had bought her on the occasion of three birthdays before .   the cosmetokit had several orifices and she used each in turn .  all but the last spray were invisible .  she used them with that fineness of touch and delicacy of control that seems to be the birthright of women even at times of the greatest stress .   the base went on first in a smooth even layer that removed all shininess and roughness from the skin and left it with the faintly golden glow which long experience had taught jessie was just the shade most suited to the natural coloring of her hair and eyes .  then the touch of tan along the forehead and chin  a gentle brush of rouge on either cheek  tracing back to the angle of the jaw  and a delicate drift of blue on the upper eyelids and along the earlobes .  finally there was the application of the smooth carmine to the lips .  that involved the one visible spray  a faintly pink mist that glistened liquidly in air  but dried and deepened richly on contact with the lips .      there     said jessie  with several swift pats at her hair and a look of deep dissatisfaction .     i suppose that will do .      the process had taken more than the promised second  but less than fifteen seconds .  nevertheless  it had seemed interminable to baley .      come     he said .   she barely had time to return the cosmetokit to the purse before he had pushed her through the door .   the eerie silence of the motorway lay thick on either side .   baley said     all right  jessie .      the impassivity that had covered jessie   s face since they first left the commissioner   s office showed signs of cracking .  she looked at her husband and at daneel with a helpless silence .   baley said     get it over with  jessie .  please .  have you committed a crime .  an actual crime .         a crime .     she shook her head uncertainly .      now hold on to yourself .  no hysterics .  just say yes or no  jessie .  have you      he hesitated a trifle     killed anyone .      the look on jessie   s face was promptly transmuted to indignation .     why  lije baley .         yes or no  jessie .         no  of course not .      the hard knot in baley   s stomach softened perceptibly .     have you stolen anything .  falsified ration data .  assaulted anyone .  destroyed property .  speak up  jessie .         i haven   t done anything  anything specific .  i didn   t mean anything like that .     she looked over her shoulder .     lije  do we have to stay down here .         right here until this is over .  now  start at the beginning .  what did you come to tell us .     over jessie   s bowed head  baley   s eyes met r .  daneel   s .   jessie spoke in a soft voice that gained in strength and articulateness as she went on .      it   s these people  these medievalists  you know  lije .  they   re always around  always talking .  even in the old days when i was an assistant dietitian  it was like that .  remember elizabeth thornbowe .  she was a medievalist .  she was always talking about how all our troubles came from the city and how things were better before the cities started .      i used to ask her how she was so sure that was so  especially after you and i met  lije  remember the talks we used to have   and then she would quote from those small book reels that are always floating around .  you know  like shame of the cities that the fellow wrote .  i don   t remember his name .      baley said  absently     ogninsky .         yes  only most of them were lots worse .  then  when i married you  she was really sarcastic .  she said     i suppose you   re going to be a real city woman now that you   ve married a policeman .     after that  she didn   t talk to me much and then i quit the job and that was that .  lots of things she used to say were just to shock me  i think  or to make herself look mysterious and glamorous .  she was an old maid  you know  never got married till the day she died .  lots of those medievalists don   t fit in  one way or another .  remember  you once said  lije  that people sometimes mistake their own shortcomings for those of society and want to fix the cities because they don   t know how to fix themselves .      baley remembered  and his words now sounded flip and superficial in his own ears .  he said  gently     keep to the point  jessie .      she went on     anyway  lizzy was always talking about how there   d come a day and people had to get together .  she said it was all the fault of the spacers because they wanted to keep earth weak and decadent .  that was one of her favorite words     decadent .     she   d look at the menus i   d prepare for the next week and sniff and say     decadent  decadent .     jane myers used to imitate her in the cook room and we   d die laughing .  she said  elizabeth did  that someday we were going to break up the cities and go back to the soil and have an accounting with the spacers who were trying to tie us forever to the cities by forcing robots on us .  only she never called them robots .  she used to say    soulless monster machines     if you   ll excuse the expression  daneel .      the robot said     i am not aware of the significance of the adjective you used  jessie  but in any case  the expression is excused .  please go on .      baley stirred restlessly .  it was that way with jessie .  no emergency  h no crisis could make her tell a story in any way but her own circuitous one .   she said     elizabeth always tried to talk as though there were lots of people in it with her .  she would say     at the last meeting     and then stop and look at me sort of half proud and half scared as though she wanted me to ask about it so she could look important  and yet scared i might get her in trouble .  of course  i never asked her .  i wouldn   t give her the satisfaction .      anyway  after i married you  lije  it was all over  until      she stopped .      go on  jessie     said baley .      you remember  lije  that argument we had .  about jezebel  i mean .         what about it .     it took a second or two for baley to remember that it was jessie   s own name  and not a reference to another woman .   he turned to r .  daneel in an automatically defensive explanation .      jessie   s full name is jezebel .  she is not fond of it and doesn   t use it .      r .  daneel nodded gravely and baley thought  jehoshaphat  why waste worry on him .      it bothered me a lot  lije     jessie said .     it really did .  i guess it was silly  but i kept thinking and thinking about what you said .  i mean about your saying that jezebel was only a conservative who fought for the ways of her ancestors against the strange ways the newcomers had brought .  after all  i was jezebel and i always  .  .  .      she groped for a word and baley supplied it .     identified yourself .         yes .     but she shook her head almost immediately and looked away .     not really  of course .  not literally .  the way i thought she was  you know .  i wasn   t like that .         i know that  jessie .  don   t be foolish .         but still i thought of her a lot and  somehow  i got to thinking  it   s just the same now as it was then .  i mean  we earth people had our old ways and here were the spacers coming in with a lot of new ways and trying to encourage the new ways we had stumbled into ourselves and maybe the medievalists were right .  maybe we should go back to our old  good ways .  so i went back and found elizabeth .         yes .  go on .         she said she didn   t know what i was talking about and besides i was a cop   s wife .  i said that had nothing to do with it and finally she said  well  she   d speak to somebody  and then about a month later she came to me and said it was all right and i joined and i   ve been at meetings ever since .      baley looked at her sadly .     and you never told me .      jessie   s voice trembled .     i   m sorry  lije .         well  that won   t help .  being sorry  i mean .  i want to know about the meetings .  in the first place  where were they held .      a sense of detachment was creeping over him  a numbing of emotions .  what he had tried not to believe was so  was openly so  was unmistakably so .  in a sense  it was a relief to have the uncertainty over .   she said     down here .         down here .  you mean on this spot .  what do you mean .         here in the motorway .  that   s why i didn   t want to come down here .  it was a wonderful place to meet  though .  we   d get together          how many .         i   m not sure .  about sixty or seventy .  it was just a sort of local branch .  there   d be folding chairs and some refreshments and someone would make a speech  mostly about how wonderful life was in the old days and how someday we   d do away with the monsters  the robots  that is  and the spacers  too .  the speeches were sort of dull really  because they were all the same .  we just endured them .  mostly  it was the fun of getting together and feeling important .  we would pledge ourselves to oaths and there   d be secret ways we could greet each other on the outside .         weren   t you ever interrupted .  no squad cars or fire engines passed .         no .  never .      r .  daneel interrupted     is that unusual  elijah .         maybe not     baley answered thoughtfully .     there are some side passages that are practically never used .  it   s quite a trick  knowing which they are  though .  is that all you did at the meetings  jessie .  make speeches and play at conspiracy .         it   s about all .  and sing songs  sometimes .  and of course  refreshments .  not much .  sandwiches  usually  and juice .         in that case     he said  almost brutally     what   s bothering you now .      jessie winced .     you   re angry .         please     said baley  with iron patience     answer my question .  if it were all as harmless as that  why have you been in such a panic for the last day and a half .         i thought they would hurt you  lije .  for heaven   s sake  why do you act as though you don   t understand .  i   ve explained it to you .         no  you haven   t .  not yet .  you   ve told me about a harmless little secret kaffee klatsch you belonged to .  did they ever hold open demonstrations .  did they ever destroy robots .  start riots .  kill people .         never .  lije  i wouldn   t do any of those things .  i wouldn   t stay a member if they tried it .         well  then  why do you say you   ve done a terrible thing .  why do you expect to be sent to jail .         well  .  .  .  well  they used to talk about someday when they   d put pressure on the government .  we were supposed to get organized and then afterward there would be huge strikes and work stoppages .  we could force the government to ban all robots and make the spacers go back where they came from .  i thought it was just talk and then  this thing started  about you and daneel  i mean .  then they said     now we   ll see action     and    we   re going to make an example of them and put a stop to the robot invasion right now .     right there in personal they said it  not knowing it was you they were talking about .  but i knew .  right away .      her voice broke .   baley softened .     come on  jessie .  it was all nothing .  it was just talk .  you can see for yourself that nothing has happened .         i was so  so suh  scared .  and i thought  i   m part of it .  if there were going to be killing and destruction  you might be killed and bentley and somehow it would be all muh  my fault for taking part in it  and i ought to be sent to jail .      baley let her sob herself out .  he put his arm about her shoulder and stared tight lipped at r .  daneel  who gazed calmly back .   he said     now  i want you to think  jessie .  who was the head of your group .      she was quieter now  patting the corners of her eyes with a handkerchief .     a man called joseph klemin was the leader  but he wasn   t really anybody .  he wasn   t more than five feet four inches tall and i think he was terribly henpecked at home .  i don   t think there   s any harm in him .  you aren   t going to arrest him  are you  lije .  on my say so .     she looked guiltily troubled .      i   m not arresting anyone just yet .  how did klemin get his instructions .         i don   t know .         did any strangers come to meeting .  you know what i mean  big shots from central headquarters .         sometimes people would come to make speeches .  that wasn   t very often  maybe twice a year or so .         can you name them .         no .  they were always just introduced as    one of us    or    a friend from jackson heights    or wherever .         i see .  daneel .         yes  elijah     said r .  daneel .      describe the men you think you   ve tabbed .  we   ll see if jessie can recognize them .      r .  daneel went through the list with clinical exactness .  jessie listened with an expression of dismay as the categories of physical measurements lengthened and shook her head with increasing firmness .      it   s no use .  it   s no use     she cried .     how can i remember .  i can   t remember how any of them looked .  i can   t       she stopped  and seemed to consider .  then she said     did you say one of them was a yeast farmer .         francis clousarr     said r .  daneel     is an employee at new york yeast .         well  you know  once a man was making a speech and i happened to be sitting in the first row and i kept getting a whiff  just a whiff  really  of raw yeast smell .  you know what i mean .  the only reason that i remember is that i had an upset stomach that day and the smell kept making me sick .  i had to stand up and move to the back and of course i couldn   t explain what was wrong .  it was so embarrassing .  maybe that   s the man you   re speaking of .  after all  when you work with yeast all the time  the odor gets to stick to your clothes .     she wrinkled her nose .      you don   t remember what he looked like .     said baley .      no     she replied  with decision .      all right  then .  look  jessie  i   m going to take you to your mother   s .  bentley will stay with you  and none of you will leave the section .  ben can stay away from school and i   ll arrange to have meals sent in and the corridors around the apartment watched by the police .         what about you .     quavered jessie .      i   ll be in no danger .         but how long .         i don   t know .  maybe just a day or two .     the words sounded hollow even to himself .   they were back in the motorway  baley and r .  daneel  alone now .  baley   s expression was dark with thought .      it would seem to me     he said     that we are faced with an organization built up on two levels .  first  a ground level with no specific program  designed only to supply mass support for an eventual coup .  secondly  a much smaller elite dedicated to a well planned program of action .  it is this elite we must find .  the comic opera groups that jessie spoke of can be ignored .         all this     said r .  daneel     follows  perhaps  if we can take jessie   s story at face value .         i think     baley said stiffly     that jessie   s story can be accepted as completely true .         so it would seem     said r .  daneel .     there is nothing about her cerebra impulses that would indicate a pathological addiction to lying .      baley turned an offended look upon the robot .     i should say not .  and there will be no necessity to mention her name in our reports .  do you understand that .         if you wish it so  partner elijah     said r .  daneel calmly     but our report will then be neither complete nor accurate .      baley said     well  maybe so  but no real harm will be done .  she has come to us with whatever information she had and to mention her name will only put her in the police records .  i do not want that to happen .         in that case  certainly not  provided we are certain that nothing more remains to be found out .         nothing remains as far as she   s concerned .  my guarantee .         could you then explain why the word  jezebel  the mere sound of a name  should lead her to abandon previous convictions and assume a new set .  the motivation seems obscure .      they were traveling slowly through the curving  empty tunnel .   baley said     it is hard to explain .  jezebel is a rare name .  it belonged once to a woman of very bad reputation .  my wife treasured that fact .  it gave her a vicarious feeling of wickedness and compensated for a life that was uniformly proper .         why should a law abiding woman wish to feel wicked .      baley almost smiled .     women are women  daneel .  anyway  i did a very foolish thing .  in a moment of irritation  i insisted that the historic jezebel was not particularly wicked and was  if anything  a good wife .  i   ve regretted that ever since .      it turned out     he went on     that i had made jessie bitterly unhappy .  i had spoiled something for her that couldn   t be replaced .  i suppose what followed was her way of revenge .  i imagine she wished to punish me by engaging in activity of which she knew i wouldn   t approve .  i don   t say the wish was a conscious one .         can a wish be anything but conscious .  is that not a contradiction in terms .      baley stared at r daneel and despaired at attempting to explain the unconscious mind .  he said  instead     besides that  the bible has a great influence on human thought and emotion .         what is the bible .      for a moment baley was surprised  and then was surprised at himself for having felt surprised .  the spacers  he knew  lived under a thoroughly mechanistic personal philosophy  and r .  daneel could know only what the spacers knew  no more .   he said  curtly     it is the sacred book of about half of earth   s population .         i do not grasp the meaning here of the adjective .         i mean that it is highly regarded .  various portions of it  when properly interpreted  contain a code of behavior which many men consider best suited to the ultimate happiness of mankind .      r .  daneel seemed to consider that .     is this code incorporated into your laws .         i   m afraid not .  the code doesn   t lend itself to legal enforcement .  it must be obeyed spontaneously by each individual out of a longing to do so .  it is in a sense higher than any law can be .         higher than law .  is that not a contradiction in terms .      baley smiled wryly .     shall i quote a portion of the bible for you .  would you be curious to hear it .         please do .      baley let the car slow to a halt and for a few moments sat with his eyes closed  remembering .  he would have liked to use the sonorous middle english of the medieval bible  but to r .  daneel  middle english would be gibberish .   he began  speaking almost casually in the words of the modern revision  as though he were telling a story of contemporary life  instead of dredging a tale out of man   s dimmest past      jesus went to the mount of olives  and at dawn returned to the temple .  all the people came to him  and he sat down and preached to them .  and the scribes and pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery  and when they had placed her before him  they said to him     master  this woman was caught in adultery  in the very act .  now moses  in the law  commanded us to stone such offenders .  what do you say .         they said this  hoping to trap him  that they might have grounds for accusations against him .  but jesus stooped down  and with his finger wrote on the ground  as though he had not heard them .  but when they continued asking him  he stood up and said to them     he that is without sin among you  let him first cast a stone at her .         and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground .  and those that heard this  being convicted by their own conscience  went away one by one  beginning with the oldest  down to the last  and jesus was left alone  with the woman standing before him .  when jesus stood up and saw no one but the woman  he said to her     woman  where are your accusers .  has no one condemned you .         she said     no one  lord .         and jesus said to her     nor do i condemn you .  go  and sin no more .          r .  daneel listened attentively .  he said     what is adultery .         that doesn   t matter .  it was a crime and at the time  the accepted punishment was stoning  that is  stones were thrown at the guilty one until she was killed .         and the woman was guilty .         she was .         then why was she not stoned .         none of the accusers felt he could after jesus   s statement .  the story is meant to show that there is something even higher than the justice which you have been filled with .  there is a human impulse known as mercy  a human act known as forgiveness .         i am not acquainted with those words  partner elijah .         i know     muttered baley .     i know .      he started the squad car with a jerk and let it tear forward savagely .  he was pressed back against the cushions of the seat .      where are we going .     asked r .  daneel .      to yeast town     said baley     to get the truth out of francis clousarr  conspirator .         you have a method for doing this  elijah .         not i  exactly .  but you have  daneel .  a simple one .      they sped onward .       chapter      arrest of a conspirator   baley could sense the vague aroma of yeast town growing stronger  more pervasive .  he did not find it as unpleasant as some did  jessie  for instance .  he even liked it  rather .  it had pleasant connotations .   every time he smelled raw yeast  the alchemy of sense perception threw him more than three decades into the past .  he was a ten year old again  visiting his uncle boris  who was a yeast farmer .  uncle boris always had a little supply of yeast delectables  small cookies  chocolaty things filled with sweet liquid  hard confections in the shape of cats and dogs .  young as he was  he knew that uncle boris shouldn   t really have had them to give away and he always ate them very quietly  sitting in a corner with his back to the center of the room .  he would eat them quickly for fear of being caught .   they tasted all the better for that .   poor uncle boris .  he had an accident and died .  they never told him exactly how  and he had cried bitterly because he thought uncle boris had been arrested for smuggling yeast out of the plant .  he expected to be arrested and executed himself .  years later  he poked carefully through police files and found the truth .  uncle boris had fallen beneath the treads of a transport .  it was a disillusioning ending to a romantic myth .   yet the myth would always arise in his mind  at least momentarily  at the whiff of raw yeast .   yeast town was not the official name of any part of new york city .  it could be found in no gazetteer and on no official map .  what was called yeast town in popular speech was  to the post office  merely the boroughs of newark  new brunswick  and trenton .  it was a broad strip across what was once medieval new jersey  dotted with residential areas  particularly in newark center and trenton center  but given over mostly to the many layered farms in which a thousand varieties of yeast grew and multiplied .   one fifth of the city   s population worked in the yeast farms  another fifth worked in the subsidiary industries .  beginning with the mountains of wood and coarse cellulose that were dragged into the city from the tangled forests of the alleghenies  through the vats of acid that hydrolyzed it to glucose  the carloads of niter and phosphate rock that were the most important additives  down to the jars of organics supplied by the chemical laboratories it all came to only one thing  yeast and more yeast .   without yeast  six of earth   s eight billions would starve in a year .  baley felt cold at the thought .  three days before the possibility existed as deeply as it did now  but three days before it would never have occurred to him .   they whizzed out of the motorway through an exit on the newark outskirts .  the thinly populated avenues  flanked on either side by the featureless blocks that were the farms  offered little to act as a brake on their speed .      what time is it  daneel .     asked baley .      sixteen oh five     replied r .  daneel .      then he   ll be at work  if he   s on day shift .      baley parked the squad car in a delivery recess and froze the controls .      this is new york yeast then  elijah .     asked the robot .      part of it     said baley .   they entered into a corridor flanked by a double row of offices .  a receptionist at a bend in the corridor was instantly smiles .     whom do you wish to see .      baley opened his wallet .     police .  is there a francis clousarr working for new york yeast .      the girl looked perturbed .     i can check .      she connected her switchboard through a line plainly marked    personnel     and her lips moved slightly  though no sound could be heard .   baley was no stranger to the throat phones that translated the small movements of the larynx into words .  he said     speak up  please .  let me hear you .      her words became audible  but consisted only of      .  .  .  he says he   s a policeman  sir .      a dark  well dressed man came out a door .  he had a thin mustache and his hairline was beginning to retreat .  he smiled whitely  and said     i   m prescott of personnel .  what   s the trouble  officer .      baley stared at him coldly and prescott   s smile grew strained .   prescott said     i just don   t want to upset the workers .  they   re touchy about the police .      baley said     tough  isn   t it .  is clousarr in the building now .         yes  officer .         let   s have a nod  then .  and if he   s gone when we get there  i   ll be speaking to you again .      the other   s smile was quite dead .  he muttered     i   ll get you a rod  officer .      the guide rod was set for department cg  section   .  what that meant in factory terminology  baley didn   t know .  he didn   t have to .  the rod was an inconspicuous thing which could be palmed in the hand .  its tip warmed gently when lined up in the direction for which it was set  cooled quickly when turned away .  the warmth increased as the final goal was approached .   to an amateur  the guide rod was almost useless  with its quick little differences of heat content  but few city dwellers were amateurs at this particular game .  one of the most popular and perennial of the games of childhood was hide and seek through the school level corridors with the use of toy guide rods .      hot or not  let hot spot spot .  hot spot guide rods are keen .       baley had found his way through hundreds of massive piles by guide rod  and he could follow the shortest course with one of them in his hand as though it had been mapped out for him .   when he stepped into a large and brilliantly lit room after ten minutes  the guide rod   s tip was almost hot .   baley said to the worker nearest the door     francis clousarr here .      the worker jerked his head .  baley walked in the indicated direction .  the odor of yeast was sharply penetrating  despite the laboring air pumps whose humming made a steady background noise .   a man had risen at the other end of the room  and was taking off an apron .  he was of moderate height  his face deeply lined despite his comparative youth  and his hair just beginning to grizzle .  he had large  knobby hands which he wiped slowly on a celltex towel .      i   m francis clousarr     he said .   baley looked briefly at r .  daneel .  the robot nodded .      okay     said baley .     anywhere here we can talk .         maybe     said clousarr slowly     but it   s just about the end of my shift .  how about tomorrow .         lots of hours between now and tomorrow .  let   s make it now .     baley opened his wallet and palmed it at the yeast farmer .   but clousarr   s hands did not waver in their somber wiping motions .  he said  coolly     i don   t know the system in the police department  but around here you get tight eating hours with no leeway .  i eat at       to        or i don   t eat .         it   s all right     said baley .     i   ll arrange to have your supper brought to you .         well  well     said clousarr  joylessly .     just like an aristocrat  or a c class copper .  what   s next .  private bath .         you just answer questions  clousarr     said baley     and save your big jokes for your girl friend .  where can we talk .         if you want to talk  how about the balance room .  suit yourself about that .  me  i   ve got nothing to say .      baley thumbed clousarr into the balance room .  it was square and antiseptically white  air conditioned independently of the larger room  and more efficiently   and with its walls lined with delicate electronic balances  glassed off and manipulable by field forces only .  baley had used cheaper models in his college days .  one make  which he recognized  could weigh a mere billion atoms .   clousarr said     i don   t expect anyone will be in here for a while .     baley grunted  then turned to daneel and said     would you step out and have a meal sent up here .  and if you don   t mind  wait outside for it .      he watched r .  daneel leave  then said to clousarr     you   re a chemist .         i   m a zymologist  if you don   t mind .         what   s the difference .      clousarr looked lofty .     a chemist is a soup pusher  a stink operator .   a zymologist is a man who helps keep a few billion people alive .  i   m a yeast culture specialist .         all right     said baley .   but clousarr went on     this laboratory keeps new york yeast going .  there isn   t one day  not one damned hour  that we haven   t got cultures of every strain of yeast in the company growing in our kettles .  we check and adjust the food factor requirements .  we make sure it   s breeding true .  we twist the genetics  start the new strains and weed them out  sort out their properties and mold them again .      when new yorkers started getting strawberries out of season a couple of years back  those weren   t strawberries  fella .  those were a special high sugar yeast culture with true bred color and just a dash of flavor additive .  it was developed right here in this room .      twenty years ago saccharomyces olei benedictae was just a scrub strain with a lousy taste of tallow and good for nothing .  it still tastes of tallow  but its fat content has been pushed up from    per cent to    per cent .  if you used the expressway today  just remember that it   s greased strictly with s .    .  benedictae  strain ag   .  developed right here in this room .      so don   t call me a chemist .  i   m a zymologist .      despite himself  baley retreated before the fierce pride of the other .  he said abruptly     where were you last night between the hours of eighteen and twenty .      clousarr shrugged .     walking .  i like to take a little walk after dinner .         you visited friends .  or a subetheric .         no .  just walked .      baley   s lips tightened .  a visit to the subetherics would have involved a notch in clousarr   s ration pack .  a meeting with a friend would have involved naming a man or woman  and a cross check .      no one saw you  then .         maybe someone did .  i don   t know .  not that i know of  though .         what about the night before last .         same thing .         you have no alibi then for either night .         if i had done anything criminal  officer  i   d have one .  what do i need an alibi for .      baley didn   t answer .  he consulted his little book .     you were up before the magistrate once .  inciting to riot .         all right .  one of the r things pushed past me and i tripped him up .  is that inciting to riot .         the court thought so .  you were convicted and fined .         that ends it  doesn   t it .  or do you want to fine me again .         night before last  there was a near riot at a shoe department in the bronx .  you were seen there .         by whom .      baley said     it was at mealtime for you here .  did you eat the evening meal night before last .      clousarr hesitated  then shook his head .     upset stomach .  yeast gets you that way sometimes .  even an old timer .         last night  there was a near riot in williamsburg and you were seen there .         by whom .         do you deny you were present on both occasions .         you   re not giving me anything to deny .  exactly where did these things happen and who says he saw me .      baley stared at the zymologist levelly .     i think you know exactly what i   m talking about .  i think you   re an important man in an unregistered medievalist organization .         i can   t stop you from thinking  officer  but thinking isn   t evidence .  maybe you know that .     clousarr was grinning .      maybe     said baley  his long face stony     i can get a little truth out of you right now .      baley stepped to the door of the balance room and opened it .  he said to r .  daneel  who was waiting stolidly outside     has clousarr   s evening meal arrived .         it is coming now  elijah .         bring it in  will you  daneel .      r .  daneel entered a moment later with a metal compartmented tray .      put it down in front of mr .  clousarr  daneel     said baley .  he sat down on one of the stools lining the balance wall  legs crossed  one shoe swinging rhythmically .  he watched clousarr edge stiffly away as r .  daneel placed the tray on a stool near the zymologist .      mr .  clousarr     said baley .     i want to introduce you to my partner  daneel olivaw .      daneel put out his hand and said     how do you do  francis .      clousarr said nothing .  he made no move to grasp daneel   s extended hand .  daneel maintained his position and clousarr began to redden .   baley said softly     you are being rude  mr .  clousarr .  are you too proud to shake hands with a policeman .      clousarr muttered     if you don   t mind  i   m hungry .     he unfolded a pocket fork out of a clasp knife he took from his pocket and sat down  eyes bent on his meal .   baley said     daneel  i think our friend is offended by your cold attitude .  you are not angry with him  are you .         not at all  elijah     said r .  daneel .      then show that there are no hard feelings .  put your arm about his shoulder .         i will be glad to     said r .  daneel  and stepped forward .   clousarr put down his fork .     what is this .  what   s going on .      r .  daneel  unruffled  put out his arm .   clousarr swung backhanded  wildly  knocking r .  daneel   s arm to one side .     damn it  don   t touch me .      he jumped up and away  the tray of food tipping and hitting the floor in a messy clatter .   baley  hard eyed  nodded curtly to r .  daneel  who thereupon continued a stolid advance toward the retreating zymologist .  baley stepped in front of the door .   clousarr yelled     keep that thing off me .         that   s no way to speak     said baley with equanimity .     the man   s my partner .         you mean he   s a damned robot     shrieked clousarr .      get away from him  daneel     said baley promptly .   r .  daneel stepped back and stood quietly against the door just behind baley .  clousarr  panting harshly  fists clenched  faced baley .   baley said     all right  smart boy .  what makes you think daneel   s a robot .         anyone can tell .         we   ll leave that to a judge .  meanwhile  i think we want you at headquarters  clousarr .  we   d like to have you explain exactly how you knew daneel was a robot .  and lots more  mister  lots more .  daneel  step outside and get through to the commissioner .  he   ll be at his home by now .  tell him to come down to the office .  tell him i have a fellow who can   t wait to be questioned .      r .  daneel stepped out .   baley said     what makes your wheels go round  clousarr .         i want a lawyer .         you   ll get one .  meanwhile  suppose you tell me what makes you medievalists tick .      clousarr looked away in a determined silence .   baley said     jehoshaphat  man  we know all about you and your organization .  i   m not bluffing .  just tell me for my own curiosity  what do you medievalists want .         back to the soil     said clousarr in a stifled voice .     that   s simple  isn   t it .         it   s simple to say     said baley .     but it isn   t simple to do .  how   s the soil going to feed eight billions .         did i say back to the soil overnight .  or in a year .  or in a hundred years .  step by step  mister policeman .  it doesn   t matter how long it takes  but let   s get started out of these caves we live in .  let   s get out into the fresh air .         have you ever been out into the fresh air .      clousarr squirmed .     all right  so i   m ruined  too .  but the children aren   t ruined yet .  there are babies being born continuously .  get them out  for god   s sake .  let them have space and open air and sun .  if we   ve got to  we   ll cut our population little by little  too .         backward  in other words  to an impossible past .     baley did not really know why he was arguing  except for the strange fever that was burning in his own veins .     back to the seed  to the egg  to the womb .  why not move forward .  don   t cut earth   s population .  use it for export .  go back to the soil  but go back to the soil of other planets .  colonize .      clousarr laughed harshly .     and make more outer worlds .  more spacers .         we won   t .  the outer worlds were settled by earthmen who came from a planet that did not have cities  by earthmen who were individualists and materialists .  those qualities were carried to an unhealthy extreme .  we can now colonize out of a society that has built co operation  if anything  too far .  now environment and tradition can interact to form a new middle way  distinct from either old earth or the outer worlds .  something newer and better .      he was parroting dr .  fastolfe  he knew  but it was coming out as though he himself had been thinking of it for years .   clousarr said     nuts .  colonize desert worlds with a world of our own at our fingertips .  what fools would try .         many .  and they wouldn   t be fools .  there   d be robots to help .         no     said clousarr  fiercely .     never .  no robots .         why not  for the love of heaven .  i don   t like them  either  but i   m not going to knife myself for the sake of a prejudice .  what are we afraid of in robots .  if you want my guess  it   s a sense of inferiority .  we  all of us  feel inferior to the spacers and hate it .  we   ve got to feel superior somehow  somewhere  to make up for it  and it kills us that we can   t at least feel superior to robots .  they seem to be better than us  only they   re not .  that   s the damned irony of it .      baley felt his blood heating as he spoke .     look at this daneel i   ve been with for over two days .  he   s taller than i am  stronger  handsomer .  he looks like a spacer  in fact .  he   s got a better memory and knows more facts .  he doesn   t have to sleep or eat .  he   s not troubled by sickness or panic or love or guilt .      but he   s a machine .  i can do anything i want to him  the way i can to that microbalance right there .  if i slam the microbalance  it won   t hit me back .  neither will daneel .  i can order him to take a blaster to himself and he   ll do it .      we can   t ever build a robot that will be even as good as a human being in anything that counts  let alone better .  we can   t create a robot with a sense of beauty or a sense of ethics or a sense of religion .  there   s no way we can raise a positronic brain one inch above the level of perfect materialism .      we can   t  damn it  we can   t .  not as long as we don   t understand what makes our own brains tick .  not as long as things exist that science can   t measure .  what is beauty  or goodness  or art  or love  or god .  we   re forever teetering on the brink of the unknowable  and trying to understand what can   t be understood .  it   s what makes us men .      a robot   s brain must be finite or it can   t be built .  it must be calculated to the final decimal place so that it has an end .  jehoshaphat  what are you afraid of .  a robot can look like daneel  he can look like a god  and be no more human than a lump of wood is .  can   t you see that .      clousarr had tried to interrupt several times and failed against baley   s furious torrent .  now  when baley paused in sheer emotional exhaustion  he said weakly     copper turned philosopher .  what do you know .      r .  daneel re entered .   baley looked at him and frowned  partly with the anger that had not yet left him  partly with new annoyance .   he said     what kept you .      r .  daneel said     i had trouble in reaching commissioner enderby  elijah .  it turned out he was still at his office .      baley looked at his watch .     now .  what for .         there is a certain confusion at the moment .  a corpse has been discovered in the department .         what .  for god   s sake  who .         the errand boy  r .  sammy .      baley gagged .  he stared at the robot and said in an outraged voice     i thought you said a corpse .      r .  daneel amended smoothly     a robot with a completely deactivated brain  if you prefer .      clousarr laughed suddenly and baley turned on him  saying huskily     nothing out of you .  understand .     deliberately  he unlimbered his blaster .  clousarr was very silent .   baley said     well  what of it .  r .  sammy blew a fuse .  so what .         commissioner enderby was evasive  elijah  but while he did not say so outright  my impression is that the commissioner believes r .  sammy to have been deliberately deactivated .      then  as baley absorbed that silently  r .  daneel added gravely     or  if you prefer the phrase  murdered .          chapter      questions concerning a motive   baley replaced his blaster  but kept his hand unobtrusively upon its butt .   he said     walk ahead of us  clousarr  to seventeenth street exit b .      clousarr said     i haven   t eaten .         tough     said baley  impatiently .     there   s your meal on the floor where you dumped it .         i have a right to eat .         you   ll eat in detention  or you   ll miss a meal .  you won   t starve .  get going .      all three were silent as they threaded the maze of new york yeast  clousarr moving stonily in advance  baley right behind him  and r .  daneel in the rear .   it was after baley and r .  daneel had checked out at the receptionist   s desk  after clousarr had drawn a leave of absence and requested that a man be sent in to clean up the balance room  after they were out in the open just to one side of the parked squad car  that clousarr said     just a minute .      he hung back  turned toward r .  daneel  and  before baley could make a move to stop him  stepped forward and swung his open hand full against the robot   s cheek .      what the devil     cried baley  snatching violently at clousarr .   clousarr did not resist the plain clothes man   s grasp .     it   s all right .  i   ll go .  i just wanted to see for myself .     he was grinning .   r .  daneel  having faded with the slap  but not having escaped it entirely  gazed quietly at clousarr .  there was no reddening of his cheek  no mark of any blow .   he said     that was a dangerous action  francis .  had i not moved backward  you might easily have damaged your hand .  as it is  i regret that i must have caused you pain .      clousarr laughed .   baley said     get in  clousarr .  you  too  daneel .  right in the back seat with him .  and make sure he doesn   t move .  i don   t care if it means breaking his arm .  that   s an order .         what about the first law .     mocked clousarr .      i think daneel is strong enough and fast enough to stop you without hurting you  but it might do you good to have an arm or two broken at that .      baley got behind the wheel and the squad car gathered speed .  the empty wind ruffled his hair and clousarr   s  but r .  daneel   s remained smoothly in place .   r .  daneel said quietly to clousarr     do you fear robots for the sake of your job  mr .  clousarr .      baley could not turn to see clousarr   s expression  but he was certain it would be a hard and rigid mirror of detestation  that he would be sitting stiffly apart  as far as he might  from r .  daneel .   clousarr   s voice said     and my kids    jobs .  and everyone   s kids .         surely adjustments are possible     said the robot .     if your children  for instance  were to accept training for emigration       clousarr broke in .     you  too .  the policeman talked about emigration .  he   s got good robot training .  maybe he is a robot .      baley growled     that   s enough  you .      r .  daneel said  evenly     a training school for emigrants would involve security  guaranteed classification  an assured career .  if you are concerned over your children  that is something to consider .         i wouldn   t take anything from a robot  or a spacer  or any of your trained hyenas in the government .      that was all .  the silence of the motorway engulfed them and there was only the soft whirr of the squad car motor and the hiss of its wheels on the pavement .   back at the department  baley signed a detention certificate for clousarr and left him in appropriate hands .  following that  he and r .  daneel took the motospiral up the levels to headquarters .   r .  daneel showed no surprise that they had not taken the elevators  nor did baley expect him to .  he was becoming used to the robot   s queer mixture of ability and submissiveness and tended to leave him out of his calculations .  the elevator was the logical method of heaping the vertical gap between detention and headquarters .  the long moving stairway that was the motospiral was useful only for short climbs or drops of two or three levels at most .  people of all sorts and varieties of administrative occupation stepped on and then off in less than a minute .  only baley and r .  daneel remained on continuously  moving upward in a slow and stolid measure .   baley felt that he needed the time .  it was only minutes at best  but up in headquarters he would be thrown violently into another phase of the problem and he wanted a rest .  he wanted time to think and orient himself .  slowly as it moved  the motospiral went too quickly to satisfy him .   r .  daneel said     it seems then we will not be questioning clousarr just yet .         he   ll keep     said baley  irritably .     let   s find out what the r .  sammy thing is all about .     he added in a mutter  far more to himself than to r .  daneel     it can   t be independent  there must be a connection .      r .  daneel said     it is a pity .  clousarr   s cerebric qualities          what about them .         they have changed in a strange way .  what was it that took place between the two of you in the balance room while i was not present .      baley said  absently     the only thing i did was to preach at him .  i passed along the gospel according to st .  fastolfe .         i do not understand you  elijah .      baley sighed and said     look  i tried to explain that earth might as well make use of robots and get its population surplus onto other planets .  i tried to knock some of the medievalist hogwash out of his head .  god knows why .  i   ve never thought of myself as the missionary type .  anyway  that   s all that happened .         i see .  well  that makes some sense .  perhaps that can be fitted in .  tell me  elijah  what did you tell him about robots .         you really want to know .  i told him robots were simply machines .  that was the gospel according to st .  gerrigel .  there are any number of gospels  i think .         did you by any chance tell him that one could strike a robot without fear of a return blow  much as one could strike any other mechanical object .         except a punching bag  i suppose .  yes .  but what made you guess that .     baley looked curiously at the robot .      it fits the cerebric changes     said r .  daneel     and it explains his blow to my face just after we left the factory .  he must have been thinking of what you said  so he simultaneously tested your statement  worked off his aggressive feelings  and had the pleasure of seeing me placed in what seemed to him a position of inferiority .  in order to be so motivated and allowing for the delta variations in his quintic  .  .  .      he paused a long moment and said     yes  it is quite interesting  and now i believe i can form a self consistent whole of the data .      headquarters level was approaching .  baley said     what time is it .     he thought  pettishly  nuts  i could look at my watch and take less time that way .   but he knew why he asked him  nevertheless .  the motive was not so different from clousarr   s in punching r .  daneel .  to give the robot a trivial order that he must fulfill emphasized his roboticity and  contrariwise  baley   s humanity .   baley thought  we   re all brothers .  under the skin  over it  everywhere .  jehoshaphat .   r .  daneel said     twenty ten .      they stepped off the motospiral and for a few seconds baley had the usual queen sensation that went with the necessary adjustment to non motion after long minutes of steady movement .   he said     and i haven   t eaten .  damn this job  anyway .      baley saw and heard commissioner enderby through the open door of his office .  the common room was empty  as though it had been wiped clean  and enderby   s voice rang through it with unusual hollowness .  his round face looked bare and weak without its glasses  which he held in his hand  while he mopped his smooth forehead with a flimsy paper napkin .   his eyes caught baley just as the latter reached the door and his voice rose into a petulant tenor .      good god  baley  where the devil were you .      baley shrugged off the remark and said     what   s doing .  where   s the night shift .     and then caught sight of the second person in the office with the commissioner .   he said  blankly     dr .  gerrigel .      the gray haired roboticist returned the involuntary greeting by nodding briefly .     i   m glad to see you again  mr .  baley .      the commissioner readjusted his glasses and stared at baley through them .     the entire staff is being questioned downstairs .  signing statements .  i was going mad trying to find you .  it looked queer  your being away .         my being away .     cried baley  strenuously .      anybody   s being away .  someone in the department did it and there   s going to be hell to pay for that .  what an unholy mess .  what an unholy  rotten mess .      he raised his hands as though in expostulation to heaven and as he did so  his eyes fell on r .  daneel .   baley thought sardonically  first time you   ve looked daneel in the face .  take a good look  julius .   the commissioner said in a subdued voice     he   ll have to sign a statement .  even i   ve had to do it .  i .      baley said     look  commissioner  what makes you so sure that r .  sammy didn   t blow a gasket all by himself .  what makes it deliberate destruction .      the commissioner sat down heavily .     ask him     he said  and pointed to dr .  gerrigel .   dr .  gerrigel cleared his throat .     i scarcely know how to go about this  mr .  baley .  i take it from your expression that you are surprised to see me .         moderately     admitted baley .      well  i was in no real hurry to return to washington and my visits to new york are few enough to make me wish to linger .  and what   s more important  i had a growing feeling that it would be criminal for me to leave the city without having made at least one more effort to be allowed to analyze your fascinating robot  whom  by the way      he looked very eager     i see you have with you .      baley stirred restlessly .     that   s quite impossible .      the roboticist looked disappointed .     now  yes .  perhaps later .      baley   s long face remained woodenly unresponsive .   dr .  gerrigel went on .     i called you  but you weren   t in and no one knew where you could be located .  i asked for the commissioner and he asked me to come to headquarters and wait for you .      the commissioner interposed quickly .     i thought it might be important .  i knew you wanted to see the man .      baley nodded .     thanks .      dr .  gerrigel said     unfortunately my guide rod was somewhat off  or perhaps in my over anxiety i misjudged its temperature .  in either case i took a wrong turning and found myself in a small room       the commissioner interrupted again .     one of the photographic supply rooms  lije .         yes     said dr .  gerrigel .     and in it was the prone figure of what was obviously a robot .  it was quite clear to me after a brief examination that he was irreversibly deactivated .  dead  you might say .  nor was it very difficult to determine the cause of the deactivation .         what was it .     asked baley .      in the robot   s partly clenched right fist     said dr .  gerrigel     was a shiny ovoid about two inches long and half an inch wide with a mica window at one end .  the fist was in contact with his skull as though the robot   s last act had been to touch his head .  the thing he was holding was an alpha sprayer .  you know what they are  i suppose .      baley nodded .  he needed neither dictionary nor handbook to be told what an alpha sprayer was .  he had handled several in his lab courses in physics  a head alloy casing with a narrow pit dug into it longitudinally  at the bottom of which was a fragment of a plutonium salt .  the pit was capped with a shiver of mica  which was transparent to alpha particles .  in that one direction  hard radiation sprayed out .   an alpha sprayer had many uses  but killing robots was not one of them  not a legal one  at least .   baley said     he held it to his head mica first  i take it .      dr .  gerrigel said     yes  and his positronic brain paths were immediately randomized .  instant death  so to speak .      baley turned to the pale commissioner .     no mistake .  it really was an alpha sprayer .      the commissioner nodded  his plump lips thrust out .     absolutely .  the counters could spot it ten feet away .  photographic film in the storeroom was fogged .  cut and dried .      he seemed to brood about it for a moment or two  then said abruptly     dr .  gerrigel  i   m afraid you   ll have to stay in the city a day or two until we can get your evidence down on  wire  film .  i   ll have you escorted to a room .  you don   t mind being under guard  i hope .      dr .  gerrigel said nervously     do you think it   s necessary .         it   s safer .      dr .  gerrigel  seeming quite abstracted  shook hands all around  even with r .  daneel  and left .   the commissioner heaved a sigh .     it   s one of us  lije .  that   s what bothers me .  no outsider would come into the department just to knock off a robot .  plenty of them outside where it   s safer .  and it had to be somebody who could pick up an alpha sprayer .  they   re hard to get hold of .      r .  daneel spoke  his cool  even voice cutting through the agitated words of the commissioner .  he said     but what is the motive for this murder .      the commissioner glanced at r .  daneel with obvious distaste  then looked away .     we   re human  too .  i suppose policemen can   t get to like robots any more than anyone else can .  he   s gone now and maybe it   s a relief to somebody .  he used to annoy you considerably  lije  remember .         that is scarcely murder motive     said r daneel .      no     agreed baley  with decision .      it isn   t murder     said the commissioner .     it   s property damage .  let   s keep our legal terms straight .  it   s just that it was done inside the department .  anywhere else it would be nothing .  nothing .  now it could be a first class scandal .  lije .         yes .         when did you last see r .  sammy .      baley said     r .  daneel spoke to r .  sammy after lunch .  i should judge it was about       .  he arranged to have us use your office  commissioner .         my office .  what for .         i wanted to talk over the case with r .  daneel in moderate privacy .  you weren   t in  so your office was an obvious place .         i see .     the commissioner looked dubious  but let the matter ride .     you didn   t see him yourself .         no  but i heard his voice perhaps an hour afterward .         are you sure it was he .         perfectly .         that would be about       .         or a little sooner .      the commissioner bit his pudgy lower lip thoughtfully .     well  that settles one thing .         it does .         yes .  the boy  vincent barrett  was here today .  did you know that .         yes .  but  commissioner  he wouldn   t do anything like this .      the commissioner lifted his eyes to baley   s face .     why not .  r .  sammy took his job away .  i can understand how he feels .  there would be a tremendous sense of injustice .  he would want a certain revenge .  wouldn   t you .  but the fact is that he left the building at       and you heard r .  sammy alive at       .  of course  he might have given the alpha sprayer to r .  sammy before he left with instructions not to use it for an hour  but then where could he have gotten an alpha sprayer .  it doesn   t bear thinking of .  let   s get back to r .  sammy .  when you spoke to him at        what did he say .      baley hesitated a perceptible moment  then said carefully     i don   t remember .  we left shortly afterward .         where did you go .         yeast town  eventually .  i want to talk about that  by the way .         later .  later .     the commissioner rubbed his chin .     jessie was in today  i noticed .  i mean  we were checking on all visitors today and i just happened to see her name .         she was here     said baley  coldly .      what for .         personal family matters .         she   ll have to be questioned as a pure formality .         i understand police routine  commissioner .  incidentally  what about the alpha sprayer itself .  has it been traced .         oh  yes .  it came from one of the power plants .         how do they account for having lost it .         they don   t .  they have no idea .  but look  lije  except for routine statements  this has nothing to do with you .  you stick to your case .  it   s just that  .  .  .  well  you stick to the spacetown investigation .      baley said     may i give my routine statements later  commissioner .  the fact is  i haven   t eaten yet .      commissioner enderby   s glassed eyes turned full on baley .     by all means get something to eat .  but stay inside the department  will you .  your partner   s right  though  lije     he seemed to avoid addressing r .  daneel or using his name     it   s the motive we need .  the motive .      baley felt suddenly frozen .   something outside himself  something completely alien  took up the events of this day and the day before and the day before and juggled them .  once again pieces began to dovetail  a pattern began to form .   he said     which power plant did the alpha sprayer come from  commissioner .         the williamsburg plant .  why .         nothing .  nothing .      the last word baley heard the commissioner mutter as he strode out of the office  with r .  daneel immediately behind him  was     motive .  motive .      baley ate a sparse meal in the small and infrequently used department lunchroom .  he devoured the stuffed tomato on lettuce without being entirely aware of its nature and for a second or so after he had gulped down the last mouthful his fork still slithered aimlessly over the slick cardboard of his plate  searching automatically for something that was no longer there .   he became aware of that and put down his fork with a muffled     jehoshaphat .      he said     daneel .      r .  daneel had been sitting at another table  as though he wished to leave the obviously preoccupied baley in peace  or as though he required privacy himself .  baley was past caring which .   daneel stood up  moved to baley   s table  and sat down again .     yes  partner elijah .      baley did not look at him .     daneel  i   ll need your co operation .         in what way .         they will question jessie and myself .  that is certain .  let me answer the questions in my own way .  do you understand .         i understand what you say  of course .  nevertheless  if i am asked a direct question  how is it possible for me to say anything but what is so .         if you are asked a direct question  that   s another matter .  i ask only that you don   t volunteer information .  you can do that  can   t you .         i believe so  elijah  provided it does not appear that i am hurting a human being by remaining silent .      baley said  grimly     you will hurt me if you don   t .  i assure you of that .         i do not quite understand your point of view  partner elijah .  surely the matter of r .  sammy cannot concern you .         no .  it all centers about motive  doesn   t it .  you   ve questioned the motive .  the commissioner questioned it .  i do  for that matter .  why should anyone want to kill r .  sammy .  mind you  it   s not just a question of who would want to smash up robots in general .  any earthman  practically  would want to do that .  the question is  who would want to single out r .  sammy .  vincent barrett might  but the commissioner said he couldn   t get hold of an alpha sprayer  and he   s right .  we have to look somewhere else  and it so happens that one other person has a motive .  it glares out .  it yells .  it stinks to top level .         who is the person  elijah .      and baley said  softly     i am  daneel .      r .  daneel   s expressionless face did not change under the impact of the statement .  he merely shook his head .   baley said     you don   t agree .  my wife came to the office today .  they know that already .  the commissioner is even curious .  if i weren   t a personal friend  he wouldn   t have stopped his questioning so soon .  now they   ll find out why .  that   s certain .  she was part of a conspiracy  a foolish and harmless one  but a conspiracy just the same .  and a policeman can   t afford to have his wife mixed up with anything like that .  it would be to my obvious interest to see that the matter was hushed up .      well  who knew about it .  you and i  of course  and jessie  and r .  sammy .  he saw her in a state of panic .  when he told her that we had left orders not to be disturbed  she must have lost control .  you saw the way she was when she first came in .      r .  daneel said     it is unlikely that she said anything incriminating to him .         that may be so .  but i   m reconstructing the case the way they will .  they   ll say she did .  there   s my motive .  i killed him to keep him quiet .         they will not think so .         they will think so .  the murder was arranged deliberately in order to throw suspicion on me .  why use an alpha sprayer .  it   s a rather risky way .  it   s hard to get and it can be traced .  i think that those were the very reasons it was used .  the murderer even ordered r .  sammy to go into the photographic supply room and kill himself there .  it seems obvious to me that the reason for that was to have the method of murder unmistakable .  even if everyone was so infantile as not to recognize the alpha sprayer immediately  someone would be bound to notice fogged photographic film in fairly short order .         how does that all relate to you  elijah .      bailey grinned tightly  his long face completely devoid of humor .     very neatly .  the alpha sprayer was taken from the williamsburg power plant .  you and i passed through the williamsburg power plant yesterday .  we were seen  and the fact will come out .  that gives me opportunity to get the weapon as well as motive for the crime .  and it may turn out that we were the last ones to see or hear r .  sammy alive  except for the real murderer  of course .         i was with you in the power plant and i can testify that you did not have the opportunity to steal an alpha sprayer .         thanks     said baley sadly     but you   re a robot and your testimony will be invalid .         the commissioner is your friend .  he will listen .         the commissioner has a job to keep  and he already is a bit uneasy about me .  there   s only one chance of saving myself from this very nasty situation .         yes .         i ask myself  why am i being framed .  obviously to get rid of me .  but why .  again obviously  because i am dangerous to someone .  i am doing my best to be dangerous to whoever killed dr .  sarton in spacetown .  that might mean the medievalists  of course  or at least  the inner group among them .  it would be this inner group that would know i had passed through the power plant  at least one of them might have followed me along the strips that far  even though you thought we had lost them .      so the chances are that if i find the murderer of dr .  sarton  i find the man or men who are trying to get me out of the way .  if i think it through  if i crack the case  if i can only crack it  i   ll be safe .  and jessie .  i couldn   t stand to have her .    but i don   t have much time .     his fist clenched and unclenched spasmodically .     i don   t have much time .      baley looked at r .  daneel   s chiseled face with a sudden burning hope .  whatever the creature was  he was strong and faithful  animated by no selfishness .  what more could you ask of any friend .  baley needed a friend and he was in no mood to cavil at the fact that a gear replaced a blood vessel in this particular one .   but r .  daneel was shaking his head .   the robot said     i am sorry  elijah     there was no trace of sorrow on his face  of course     but i anticipated none of this .  perhaps my action was to your harm .  i am sorry if the general good requires that .         what general good .     stammered baley .      i have been in communication with dr .  fastolfe .         jehoshaphat .  when .         while you were eating .      baley   s lips tightened .      well .     he managed to say .     what happened .         you will have to clear yourself of suspicion of the murder of r .  sammy through some means other than the investigation of the murder of my designer  dr .  sarton .  our people at spacetown  as a result of my information  have decided to bring that investigation to an end  as of today  and to begin plans for leaving spacetown and earth .          chapter      conclusion of a project   baley looked at his watch with something approaching detachment .  it was       .  in two and a quarter hours it would be midnight .  he had been awake since before six and had been under tension now for two and a half days .  a vague sense of unreality pervaded everything .   he kept his voice painfully steady as he reached for his pipe and for the little bag that held his precious crumbs of tobacco .  he said     what   s it all about  daneel .      r .  daneel said     do you not understand .  is it not obvious .      baley said  patiently     i do not understand .  it is not obvious .         we are here     said the robot     and by we  i mean our people at spacetown  to break the shell surrounding earth and force its people into new expansion and colonization .         i know that .  please don   t labor the point .         i must  since it is the essential one .  if we were anxious to exact punishment for the murder of dr .  sarton  it was not that in doing so we expected to bring dr .  sarton back to life  you understand  it was only that failure to do so would strengthen the position of our home planet politicians who are against the very idea of spacetown .         but now     said baley  with sudden violence     you say you   re getting ready to go home of your own accord .  why .  in heaven   s name  why .  the answer to the sarton case is close .  it must be close or they wouldn   t be trying so hard to blast me out of the investigation .  i have a feeling i have all the facts i need to work out the answer .  it must be in here somewhere .     he knuckled his temple wildly .     a sentence might bring it out .  a word .      he clenched his eyes fiercely shut  as though the quivering opaque jelly of the last sixty hours were indeed on the point of clarifying and becoming transparent .  but it did not .  it did not .   baley drew a shuddering breath and felt ashamed .  he was making a weak spectacle of himself before a cold and unimpressed machine that could only stare at him silently .   he said harshly     well  never mind that .  why are the spacers breaking off .      the robot said     our project is concluded .  we are satisfied that earth will colonize .         you   ve switched to optimism then .     the plain clothes man drew in his first calming puff of tobacco smoke and felt his grip upon his own emotions grow firmer .      i have .  for a long time now  we of spacetown have tried to change earth by changing its economy .  we have tried to introduce our own c fe culture .  your planetary and various city governments co operated with us because it was expedient to do so .  still  in twenty five years  we have failed .  the harder we tried  the stronger the opposing party of the medievalists grew .         i know all this     said baley .  he thought  no use .  he   s got to tell this in his own way  like a field recording .  he yelled silently at r .  daneel  machine .   r .  daneel went on     it was dr .  sarton who first theorized that we must reverse our tactics .  we must first find a segment of earth   s population that desired what we desired or could be persuaded to do so .  by encouraging and helping them  we could make the movement a native one rather than a foreign one .  the difficulty was in finding the native element best suited for our purposes .  you  yourself  elijah  were an interesting experiment .         i .  i .  what do you mean .     demanded baley .      we were glad your commissioner recommended you .  from your psychic profile we judged you to be a useful specimen .  cerebroanalysis  a process i conducted upon you as soon as i met you  confirmed our judgment .  you are a practical man  elijah .  you do not moon romantically over earth   s past  despite your healthy interest in it .  nor do you stubbornly embrace the city culture of earth   s present day .  we felt that people such as yourself were the ones that could lead earthmen to the stars once more .  it was one reason dr .  fastolfe was anxious to see you yesterday morning .      to be sure  your practical nature was embarrassingly intense .  you refused to understand that the fanatical service of an ideal  even a mistaken ideal  could make a man do things quite beyond his ordinary capacity  as  for instance  crossing open country at night to destroy someone he considered an archenemy of his cause .  we were not overly surprised  therefore  that you were stubborn enough and daring enough to attempt to prove the murder a fraud .  in a way  it proved you were the man we wanted for our experiment .         for god   s sake  what experiment .     baley brought his fist down on the table .      the experiment of persuading you that colonization was the answer to earth   s problems .         well  i was persuaded .  i   ll grant you that .         yes  under the influence of the appropriate drug .      baley   s teeth loosened their grip on his pipestem .  he caught the pipe as it fell .  once again  he was seeing that scene in the spacetown dome .  himself swimming back to awareness after the shock of learning that r .  daneel was a robot after all  r .  daneel   s smooth fingers pinching up the flesh of his arm  a hypo shiver standing out darkly under his skin and then fading away .   he said  chokingly     what was in the hypo shiver .         nothing that need alarm you  elijah .  it was a mild drug intended only to make your mind more receptive .         and so i believed whatever was told me .  is that it .         not quite .  you would not believe anything that was foreign to the basic pattern of your thought .  in fact  the results of the experiment were disappointing .  dr .  fastolfe had hoped you would become fanatical and single minded on the subject .  instead you became rather distantly approving  no more .  your practical nature stood in the way of anything further .  it made us realize that our only hope was the romantics after all  and the romantics  unfortunately  were all medievalists  actual or potential .      baley felt incongruously proud of himself  glad of his stubbornness  and happy that he had disappointed them .  let them experiment with someone else .   he grinned savagely .     and so now you   ve given up and are going home .         why  that is not it .  i said a few moments ago that we were satisfied earth would colonize .  it was you that gave us the answer .         i gave it to you .  how .         you spoke to francis clousarr of the advantages of colonization .  you spoke rather fervently  i judge .  at least our experiment on you had that result .  and clousarr   s cerebroanalytic properties changed .  very subtly  to be sure  but they changed .         you mean i convinced him that i was right .  i don   t believe that .         no  conviction does not come that easily .  but the cerebroanalytic changes demonstrated conclusively that the medievalist mind is open to that sort of conviction .  i experimented further myself .  when leaving yeast town  guessing what might have happened between you two from his cerebric changes  i made the proposition of a school for emigrants as a way of insuring his children   s future .  he rejected that  but again his aura changed  and it seemed to me quite obvious that it was the proper method of attack .      r .  daneel paused  then spoke on .      the thing called medievalism shows a craving for pioneering .  to be sure  the direction in which that craving turns itself is toward earth itself  which is near and which has the precedent of a great past .  but the vision of worlds beyond is a similar something and the romantic can turn to it easily  just as clousarr felt the attraction as a result of one lecture from you .      so you see  we of spacetown had already succeeded without knowing it .  we ourselves  rather than anything we tried to introduce  were the unsettling factor .  we crystallized the romantic impulses on earth into medievalism and induced an organization in them .  after all  it is the medievalist who wishes to break the cake of custom  not the city officials who have most to gain from preserving the status quo .  if we leave spacetown now  if we do not irritate the medievalist by our continued presence until he has committed himself to earth  and only earth  past redemption  if we leave behind a few obscure individuals or robots such as myself who  together with sympathetic earthmen such as yourself  can establish the training schools for emigrants that i spoke of  the medievalist will eventually turn away from earth .  he will need robots and will either get them from us or build his own .  he will develop a c fe culture to suit himself .      it was a long speech for r .  daneel .  he must have realized that himself  for  after another pause  he said     i tell you all this to explain why it is necessary to do something that may hurt you .      baley thought bitterly  a robot must not hurt a human being  unless he can think of a way to prove it is for the human being   s ultimate good after all .   baley said     just a minute .  let me introduce a practical note .  you   ll go back to your worlds and say that an earthman killed a spacer and is unpunished .  the outer worlds will demand an indemnity from earth  and i warn you  earth is no longer in a mood to endure such treatment .  there will be trouble .         i am sure that will not happen  elijah .  the elements on our planets that would be most interested in pressing for an indemnity would be also most interested in forcing an end to spacetown .  we can easily offer the latter as an inducement to abandon the former .  it is what we plan to do  anyway .  earth will be left in peace .      and baley broke out  his voice hoarse with sudden despair     and where does that leave me .  the commissioner will drop the sarton investigation at once if spacetown is willing  but the r .  sammy thing will have to continue  since it points to corruption inside the department .  he   ll be in any minute with a ream of evidence against me .  i know that .  it   s been arranged .  i   ll be declassified  daneel .  there   s jessie to consider .  she   ll be smeared as a criminal .  there   s bentley       r .  daneel said     you must not think  elijah  that i do not understand the position in which you find yourself .  in the service of humanity   s good  the minor wrongs must be tolerated .  dr .  sarton has a surviving wife  two children  parents  a sister  many friends .  all must grieve at his death and be saddened at the thought that his murderer has not been found and punished .         then why not stay and find him .         it is no longer necessary .      baley said  bitterly     why not admit that the entire investigation was an excuse to study us under field conditions .  you never gave a damn who killed dr .  sarton .         we would have liked to know     said r .  daneel  coolly     but we were never under any delusions as to which was more important  an individual or humanity .  to continue the investigation now would involve interfering with a situation which we now find satisfactory .  we could not foretell what damage we might do .         you mean the murderer might turn out to be a prominent medievalist and right now the spacers don   t want to do anything to antagonize their new friends .         it is not as i would say it  but there is truth in your words .         where   s your justice circuit  daneel .  is this justice .         there are degrees of justice  elijah .  when the lesser is incompatible with the greater  the lesser must give way .      it was as though baley   s mind were circling the impregnable logic of r .  daneel   s positronic brain  searching for a loophole  a weakness .   he said     have you no personal curiosity  daneel .  you   ve called yourself a detective .  do you know what that implies .  do you understand that an investigation is more than a job of work .  it is a challenge .  your mind is pitted against that of the criminal .  it is a clash of intellect .  can you abandon the battle and admit defeat .         if no worthy end is served by a continuation  certainly .         would you feel no loss .  no wonder .  would there be no little speck of dissatisfaction .  frustrated curiosity .      baley   s hopes  not strong in the first place  weakened as he spoke .  the word    curiosity     second time repeated  brought back his own remarks to francis clousarr four hours before .  he had known well enough then the qualities that marked off a man from a machine .  curiosity had to be one of them .  a six week old kitten was curious  but how could there be a curious machine  be it ever so humanoid .   r .  daneel echoed those thoughts by saying     what do you mean by curiosity .      baley put the best face on it .     curiosity is the name we give to a desire to extend one   s knowledge .         such a desire exists within me  when the extension of knowledge is necessary for the performance of an assigned task .         yes     said baley  sarcastically     as when you ask questions about bentley   s contact lenses in order to learn more of earth   s peculiar customs .         precisely     said r .  daneel  with no sign of any awareness of sarcasm .     aimless extension of knowledge  however  which is what i think you really mean by the term curiosity  is merely inefficiency .  i am designed to avoid inefficiency .      it was in that way that the    sentence    he had been waiting for came to elijah baley  and the opaque jelly shuddered and settled and changed into luminous transparency .   while r .  daneel spoke  baley   s mouth opened and stayed so .   it could not all have burst full grown into his mind .  things did not work so .  somewhere  deep inside his unconscious  he had built a case  built it carefully and in detail  but had been brought up short by a single inconsistency .  one inconsistency that could be neither jumped over  burrowed under  nor shunted aside .  while that inconsistency existed  the case remained buried below his thoughts  beyond the reach of his conscious probing .   but the sentence had come  the inconsistency had vanished  the case was his .   the glare of mental light appeared to have stimulated baley mightily .  at least he suddenly knew what r .  daneel   s weakness must be  the weakness of any thinking machine .  he thought feverishly  hopefully  the thing must be literal minded .   he said     then project spacetown is concluded as of today and with it the sarton investigation .  is that it .         that is the decision of our people at spacetown     agreed r .  daneel  calmly .      but today is not yet over .     baley looked at his watch .  it was       .     there is an hour and a half until midnight .      r .  daneel said nothing .  he seemed to consider .   baley spoke rapidly .     until midnight  the project continues then .  you are my partner and the investigation continues .     he was becoming almost telegraphic in his haste .     let us go on as before .  let me work .  it will do your people no harm .  it will do them great good .  my word upon it .  if  in your judgment  i am doing harm  stop me .  it is only an hour and a half i ask .      r .  daneel said     what you say is correct .  today is not over .  i had not thought of that  partner elijah .      baley was    partner elijah    again .   he grinned  and said     didn   t dr .  fastolfe mention a film of the scene of the murder when i was in spacetown .         he did     said r .  daneel .   baley said     can you get a copy of the film .         yes  partner elijah .         i mean now .  instantly .         in ten minutes  if i can use the department transmitter .      the process took less time than that .  baley stared at the small aluminum block he held in his trembling hands .  within it the subtle forces transmitted from spacetown had strongly fixed a certain atomic pattern .   and at that moment  commissioner julius enderby stood in the doorway .  he saw baley and a certain anxiety passed from his round face  leaving behind it a look of growing thunder .   he said  uncertainly     look here  lije  you   re taking a devil of a time  eating .         i was bone tired  commissioner .  sorry if i   ve delayed you .         i wouldn   t mind  but  .  .  .  you   d better come to my office .     baley   s eyes flicked toward r .  daneel  but met no answering look .  together they moved out of the lunchroom .   julius enderby tramped the floor before his desk  up and down  up and down .  baley watched him  himself far from composed .  occasionally  he glanced at his watch .         .   the commissioner moved his glasses up onto his forehead and rubbed his eyes with thumb and forefinger .  he left red splotches in the flesh around them  then restored the glasses to their place  blinking at baley from behind them .      lije     he said suddenly     when were you last in the williamsburg power plant .      baley said     yesterday  after i left the office .  i should judge at about eighteen or shortly thereafter .      the commissioner shook his head .     why didn   t you say so .         i was going to .  i haven   t given an official statement yet .         what were you doing there .         just passing through on my way to our temporary sleeping quarters .      the commissioner stopped short  standing before baley  and said     that   s no good  lije .  no one just passes through a power plant to get somewhere else .      baley shrugged .  there was no point in going through the story of the pursuing medievalists  of the dash along the strips .  not now .   he said     if you   re trying to hint that i had an opportunity to get the alpha sprayer that knocked out r .  sammy  i   ll remind you that daneel was with me and will testify that i went right through the plant without stopping and that i had no alpha sprayer on me when i left .      slowly  the commissioner sat down .  he did not look in r .  daneel   s direction or offer to speak to him .  he put his pudgy white hands on the desk before him and regarded them with a look of acute misery on his face .   he said     lije  i don   t know what to say or what to think .  and it   s no use having your  your partner as alibi .  he can   t give evidence .         i still deny that i took an alpha sprayer .      the commissioner   s fingers intertwined and writhed .  he said     lije  why did jessie come to see you here this afternoon .         you asked me that before  commissioner .  same answer .  family matters .         i   ve got information from francis clousarr  lije .         what kind of information .         he claims that a jezebel baley is a member of a medievalist society dedicated to the overthrow of the government by force .         are you sure he has the right person .  there are many baleys .         there aren   t many jezebel baleys .         he used her name  did he .         he said jezebel .  i heard him  lije .  i   m not giving you a second hand report .         all right .  jessie was a member of a harmless lunatic fringe organization .  she never did anything but attend meetings and feel devilish about it .         it won   t look that way to a board of review  lije .         you mean i   m going to be suspended and held on suspicion of destroying government property in the form of r .  sammy .         i hope not  lije  but it looks awfully bad .  everyone knows you didn   t like r .  sammy .  your wife was seen talking to him this afternoon .  she was in tears and some of her words were heard .  they were harmless in themselves  but two and two can be added up  lije .  you might feel it was dangerous to leave him in a position to talk .  and you had an opportunity to obtain the weapon .      baley interrupted .     if i were wiping out all evidence against jessie  would i bring in francis clousarr .  he seems to know a lot more about her than r .  sammy could have .  another thing .  i passed through the power plant eighteen hours before r .  sammy spoke to jessie .  did i know that long in advance that i would have to destroy him and pick up an alpha sprayer out of clairvoyance .      the commissioner said     those are good points .  i   ll do my best .  i   m sorry about this  lije .         yes .  do you really believe i didn   t do it  commissioner .      enderby said slowly     i don   t know what to think  lije .  i   ll be frank with you .         then i   ll tell you what to think .  commissioner  this is all a careful and elaborate frame .      the commissioner stiffened .     now  wait  lije .  don   t strike out blindly .  you won   t get any sympathy with that line of defense .  it   s been used by too many bad eggs .         i   m not after sympathy .  i   m just telling the truth .  i   m being taken out of circulation to prevent me from learning the facts about the sarton murder .  unfortunately for my framing pal  it   s too late for that .         what .      baley looked at his watch .  it was       .   he said     i know who is framing me  and i know how dr .  sarton was killed and by whom  and i have one hour to tell you about it  catch the man  and end the investigation .          chapter      end of an investigation   commissioner enderby   s eyes narrowed and he glared at baley .     what are you going to do .  you tried something like this in fastolfe   s dome yesterday morning .  not again .  please .      baley nodded .     i know .  i was wrong the first time .      he thought  fiercely  also the second time .  but not now  not this time  not  .  .  .      the thought faded out  spluttering like a micropile under a positronic damper .   he said     judge for yourself  commissioner .  grant that the evidence against me has been planted .  go that far with me and see where it takes you .  ask yourself who could have planted that evidence .  obviously only someone who   d known i was in the williamsburg plant yesterday evening .         all right .  who would that be .      baley said     i was followed out of the kitchen by a medievalist group .  i lost them  or i thought i did  but obviously at least one of them saw me pass through the plant .  my only purpose in doing so  you understand  was to help me lose them .      the commissioner considered .     clousarr .  was he with them .      baley nodded .   enderby said     all right  we   ll question him .  if he   s got anything in him  we   ll have it out of him .  what more can i do  lije .         wait  now .  don   t quit on me .  do you see my point .         well  let   s see if i do .     the commissioner clasped his hands .     clousarr saw you go into the williamsburg power plant  or else someone in his group did and passed the information along to him .  he decided to utilize that fact to get you into trouble and off the investigation .  is that what you   re saying .         it   s close to it .         good .     the commissioner seemed to warm to the task .     he knew your wife was a member of his organization  naturally  and so he knew you wouldn   t face a really close probe into your private life .  he thought you would resign rather than fight circumstantial evidence .  by the way  lije  what about a resignation .  i mean  if things looked really bad .  we could keep things quiet          not in a million years  commissioner .      enderby shrugged .     well  where was i .  oh  yes  so he got an alpha sprayer  presumably through a confederate in the plant  and had another confederate arrange the destruction of r .  sammy .     his fingers drummed lightly on the desk .     no good  lije .         why not .         too farfetched .  too many confederates .  and he has a cast iron alibi for the night and morning of the spacetown murder  by the way .  we checked that almost right away  though i was the only one who knew the reason for checking that particular time .      baley said     i never said it was clousarr  commissioner .  you did .  it could be anyone in the medievalist organization .  clousarr is just the owner of a face that daneel happened to recognize .  i don   t even think he   s particularly important in the organization .  though there is one queer thing about him .         what .     asked enderby  suspiciously .      he did know jessie was a member .  does he know every member in the organization  do you suppose .         i don   t know .  he knew about jessie  anyway .  maybe she was important because she was the wife of a policeman .  maybe he remembered her for that reason .         you say he came right out and said that jezebel baley was a member .  just like that .  jezebel baley .      enderby nodded .     i keep telling you i heard him .         that   s the funny thing  commissioner .  jessie hasn   t used her full first name since before bentley was born .  not once .  i know that for certain .  she joined the medievalists after she dropped her full name .  i know that for sure  too .  how would clousarr come to know her as jezebel  then .      the commissioner flushed and said  hastily     oh well  if it comes to that  he probably said jessie .  i just filled it in automatically and gave her full name .  in fact  i   m sure of that .  he said jessie .         until now you were quite sure he said jezebel .  i asked several times .      the commissioner   s voice rose .     you   re not saying i   m a liar  are you .         i   m just wondering if clousarr  perhaps  said nothing at all .  i   m wondering if you made that up .  you   ve known jessie for twenty years  and you knew her name was jezebel .         you   re off your head  man .         am i .  where were you after lunch today .  you were out of your office for two hours at least .         are you questioning me .         i   ll answer for you  too .  you were in the williamsburg power plant .      the commissioner rose from his seat .  his forehead glistened and there were dry  white flecks at the corners of his lips .     what the hell are you trying to say .         weren   t you .         baley  you   re suspended .  hand me your credentials .         not yet .  hear me out .         i don   t intend to .  you   re guilty .  you   re guilty as the devil  and what gets me is your cheap attempt to make me  me  look as though i were conspiring against you .     he lost his voice momentarily in a squeak of indignation .  he managed to gasp out     in fact  you   re under arrest .         no     said baley  tightly     not yet .  commissioner  i   ve got a blaster on you .  it   s pointed straight and it   s cocked .  don   t fool with me  please  because i   m desperate and i will have my say .  afterward  you can do what you please .      with widening eyes  julius enderby stared at the wicked muzzle in baley   s hands .   he stammered     twenty years for this  baley  in the deepest prison level in the city .      r .  daneel moved suddenly .  his hand clamped down on baley   s wrist .  he said  quietly     i cannot permit this  partner elijah .  you must do no harm to the commissioner .      for the first time since r .  daneel had entered the city  the commissioner spoke directly to him .     hold him  you .  first law .      baley said quickly     i have no intention of hurting him  daneel  if you will keep him from arresting me .  you said you would help me clear this up .  i have forty five minutes .      r .  daneel  without releasing baley   s wrist  said     commissioner  i believe elijah should be allowed to speak .  i am in communication with dr .  fastolfe at this moment          how .  how .     demanded the commissioner  wildly .      i possess a self contained subethenic unit     said r .  daneel .  the commissioner stared .      i am in communication with dr .  fastolfe     the robot went on inexorably     and it would make a bad impression  commissioner  if you were to refuse to listen to elijah .  damaging inferences might be drawn .      the commissioner fell back in his chair  quite speechless .  baley said     i say you were in the williamsburg power plant today  commissioner  and you got the alpha sprayer and gave it to r .  sammy .  you deliberately chose the williamsburg power plant in order to incriminate me .  you even seized dr .  gerrigel   s reappearance to invite him down to the department and give him a deliberately maladjusted guide rod to lead him to the photographic supply room and allow him to find r .  sammy   s remains .  you counted on him to make a correct diagnosis .      baley put away his blaster .     if you want to have me arrested now  go ahead  but spacetown won   t take that for an answer .         motive     spluttered enderby breathlessly .  his glasses were fogged and he removed them  looking once again curiously vague and helpless in their absence .     what motive could i have for this .         you got me into trouble  didn   t you .  it will put a spoke in the sarton investigation  won   t it .  and all that aside  r .  sammy knew too much .         about what  in heaven   s name .         about the way in which a spacer was murdered five and a half days ago .  you see  commissioner  you murdered dr .  sarton of spacetown .      it was r .  daneel who spoke .  enderby could only clutch feverishly at his hair and shake his head .   the robot said     partner elijah  i am afraid that this theory is quite untenable .  as you know  it is impossible for commissioner enderby to have murdered dr .  sarton .         listen  then .  listen to me .  enderby begged me to take the case  not any of the men who over ranked me .  he did that for several reasons .  in the first place  we were college friends and he thought he could count on its never occurring to me that an old buddy and respected superior could be a criminal .  he counted on my well known loyalty  you see .  secondly  he knew jessie was a member of an underground organization and expected to be able to maneuver me out of the investigation or blackmail me into silence if i got too close to the truth .  and he wasn   t really worried about that .  at the very beginning he did his best to arouse my distrust of you  daneel  and make certain that the two of us worked at cross purposes .  he knew about my father   s declassification .  he could guess how i would react .  you see  it is an advantage for the murderer to be in charge of the murder investigation .      the commissioner found his voice .  he said  weakly     how could i know about jessie .     he turned to the robot .     you .  if you   re transmitting this to spacetown  tell them it   s a lie .  it   s all a lie .      baley broke in  raising his voice for a moment and then lowering it into a queer sort of tense calm .     certainly you would know about jessie .  you   re a medievalist  and part of the organization .  your old fashioned spectacles .  your windows .  it   s obvious your temperament is turned that way .  but there   s better evidence than that .      how did jessie find out daneel was a robot .  it puzzled me at the time .  of course we know now that she found out through her medievalist organization  but that just shoves the problem one step backward .  how did they know .  you  commissioner  dismissed it with a theory that daneel was recognized as a robot during the incident at the shoe counter .  i didn   t quite believe that .  i couldn   t .  i took him for human when i first saw him  and there   s nothing wrong with my eyes .      yesterday  i asked dr .  gerrigel to come in from washington .  later i decided i needed him for several reasons  but  at the time i first called him  my only purpose was to see if he would recognize daneel for what he was with no prompting on my part .      commissioner  he didn   t .  i introduced him to daneel  he shook hands with him  we all talked together  and it was only after the subject got around to humanoid robots that he suddenly caught on .  now  that was dr .  gerrigel  earth   s greatest expert on robots .  do you mean to say a few medievalist rioters could do better than he under conditions of confusion and tension  and be so certain about it that they would throw their entire organization into activity based on the feeling that daneel was a robot .      it   s obvious now that the medievalists must have known daneel to be a robot to begin with .  the incident at the shoe counter was deliberately designed to show daneel and  through him  spacetown  the extent of anti robot feeling in the city .  it was meant to confuse the issue  to turn suspicion away from individuals and toward the population as a whole .      now  if they knew the truth about daneel to begin with  who told them .  i didn   t .  i once thought it was daneel himself  but that   s out .  the only other earthman who knew about it was you  commissioner .      enderby said  with surprising energy     there could be spies in the department  too .  the medievalists could have us riddled with them .  your wife was one  and if you don   t find it impossible that i should be one  why not others in the department .      the corners of baley   s lips pulled back a savage trifle .     let   s not bring up mysterious spies until we see where the straightforward solution leads us .  i say you   re the obvious informer and the real one .      it   s interesting now that i look back on it  commissioner  to see how your spirits rose and fell accordingly as i seemed to be far from a solution or possibly close to it .  you were nervous to begin with .  when i wanted to visit spacetown yesterday morning and wouldn   t tell you the reason  you were practically in a state of collapse .  did you think i had you pinned  commissioner .  that it was a trap to get you into their hands .  you hated them  you told me .  you were virtually in tears .  for a time  i thought that to be caused by the memory of humiliation in spacetown when you yourself were a suspect  but then daneel told me that your sensibilities had been carefully regarded .  you had never known you were a suspect .  your panic was due to fear  not humiliation .      then when i came out with my completely wrong solution  while you listened over trimensional circuit  and you saw how far  how immensely far  from the truth i was  you were confident again .  you even argued with me  defended the spacers .  after that  you were quite master of yourself for a while  quite confident .  it surprised me at the time that you so easily forgave my false accusations against the spacers when earlier you had so lectured me on their sensitivity .  you enjoyed my mistake .      then i put in my call for dr .  gerrigel and you wanted to know why and i wouldn   t tell you .  that plunged you into the abyss again because you feared       r .  daneel suddenly raised his hand .     partner elijah .      baley looked at his watch .        .  he said     what is it .      r .  daneel said     he might have been disturbed at thinking you would find out his medievalist connections  if we grant their existence .  there is nothing  though  to connect him with the murder .  he cannot have had anything to do with that .      baley said     you   re quite wrong  daneel .  he didn   t know what i wanted dr .  gerrigel for  but it was quite safe to assume that it was in connection with information about robots .  this frightened the commissioner  because a robot had an intimate connection with his greater crime .  isn   t that so  commissioner .      enderby shook his head .     when this is over      he began  but choked into inarticulacy .      how was the murder committed .     demanded baley with a suppressed fury .     c fe  damn it .  c fe .  i use your own term  daneel .  you   re so full of the benefits of a c fe culture  yet you don   t see where an earthman might have used it for at least a temporary advantage .  let me sketch it in for you .      there is no difficulty in the notion of a robot crossing open country .  even at night .  even alone .  the commissioner put a blaster into r .  sammy   s hand  told him where to go and when .  he himself entered spacetown through the personal and was relieved of his own blaster .  he received the other from r .  sammy   s hands  killed dr .  sarton  returned the blaster to r .  sammy  who took it back across the fields to new york city .  and today he destroyed r .  sammy  whose knowledge had become dangerous .      that explains everything .  the presence of the commissioner  the absence of a weapon .  and it makes it unnecessary to suppose any human new yorker had crawled a mile under the open sky at night .      but at the end of baley   s recitation  r .  daneel said     i am sorry  partner elijah  though happy for the commissioner  that your story explains nothing .  i have told you that the cerebroanalytic properties of the commissioner are such that it is impossible for him to have committed deliberate murder .  i don   t know what english word would be applied to the psychological fact  cowardice  conscience  or compassion .  i know the dictionary meanings of all these  but i cannot judge .  at any rate  the commissioner did not murder .         thank you     muttered enderby .  his voice gained strength and confidence .     i don   t know what your motives are  baley  or why you should try to ruin me this way  but i   ll get to the bottom          wait     said baley .     i   m not through .  i   ve got this .      he slammed the aluminum cube on enderby   s desk  and tried to feel the confidence he hoped he was radiating .  for half an hour now  he had been hiding from himself one little fact  that he did not know what the picture showed .  he was gambling  but it was all that was left to do .   enderby shrank away from the small object .     what is it .         it isn   t a bomb     said baley  sardonically .     just an ordinary microprojector .         well .  what will that prove .         suppose we see .     his fingernail probed at one of the slits in the cube  and a corner of the commissioner   s office blanked out  then lit up in an alien scene in three dimensions .   it reached from floor to ceiling and extended out past the walls of the room .  it was awash with a gray light of a sort the city   s utilities never provided .   baley thought  with a pang of mingled distaste and perverse attraction  it must be the dawn they talk about .   the pictured scene was of dr .  sarton   s dome .  dr .  sarton   s dead body  a horrible  broken remnant  filled its center .   enderby   s eyes bulged as he stared .   baley said     i know the commissioner isn   t a killer .  i don   t need you to tell me that  daneel .  if i could have gotten around that one fact earlier  i would have had the solution earlier .  actually  i didn   t see a way out of it until an hour ago when i carelessly said to you that you had once been curious about bentley   s contact lenses .   that was it  commissioner .  it occurred to me then that your nearsightedness and your glasses were the key .  they don   t have nearsightedness on the outer worlds  i suppose  or they might have reached the true solution of the murder almost at once .  commissioner  when did you break your glasses .      the commissioner said     what do you mean .      baley said     when i first saw you about this case  you told me you had broken your glasses in spacetown .  i assumed that you broke them in your agitation on hearing the news of the murder  but you never said so  and i had no reason for making that assumption .  actually  if you were entering spacetown with crime on your mind  you were already sufficiently agitated to drop and break your glasses before the murder .  isn   t that so  and didn   t that  in fact  happen .      r .  daneel said     i do not see the point  partner elijah .      baley thought  i   m partner elijah for ten minutes more .  fast .  talk fast .  and think fast .   he was manipulating sarton   s dome image as he spoke .  clumsily  he expanded it  his fingernails unsure in the tension that was overwhelming him .  slowly  in jerks  the corpse widened  broadened  heightened  came closer .  baley could almost smell the stench of its scorched flesh .  its head  shoulders  and one upper arm lolled crazily  connected to hips and legs by a blackened remnant of spine from which charred rib stumps jutted .   baley cast a side glance at the commissioner .  enderby had closed his eyes .  he looked sick .  baley felt sick  too  but he had to look .  slowly he circled the trimensional image by means of the transmitter controls  rotating it  bringing the ground about the corpse to view in successive quadrants .  his fingernail slipped and the imaged floor tilted suddenly and expanded till floor and corpse alike were a hazy mass  beyond the resolving power of the transmitter .  he brought the expansion down  let the corpse slide away .   he was still talking .  he had to .  he couldn   t stop till he found what he was looking for .  and if he didn   t  all his talk might be useless .  worse than useless .  his heart was throbbing  and so was his head .   he said     the commissioner can   t commit deliberate murder .  true .  deliberate .  but any man can kill by accident .  the commissioner didn   t enter spacetown to kill dr .  sarton .  he came in to kill you  daneel  you .  is there anything in his cerebroanalysis that says he is incapable of wrecking a machine .  that   s not murder  merely sabotage .      he is a medievalist  an earnest one .  he worked with dr .  sarton and knew the purpose for which you were designed  daneel .  he feared that purpose might be achieved  that earthmen would eventually be weaned away from earth .  so he decided to destroy you  daneel .  you were the only one of your type manufactured as yet and he had good reason to think that by demonstrating the extent and determination of medievalism on earth  he would discourage the spacers .  he knew how strong popular opinion was on the outer worlds to end the spacetown project altogether .  dr .  sarton must have discussed that with him .  this  he thought  would be the last nudge in the proper direction .      i don   t say even the thought of killing you  daneel  was a pleasant one .  he would have had r .  sammy do it  i imagine  if you didn   t look so human that a primitive robot such as sammy could not have told the difference  or understood it .  first law would stop him .  or the commissioner would have had another human do it if he  himself  were not the only one who had ready access to spacetown at all times .      let me reconstruct what the commissioner   s plan might have been .  i   m guessing  i admit  but i think i   m close .  he made the appointment with dr .  sarton  but deliberately came early  at dawn  in fact .  dr .  sarton would be sleeping  i imagine  but you  daneel  would be awake .  i assume  by the way  you were living with dr .  sarton  daneel .      the robot nodded .     you are quite right  partner elijah .      baley said     then let me go on .  you would come to the dome door  daneel  receive a blaster charge in the chest or head  and be done with .  the commissioner would leave quickly  through the deserted streets of spacetown   s dawn  and back to where r .  sammy waited .  he would give him back the blaster  then slowly walk again to dr .  sarton   s dome .  if necessary  he would    discover    the body himself  though he would prefer to have someone else do that .  if questioned concerning his early arrival  he could say  i suppose  that he had come to tell dr .  sarton of rumors of a medievalist attack on spacetown  urge him to take secret precautions to avoid open trouble between spacers and earthmen .  the dead robot would lend point to his words .      if they asked about the long interval between your entering spacetown  commissioner  and your arrival at dr .  sarton   s dome  you could say  let   s see  that you saw someone lurking through the streets and heading for open country .  you pursued for a while .  that would also encourage them along a false path .  as for r .  sammy  no one would notice him .  a robot among the truck farms outside the city is just another robot .      how close am i  commissioner .      enderby writhed     i didn   t          no     said baley     you didn   t kill daneel .  he   s here  and in all the time he   s been in the city  you haven   t been able to look him in the face or address him by name .  look at him now  commissioner .      enderby couldn   t .  he covered his face with shaking hands .   baley   s shaking hands almost dropped his transmitter .  he had found it .   the image was now centered upon the main door to dr .  sarton   s dome .  the door was open  it had been slid into its wall receptacle along its shining metal runner grooves .  down within them .  there .  there .   the sparkle was unmistakable .      i   ll tell you what happened     said baley .     you were at the dome when you dropped your glasses .  you must have been nervous and i   ve seen you when you   re nervous .  you take them off  you wipe them .  you did that then .  but your hands were shaking and you dropped them  maybe you stepped on them .  anyway  they were broken  and just then  the door opened and a figure that looked like daneel faced you .      you blasted him  scrabbled up the remains of your glasses  and ran .  they found the body  not you  and when they came to find you  you discovered that it was not daneel  but the early rising dr .  sarton  that you had killed .  dr .  sarton had designed daneel in his own image  to his great misfortune  and without your glasses in that moment of tension  you could not tell them apart .      and if you want the tangible proof  it   s there .     the image of sarton   s dome quivered and baley put the transmitter carefully upon the desk  his hand tightly upon it .   commissioner enderby   s face was distorted with terror and baley   s with tension .  r .  daneel seemed indifferent .   baley   s finger was pointing .     that glitter in the grooves of the door .  what was it  daneel .         two small slivers of glass     said the robot  coolly .     it meant nothing to us .         it will now .  they   re portions of concave lenses .  measure their optical properties and compare them with those of the glasses enderby is wearing now .  don   t smash them  commissioner .      he lunged at the commissioner and wrenched the spectacles from the other   s hand .  he held them out to r .  daneel  panting     that   s proof enough  i think  that he was at the dome earlier than he was thought to be .      r .  daneel said     i am quite convinced .  i can see now that i was thrown completely off the scent by the commissioner   s cerebroanalysis .  i congratulate you  partner elijah .      baley   s watch said       .  a new day was beginning .   slowly  the commissioner   s head went down on his arms .  his words were muffled wails .     it was a mistake .  a mistake .  i never meant to kill him .     without warning  he slipped from the chair and lay crumpled on the floor .   r .  daneel sprang to him  saying     you have hurt him  elijah .  that is too bad .         he isn   t dead  is he .         no .  but unconscious .         he   ll come to .  it was too much for him  i suppose .  i had to do it  daneel  i had to .  i had no evidence that would stand up in court  only inferences .  i had to badger him and badger him and let it out little by little  hoping he would break down .  he did  daneel .  you heard him confess  didn   t you .         yes .         now  then  i promised this would be to the benefit of spacetown   s project  so  wait  he   s coming to .      the commissioner groaned .  his eyes fluttered and opened .  he stared speechlessly at the two .   baley said     commissioner  do you hear me .      the commissioner nodded listlessly .      all right  then .  now  the spacers have more on their minds than your prosecution .  if you co operate with them          what .  what .     there was a dawning flicker of hope in the commissioner   s eyes .      you must be a big wheel in new york   s medievalist organization  maybe even in the planetary setup .  maneuver them in the direction of the colonization of space .  you can see the propaganda line  can   t you .  we can go back to the soil all right  but on other planets .         i don   t understand     mumbled the commissioner .      it   s what the spacers are after .  and god help me  it   s what i   m after now  too  since a small conversation i had with dr .  fastolfe .  it   s what they want more than anything .  they risk death continually by coming to earth and staying here for that purpose .  if dr .  sarton   s murder will make it possible for you to swing medievalism into line for the resumption of galactic colonization  they   ll probably consider it a worthwhile sacrifice .  do you understand now .      r .  daneel said     elijah is quite correct .  help us  commissioner  and we will forget the past .  i am speaking for dr .  fastolfe and our people generally in this .  of course  if you should agree to help and later betray us  we would always have the fact of your guilt to hold over your head .  i hope you understand that  too .  it pains me to have to mention that .         i won   t be prosecuted .     asked the commissioner .      not if you help us .      tears filled his eyes .     i   ll do it .  it was an accident .  explain that .  an accident .  i did what i thought right .      baley said     if you help us  you will be doing right .  the colonization of space is the only possible salvation of earth .  you   ll realize that if you think about it without prejudice .  if you find you cannot  have a short talk with dr .  fastolfe .  and now  you can begin helping by quashing the r .  sammy business .  call it an accident or something .  end it .      baley got to his feet .     and remember  i   m not the only one who knows the truth  commissioner .  getting rid of me will ruin you .  all spacetown knows .  you see that  don   t you .      r .  daneel said     it is unnecessary to say more  elijah .  he is sincere and he will help .  so much is obvious from his cerebroanalysis .         all right .  then i   ll go home .  i want to see jessie and bentley and take up a natural existence again .  and i want to sleep .    daneel  will you stay on earth after the spacers go .      r .  daneel said     i have not been informed .  why do you ask .      baley bit his lip  then said     i didn   t think i would ever say anything like this to anyone like you  daneel  but i trust you .  i even  admire you .  i   m too old ever to leave earth myself  but when schools for emigrants are finally established  there   s bentley .  if someday  perhaps  bentley and you  together  .  .  .         perhaps .     r .  daneel   s face was emotionless .   the robot turned to julius enderby  who was watching them with a flaccid face into which a certain vitality was only now beginning to return .   the robot said     i have been trying  friend julius  to understand some remarks elijah made to me earlier .  perhaps i am beginning to  for it suddenly seems to me that the destruction of what should not be  that is  the destruction of what you people call evil  is less just and desirable than the conversion of this evil into what you call good .      he hesitated  then  almost as though he were surprised at his own words  he said     go  and sin no more .      baley  suddenly smiling  took r .  daneel   s elbow  and they walked out the door  arm in arm .       the end .
