fellows  every one .       in the early asimov i mentioned the fact that there were eleven stories that i had never succeeded in selling .  what   s more  said i in that book  all eleven stories no longer existed and must remain forever in limbo .   however  boston university collects all my papers with an assiduity and determination worthy of a far better cause  and when they first began to do so back in       i handed them piles and piles of manuscript material i didn   t look through .   some eager young fan did  though .  boston university apparently allows the inspection of its literary collections for research purposes  and this young fan  representing himself as a literary historian  i suppose  got access to my files .  he came across the faded manuscript of big game  a thousand word short short which i had listed in the early asimov as the eleventh and last of my lost rejections .   having read the early asimov  the fan recognized the value of the find .  he promptly had it reproduced and sent me a copy .  and i promptly saw to it that it got into print .  it appeared in before the golden age .   when i read the manuscript of big game  however  i discovered that  in a way  it bad never been lost .  i had salvaged it .  back in early       robert w .  lowndes  then publishing several science fiction magazines for columbia publications  and reveling in the science fiction boom of the period  asked me for a story .  i must have remembered big game  written eight years earlier  for i produced day of the hunters  which was an expanded version of the earlier story  and had published it in the november      issue of future combined with science fiction stories .       day of the hunters     it began the same night it ended .  it wasn   t much .  it just bothered me  it still bothers me .   you see  joe bloch  ray manning  and i were squatting around our favorite table in the corner bar with an evening on our hands and a mess of chatter to throw it away with .  that   s the beginning .   joe bloch started it by talking about the atomic bomb  and what he thought ought to be done with it  and how who would have thought it five years ago .  and i said lots of guys thought it five years ago and wrote stories about it and it was going to be tough on them trying to keep ahead of the newspapers now .  which led to a general palaver on how lots of screwy things might come true and a lot of for instances were thrown about .   ray said he heard from somebody that some big shot scientist had sent a block of lead back in time for about two seconds or two minutes or two thousandths of a second     he didn   t know which .  he said the scientist wasn   t saying anything to anybody because he didn   t think anyone would believe him .   so i asked  pretty sarcastic  how he came to know about it .      ray may have lots of friends but i have the same lot and none of them know any big shot scientists .  but he said never mind how he heard  take it or leave it .   and then there wasn   t anything to do but talk about time machines  and how supposing you went back and killed your own grandfather or why didn   t somebody from the future come back and tell us who was going to win the next war  or if there was going to be a next war  or if there   d be anywhere on earth you could live after it  regardless of who wins .   ray thought just knowing the winner in the seventh race while the sixth was being run would he something .   but joe decided different .  he said     the trouble with you guys is you got wars and races on the mind .  me  i got curiosity .  know what i   d do if i had a time machine .      so right away we wanted to know  all ready to give him the old snicker whatever it was .   he said     if i had one  i   d go back in time about a couple or five or fifty million years and find out what happened to the dinosaurs .      which was too bad for joe  because ray and i both thought there was just about no sense to that at all .  ray said who cared about a lot of dinosaurs and i said the only thing they were good for was to make a mess of skeletons for guys who were dopy enough to wear out the floors in museums  and it was a good thing they did get out of the way to make room for human beings .  of course joe said that with some human beings he knew  and he gives us a hard look  we should   ve stuck to dinosaurs  but we pay no attention to that .      you dumb squirts can laugh and make like you know something  but that   s because you don   t ever have any imagination     he says .     those dinosaurs were big stuff .  millions of all kinds     big as houses  and dumb as houses  too     all over the place .  and then  all of a sudden  like that     and he snaps his fingers     there aren   t any anymore .      how come  we wanted to know .   but he was just finishing a beer and waving at charlie for another with a coin to prove he wanted to pay for it and he just shrugged his shoulders .     i don   t know .  that   s what i   d find out  though .      that   s all .  that would have finished it .  i would   ve said something and ray would   ve made a crack  and we all would   ve had another beer and maybe swapped some talk about the weather and the brooklyn dodgers and then said so long  and never think of dinosaurs again .   only we didn   t  and now i never have anything on my mind but dinosaurs  and i feel sick .   because the rummy at the next table looks up and hollers     hey .        we hadn   t seen him .  as a general rule  we don   t go around looking at rummies we don   t know in bars .  i got plenty to do keeping track of the rummies i do know .  this fellow had a bottle before him that was half empty  and a glass in his hand that was half full .   he said     hey     and we all looked at him  and ray said     ask him what he wants  joe .      joe was nearest .  he tipped his chair backward and said     what do you want .      the rummy said     did i hear you gentlemen mention dinosaurs .      he was just a little weavy  and his eyes looked like they were bleeding  and you could only tell his shirt was once white by guessing  but it must   ve been the way he talked .  it didn   t sound rummy  if you know what i mean .   anyway  joe sort of eased up and said     sure .  something you want to know .      he sort of smiled at us .  it was a funny smile  it started at the mouth and ended just before it touched the eyes .  he said     did you want to build a time machine and go back to find out what happened to the dinosaurs .      i could see joe was figuring that some kind of confidence game was coming up .  i was figuring the same thing .  joe said     why .  you aiming to offer to build one for me .      the rummy showed a mess of teeth and said .     no  sir .  i could but i won   t .  you know why .  because i built a time machine for myself a couple of years ago and went back to the mesozoic era and found out what happened to the dinosaurs .      later on  i looked up how to spell    mesozoic     which is why i got it right .  in case you   re wondering  and i found nut that the mesozoic era is when a   the dinosaurs were doing whatever dinosaurs do .  rut of course at the time this is just so much double talk to me  and mostly i was thinking we had a lunatic talking to us .  joe claimed afterward that he knew about this mesozoic thing  but he   ll have to talk lots longer and louder before ray and i believe him .   but that did it just the same .  we said to the rummy to come over to our table .  i guess i figured we could listen to him for a while and maybe get some of the bottle  and the others must have figured the same .  but he held his bottle tight in his right hand when he sat down and that   s where he kept it .  it .   sic   ray said     where   d you build a time machine .         at midwestern university .  my daughter and i worked on it together .      he sounded like a college guy at that .   i said     where is it now .  in your pocket .      he didn   t blink  he never jumped at us no matter how wise we cracked .  just kept talking to himself out loud  as if the whiskey had limbered up his tongue and he didn   t care if we stayed or not .   he said     i broke it up .  didn   t want it .  had enough of it .      we didn   t believe him .  we didn   t believe him worth a darn .  you better get that straight .  it stands to reason  because if a guy invented a time machine  he could clean up millions     he could clean up all the money in the world  just knowing what would happen to the stock market and the races and elections .  he wouldn   t throw a   that away  i don   t care what reasons he had .      besides  none of us were going to believe in time travel anyway  because what if you did kill your own grandfather .   well  never mind .   joe said     yeah  you broke it up .  sure you did .  what   s your name .      but he didn   t answer that one  ever .  we asked him a few more times  and then we ended up calling him    professor .      he finished off his glass and filled it again very slow .  he didn   t offer us any  and we all sucked at our beers .   so i said     well  go ahead .  what happened to the dinosaurs .      but he didn   t tell us right away .  he stared right at the middle of the table and talked to it .      i don   t know how many times carol sent me back     just a few minutes or hours     before i made the big jump .  i didn   t care about the dinosaurs  i just wanted to see how far the machine would take me on the supply of power i had available .  i suppose it was dangerous  but is life so wonderful .  the war was on them     one more life .      he sort of coddled his glass as if he was thinking about things in general  then he seemed to skip a part in his mind and keep right on going .      it was sunny     he said     sunny and bright  dry and hard .  there were no swamps  no ferns .  none of the accoutrements of the cretaceous we associate with dinosaurs         anyway  i think that   s what he said .  i didn   t always catch the big words  so later on i   ll just stick in what i can remember .  i checked all the spellings  and i must say that for all the liquor he put away  he pronounced them without stutters .   that   s maybe what bothered us .  he sounded so familiar with everything  and it all just rolled off his tongue like nothing .   he went on     it was a late age  certainly the cretaceous .  the dinosaurs were already on the way out     all except those little ones  with their metal belts and their guns .      i guess joe practically dropped his nose into the beer altogether .  he skidded halfway around the glass  when the professor let loose that statement sort of sadlike .     joe sounded mad .     what little ones  with whose metal belts and which guns .      the professor looked at him for just a second and then let his eyes slide back to nowhere .     thc were little reptiles  standing four feet high .  they stood on their hind legs with a thick tail behind  and they had little forearms with fingers .  around their waists were strapped wide metal belts  and from these hung guns .      and they weren   t guns that shot pellets either  they were energy projectors .         they were what    .     i asked .     say  when was this .  millions of years ago .         that   s right     he said .     they were reptiles .  they had scales and no eyelids and they probably laid eggs .  but they used energy guns .  there were five of them .  they were on me as soon as i got out of the machine .  there must have been millions of them all over earth     millions .  scattered all over .  they must have been the lords of creation then .      i guess it was then that ray thought he had him  because he developed that wise look in his eyes that makes you feel like conking him with an empty beer mug  because a full one would waste beer .  he said     look  p   fessor  millions of them  huh .  aren   t there guys who don   t do anything but find old bones and mess around with them till they figure out what some dinosaur looked like .  the museums are full of these here skeletons  aren   t they .  well  where   s there one with a metal belt on him .  if there were millions  what   s become of them .  where are the hones .      the professor sighed .  it was a real  sad sigh .  maybe he realized for the first time he was just speaking to three guys in overalls in a barroom .  or maybe he didn   t care .   he said     you don   t find many fossils .  think how many animals lived on earth altogether .  think how many billions and trillions .  and then think how few fossils we find .      and these lizards were intelligent .  remember that .  they   re not going to get caught in snow drifts or mud  or fall into lava  except by big accident .  think how few fossil men there are     even of these subintelligent apemen of a million years ago .      he looked at his half full glass and turned it round and round .   he said     what would fossils show anyway .  metal belts rust away and leave nothing .  those little lizards were warm blooded .  i know that  but you couldn   t prove it from petrified bones .  what the devil .  a million years from now could you tell what new york looks like from a human skeleton .  could you tell a human from a gorilla by the bones and figure out which one built an atomic bomb and which one ate bananas in a zoo .         hey     said joe  plenty objecting     any simple bum can tell a gorilla skeleton from a man   s .  a man   s got a larger brain .  any fool can tell which one was intelligent .         really .     the professor laughed to himself  as if all this was so simple and obvious  it was just a crying shame to waste time on it .     you judge everything from the type of brain human beings have managed to develop .  evolution has different ways of doing things .  birds fly one way  bats ay another way .  life has plenty of tricks for everything .      how much of your brain do you think you use .  about a fifth .  that   s what the psychologists say .  as far as they know  as far as anybody knows  eighty per cent of your brain has no use at all .  everybody just works on way low gear  except maybe a few in history .  leonardo da vinci  for instance .  archimedes  aristotle  gauss  galois  einstein         i never heard of any of them except einstein  but i didn   t let on .  he mentioned a few more  but i   ve put in all i can remember .  then he said     those little reptiles had tiny brains  maybe quarter size  maybe even less  but they used it all     every hit of it .  their hones might not show it  but they were intelligent  intelligent as humans .  and they were boss of all earth .        and then joe came up with something that was really good .  for a while i was sure that he had the professor and i was awfully glad he came out with it .  he said     look  p   fessor  if those lizards were so damned hot  why didn   t they leave something behind .  where are their cities and their buildings and all the sort of stuff we keep finding of the cavemen  stone knives and things .  hell  if human beings got the heck off of earth  think of the stuff we   d leave behind us .  you couldn   t walk a mile without falling over a city .  and roads and things .        but the professor just couldn   t he stopped .  he wasn   t even shaken up .  he just came right back with     you   re still judging other forms of life by human standards .  we build cities and roads and airports and the rest that goes with us     but they didn   t .  they were built on a different plan .  their whole way of life was different from the ground up .  they didn   t live in cities .  they didn   t have our kind of art .  i   m not sure what they did have because it was so alien i couldn   t grasp it     except for their guns .  those would be the same .  funny  isn   t it .      for all i know  maybe we stumble over their relics every day and don   t even know that   s what they are .      i was pretty sick of it by that time .  you just couldn   t get him .  the cuter you   d be  the cuter he   d be .   i said     look here .  how do you know so much about those things .  what did you do  live with them .  or did they speak english .  or maybe you speak lizard talk .  give us a few words of lizard talk .      i guess i was getting mad  too .  you know how it is .  a guy tells you something you don   t believe because it   s all cockeyed  and you can   t get him to admit he   s lying .   but the professor wasn   t mad .  he was just filling the glass again  very slowly .     no     he said     i didn   t talk and they didn   t talk .  they just looked at me with their cold  hard  staring eyes     snake   s eyes     and i knew what they were thinking  and i could see that they knew what i was thinking .  don   t ask me how it happened .  it just did .  everything .  i knew that they were out on a hunting expedition and i knew they weren   t going to let me go .      and we stopped asking questions .  we just looked at him  then ray said     what happened .  how did you get away .         that was easy .  an animal scurried past on the hilltop .  it was long     maybe ten feet     and narrow and ran close to the ground .  the lizards got excited .  i could feel the excitement in waves .  it was as if they forgot about me in a single hot flash of blood lust     and off they went .  i got back in the machine  returned  and broke it up .      it was the flattest sort of ending you ever heard .  joe made a noise in his throat .     well  what happened to the dinosaurs .         oh  you don   t see .  i thought it was plain enough .      it was those little intelligent lizards that did it .  they were hunters     by instinct and by choice .  it was their hobby in life .  it wasn   t for food  it was for fun .         and they just wiped out all the dinosaurs on the earth .         all that lived at the time  anyway  all the contemporary species .  don   t you think it   s possible .  how long did it take us to wipe out bison herds by the hundred million .  what happened to the dodo in a few years .  supposing we really put our minds to it  how long would the lions and the tigers and the giraffes last .  why  by the time i saw those lizards there wasn   t any big game left     no reptile more than fifteen feet maybe .  all gone .  those little demons were chasing the little  scurrying ones  and probably crying their hearts out for the good old days .      and we all kept quiet and looked at our empty beer bottles and thought about it .  all those dinosaurs     big as houses     killed by little lizards with guns .  killed for fun .   then joe leaned over and put his hand on the professor   s shoulder  easylike  and shook it .  he said     hey  p   fessor  but if that   s so  what happened to the little lizards with the guns .  huh .      did you ever go back to find out .      the professor looked up with the kind of look in his eyes that he   d have if he were lost .      you still don   t see .  it was already beginning to happen to them .  i saw it in their eyes .  they were running out of big game    the fun was going nut of it .  so what did you expect them to do .  they turned to other game     the biggest and most dangerous of all     and really had fun .  they hunted that game to the end .         what game .     asked ray .  he didn   t get it  but joe and i did .      themselves     said the professor in a loud voice .     they finished off all the others and began on themselves     till not one was left .      and again we stopped and thought about those dinosaurs     big as houses     all finished off by little lizards with guns .  then we thought about the little lizards and how they had to keep the guns going even when there was nothing to use them on but themselves .   joe said     poor dumb lizards .         yeah     said ray     poor crackpot lizards .      and then what happened really scared us .  because the professor jumped up with eyes that looked as if they were trying to climb right out of their sockets and leap at us .  he shouted     you damned fools .  why do you sit there slobbering over reptiles dead a hundred million years .  that was the first intelligence on earth and that   s how it ended .  that   s done .  but we   re the second intelligence     and how the devil do you think we   re going to end .      he pushed the chair over and headed for the door .  but then he stood there just before leaving altogether and said     poor dumb humanity .  go ahead and cry about that .                 the story  alas  seems to have a moral  and  in fact  ends by pounding that moral over the reader   s head .  that is bad .  straightforward preaching spoils the effectiveness of a story .  if you can   t resist the impulse to improve your fellow human beings  do it subtly .   occasionally i overflow and forget this good maxim .  day of the hunters was written not long after the soviet union had exploded its first fission bomb .  it had been bad enough till then  knowing that the united states might be tempted to use fission bombs if sufficiently irritated  as in       .  now  for the first time  the possibility of a real nuclear war  one in which both sides used fission bombs  had arisen .   we   ve grown used to that situation now and scarcely think of it  but in      there were many who thought a nuclear war was inevitable  and in short order  too .  i was pretty bitter about that     and the bitterness shows in the story .      mankind s suicide seems now  a quarter century after day of the hunters was written  to be more likely than ever  but for different reasons .    day of the hunters is also told in the framework of a conversation  by the way .  this one takes place in a bar .  wodehouse   s stories about mulliner  the stories set in gavagan   s bar by l .  sprague de camp and fletcher pratt  and clarke   s stories about the white hart were all set in bars  and i   d read them a   and loved them .   it was inevitable  therefore  that someday i would tell a story in the form of a bar conversation .  the only trouble is that i don   t drink and have hardly ever sat in a bar  so i probably have it all wrong .     my stay in boston quickly proved to be no barrier to my literary career .   in fact  nothing since my concentra tion on my doctoral research in      has proved to be a barrier .    after two months in a small sublet apartment  of slum quality  very close to the school  we moved to the suburbs     if you want to call it that .  neither my wife nor i could drive a car when we came to boston so we had to find a place on the bus lines .  we got one in the rather impoverished town of somerville     an attic apartment of primitive sort that was unbelievably hot in the summer .   there i wrote my second novel  the stars  like dust  doubleday         and while there a small  one man publishing firm  gnome press  put out a collection of my positronic robot stories  i  robot  in       and the first portion of my foundation stories as foundation in      .      gnome press did not do well with these books or with foundation and empire and second foundation  which they published in      and      .  to my great relief  therefore  doubleday  playing the role of white knight on my behalf  pressured gnome press into relinquishing these books in      .  doubleday handled them thereafter and succeeded in earning  and is still continuing to earn  very substantial sums out of all of them for myself and for themselves .      in      i learned to drive an automobile  and in      we even had a son  rather to our surprise .  after nine years of marriage we had rather come to the opinion that we were doomed to he childless .  late in       however  it turned out that the explanation to some rather puzzling physiological manifestations was that my wife was pregnant .  the first person to tell me that that must be so  i remember  was evelyn gold  she was then mrs .  horace gold  .  i laughed and said     no  no     but it was yes  yes  and david was horn on august          .   having thus become prolific in books and having made a start in the direction of automobiles and offspring  i was ready for anything and began to accept all kinds of assignments .   among the many science fiction magazines of the early     s  for instance  there was one called marvel science fiction .  it was the reincarnation of an earlier marvel that had published nine issues between      and      .  the earlier magazine had specialized in stories that accented sex in a rather heavy handed and foolish manner .      i n a very indirect way this eventually led to my writing a story called playboy and the slime god which appeared in the march      amazing stories and was then included in my collection nightfall and other stories under the much better title what is this thing called love .   after marvel was revived in       it lasted only for another half dozen issues  i was asked for a story .  i might have recalled the unsavory history of the magazine and refused to supply one  but i thought of a story i couldn   t resist writing because  as all who know me are aware  i am an incorrigible punster .      i once asked a girl named dawn if she had ever used one of those penny weighing machines on a trip to florida she was telling me about .  she said     no .  why .     and i said because there was a song written about it .  she said     what are you talking about .     and i said     haven   t you heard    weigh dawn upon the swanee river    .     and she chased me for five blocks before i got away .   the story was shah guido g .  and it appeared in the november      issue of marvel .       shah guido g .      once every year philo plat returned to the scene of his crime .  it was a form of penance .  on each anniversary he climbed the barren crest and gazed along the miles of smashed metal  concrete  and bones .   the area was desolate .  the metal crumplings were still stainless and unrusted  their jagged teeth raised in futile anger .  somewhere among it all were the skeletons of the thousands who had died  of all ages and both sexes .  their skully sightlessness  for all he knew  was turning empty  curse torn eye holes at him .   the stench had long since gone from the desert  and the lizards held their lairs untroubled .  no man approached the fenced off burial ground where what remained of bodies lay in the gashed crater carved out in that final fall .   only plat came .  he returned year after year and always  as though to ward off so many evil eyes  he took his gold medal with him .  it hung suspended bravely from his neck as he stood on the crest .  on it was inscribed simply     to the liberator .      this time  fulton was with him .  fulton had been a lower one once in the days before the crash  the days when there had been higher ones and lower ones .   fulton said     i am amazed you insist on coming here  philo .      plat said     i must .  you know the sound of the crash was heard for hundreds of miles  seismographs registered it around the world .  my ship was almost directly above it  the shock vibrations caught me and flung me miles .  yet all i can remember of sound is that one composite scream as atlantis began its fall .         it had to be done .         words     sighed plat .     there were babies and guiltless ones .         no one is guiltless .         nor am i .  ought i to have been the executioner .         someone had to be .     fulton was firm .     consider the world now  twenty five years later .  democracy re established  education once more universal  culture available for the masses  and science once more advancing .  two expeditions have already landed on mars .         i know .  i know .  but that  too  was a culture .  thc called it atlantis because it was an island that ruled the world .  it was an island in the sky  not the sea .  it was a city and a world all at once  fulton .  you never saw its crystal covering and its gorgeous buildings .  it was a single jewel carved of stone and metal .  it was a dream .         it was concentrated happiness distilled out of the little supply distributed to billions of ordinary folk who lived on the surface .         yes  you are right .  yes  it had to be .  but it might have been so different  fulton .  you know     he seated himself on the hard rock  crossed his arms upon his knees and cradled his chin in them     i think  sometimes  of how it must have been in the old days  when there were nations and wars upon the earth .  i think of how much a miracle it must have seemed to the peoples when the united nations first became a real world government  and what atlantis must have meant to them .      it was a capital city that governed earth but was not of it .  it was a black disc in the air  capable of appearing anywhere on earth at any height  belonging to no one nation  but to all the planet  the product of no one nation   s ingenuity but the first great achievement of all the race     and then  what it became .      fulton said     shall we go .  we   ll want to get back to the ship before dark .      plat went on     in a way .  i suppose it was inevitable .  the human race never did invent an institution that didn   t end as a cancer .  probably in prehistoric times  the medicine man who began as the repository of tribal wisdom ended as the last bar to tribal advance .  in ancient rome  the citizen army         fulton was letting him speak     patiently .  it was a queer echo of the past .  and there had been other eyes upon him in those days  patiently waiting  while he talked .          the citizen army that defended the romans against all comers from veii to carthage  became the professional praetorian guard that sold the imperium and levied tribute on all the empire .  the turks developed the janissaries as their invincible advance guard against europe and the sultan ended as a slave of his janissary slaves .  the barons of medieval europe protected the serfs against the northmen and the magyars  then remained six hundred years longer as a parasite aristocracy that contributed nothing .      plat became aware of the patient eyes and said     don   t you understand me .      one of the bolder technicians said     with your kind permission  higher one  we must needs be at work .         yes  i suppose you must .      the technician felt sorry .  this higher one was queer  but he meant well .  though he spoke a deal of nonsense  he inquired after their families  told them they were fine fellows  and that their work made them better than the higher ones .   so he explained     you see  there is another shipment of granite and steel for the new theater and we will have to shift the energy distribution .  it is becoming very hard to do that .  the higher ones will not listen .         now that   s what i mean .  you should make them listen .      but they just stared at him  and at that moment an idea crawled gently into plat   s unconscious mind .     leo spinney waited for him on the crystal level .  he was plat   s age but taller and much more handsome .  plat   s face was thin  his eyes were china blue  and he never smiled .  spinney was straight nosed with brown eyes that seemed to laugh continuously .   spinney called     we   ll miss the game .         i don   t want to go  leo .  please .      spinney said     with the technicians again .  why do you waste your time .      plat said     they work .  i respect them .  what right have we to idle .         ought i to ask questions of the world as it is when it suits me so well    .         if you do not  someone will ask questions for you someday .         that will be someday  not this day .  and  frankly  you had better come .  the sekjen has noticed that you are never present at the games and he doesn   t like it .  personally  i think people have been telling him of your talks to the technicians and your visits to the surface .  he might even think you consort with lower ones .      spinney laughed heartily  but plat said nothing .  it would not hurt them if they consorted with lower ones a bit more  learned something of their thinking .  atlantis had its guns and its battalions of waves .  it might learn someday that that was not enough .  not enough to save the sekjen .   the sekjen .  plat wanted to spit .  the full title was    secretary general of the united nations .     two centuries before it had been an elective office  an honorable one .  now a man like guido garshthavastra could fill it because he could prove he was the son of his equally worthless father .      guido g .     was what the lower ones on the surface called him .  and usually  with bitterness     shah guido g .      because    shah    had been the title of a line of despotic oriental kings .  the lower ones knew him for what he was .  plat wanted to tell spinney that  but it wasn   t time yet .     the real games were held in the upper stratosphere  a hundred miles above atlantis  though the sky island was itself twenty miles above sea level .  the huge amphitheater was filled and the radiant globe in its center held all eyes .  each tiny one man cruiser high above was represented by its own particular glowing symbol in the color that belonged to the fleet of which it was part .  the little sparks reproduced in exact miniature the motions of the ships .   the game was starting as plat and spinney took their seats .  the little dots were already flashing toward one another .  skimming and missing  veering .   a large scoreboard blazoned the progress of the battle in conventional symbology that plat did not understand .  there was confused cheering for either fleet and for particular ships .   high up under a canopy was the sekjen  the shah guido g .  of the lower ones .  plat could barely see him but he could make out clearly the smaller replica of the game globe that was there for his private use .   plat was watching the game for the first time .  he understood none of the finer points and wondered at the reason for the particular shouts .  yet he understood that the dots were ships and that the streaks of light that licked out from them on frequent occasions represented energy beams which  one hundred miles above  were as real as flaring atoms could make them .  each time a dot streaked  there was a clamor in the audience that died in a great moan as a target dot veered and escaped .   and then there was a general yell and the audience  men and women up to the sekjen himself clambered to its feet .  one of the shining dots had been hit and was going down     spiraling  spiraling .  a hundred miles above  a real ship was doing the same  plunging down into the thickening air that would heat and consume its specially designed magnesium alloy shell to harmless powdery ash before it could reach the surface of the earth .   plat turned away .     i   m leaving  spinney .      spinney was marking his scorecard and saying     that   s five ships the greens have lost this week .  we   ve got to have more .     he was on his feet  calling wildly     another one .      the audience was taking up the shout  chanting it .   plat said     a man died in that ship .         you bet .  one of the green   s hest too .  damn good thing .        do you realize that a man died .         they   re only lower ones .  what   s bothering you .      plat made his slow way out among the rows of people .  a few looked at him and whispered .  most had eyes for nothing but the game globe .  there was perfume all about him and in the distance  occasionally heard amid the shouts  there was a faint wash of gentle music .  as he passed through a main exit  a yell trembled the air behind him .   plat fought the nausea grimly .     he walked two miles  then stopped .   steel girders were swaying at the end of diamagnetic beams and the coarse sound of orders yelled in lower accents filled the air .   there was always building going on upon atlantis .  two hundred years ago  when atlantis had been the genuine seat of government  its lines had been straight  its spaces broad .  but now it was much more than that .  it was the xanadu pleasure dome that coleridge spoke of .   the crystal roof had been lifted upward and outward many times in the last two centuries .  each time it had been thickened so that atlantis might more safely climb higher  more safely withstand the possible blows of meteoric pebbles not yet entirely burnt by the thin wisps of air .   and as atlantis became more useless and more attractive  more and more of the higher ones left their estates and factories in the hands of managers and foremen and took up permanent residence on the sky island .  all built larger  higher  more elaborately .   and here was still another structure .   waves were standing by in stolid  duty ridden obedience .  the name applied to the females     if  plat thought sourly  they could be called that     was taken from the early english of the days when earth was divided into nations .  there  too  conversion and degeneration had obtained .  the old waves had done paper work behind the lines .  these creatures  still called waves  were front line soldiers .   it made sense  plat knew .  properly trained  women were more single minded  more fanatic  less given to doubts and remorse than ever men could be .   they always had waves present at the scene of any building  because the building was done by lower ones  and lower ones on atlantis had to he guarded .  just as those on the surface had to he cowed .  in the last fifty years alone  the long range atomic artillery that studded the underside of atlantis had been doubled and tripled .   he watched the girder come softly down  two men yelling directions to each other as it settled in place .  soon there would be no further room for new buildings on atlantis .   the idea that had nudged his unconscious mind earlier in the day gently touched his conscious mind .   plat   s nostrils flared .     plat   s nose twitched at the smell of oil and machinery .  more than most of the perfume spoiled higher ones  he was used to odors of all sorts .  he had been on the surface and smelled the pungence of its growing fields and the fumes of its cities .   he said to the technician     i am seriously thinking of building a new house and would like your advice as to the best possible location .      the technician was amazed and electrified .     thank you  higher one .  it has become so difficult to arrange the available power .         it is why l come to you .      they talked at length  plat asked a great many questions and when he returned to crystal level his mind was a maze of speculation .  two days passed in an agony of doubt .  then he remembered the shining dot  spiraling and spiraling  and the young  wondering eyes upon his own as spinnev said     they   re only lower ones .      he made up his mind and applied for audience with the sekjen .     the sekjen   s drawling voice accentuated the boredom he did not care to hide .  he said .     the plats are of good family  yet you amuse yourself with technicians .  i am told you speak to them as equals .  i hope that it will not become necessary to remind you that your estates on the surface require your care .      that would have meant exile from atlantis  of course .   plat said     it is necessary to watch the technicians  sire .  they are of lower extraction .      the sekjen frowned .     our wave commander has her job she takes care of such matters .         she docs her best  i have no doubt  sire  but i have made friends with the technicians .  they are not safe .  would i have any other reason to soil my hands with them  but the safety of atlantis .      the sekjen listened .  first  doubtfully  then  with fear on his soft face .  he said     i shall have them in custody            softly  sire     said plat .     we cannot do without them meanwhile  since none of us can man the guns and the antigravs .  it would be better to give them no opportunity for rebellion .  in two weeks the new theater will be dedicated with games and feasting .         and what do they intend then .        i am not yet certain  sire .  but i know enough to recommend that a division of waves be brought to atlantis .  secretly  of course  and at the last minute so that it will be too late for the rebels to change any plans they have made .  they will have to drop them altogether  and the proper moment  once lost  may never be regained .  thereafter  i will learn more .  if necessary  we will train new men .  it would be a pity  sire  to tell anyone of this in advance .  if the technicians learn our countermeasures prematurely  matters may go badly .      the sekjen  with his jeweled hand to his chin  mused     and believed .   shah guido g .   thought philo plat .  in history  you   ll go down as shah guido g .     philo plat watched the gaiety from a distance .  atlantis   s central squares were crawling black with people .  that was good .  he himself had managed to get away only with difficulty .  and none too soon  since the wave division had already cross hatched the sky with their ships .   they were maneuvering edgily now  adjusting themselves into final position over atlantis   s huge  raised air field  which was well able to take their ships all at once .   the cruisers were descending now vertically  in parade formation .  plat looked quickly toward the city proper .  the populace had grown quieter as they watched the unscheduled demonstration  and it seemed to him that he had never seen so many higher ones upon the sky island at one time .  for a moment  a last misgiving arose .  there was still time for a warning .   and even as he thought that he knew that there wasn   t .  the cruisers were dropping speedily .  he would have to go hurry if he were himself to escape in his own little craft .  he wondered sickly  even as he grasped the controls  whether his friends on the surface had received his yesterday   s warning  or would believe it if they had received it .  if they could not act quickly the higher ones would yet recover from the first blow  devastating though it was .   he was in the air when the waves landed  seven thousand five hundred tear drop ships covering the airfield like a descending net .  plat drove his ship upward  watching      and atlantis went dark .  it was like a candle over which a mighty hand was suddenly cupped .  one moment it blazed the night into brilliance for fifty miles around  the next it was black against blackness .   to plat the thousands of screams blended into one thin  lost shriek of fear .  he red  and the shock vibrations of atlantis   s crash to earth caught his ship and hurled it far .   he never stopped hearing that scream .     fulton was staring at plat .  he said     have you ever told this to anyone .      plat shook his head .   fulton   s mind went back a quarter century  too .     we got your message  of course .  it was hard to believe  as you expected .  many feared a trap even after report of the fall arrived .  but     well  it   s history .  the higher ones that remained  those on the surface  were demoralized and before they could recover  they were done .      but tell me     he turned to plat with sudden  hard curiosity .     what was it you did    .  we   ve always assumed you sabotaged the power stations .         i know .  the truth is so much less romantic  fulton .  the world would prefer to believe its myth .  let it .         may i have the truth .         if you will .  as i told you  the higher ones built and built to saturation .  the antigrav energy beams had to support a weight in buildings  guns  and enclosing shell that doubled and tripled as the years went on .  any requests the technicians might have made for newer or bigger motors were turned down  since the higher ones would rather have the room and money for their mansions and there was always enough power for the moment .      the technicians  as i said  had already reached the stage where they were disturbed at the construction of single buildings .  i questioned them and found exactly how little margin of safety remained .  they were waiting only for the completion of the new theater to make a new request .  they did not realize  however  that  at my suggestion  atlantis would be called upon to support the sudden additional burden of a division of wave cavalry in their ships .  seven thousand five hundred ships  fully rigged .      when the waves landed  by then almost two thousand tons  the antigrav power supply was overloaded .  the motors failed and atlantis was only a vast rock  ten miles above the ground .  what could such a rock do but fall .      plat arose .  together they turned back toward their ship .   fulton laughed harshly .     you know  there is a fatality in names .        what do you mean .         why  that once more in history atlantis sank beneath the waves .                 now that you   ve read the story  you   ll notice that the whole thing is for the purpose of that final lousy pun  right .  in fact  one person came up to me and  in tones of deep disgust  said     why  shah guido g .  is nothing but a shaggy dog story .         right     i said     and if you divide the title into two parts instead of three  you get shahgui dog  so don   t you think i know it .      in other words  the title is a pun  too .     with david on his way  we obviously couldn   t remain in that impossible somerville apartment .  since i could now drive a car  we were no longer bound to the bus lines and could look farther afield .  in the spring of      we moved into an apartment in waltham  massachusetts  therefore .  it was a great improvement over the earlier apartment  though it  too  was pretty hot in the summer .   there were two very small built in bookcases in the living room of the apartment and i began using that for a collection of my own books in chronological order .  i got up to seventeen books while i was in that apartment .  when my biochemistry textbook came out in      i placed it with the rest in its proper order .  it received no preferential treatment .  i saw no way in which a scientific textbook could lay claim to greater respectability than a science fiction novel .   if i had ambitions  in fact  it was not toward respectability .  i kept wanting to write funny material .   humor is a funny thing  however      all right  humor is a peculiar thing  if you have a prejudice against a witty play on words .  there is no way of being almost funny or mildly funny or fairly funny or tolerably funny .  you are either funny or not funny and there is nothing in between .  and usually it is the writer who thinks he is funny and the reader who thinks he isn   t .   naturally  then  humor isn   t something a man should lightly undertake  especially in the early days of his career when he has not yet learned to handle his tools .      and yet almost every beginning writer tries his hand at humor  convinced that it is an easy thing to do .   i was no exception .  by the time i had written and submitted four stories  and had  as yet  sold none  i already felt it was time to write a funny story .  i did .  it was ring around the sun  something i actually managed to sell and which was eventually included in the early asimov .   i didn   t think it was successfully funny even at the time it was written .  nor did i think several other funny stories i tried my hand at  such as christmas on ganymede  also in the early asimov  and robot al    goes astray  included in the rest of the robots  doubleday        were really funny .   it wasn   t till      that  in my own mind only  i say nothing about yours  i succeeded .  i wrote two stories  button  button and the monkey   s finger  in which i definitely thought i had managed to do it right .  i was giggling all the way through each one  and i managed to unload both on startling stories  where they appeared in successive issues  button  button in the january      issue and the monkey   s finger in the february      issue .   and  gentle reader  if you don   t think they   re funny  do your best not to tell me so .  leave me to my illusions .       button  button     it was the tuxedo that fooled me and for two seconds i didn   t recognize him .  to me  he was just a possible client  the first that had whiffed my way in a week     and he looked beautiful .   even wearing a tuxedo at      a . m .  he looked beautiful .  six inches of bony wrist and ten inches of knobby hand continued on where his sleeve left off  the top of his socks and the bottom of his trousers did not quite join forces  still he looked beautiful .   then i looked at his face and it wasn   t a client at all .  it was my uncle otto .  beauty ended .  as usual  my uncle otto   s face looked like that of a bloodhound that had just been kicked in the rump by his best friend .   i wasn   t very original in my reaction .  i said     uncle otto .      you   d know him too  if you saw that face .  when he was featured on the cover of time about five years ago  it was either       or             readers by count wrote in to say that they would never forget that face .  most added comments concerning nightmares .  if you want my uncle otto   s full name  it   s otto schlemmelmayer .  but don   t jump to conclusions .  he   s my mother   s brother .  my own name is smith .   he said     harry  my boy     and groaned .   interesting  but not enlightening .  i said     why the tuxedo .      he said     it   s rented .         all right .  but why do you wear it in the morning .         is it morning already .     he stared vaguely about him  then went to the window and looked out .   that   s my uncle otto schlemmelmayer .  i assured him it was morning and with an effort he deduced that he must have been walking the city streets all night .   he took a handful of fingers away from his forehead to say     but i was so upset  harry .  at the banquet         the fingers waved about for a minute and then folded into a quart of fist that came down and pounded holes in my desk top .     but it   s the end .  from now on   do things my own way .      my uncle otto had been saying that since the business of the    schlemmelmayer effect    first started up .  maybe that surprises you .  maybe you think it was the schlemmelmayer effect that made my uncle otto famous .  well  it   s all how you look at it .   he discovered the effect back in      and the chances are that you know as much about it as i do .  in a nutshell  he devised a germanium relay of such a nature as to respond to thoughtwaves  or anyway to the electromagnetic fields of the brain cells .  he worked for years to build such a delay into a flute  so that it would play music under the pressure of nothing but thought .  it was his love  his life  it was to revolutionize music .  everyone would be able to play  no skill necessary     only thought .   then  five years ago  this young fellow at consolidated arms  stephen wheland  modified the schlemmelmayer effect and reversed it .  he devised a field of supersonic waves that could activate the brain via a germanium relay  fry it  and kill a rat at twenty feet .  also  they found out later  men .   after that  wheland got a bonus of ten thousand dollars and a promotion  while the major stockholders of consolidated arms proceeded to make millions when the government bought the patents and placed its orders .   my uncle otto .  he made the cover of time .   after that  everyone who was close to him  say within a few miles  knew he had a grievance .  some thought it was the fact that he had received no money  others  that his great discovery had been made an instrument of war and killing .   nuts .  it was his flute .  that was the real tack on the chair of his life .  poor uncle otto .  he loved his flute .  he carried it with him always  ready to demonstrate .  it reposed in its special case on the back of his chair when he ate  and at the head of his bed when he slept .  sunday mornings in the university physics laboratories were made hideous by the sounds of my uncle otto   s flute  under imperfect mental control  flatting its way through some tearful german folk song .   the trouble was that no manufacturer would touch it .  as soon as its existence was unveiled  the musicians    union threatened to silence every demiquaver in the land  the various entertainment industries called their lobbyists to attention and marked them off in brigades for instant action  and even old pietro faranini stuck his baton behind his ear and made fervent statements to the newspapers about the impending death of art .   uncle otto never recovered .   he was saying     yesterday were my final hopes .  consolidated informs me they will in my honor a banquet give .  who knows  i say to myself .  maybe they will my flute buy .     under stress  my uncle otto   s word order tends to shift from english to germanic .   the picture intrigued me .      what an idea     i said .     a thousand giant flutes secreted in key spots in enemy territories blaring out singing commercials just flat enough to            quiet .  quiet .     my uncle otto brought down the flat of his hand on my desk like n pistol shot  and the plastic calendar jumped in fright and fell down dead .     from you also mockery .  where is your respect .         i   m sorry  uncle otto .         then listen .  i attended the banquet and they made speeches about the schlemmelmayer effect and how it harnessed the power of mind .  then when i thought they would announce they would my flute buy  they give me this .      he took out what looked like a two thousand dollar gold piece and threw it at me .  i ducked .     had it hit the window  it would have gone through and brained a pedestrian  but it hit the wall .  i picked it up .  you could tell by the weight that it was only gold plated .  on one side it said     the elias hancroft sudford award    in big letters  and    to dr .  otto schlemmelmayer for his contributions to science    in small letters .  on the other side was a profile  obviously not of my uncle otto .  in fact  it didn   t look like any breed of dog  more like a pig .      that     said my uncle otto     is elias bancroft sudford  chairman of consolidated arms .      he went on     so when i saw that was all  i got up and very politely said     gentlemen  dead drop .     and walked out .         then you walked the streets all night .     i filled in for him     and came here without even changing your clothes .  you   re still in your tuxedo .      my uncle otto stretched out an arm and looked at its covering .     a tuxedo .     he said .      a tuxedo .     i said .   his long  jowled checks turned blotchy red and he roared     i come here on something of first rate importance and you insist on about nothing but tuxedos talking .  my own nephew .      i let the fire burn out .  my uncle otto is the brilliant one in the family  so except for trying to keep him from falling into sewers and walking out of windows  we morons try not to bother him .   i said     and what can i do for you  uncle .      i tried to make it sound businesslike  i tried to introduce the lawyer client relationship .   he waited impressively and said     i need money .      he had come to the wrong place .  i said     uncle  right now i don   t have            not from you     he said .   i felt better .   he said     there is a new schlemmelmayer effect  a better one .  this one i do not in scientific journals publish .  my big mouth shut i keep .  it entirely my own is .     he was leading a phantom orchestra with his bony fist as he spoke .      from this new effect     he went on     i will make money and my own flute factory open .         good     i said  thinking of the factory and lying .      but i don   t know how .         bad     i said .  thinking of the factory and lying .      the trouble is my mind is brilliant .  i can conceive concepts beyond ordinary people .  only  harry  i can   t conceive ways of making money .  it   s a talent i do not have .         bad     i said  not lying at all .      so i come to you as a lawyer .      i sniggered a little deprecating snigger .      i come to you     he went on     to make you help me with your crooked  lying  sneaking  dishonest lawyer   s brain .      i filed the remark  mentally  under unexpected compliments and said     i love you  too  uncle otto .      he must have sensed the sarcasm because he turned purple with rage and yelled     don   t be touchy .  be like me  patient  understanding  and easygoing  lumphead .  who says anything about you as a man .  as a man  you are an honest dunderkopf  but as a lawyer  you have to be a crook .  everyone knows that .      i sighed .  the bar association warned me there would be days like this .      what   s your new effect  uncle otto .     i asked .   he said     i can reach back into time and bring things out of the past .      i acted quickly .  with my left hand i snatched my watch out of the lower left vest pocket and consulted it with all the anxiety i could work up .  with my right hand i reached for the telephone .      well  uncle     i said heartily     i just remembered an extremely important appointment i   m already hours late for .  always glad to see you .  and now  i   m afraid i must say good bye .  yes  sir  seeing you has been a pleasure  a real pleasure .  well  good bye .  yes  sir         i failed to lift the telephone out of its cradle .  i was pulling up all right  but my uncle otto   s hand was on mine and pushing down .  it was no contest .  have i said my uncle otto was once on the heidelberg wrestling team in       .   he took hold of my elbow gently  for him  and i was standing .  it was a great saving of muscular effort  for me  .      let   s    he said     to my laboratory go .      he to his laboratory went .  and since i had neither the knife nor the inclination to cut my left arm off at the shoulder  i to his laboratory went also .  .  .  .   my uncle otto   s laboratory is down a corridor and around a corner in one of the university buildings .  ever since the schlemmelmayer effect had turned out to be a big thing  he had been relieved of all course work and left entirely to himself .  his laboratory looked it .   i said     don   t you keep the door locked anymore .      he looked at me slyly  his huge nose wrinkling into a sniff .     it is locked .  with a schlemmelmayer relay  it   s locked .  i think a word     and the door opens .  without it  nobody can get in .  not even the president of the university .  not even the janitor .      i got a little excited     great guns  uncle otto .  a thought lock could bring you            hah .  i should sell the patent for someone else rich to get .  after last night .  never .  in a while  i will myself rich become .      one thing about my uncle otto .  he   s not one of these fellows you have to argue and argue with before you can get him to see the light .  you know in advance he   ll never see the light .   so i changed the subject .  i said     and the time machine .      my uncle otto is a foot taller than i am  thirty pounds heavier  and strong as an ox .  when he puts his hands around my throat and shakes  i have to confine my own part in the conflict to turning blue .   i turned blue accordingly .   he said .     ssh .      i got the idea .   he let go and said     nobody knows about project x .     he repeated  heavily     project x .  you understand .      i nodded .  i couldn   t speak anyway with a larynx that was only slowly healing .   he said     i do not ask you to take my word for it .  i will for you a demonstration make .      i tried to stay near the door .   he said     do you have a piece of paper with your own handwriting on it .      i fumbled in my inner jacket pocket .  i had notes for a possible brief for a possible client on some possible future day .   uncle otto said     don   t show it to me .  just tear it up .  in little pieces tear it up and in this beaker the fragments put .      i tore it into one hundred and twenty eight pieces .   he considered them thoughtfully and began adjusting knobs on a     well  on a machine .  it had a thick opal glass slab attached to it that looked like a dentist   s tray .   there was a wait .  he kept adjusting .   then he said     aha .     and i made a sort of queer sound that doesn   t translate into letters .   about two inches above the glass tray there was what seemed to be a fuzzy piece of paper .  it came into focus while i watched and     oh  well  why make a big thing out of it .  it was my notes .  my handwriting .  perfectly legible .  perfectly legitimate .      is it all right to touch it .     i was a little hoarse  partly out of astonishment and partly because of my uncle otto   s gentle ways of enforcing secrecy .      you can   t     he said  and passed his hand through it .  the paper remained behind  untouched .  he said     it   s only an image at one focus of a four dimensional paraboloid .  the other focus is at a point in time before you tore it up .      i put my hand through it  too .  i didn   t feel a thing .      now watch     he said .  he turned a knob on the machine and the image of the paper vanished .  then he took out a pinch of paper from the pile of scrap  dropped them in an ashtray  and set a match to it .  he flushed the ash down the sink .  he turned a knob again and the paper appeared  but with a difference .  ragged patches in it were missing .      the burned pieces .     i asked .      exactly .  the machine must trace in time along the hypervectors of the molecules on which it is focused .  if certain molecules are in the air dispersed     pff f ft .      i had an idea .     suppose you just had the ash of a document .         only those molecules would be traced back .         but they   d be so well distributed     i pointed out     that you could get a hazy picture of the entire document .         hmm .  maybe .        the idea became more exciting .     well  then  look  uncle otto .  do you know how much police departments would pay for a machine like this .  it would be a boon to the legal         i stopped .  i didn   t like the way he was stiffening .  i said  politely     you were saying  uncle .      he was remarkably calm about it .  he spoke in scarcely more than a shout .     once and for all  nephew .  all my inventions i will myself from now on develop .  first i must some initial capital obtain .  capital from some source other than my ideas selling .  after that  i will for my flutes a factory to manufacture open .  that comes first .  afterward  afterward  with my profits i can time vector machinery manufacture .  but first my flutes .  before anything  my flutes .  last night  i so swore .      through selfishness of a few the world of great music is being deprived .  shall my name in history as a murderer go down .  shall the schlemmelmayer effect a way to fry men   s brains he .  or shall it beautiful music to mind bring .  great  wonderful  enduring music .      he had a hand raised oracularly and the other behind his hack .  the windows gave out a shrill hum as they vibrated to his words .   i said quickly     uncle otto  they   ll hear you .         then stop shouting     he retorted .      but look     i protested     how do you plan to get your initial capital  if you won   t exploit this machinery .         i haven   t told you .  i can make an image real .  what if the image is valuable .      that did sound good .     you mean  like some lost document  manuscript  first edition     things like that .         well  no .  there   s a catch .  two catches .  three catches .      i waited for him to stop counting  but three seemed the limit .     what are they .     i asked .   he said     first  i must have the object in the present to focus on or i can   t locate it in the past .         you mean you can   t get anything that doesn   t exist right now where you can see it .         yes .         in that case  catches two and three are purely academic .  but what are they  anyway .         i can only remove about a gram of material from the past .      a gram .  a thirtieth of an ounce .      what   s the matter .  not enough power .      my uncle otto said impatiently     it   s an inverse exponential relationship .  all the power in the universe more than maybe two grams couldn   t bring .      this left things cloudy .  i said     the third catch .         well .     he hesitated .     the further the two foci separated are  the more flexible the bond .  it must a certain length be before into the present it can he drawn .  in other words  i must at least one hundred fifty years into the past go .         i see     i said  not that i really did  .     let   s summarize .        i tried to sound like a lawyer .     you want to bring something from the past out of which you can coin a little capital .  it   s got to he something that exists and which you can see  so it can   t be a lost object of historical or archaeological value .  it   s got to weigh less than a thirtieth of an ounce  so it can   t he the kullinan diamond or anything like that .  it   s got to be at least one hundred and fifty years old  so it can   t be a rare stamp .         exactly     said my uncle otto .     you   ve got it .         got what .     i thought two seconds .     can   t think of a thing     i said .     well  good bye  uncle otto .      i didn   t think it would work  but i tried to go .   it didn   t work .  my uncle otto   s hands came down on my shoulders and i was standing tiptoe on an inch of air .      you   ll wrinkle my jacket  uncle otto .         harold     he said .     as a lawyer to a client  you owe me more than a quick good bye .         i didn   t take a retainer     i managed to gargle .  my shirt collar was beginning to fit very tightly about my neck .  i tried to swallow and the top button pinged off .   he reasoned     between relatives a retainer is a formality .  as a client and as an uncle  you owe me absolute loyalty .  and besides  if you do not help me out i will tie your legs behind your neck and dribble you like a basketball .      well  as a lawyer  i am always susceptible to logic .  i said     i give up .  i surrender .  you win .      he let me drop .  and then     this is the part that seems most unbelievable to me when i look back at it all     i got an idea .   it was a whale of an idea .  a piperoo .  the one in a lifetime that everyone gets once in a lifetime .   i didn   t tell uncle otto the whole thing at the time .  i wanted a few days to think about it .  but i told him what to do .  i told him he would have to go to washington .  it wasn   t easy to argue him into it  but  on the other hand  if you know my uncle otto  there are ways .   i found two ten dollar bills lurking pitifully in my wallet and gave them to him .   i said     i   ll make out a check for the train fare and you can keep the two tens if it turns out i   m being dishonest with you .      he considered .     a fool to risk twenty dollars for nothing you aren   t     he admitted .  he was right  too .  .  .  .   he was back in two days and pronounced the object focused .  after all  it was on public view .  it   s in a nitrogen filled  air tight case  but my uncle otto said that didn   t matter .  and back in the laboratory  four hundred miles away .  the focusing remained accurate .  my uncle otto assured me of that  too .   i said     two things  uncle otto  before we do anything .         what .  what .  what .     he went on at greater length     what .  what .  what .  what     i gathered he was growing anxious .  i said     are you sure that if we bring into the present a piece of something out of the past  that piece won   t disappear out of the object as it now exists .      my uncle otto cracked his large knuckles and said     we are creating new matter  not stealing old .  why else should we enormous energy need .      i passed on to the second point .     what about my fee .     you may not believe this  but i hadn   t mentioned money till then .  my uncle otto hadn   t either  but then  that follows .   his mouth stretched in a bad imitation of an affectionate smile .     a fee .         ten per cent of the take     i explained     is what i   ll need .      his jowls drooped .     but how much is the take .         maybe a hundred thousand dollars .  that would leave you ninety .         ninety thousand     himmel .  then why do we wait .      he leaped at his machine and in half a minute the space above the dentist   s tray was agleam with an image of parchment .   it was covered with neat script  closely spaced  looking like an entry for an old fashioned penmanship prize .  at the bottom of the sheet there were names  one large one and fifty five small ones .   funny thing .  i choked up .  i had seen many reproductions  but this was the real thing .  the real declaration of independence .   i said     i   ll be damned .  you did it .         and the hundred thousand .     asked my uncle otto  getting to the point .   now was the time to explain .     you see  uncle  at the bottom of the document there are signatures .  these are the names of great americans  fathers of their country  whom we all reverence .  anything about them is of interest to all true americans .         all right     grumbled my uncle otto     i will accompany you by playing the    stars and stripes forever    on my flute .      i laughed quickly to show that i took that remark as a joke .  the alternative to a joke would not hear thinking of .  have you ever heard my uncle otto playing the    stars and stripes forever    on his flute .   i said     but one of these signers  from the state of georgia  died in       the year after he signed the declaration .  he didn   t have much behind him and so authentic examples of his signature was about the most valuable in the world .  his name was button gwinnett .         and how does this help us cash in .     asked my uncle otto  his mind still fixed grimly on the eternal verities of the universe .      here     i said  simply     is an authentic  real life signature of button gwinnett  right on the declaration of independence .      my uncle otto was stunned into absolute silence  and to bring absolute silence out of my uncle otto  he   s really got to be stunned .   i said     now you see him right here on the extreme left of the signature space along with the two other signers for georgia  lyman hall and george walton .  you   ll notice they crowded their names although there   s plenty of room above and below .  in fact  the capital g of gwinnett runs down into practical contact with hall   s name .  so we won   t try to separate them .  we   ll get them all .  can you handle that .      have you ever seen a bloodhound that looked happy .  well  my uncle otto managed it .   a spot of brighter light centered about the names of the three georgian signers .   my uncle otto said  a little breathlessly     i have this never tried before .         what .     i screamed .  now he told me .      it would have too much energy required .  i did not wish the university to inquire what was in here going on .  but don   t worry .  my mathematics cannot wrong be .      i prayed silently that his mathematics not wrong were .   the light grew brighter and there was a humming that filled the laboratory with raucous noise .  my uncle otto turned a knob  then another  then a third .     do you remember the time a few weeks back when all of upper manhattan and the bronx were without electricity for twelve hours because of the damndest overload cut off in the main power house .  i won   t say we did that  because i am in no mood to be sued for damages .  but i will say this  the electricity went off when my uncle otto turned the third knob .   inside the lab  all the lights went nut and i found my self on the floor with a terrific ringing in my ears .  my uncle otto was sprawled across me .   we worked each other to our feet and my uncle otto found a flashlight .   he howled his anguish .     fused .  fused .  my machine in ruins is .  it has to destruction devoted been .         but the signatures .     i yelled at him .     did you get them .      he stopped in mid cry .     i haven   t looked .      he looked  and i closed my eyes .  the disappearance of a hundred thousand dollars is not an easy thing to watch .   he cried     ah  ha .     and i opened my eyes quickly .  he had a square of parchment in his hand some two inches on a side .  it had three signatures on it and the top one was that of rutton gwinnett .   now  mind you  the signature was absolutely genuine .  it was no fake .  there wasn   t an atom of fraud about the whole transaction .  i want that understood .  lying on my uncle otto   s broad hand was a signature indited with the georgian hand of rutton gwinnett himself on the authentic parchment of the honest to god  real life declaration of independence .     it was decided that my uncle otto would travel down to washington with the parchment scrap .  i was unsatisfactory for the purpose .  i was a lawyer .  i would be expected to know too much .  he was merely a scientific genius  and wasn   t expected to know anything .  besides  who could suspect dr .  otto schlemmelmayer of anything but the most transparent honesty .   we spent a week arranging our story .  i bought a book for the occasion  an old history of colonial georgia  in a secondhand shop .  my uncle otto was to take it with him and claim that he had found a document among its leaves  a letter to the continental congress in the name of the state of georgia .  he shrugged his shoulders at it and held it out over a bunsen flame .  why should a physicist be interested in letters .  then he became aware of the peculiar odor it gave off as it burned and the slowness with which it was consumed .  he beat out the flames but saved only the piece with the signatures .  he looked at it and the name button gwinnett had stirred a slight fiber of memory .   he had the story cold .  i burnt the edges of the parchment so that the lowest name  that of george walton  was slightly singed .      it will make it more realistic     i explained .     of course  a signature  without a letter above it  loses value  but here we have three signatures  all signers .   my uncle otto was thoughtful .     and if they compare the signatures with those on the declaration and notice it is all even microscopically the same  won   t they fraud suspect .      certainly .  but what can they do .  the parchment is authentic .  the ink is authentic .  the signatures are authentic .  they   ll have to concede that .  no matter how they suspect something queer  they can   t prove anything .  can they conceive of reaching through time for it .  in fact  i hope they do try to make a fuss about it .  the publicity will boost the price .      the last phrase made my uncle otto laugh .   the next day he took the train to washington with visions of flutes in his head .  long flutes  short flutes  bass flutes  flute tremolos  massive flutes  micro flutes  flutes for the individual and flutes for the orchestra .  a world of flutes for mind drawn music .      remember     his last words were     the machine i have no money to rebuild .  this must work .      and i said     uncle otto  it can   t miss .      ha .   he was back in a week .  i had made long distance calls each day and each day he told me they were investigating .   investigating .   well  wouldn   t you investigate .  but what good would it do them .   i was at the station waiting for him .  he was expressionless .  i didn   t dare ask anything in public .  i wanted to say     well  yes or no .     but i thought  let him speak .   i took him to my office .  i offered him a cigar and a drink .  i hid my hands under the desk but that only made the desk shake too  so i put them in my pocket and shook all over .   he said     they investigated .         sure .  i told you they would .  ha  ha  ha .  ha  ha .      my uncle otto took a slow drag at the cigar .  he said     the man at the bureau of documents came to me and said     professor schlemmelmayer     he said     you are the victim of a clever fraud .     i said     so .  and how can it a fraud be .  the signature a forgery is .     so he answered     it certainly doesn   t look like a forgery  but it must be .        and why must it be .     i asked .      my uncle otto put down his cigar  put down his drink  and leaned across the desk toward me .  he had me so in suspense  i leaned forward toward him  so in a way i deserved everything i got .      exactly     i babbled     why must it be .  they can   t prove a thing wrong with it  because it   s genuine .  why must it he a fraud  eh .  why     my uncle otto   s voice was terrifyingly saccharine .  he said     we got the parchment from the past .         yes .  yes .  you know we did .        over a hundred fifty years in the past .  you said            and a hundred fifty years ago the parchment on which the declaration of independence was written pretty new was .  no .      i was beginning to get it  but not fast enough .   my uncle otto   s voice switched gears and became a dull  throbbing roar     and if button gwinnett in      died  you godforsaken dunderlump  how can an authentic signature of his on a new piece of parchment be found .      after that it was just a case of the whole world rushing backward and forward about me .   i expect to be on my feet soon .  i still ache  but the doctors tell me no bones were broken .   still  my uncle otto didn   t have to make me swallow the damned parchment .              if i had hoped to be recognized as a master of humor as a result of these stories  i think i failed .   l .  sprague de camp  one of the most successful writers of humorous science fiction and fantasy  had this to say about me in his science fiction handbook  hermitage house         which  as you see  appeared not long after these  in my opinion  successful forays into humor      asimov is a stoutish  youngish looking man with wavy brown hair  blue eyes  and a bouncing  jovial  effervescent manner  esteemed among his friends for his generous  warm hearted nature .  extremely sociable  articulate  and witty  he is a perfect toastmaster .  this vein of oral humor contrasts with the sobriety of his stories .      sobriety .   on the other hand  twelves  sic  years later  groff conklin included button  button  in his anthology    above the niqht  dell        and he said  in part     when the good doctor .  .  .  decides to take a day off and be funny  he can be very funny indeed .  .  .  .      now  although groff and sprague were both very dear friends of mine  groff is now dead  alas   there is no question but that in this particular case i think groff shows good taste and sprague is nowhere .   incidentally  before i pass on i had better explain that    generous  warm hearted nature    crack by sprague  which may puzzle those who know me as a vicious  rotten brute .   sprague   s prejudice in my favor is  i think  all based on a single incident .   it was back in       when sprague and i were working at the philadelphia navy yard .  it was wartime and we needed badges to get in .  anyone who forgot his badge had to buck the bureaucracy for an hour to get a temporary  was docked an hour   s pay  and had the heinous misdeed entered on his record .   as we walked up to the gate on this particular day sprague turned a pastel shade of green and said .     i forgot my badge .     he was up for a lieutenancy in the navy and he was afraid that even a slight flaw in his civilian record might have an adverse effect on the whole thing .   well  i wasn   t up for anything at all  and i was so used to being sent to the principal   s office during my school days that being yelled at by the authorities had no terrors for me .   so i handed him my badge and said     go in  sprague  and pin this on your lapel .  they   ll never look at it .     he went in  and they didn   t  and i reported myself as having forgotten my badge and took my lumps .   sprague has never forgotten .  to this day  he goes around telling people what a great guy i am  despite the fact that everyone just stares at him in disbelief .  that one impulsive action has given rise to a lifetime of fervent pro asimov propaganda .  cast your bread upon the waters     but  let   s move onward .       the monkey s finger        yes .  yes .  yes .  yes .  yes .  yes .  yes .  yes .  yes .  yes yes .  yes .  yes .  yes .  yes .  yes     said marmie tallinn  in sixteen different inflections and pitches  while the adam s apple in his long neck bobbed convulsively .  he was a science fiction writer .      no     said lemuel hoskins  staring stonily through his steel rimmed glasses .  he was a science fiction editor .      then you won t accept a scientific test .  you won t listen to me .  i m outvoted  eh .     marmie lifted himself on his toes  dropped down  repeated the process a few times  and breathed heavily .  his dark hair was matted into tufts  where fingers had clutched .      one to sixteen     said hoskins .      look     said marmie     what makes you always right .  what makes me always wrong .         marmie  face it .  we re each judged in our own way .  if magazine circulation were to drop  i d be a flop .  i d be out on my ear .  the president of space publishers would ask no questions  believe me .  he would just look at the figures .  but circulation doesn t go down  it s going up .  that makes me a good editor .  and as for you when editors accept you  you re a talent .  when they reject you  you re a bum .  at the moment  you are a bum .         there are other editors  you know .  you re not the only one .     marmie held up his hands  fingers outspread .     can you count .  that s how many science fiction magazines on the market would gladly take a tallinn yarn  sight unseen .         gesundheit     said hoskins .      look     marmie s voice sweetened     you wanted two changes  right .  you wanted an introductory scene with the battle in space .  well  i gave that to you .  it s right here .     he waved the manuscript under hoskin s nose and hoskin moved away as though at a bad smell .      but you also wanted the scene on the spaceship s hull cut into with a flashback into the interior     went on marmie     and that you can t get .  if i make that change  i ruin an ending which  as it stands  has pathos and depth and feeling .      editor hoskins sat back in his chair and appealed to his secretary  who throughout had been quietly typing .  she was used to these scenes .   hoskins said     you hear that  miss kane .  he talks of pathos  depth  and feeling .  what does a writer know about such things .  look  if you insert the flashback  you increase the suspense  you tighten the story  you make it more valid .         how do i make it more valid .     cried marmie in anguish .     you mean to say that having a bunch of fellows in a spaceship start talking politics and sociology when they re liable to be blown up makes it more valid .  oh  my god .         there s nothing else you can do .  if you wait till the climax is past and then discuss your politics and sociology  the reader will go to sleep on you .         but i m trying to tell you that you re wrong and i can prove it .  what s the use of talking when i ve arranged a scientific experiment         what scientific experiment .     hoskins appealed to his secretary again .     how do you like that  miss kane .  he thinks he s one of his own characters .         it so happens i know a scientist .         who .         dr .  arndt torgesson  professor of psychodynamics at columbia .         never heard of him .         i suppose that means a lot     said marmie  with contempt .     you never heard of him .  you never heard of einstein until your writers started mentioning him in their stories .         very humorous .  a yuk .  what about this torgesson .         he s worked out a system for determining scientifically  the value of a piece of writing .  it s a tremendous piece of work .  it s it s          and it s secret .         certainly it s secret .  he s not a science fiction professor .  in science fiction  when a man thinks up a theory  he announces it to the newspapers right away .  in real life  that s not done .  a scientist spends years on experimentation sometimes before going into print .  publishing is a serious thing .         then how do you know about it .  just a question .         it so happens that dr .  torgesson is a fan of mine .  he happens to like my stories .  he happens to think i m the best fantasy writer in the business .          and he shows you his work .         that s right .  i was counting on you being stubborn about this yam and i ve asked him to run an experiment for us .  he said he would do it if we don t talk about it .  he said it would be an interesting experiment .  he said         what s so secret about it .         well     marmie hesitated .     look  suppose i told you he had a monkey that could type hamlet out of its head .      hoskins stared at marmie in alarm .     what are you working up here  a practical joke .     he turned to miss kane .     when a writer writes science fiction for ten years he just isn t safe without a personal cage .      miss kane maintained a steady typing speed .   marmie said     you heard me  a common monkey  even funnier looking than the average editor .  i made an appointment for this afternoon .  are you coming with me or not .         of course not .  you think i d abandon a stack of manuscripts this high    and he indicated his larynx with a cutting motion of the hand    for your stupid jokes .  you think i   ll play straight man for you .         if this is in any way a joke  hoskins  i   ll stand you dinner in any restaurant you name .  miss kane s the witness .      hoskins sat back in his chair .     you   ll buy me dinner .  you  marmaduke tallinn  new york s most widely known tapeworm on credit  are going to pick up a  check .      marmie winced  not at the reference to his agility in  overlooking a dinner check  but at the mention of his name in all its horrible trysyllabicity .  he said     i repeat .  dinner on me wherever you want and whatever you want .  steaks  mushrooms  breast of guinea hen  martian alligator  anything .      hoskins stood up and plucked his hat from the top of the filing cabinet .      for a chance     he said     to see you unfold some of the old style  large size dollar bills you ve been keeping in the false heel of your left shoe since nineteen two eight  i d walk to boston .   .  .  .      dr .  torgesson was honored .  he shook hoskin s hand warmly and said     i ve been reading space yarns ever since i came to this country  mr .  hoskins .  it is an excellent magazine .  i am particularly fond of mr .  tallinn s stories .         you hear .     asked marmie .     i hear .  marmie says you have a monkey with talent  professor .         yes     torgesson said     but of course this must be confidential .  i am not yet ready to publish  and premature publicity could be my professional ruin .         this is strictly under the editorial hat  professor .         good  good .  sit down  gentlemen  sit down .     he paced the floor before them .     what have you told mr .  hoskins about my work  marmie .         not a thing  professor .         so .  well  mr .  hoskins  as the editor of a science fiction magazine  i don t have to ask you if you know anything about cybernetics .      hoskins allowed a glance of concentrated intellect to ooze out past his steel rims .  he said     ah  yes .  computing machines m . i . t .  norbert weiner     he mumbled some more .      yes .  yes .     torgesson paced faster .     then you must know that chess playing computers have been constructed on cybernetic principles .  the rules of chess moves and the object of the game are built into its circuits .  given any position on the chess board  the machine can then compute all possible moves together with their consequence and choose that one which offers the highest probability of winning the game .  it can even be made to take the temperament of its opponent into account .         ah  yes     said hoskins  stroking his chin profoundly .   torgesson said     now imagine a similar situation in which a computing machine can be given a fragment of a literary work to which the computer can then add words from its stock of the entire vocabulary such that the greatest literary values are served .  naturally  the machine would have to be taught the significance of the various keys of a typewriter .  of course  such a computer would have to be much  much more complex than any chess player .      hoskins stirred restlessly .     the monkey  professor .  marmie mentioned a monkey .         but that is what i am coming to     said torgesson .     naturally  no machine built is sufficiently complex .  but the human brain   ah .  the human brain is itself a computing machine .  of course  i couldn t use a human brain .  the law  unfortunately  would not permit me .  but even a monkey s brain  properly managed  can do more than any machine ever constructed by man .  wait .  i ll go get little rollo .      he left the room .  hoskins waited a moment  then looked cautiously at marmie .  he said     oh  brother .      marmie said     what s the matter .         what s the matter .  the man s a phony .  tell me  marmie  where did you hire this faker .      marmie was outraged .     faker .  this is a genuine professor s office in fayerweather hall  columbia .  you recognize columbia  i hope .  you saw the statue of alma mater on    th street .  i pointed out eisenhower s office .         sure  but         and this is dr .  torgesson s office .  look at the dust .     he blew at a textbook and stirred up clouds of it .     the dust alone shows it s the real thing .  and look at the title of the book  psychodynamics of human behavior  by professor arndt rolf torgesson .         granted  marmie  granted .  there is a torgesson and this is his office .  how you knew the real guy was on vacation and how you managed to get the use of his office  i don t know .  but are you trying to tell me that this comic with his monkeys and computers is the real thing .  hah .         with a suspicious nature like yours  i can only assume  you had a very miserable  rejected type of childhood .         just the result of experience with writers  marmie .  i have my restaurant all picked out and this will cost you a pretty penny .      marmie snorted     this won t cost me even the ugliest penny you ever paid me .  quiet  he s coming back .        with the professor  and clinging to his neck  was a very melancholy capuchin monkey .      this     said torgesson     is little rollo .  say hello  rollo .      the monkey tugged at his forelock .   the professor said     he s tired  i m afraid .  now  i have a piece of his manuscript right here .      he put the monkey down and let it cling to his finger while he brought out two sheets of paper from his jacket pocket and handed them to hoskins .   hoskins read       to be or not to be  that is the question  whether  tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune  or to take arms against a host of troubles  and by opposing end them .  to die  to sleep  no more  and  by a sleep to say we        he looked up .     little rollo typed this .         not exactly .  it s a copy of what he typed .         oh  a copy .  well  little rollo doesn t know his shakespeare .  it s  to take arms against a sea of troubles .        torgesson nodded .     you are quite correct  mr .  hoskins .  shakespeare did write  sea .   but you see that s a mixed metaphor .  you don t fight a sea with arms .  you fight a host or army with arms .  rollo chose the monosyllable and typed  host .   it s one of shakespeare s rare mistakes .      hoskins said     let s see him type .         surely .     the professor trundled out a typewriter on a little table .  a wire trailed from it .  he explained     it is necessary to use an electric typewriter as otherwise the physical effort would be too great .  it is also necessary to wire little rollo to this transformer .      he did so  using as leads two electrodes that protruded an eighth of an inch through the fur on the little creature s skull .      rollo     he said     was subjected to a very delicate brain operation in which a nest of wires were connected to various regions of his brain .  we can short his voluntary activities and  in effect  use his brain simply as a computer .  i m afraid the details would be           let s see him type     said hoskins .     what would you like .      hoskins thought rapidly .     does he know chesterton s  lepanto  .         he knows nothing by heart .  his writing is purely computation .  now  you simply recite a little of the piece so that he will be able to estimate the mood and compute the consequences of the first words .      hoskins nodded  inflated his chest  and thundered     white founts falling in the courts of the sun  and the soldan of byzantium is smiling as they run .  there is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared  it stirs the forest darkness  the darkness of his beard  it curls the blood red crescent  the crescent of his lips  for the inmost sea of all the world is shaken by his ships         that s enough .     said torgesson .  there was silence as they waited .  the monkey regarded the typewriter solemnly .   torgesson said     the process takes time  of course .  little rollo has to take into account the romanticism of the poem  the slightly archaic flavor  the strong sing song rhythm  and so on .      and then a black little finger reached out and touched a key .  it was a t .      he doesn t capitalize     said the scientist     or punctuate  and his spacing isn t very reliable .  that s why i usually retype his work when he s finished .      little rollo touched an h  then an e and a y .  then  after a longish pause  he tapped the space bar .      they     said hoskins .  the words typed themselves out     they have dared the white repub lics upthe capes of italy they have dashed the adreeatic roundthe lion of the sea  and the popehas throw n his arms abroa dfor agoni and loss and called the kings of chrissndom for sords about the cross .         my god .     said hoskins .      that s the way the piece goes then .     asked torgesson .     for the love of pete .     said hoskins .      if it is  then chesterton must have done a good  consistent job .         holy smokes .     said hoskins .      you see     said marmie  massaging hoskins s shoulder     you see  you see  you see .  you see     he added .      i ll be damned     said hoskins .      now look     said marmie  rubbing his hair till it rose in clusters like a cockatoo s chest     let s get to business .  let s tackle my story .         well but         it will not be beyond little rollo s capacity     torgesson assured him .     i frequently read little rollo parts of some of the better science fiction  including some of marmie s tales .  it s amazing how some of the yarns are improved .         it s not that     said hoskins .     any monkey can write better sf than some of the hacks we ve got .  but the tallinn story is thirteen thousand words long .  it ll take forever for the monk to type it .         not at all  mr .  hoskins  not at all .  i shall read the story to him  and at the crucial point we will let him continue .      hoskins folded his arms .     then shoot .  i m ready .         i     said marmie     am more than ready .     and he folded his arms .   little rollo sat there  a furry little bundle of cataleptic misery  while dr .  torgesson s soft voice rose and fell in cadence with a spaceship battle and the subsequent struggles of earthmen captives to recapture their lost ship .   one of the characters made his way out to the spaceship hull  and dr .  torgesson followed the flamboyant events in mild rapture .  he read       .  .  . stalny froze in the silence of the eternal stars .  his aching knee tore at his consciousness as he waited for the monsters to hear the thud and        marmie yanked desperately at dr .  torgesson s sleeve .  torgesson looked up and disconnected little rollo .      that s it     said marmie .     you see  professor  it s just about here that hoskins is getting his sticky little fingers into the works .  i continue the scene outside the spaceship till stalny wins out and the ship is back in earth hands .  then i go into explanations .  hoskins wants me to break that outside scene  get back inside  halt the action for two thousand words  then get back out again .  ever hear such crud .         suppose we let the monk decide     said hoskins .   dr .  torgesson turned little rollo on  and a black shriveled finger reached hesitantly out to the typewriter .  hoskins and marmie leaned forward simultaneously  their heads coming softly together just over little rollo s brooding body .  the typewriter punched out the letter t .      t     encouraged marmie  nodding .     t     agreed hoskins .   the typewriter made an a  then went on at a more rapid rate     take action stalnee waited in helpless hor ror forair locks toyawn and suited laroos to emerge relentlessly           word for word     said marmie in raptures .     he certainly has your gooey style .         the readers like it .         they wouldn t if their average mental age wasn t     hoskins stopped .      go on     said marmie     say it .  say it .  say their iq is that of a twelve year old child and i ll quote you in every fan magazine in the country .         gentlemen     said torgesson     gentlemen .  you ll disturb little rollo .      they turned to the typewriter  which was still tapping steadily      the stars whelled in ther mightie orb its as stalnees earthbound senses insis ted the rotating ship sto od still .      the typewriter carriage whipped back to begin a new line .  marmie held his breath .  here  if anywhere  would come     and the little finger moved out and made    hoskins yelled     asterisk .         marmie muttered      asterisk .     torgesson said      asterisk .      a line of nine more asterisks followed .      that s all  brother     said hoskins .  he explained quickly to the staring torgesson     with marmie  it s a habit to use a line of asterisks when he wants to indicate a radical shift of scene .  and a radical shift of scene is exactly what i wanted .      the typewriter started a new paragraph     within the ship         turn it off  professor     said marmie .   hoskins rubbed his hands .     when do i get the revision marmie .      marmie said coolly     what revision .         you said the monk s version .         i sure did .  it s what i brought you here to see .  that little rollo is a machine  a cold  brutal  logical machine .         well .         and the point is that a good writer is not a machine .  he doesn t write with his mind  but with his heart .  his heart .     marmie pounded his chest .   hoskins groaned .     what are you doing to me  marmie .  if you give me that heart and soul of a writer routine  i ll just be forced to turn sick right here and right now .  let s keep all this on the usual i ll write anything for money basis .      marmie said     just listen to me for a minute .  little rollo corrected shakespeare .  you pointed that out for yourself .  little rollo wanted shakespeare to say   host of troubles   and he was right from his machine standpoint .  a  sea of troubles  under the circumstances is a mixed metaphor .  but don t you suppose shakespeare knew that  too .  shakespeare just happened to know when to break the rules  that s all .  little rollo is a machine that can t break the rules  but a good writer can  and must .   sea of troubles  is more impressive  it has roll and power .  the hell with the mixed metaphor .      now  when you tell me to shift the scene  you re following mechanical rules on maintaining suspense  so of course little rollo agrees with you .  but i know that i must break the rules to maintain the profound emotional impact of the ending as i see it .  otherwise i have a mechanical product that a computer can turn out .      hoskins said     but         go on     said marmie     vote for the mechanical .  say that little rollo is all the editor you ll ever be .      hoskins said  with a quiver in his throat      all right  marmie  i ll take the story as is .  no  don t give it to me  mail it .  i ve got to find a bar  if you don t mind .      he forced his hat down on his head and turned to leave .  torgesson called after him .     don t tell anyone about little rollo  please .      the parting answer floated back over a slamming door     do you think i m crazy .   .  .  .      marmie rubbed his hands ecstatically when he was sure hoskins was gone .      brains  that s what it was     he said  and probed one finger as deeply into his temple as it would go .     this sale i enjoyed .  this sale  professor  is worth all the rest i ve ever made .  all the rest of them together .     he collapsed joyfully on the nearest chair .   torgesson lifted little rollo to his shoulder .  he said mildly     but  marmaduke  what would you have done if little rollo had typed your version instead .      a took of grievance passed momentarily over marmie s face .     well  damn it     he said     that s what i thought it was going to do .                 in the monkey s finger  by the way  the writer and editor were modeled on a real pair  arguing over a real story in a real way .   the story involved was c chute  which had appeared in the october      galaxy  after the argument  and which was eventually included in my book nightfall and other stories .  i was the writer  of course  and horace gold was the editor .   though the argument and the story are authentic  the people are caricatured .  i am nothing at all like the writer in the story and horace is certainly nothing at all like the editor in the story .  horace has his own peculiarities which are far more interesting than the ones i made  up for fictional purposes  and so have i but never mind that .   of all the stories i have written that have appeared once and then never again  this next is the one i talk about most .  i have discussed it in dozens of talks and mentioned it in print occasionally  for a very good reason which i ll come to later .   in april      i was in chicago .  i m not much of a traveler and that was the first time i was ever in chicago  and i have returned since then only once   . i was there to attend an american chemical society convention at which i was supposed to present a small paper .  that was little fun  so i thought i would liven things up by going to evanston  a northern suburb  and visiting the offices of universe science fiction .   this magazine was then edited by bea mahaffey  an extraordinarily good looking young woman .   the way i usually put it is that science fiction writers voted her  two years running  the editor to whom they would most like to submit .    when i arrived in the office on april          bea greeted me with great glee and at once asked why i had not brought a story for her with me .      you want a story .     i said  basking in her beauty .   .  i ll write you a story .  bring me a typewriter .      actually  i was just trying to impress her  hoping that she would throw herself into my arms in a spasm of wild adoration .  she didn t .  she brought me a typewriter .   i had to come through .  since the task of climbing mount everest was much in the news those days  men  had been trying to scale it for thirty years and the seventh attempt to do so had just failed  i thought rapidly and wrote everest  .   bea read it  liked it  and offered me thirty dollars  which i accepted with alacrity .  i promptly spent half of it on a fancy dinner for the two of us  and labored   with so much success to be charming  debonair  and suave that the waitress said to me  longingly  that she wished her son in law were like me .   that seemed hopeful and with a light heart i took bea home to her apartment .  i am not sure what i had in mind  but if i did have anything in mind that was not completely proper  surely not .   i was foiled .  bea managed to get into that apartment  leaving me standing in the hallway  without my ever having seen the door open .       everest     in      they were about ready to give up trying to climb mount everest .  it was the photographs that kept them going .   as photographs go  they weren t much  fuzzy  streaked  and with just dark blobs against the white to be interested in .  but those dark blobs were living creatures .  the men swore to it .   i said     what the hell  they ve been talking about creatures skidding along the everest glaciers for forty years .  it s about time we did something about it .      jimmy robbons  pardon me  james abram robbons  was the one who pushed me into that position .  he was always nuts on mountain climbing  you see .  he was the one who knew all about how the tibetans wouldn t go near everest because it was the mountain of the gods .  he could quote me every mysterious manlike footprint ever reported in the ice twenty five thousand feet up  he knew by heart every tall story about the spindly white creatures  speeding along the crags just over the last heart breaking camp which the climbers had managed to establish .   it s good to have one enthusiastic creature of the sort at planetary survey headquarters .   the last photographs put bite into his words  though .  after all  you might just barely think they were men .   jimmy said     look  boss  the point isn t that they re there  the point is that they move fast .  look at that figure .  it s blurred .         the camera might have moved .         the crag here is sharp enough .  and the men swear it was running .  imagine the metabolism it must have to run at that oxygen pressure .  look  boss  would you have believed in deep sea fish if you d never heard of them .  you have fish which are looking for new niches in environment which they can exploit  so they go deeper and deeper into the abyss until one day they find they can t return .   they ve adapted so thoroughly they can live only under tons of pressure .         well           damn it  can t you reverse the picture .  creatures can be forced up a mountain  can t they .  they can learn to stick it out in thinner air and colder temperatures .  they can live on moss or on occasional birds  just as the deep sea fish in the last analysis live on the upper fauna that slowly go filtering down .  then  someday  they find they can t go down again .  i don t even say they re men .  they can be chamois or mountain goats or badgers or anything .      i said stubbornly     the witnesses said they were vaguely manlike  and the reported footprints are certainly manlike .         or bearlike     said jimmy .     you can t tell .      so that s when i said     it s about time we did something about it .      jimmy shrugged and said     they ve been trying to climb mount everest for forty years .     and he shook his head .      for gossake     i said .      all you mountain climbers are nuts .  that s for sure .  you re not interested in getting to the top .  you re just interested in getting to the top in a certain way .  it s about time we stopped fooling around with picks  ropes  camps  and all the paraphernalia of the gentlemen s club that sends suckers up the slopes every five years or so .         what are you getting at .         they invented the airplane in       you know .         you mean fly over mount everest .     he said it the way an english lord would say     shoot a fox .     or an angler would say     use worms .         yes     i said     fly over mount everest and let someone down on the top .  why not .         he won t live long .  the fellow you let down  i mean .         why not .     i asked again .     you drop supplies and oxygen tanks  and the fellow wears a spacesuit .  naturally .      it took time to get the air force to listen and to agree to send a plane and by that time jimmy robbons had swiveled his mind to the point where he volunteered to be the one to land on everest s peak .     after all     he said in a half whisper     i d be the first man ever to stand there .        that s the beginning of the story .  the story itself can be told very simply  and in far fewer words .   the plane waited two weeks during the best part of the year  as far as everest was concerned  that is  for a siege of only moderately nasty flying weather  then took off .  they made it .  the pilot reported by radio to a listening group exactly what the top of mount everest looked like when seen from above and then he described exactly how jimmy robbons looked as his parachute got smaller and smaller .   then another blizzard broke and the plane barely made it back to base and it was another two weeks before the weather was bearable again .   and all that time jimmy was on the roof of the world by himself and i hated myself for a murderer .   the plane went back up two weeks later to see if they could spot his body .  i don t know what good it would have done if they had  but that s the human race for you .  how many dead in the last war .  who can count that high .  but money or anything else is no object to the saving of one life  or even the recovering of one body .   they didn t find his body  but they did find a smoke signal  curling up in the thin air and whipping away in the gusts .  they let down a grapple and jimmy came up  still in his spacesuit  looking like hell  but definitely alive .     the p . s .  to the story involves my visit to the hospital last week to see him .  he was recovering very slowly .  the doctors said shock  they said exhaustion  but jimmy s eyes said a lot more .   i said     how about it  jimmy  you haven t talked to the reporters  you haven t talked to the government .  all right how about talking to me .         i ve got nothing to say     he whispered .     sure you have     i said .     you lived on top of mount everest during a two week blizzard .  you didn t do that by yourself  not with all the supplies we dumped along with you .  who helped you  jimmy boy .      i guess he knew there was no use trying to bluff .  or maybe he was anxious to get it off his mind .   he said     they re intelligent  boss .  they compressed air for me .  they set up a little power pack to keep me warm .  they set up the smoke signal when they spotted the airplane coming back .         i see .     i didn t want to rush him .     it s like we thought .  they ve adapted to everest life .  they can t come down the slopes .         no  they can t .  and we can t go up the slopes .  even if the weather didn t stop us  they would .         they sound like kindly creatures  so why should they object .  they helped you .         they have nothing against us .  they spoke to me  you know .  telepathy .      i frowned .     well  then .         but they don t intend to be interfered with .  they re watching us  boss .  they ve got to .  we ve got atomic power .  we re about to have rocket ships .  they re worried about us .  and everest is the only place they can watch us from .      i frowned deeper .  he was sweating and his hands were shaking .   i said     easy  boy .  take it easy .  what on earth are these creatures .      and he said     what do you suppose would be so adapted to thin air and subzero cold that everest would be the only livable place on earth to them .  that s the whole point .  they re nothing at all on earth .  they re martians .      and that s it .              and now let me explain the reason i frequently discuss  everest .  naturally  i did not actually believe that there were martians on mount everest or that anything would long delay the eventual conquest of the mountain .  i just thought that people would have the decency to refrain from climbing it until the story was published .   but no .  on may           less than two months after i had written and sold everest  edmund hillary and tenzing norgay stood upon everest s highest point and saw neither martians nor abominable snowmen .   of course  universe might have sacrificed thirty dollars and left the story unpublished  or i might have offered to buy back the story .  neither of us made the gesture and everest appeared in the december      issue of universe .   since i am frequently called on to discuss the future of man  i can t help using everest to point out what an expert futurist i am .  after all  i predicted that mount everest would never be climbed  five months after it was climbed .     nowadays it is quite fashionable to publish anthologies of original science fiction stories  and i rather disapprove of this .  it drains off some of the stories and readers that might otherwise go to the magazines .  i don t want that to happen .  i think that magazines are essential to science fiction .   is my feeling born of mere nostalgia .  does it arise out of the memory of what science fiction magazines meant to me in my childhood and of how they gave me my start as a writer .  in part  yes  i suppose  but in part it is the result of an honest feeling that they do playa vital role .   where can a young writer get a start .  magazines  appearing six or twelve times a year  simply must have stories .  an anthology can delay publication till the desired stories come in  a magazine cannot .  driven by unswervable deadlines  a magazine must accept an occasional substandard story  and an occasional young writer gets a start while he is still perhaps of only marginal quality .  that was how i got my start  in fact .   it means  to be sure  that the reader is subjected to an occasional amateurish story in the magazine  but the amateur writer who wrote it gets enough encouragement to continue working and to become  just possibly  a great writer .   when the anthologies of original science fiction first appeared  however  they were novelties .  i never really thought they would come to much  and had no feeling of contributing to an impending doom when i wrote for them .  in fact  since they paid better than the magazines usually did  i felt good about writing for them .   the first of the breed was new tales of space and time  edited by raymond j .  healy  henry holt          and for it i wrote in a good cause a story that was eventually included in nightfall and other stories .   a few years later  august derleth was editing an anthology of originals  and for it i wrote the pause .       the pause     the white powder was confined within a thin walled  transparent capsule .  the capsule was heat sealed into a double strip of parafilm .  along that strip of parafilm were other capsules at six inch intervals .   the strip moved .  each capsule in the course of events rested for one minute on a metal jaw immediately beneath a mica window .  on another portion of the face of the radiation counter a number clicked out upon an unrolling cylinder of paper .  the capsule moved on  the next took its place .   the number printed at      p . m .  was     .  a minute later     appeared .  a minute later      .  a minute later      .  a minute later      .  a minute later      .  a minute later      .  a minute later      .  a minute later      .  a minute later      .     shortly after   p . m .  mr .  alexander johannison passed by the counter and the comer of one eye stubbed itself over the row of figures .  two steps past the counter he stopped and returned .   he ran the paper cylinder backward  then restored its position and said     nuts .      he said it with vehemence .  he was tall and thin  with big knuckled hands  sandy hair  and light eyebrows .  he looked tired and  at the moment  perplexed .   gene damelli wandered his way with the same easy carelessness he brought to all his actions .  he was dark  hairy  and on the short side .  his nose had once been broken and it made him look curiously unlike the popular conception of the nuclear physicist .   damelli said     my damned geiger won t pick up a thing  and i m not in the mood to go over the wiring .  got a cigarette .      johannison held out a pack .     what about the others in the building .         i haven t tried them  but i guess they haven t all gone .         why not .  my counter isn t registering either .         no kidding .  you see .  all the money invested  too .  it doesn t mean a thing .  let s step out for a coke .      johannison said with greater vehemence than he intended     no .  i m going to see george duke .  i want to see his machine .  if it s off      damelli tagged along .     it won t be off  alex .  don t be an ass .      george duke listened to johannison and watched him disapprovingly over rimless glasses .  he was an old young man with little hair and less patience .   he said     i m busy .         too busy to tell me if your rig is working  for heaven s sake .      duke stood up .     oh  hell  when does a man have time to work around here .     his slide rule fell with a thud over a scattering of ruled paper as he rounded his desk .   he stepped to a cluttered lab table and lifted the heavy gray leaden top from a heavier gray leaden container .  he reached in with a two foot long pair of tongs  and took out a small silvery cylinder .   duke said grimly     stay where you are .      johannison didn t need the advice .  he kept his distance .  he had not been exposed to any abnormal dosage of radioactivity over the past month but there was no sense getting any closer than necessary to    hot    cobalt .   still using the tongs  and with arms held well away from his body  duke brought the shining bit of metal that contained the concentrated radioactivity up to the window of his counter .  at two feet  the counter should have chattered its head off .  it didn t .   duke said     guk .     and let the cobalt container drop .  he scrabbled madly for it and lifted it against the window again .  closer .   there was no sound .  the dots of light on the scaler did  not show .  numbers did not step up and up .   johannison said     not even background noise .     damelli said     holy jumping jupiter .      duke put the cobalt tube back into its leaden sheath  as gingerly as ever  and stood there  glaring .   johannison burst into bill everard s office  with damelli at his heels .  he spoke for excited minutes  his bony hands knuckly white on everard s shiny desk .  everard listened  his smooth  fresh shaven cheeks turning pink and his plump neck bulging out a bit over his stiff  white collar .   everard looked at damelli and pointed a questioning thumb at johannison .  damelli shrugged  bringing his hands forward  palms upward  and corrugating his forehead .   everard said     i don t see how they can all go wrong .         they have  that s all     insisted johannison .     they all went dead at about two o clock .  that s over an hour ago now and none of them is back in order .  even george duke can t do anything about it .  i m telling you  it isn t the counters .         you re saying it is .         i m saying they re not working .  but that s not their fault .  there s nothing for them to work on .         what do you mean .         i mean there isn t any radioactivity in this place .  in this whole building .  nowhere .         i don t believe you .         listen  if a hot cobalt cartridge won t start up a counter  maybe there s something wrong with every counter we try .  but when that same cartridge won t discharge a gold leaf electroscope and when it won t even fog a photographic film  then there s something wrong with the cartridge .         all right     said everard     so it s a dud .  somebody made a mistake and never filled it .         the same cartridge was working this morning  but never mind that .  maybe cartridges can get switched somehow .  but i got that hunk of pitchblende from our display box on the fourth floor and that doesn t register either .  you re not going to tell me that someone forgot to put the uranium in it .      everard rubbed his ear .     what do you think  damelli .      damelli shook his head .     i don t know  boss .  wish i did .      johannison said     it s not the time for thinking .  it s a time for doing .  you ve got to call washington .         what about .     asked everard .     about the a bomb supply .         what .         that might be the answer  boss .  look  someone has figured out a way to stop radioactivity  all of it .  it might be blanketing the country  the whole u . s . a .  if that s being done  it can only be to put our a bombs out of commission .  they don t know where we keep them  so they have to blank out the nation .  and if that s right  it means an attack is due .  any minute  maybe .  use the phone  boss .      everard s hand reached for the phone .  his eyes and johannison s met and locked .   he said into the mouthpiece     an outside call  please .        it was five minutes to four .  everard put down the phone .      was that the commissioner .     asked johannison .      yes     said everard .  he was frowning .      all right .  what did he say .          son      said everard     he said to me   what a bombs .       johannison looked bewildered .     what the devil does he mean   what a bombs .   i know .  they ve already found out they ve got duds on their hands  and they won t talk .  not even to us .  now what .         now nothing     said everard .  he sat back in his chair and glowered at the physicist .      alex  i know the kind of strain you re under  so i m not going to blow up about this .  what bothers me is  how did you get me started on this nonsense .      johannison paled .     this isn t nonsense .  did the commissioner say it was .         he said i was a fool  and so i am .  what the devil do you mean coming here with your stories about a bombs .  what are a bombs .  i never heard of them .         you never heard of atom bombs .  what is this .  a gag .         i never heard of them .  it sounds like something from a comic strip .      johannison turned to damelli  whose olive complexion had seemed to deepen with worry .     tell him  gene .      damelli shook his head .     leave me out of this .         all right .     johannison leaned forward  looking at the line of books in the shelves about everard s head .     i don t know what this is all about  but i can go along with it .  where s glasstone .         right there     said everard .      no .  not the textbook of physical chemistry .  i want his sourcebook on atomic energy .         never heard of it .         what are you talking about .  it s been here in your shelf since i ve been here .         never heard of it     said everard stubbornly .      i suppose you haven t heard of kamen s radioactive tracers in biology either .         no .      johannison shouted     all right .  let s use glasstone s textbook then .  it will do .      he brought down the thick book and flipped the pages .  first once  then a second time .  he frowned and looked at the copyright page .  it said  third edition       .  he went through the first two chapters page by page .  it was there  atomic structure  quantum numbers  electrons and their shells  transition series but no radioactivity  nothing about that .   he turned to the table of elements on the inside front cover .  it took him only a few seconds to see that there were only eighty one listed  the eighty one nonradioactive ones .   johannison s throat felt bricky dry .  he said huskily to everard     i suppose you never heard of uranium .         what s that .     asked everard coldly .      a trade name .     desperately  johannison dropped glasstone and reached for the handbook of chemistry and physics .  he used the index .  he looked up radioactive series  uranium  plutonium  isotopes .  he found only the last .  with fumbling  jittery fingers he turned to the table of isotopes .  just a glance .  only the stable isotopes were listed .   he said pleadingly     all right .  i give up .  enough s enough .  you ve set up a bunch of fake books just to get a rise out of me  haven t you .     he tried to smile .   everard stiffened .     don t be a fool  johannison .  you d better go home .  see a doctor .         there s nothing wrong with me .         you may not think so  but there is .  you need a vacation  so take one .  damelli  do me a favor .  get him into a cab and see that he gets home .      johannison stood irresolute .  suddenly he screamed     then what are all the counters in this place for .  what do they do .         i don t know what you mean by counters .  if you mean computers  they re here to solve our problems for us .      johannison pointed to a plaque on the wall .     all right  then .  see those initials .  a .  e .  c .  atomic .  energy .  commission .     he spaced the words  staccato .   everard pointed in turn .      air .  experimental .  commission .  get him home  damelli .      johannison turned to damelli when they reached the sidewalk .  urgently he whispered     listen  gene  don t be a setup for that guy .  everard s sold out .  they got to him some way .  imagine them setting up the faked books and trying to make me think i m crazy .         you heard him .  he never heard of a bombs .  uranium s a trade name .  how can he be all right .         if it comes to that  i never heard of a bombs or uranium .      he lifted a finger .     taxi .     it whizzed by .   johannison got rid of the gagging sensation .     gene .  you were there when the counters quit .  you were there when the pitchblende went dead .  you came with me to everard to get the thing straightened out .         if you want the straight truth  alex  you said you had something to discuss with the boss and you asked me to come along  and that s all i know about it .  nothing went wrong as far as i know  and what the devil would we be doing with this pitchblende .  we don t use any tar in the place .   taxi .      a cab drew up to the curb .   damelli opened the door  motioned johannison in .  johannison entered  then  with red eyed fury  fumed  snatched the door out of damelli s hand  slammed it closed  and shouted an address at the cab driver .  he leaned out the window as the cab pulled away  leaving damelli stranded and staring .   johannison cried     tell everard it won t work .  i m wise to all of you .      he fell back into the upholstery  exhausted .  he was sure damelli had heard the address he gave .  would they get to the fbi first with some story about a nervous breakdown .  would they take everard s word against his .  they couldn t deny the stopping of the radioactivity .  they couldn t deny the faked books .   but what was the good of it .  an enemy attack was on its way and men like everard and damelli how rotten with treason was the country .   he stiffened suddenly .     driver .     he cried .  then louder     driver .      the man at the wheel did not turn around .  the traffic passed smoothly by them .   johannison tried to struggle up from his seat  but his head was swimming .      driver .     he muttered .  this wasn t the way to the fbi .  he was being taken home .  but how did the driver know where he lived .   a planted driver  of course .  he could scarcely see and there was a roaring in his ears .   lord  what organization .  there was no use fighting .  he blacked out .     he was moving up the walk toward the small  two story  brick fronted house in which mercedes and he lived .  he didn t remember getting out of the cab .   he fumed .  there was no taxicab in sight .  automatically  he felt for his wallet and keys .  they were there .  nothing had been touched .   mercedes was at the door  waiting .  she didn t seem surprised at his return .  he looked at his watch quickly .  it was nearly an hour before his usual homecoming .   he said     mercy  we ve got to get out of here and      she said huskily     i know all about it  alex .  come in .     she looked like heaven to him .  straight hair  a little on the blond side  parted in the middle and drawn into a horse tail  wide set blue eyes with that slight oriental tilt  full lips  and little ears set close to the head .  johannison s eyes devoured her .   but he could see she was doing her best to repress a certain tension .   he said     did everard call you .  or damelli .     she said     we have a visitor .      he thought  they ve got to her .   he might snatch her out of the doorway .  they would run  try to make it to safety .  but how could they .  the visitor would be standing in the shadows of the hallway .  it would be a sinister man  he imagined  with a thick  brutal voice  and foreign accent  standing there with a hand in his jacket pocket and a bulge there that was bigger than his hand .   numbly he stepped inside .      in the living room     said mercedes .  a smile flashed momentarily across her face .     i think it s all right .      the visitor was standing .  he had an unreal look about him  the unreality of perfection .  his face and body were flawless and carefully devoid of individuality .  he might have stepped off a billboard .   his voice had the cultured and unimpassioned sound of the professional radio announcer .  it was entirely free of accent .   he said     it was quite troublesome getting you home  dr .  johannison .      johannison said     whatever it is  whatever you want  i   m not cooperating .      mercedes broke in .     no  alex  you don t understand .  we ve been talking .  he says all radioactivity has been stopped .         yes  it has  and how i wish this collar ad could tell me how it was done .  look here  you  are you an american .         you still don t understand  alex     said his wife .     it s stopped all over the world .  this man isn t from anywhere on earth .  don t look at me like that  alex .  it s true .  i know it s true .  look at him .      the visitor smiled .  it was a perfect smile .  he said     this body in which i appear is carefully built up according to specification  but it is only matter .  it s under complete control .     he held out a hand and the skin vanished .  the muscles  the straight tendons  and crooked veins were exposed .  the walls of the veins disappeared and blood flowed smoothly without the necessity of containment .  all dissolved to the appearance of smooth gray bone .  that went also .   then all reappeared .   johannison muttered     hypnotism .         not at all     said the visitor  calmly .   johannison said     where are you from .      the visitor said     that s hard to explain .  does it matter .         i ve got to understand what s going on     cried johannison .     can t you see that .         yes  i can .  it s why i m here .  at this moment i am speaking to a hundred and more of your people all over your planet .  in different bodies  of course  since different segments of your people have different preferences and standards as far as bodily appearance is concerned .      fleetingly  johannison wondered if he was mad after all .  he said      are you from from mars .  any place like that .  are you taking over .  is this war .         you see     said the visitor     that sort of attitude is what we re trying to correct .  your people are sick  dr .  johannison  very sick .  for tens of thousands of your years we have known that your particular species has great possibilities .  it has been a great disappointment to us that your development has taken a pathological pathway .  definitely pathological .     he shook his head .   mercedes interrupted     he told me before you came that he was trying to cure us .         who asked him .     muttered johannison .  the visitor only smiled .  he said     i was assigned the job a long time ago  but such illnesses are always hard to treat .  for one thing  there is the difficulty in communication .         we re communicating     said johannison stubbornly .     yes .  in a manner of speaking  we are .  i m using your concepts  your code system .  it s quite inadequate .  i couldn t even explain to you the true nature of the disaster of your species .  by your concepts  the closest approach i can make is that it is a disease of the spirit .         huh .         it s a kind of social ailment that is very ticklish to handle .  that s why i ve hesitated for so long to attempt a direct cure .  it would be sad if  through accident  so gifted a potentiality as that of your race were lost to us .  what i ve tried to do for millennia has been to work indirectly through the few individuals in each generation who had natural immunity to the disease .  philosophers  moralists  warriors  and politicians .  all those who had a glimpse of world brotherhood .  all those who           all right .  you failed .  let it go at that .  now suppose you tell me about your people  not mine .         what can i tell you that you would understand .         where are you from .  begin with that .         you have no proper concept .  i m not from anywhere in the yard .         what yard .         in the universe  i mean .  i m from outside the universe .      mercedes interrupted again  leaning forward .      alex  don t you see what he means .  suppose you landed on the new guinea coast and talked to some natives through television somehow .  i mean to natives who had never seen or heard of anyone outside their tribe .  could you explain how television worked or how it made it possible for you to speak to many men in many places at once .  could you explain that the image wasn t you yourself but merely an illusion that you could make disappear and reappear .  you couldn t even explain where you came from if all the universe they knew was their own island .         well  then  we re savages to him .  is that it .     demanded johannison .   the visitor said     your wife is being metaphorical .  let me finish .  i can no longer try to encourage your society to cure itself .  the disease has progressed too far .  i am going to have to alter the temperamental makeup of the race .         how .         there are neither words nor concepts to explain that either .  you must see that our control of physical matter is extensive .  it was quite simple to stop all radioactivity .  it was a little more difficult to see to it that all things  including books  now suited a world in which radioactivity did not exist .  it was still more difficult  and took more time  to wipe out all thought of radioactivity from the minds of men .  right now  uranium does not exist on earth .  no one ever heard of it .         i have     said johannison .     how about you  mercy .         i remember  too     said mercedes .      you two are omitted for a reason     said the visitor    as are over a hundred others  men and women  all over the world .         no radioactivity     muttered johannison .     forever .         for five of your years     said the visitor .     it is a pause  nothing more .  merely a pause  or call it a period of anesthesia  so that i can operate on the species without the interim danger of atomic war .  in five years the phenomenon of radioactivity will return  together with all the uranium and thorium that currently do not exist .  the knowledge will not return  however .  that is where you will come in .  you and the others like you .  you will re educate the world gradually .         that s quite a job .  it took fifty years to get us to this point .  even allowing for less the second time  why not simply restore knowledge .  you can do that  can t you .         the operation     said the visitor     will be a serious one .  it will take anywhere up to a decade to make certain there are no complications .  so we want re education slowly  on purpose .      johannison said     how do we know when the time comes .  i mean when the operation s over .      the visitor smiled .     when the time comes  you will know .  be assured of that .         well  it s a hell of a thing  waiting five years for a gong to ring in your head .  what if it never comes .  what if your operation isn t successful .      the visitor said seriously     let us hope that it is .         but if it isn t .  can t you clear our minds temporarily  too .  can t you let us live normally till it s time .         no .  i m sorry .  i need your minds untouched .  if the operation is a failure  if the cure does not work out  i will need a small reservoir of normal  untouched minds out of which to bring about the growth of a new population on this planet on whom a new variety of cure may be attempted .  at all costs  your species must be preserved .  it is valuable to us .  it is why i am spending so much time trying to explain the situation to you .  if i had left you as you were an hour ago  five days  let alone five years  would have completely ruined you .      and without another word he disappeared .     mercedes went through the motions of preparing supper and they sat at the table almost as though it had been any other day .   johannison said     is it true .  is it all real .         i saw it  too     said mercedes .     i heard it .         i went through my own books .  they re all changed .  when this pause is over  we ll be working strictly from memory  all of us who are left .  we ll have to build instruments again .  it will take a long time to get it across to those who won t remember .     suddenly he was angry     and what for  i want to know .  what for .         alex     mercedes began timidly     he may have been on earth before and spoken to people .  he s lived for thousands and thousands of years .  do you suppose he s what we ve been thinking of for so long as as     johannison looked at her .     as god .  is that what you re trying to say .  how should i know .  all i know is that his people  whatever they are  are infinitely more advanced than we  and that he s curing us of a disease .      mercedes said     then i think of him as a doctor or what s equivalent to it in his society .         a doctor .  all he kept saying was that the difficulty of communication was the big problem .  what kind of a doctor can t communicate with his patients .  a vet .  an animal doctor .      he pushed his plate away .   his wife said     even so .  if he brings an end to war         why should he want to .  what are we to him .  we re animals .  we are animals to him .  literally .  he as much as said so .  when i asked him where he was from  he said he didn t come from the  yard  at all .  get it .  the barnyard .  then he changed it to the  universe .   he didn t come from the  universe  at all .  his difficulty in communication gave him away .  he used the concept for what our universe was to him rather than what it was to us .  so the universe is a barnyard and we re   horses  chickens  sheep .  take your choice .      mercedes said softly      the lord is my shepherd .  i shall not want .  .  .          stop it  mercy .  that s a metaphor  this is reality .  if he s a shepherd  then we re sheep with a queer  unnatural desire  and ability  to kill one another .  why stop us .         he said         i know what he said .  he said we have great potentialities .  we re very valuable .  right .         yes .         but what are the potentialities and values of sheep to a shepherd .  the sheep wouldn t have any idea .  they couldn t .  maybe if they knew why they were coddled so  they d prefer to live their own lives .  they d take their own chances with wolves or with themselves .      mercedes looked at him helplessly .   johannison cried     it s what i keep asking myself now .  where are we going .  where are we going .  do sheep know .  do we know .  can we know .      they sat staring at their plates  not eating .   outside  there was the noise of traffic and the calling of children at play .  night was falling and gradually it grew dark .              one memory i have concerning the pause reinforces my constant delight that i am at the writing end of things and am not part of any other facet of the literary game .   i was in the offices of farrar  straus   young at a time when the anthology was in the early stage of production and the woman who was the in house editor was agonizing over the title of the anthology .  it was supposed to be in time to come  but she thought that lacked something and was wondering about alternatives .      what do you think  dr .  asimov .     she asked and looked at me pleadingly .   people often think i have the answers  when sometimes i don t even have the questions .    i thought desperately and said     leave out the first word and make it time to come .  that strengthens the concept  time  and makes the title seem more science fictional .      she cried out at once     just the thing     and time to come was indeed the title of the anthology when it appeared .   well  did the change in title improve sales .  how would they ever know .  how could they be sure it didn t actually hurt sales .   i m very glad i m not an editor .     while all this writing was going on  my professional labors at the medical school were doing very well .  in      i had been promoted to assistant professor of biochemistry  and i now had the professorial status to add to my doctorate .  this double dose of title didn t seem to add to my dignity in the least  however .  i continued to have a    bouncing  jovial  effervescent manner     as sprague would say  and i still do to this day  as anyone who meets me will testify  despite the fact that my    wavy brown hair     while still wavy  is longer and less brown than it used to be .   all that effervescing made it possible for me to get along very well with the students  but perhaps not always so well with a few of the faculty members .  fortunately  everyone was quite aware that i was a science fiction writer .  it helped .  it seemed to reconcile them to the fact that i was an eccentric and they thereupon forgave me a great deal .   as for myself  i made no attempt to conceal the fact .  some people in the more staid callings use pseudonyms when they succumb to the temptation to write what they fear is trash .  since i never thought of science fiction as trash  and since i was writing and selling long before i had become a faculty member  i had no choice but to use my own peculiar name on my stories .   nor did i intend to get the school itself into anything that would hurt its dignity .   i had sold my first book  pebble in the sky  some six weeks before i had accepted the job at the medical school .  what i did not know was that doubleday was going to exploit my new professional position in connection with the book .  it was only when i saw the book jacket  toward the end of       that i saw what was to be on the back cover .   along with a very good likeness of myself at the age of twenty five  which breaks my heart now when i look at it  there was a final sentence  which read     dr .  asimov lives in boston  where he is engaged in cancer research at boston university school of medicine .      i thought about that for quite a while  then decided to do the straightforward thing .  i asked to see dean james faulkner  and i put it to him frankly .  i was a science fiction writer  i said  and had been for years .  my first book was coming out under my own name  and my association with the medical school would be mentioned .  did he want my resignation .   the dean  a boston brahmin with a sense of humor  said     is it a good book .      cautiously  i said     the publishers think so .      and he said     in that case the medical school will be glad to be identified with it .      that took care of that and never  in my stay at the medical school  did i get into trouble over my science fiction .  in fact  it occurred to some of the people at the school to put me to use .  in october      the people running the boston university graduate journal asked me for a few hundred words of science fiction with which to liven up one of their issues .  i obliged with let s not  which then appeared in the december      issue .       let s not     professor charles kittredge ran in long  unsteady strides .  he was in time to bat the glass from the lips of associate  professor heber vandermeer .  it was almost like an exercise in slow motion .   vandermeer  whose absorption had apparently been such that he had not heard the thud of kittredge s approach  looked at once startled and ashamed .  his glance sank to the smashed glass and the puddling liquid that surrounded it .      potassium cyanide .  i d kept a bit  when we left .  just .     m case .  .  .      how would that have helped .  and it s one glass gone  too .  now it s got to be cleaned up .  .  .  . no  i ll do it .      kittredge found a precious fragment of cardboard to scoop up the glass fragments and an even more precious scrap of cloth to soak up the poisonous fluid .  he left to discard the glass and  regretfully  the cardboard and cloth into one of the chutes that would puff them to the surface  a half mile up .   he returned to find vandermeer sitting on the cot  eyes fixed glassily on the wall .  the physicist s hair had turned quite white and he had lost weight  of course .  there were no fat men in the refuge .  kittredge  who had been long  thin  and gray to begin with  had  in contrast  scarcely changed .   vandermeer said     remember the old days  kitt .         i try not to .         it s the only pleasure left     said vandermeer .     schools were schools .  there were classes  equipment  students  air  light  and people .  people .          a school s a school as long as there is one teacher and one student .         you re almost right     mourned vandermeer .     there are two teachers .  you  chemistry .  i  physics .  the two of us  everything else we can get out of the books .  and one graduate student .  he ll be the first man ever to get his ph . d .  down here .  quite a distinction .  poor jones .      kittredge put his hands behind his back to keep them steady .     there are twenty other youngsters who will live to be graduate students someday .      vandermeer looked up .  his face was gray .     what do we teach them meanwhile .  history .  how man discovered what makes hydrogen go boom and was happy as a lark while it went boom and boom and boom .  geography .  we can describe how the winds blew the shining dust everywhere and the water currents carried the dissolved isotopes to all the deeps and shallows of the ocean .      kittredge found it very hard .  he and vandermeer were the only qualified scientists who got away in time .  the responsibility of the existence of a hundred men  women  and children was theirs as they hid from the dangers and rigors of the surface and from the terror man had created here in this bubble of life half a mile below the planet s crust .   desperately  he tried to put nerve into vandermeer .  he said  as forcefully as he could     you know what we must teach them .  we must keep science alive so that someday we can repopulate the earth .  make a new start .      vandermeer did not answer that .  he turned his face to the wall .   kittredge said     why not .  even radioactivity doesn t last forever .  let it take a thousand years  five thousand .  someday the radiation level on earth s surface will drop to bearable amounts .         someday .         of course .  someday .  don t you see that what we have here is the most important school in the history of man .  if we succeed  you and i  our descendants will have open sky and free running water again .  they ll even have     and he smiled wryly     graduate schools such as those we remember .      vandermeer said .     i don t believe any of it .  at first  when it seemed better than dying  i would have believed anything .  but now  it just doesn t make sense .  so we ll teach them all we know  down here  and then we die .  .  .  down here .         but before long i ones will be teaching with us  and then there ll be others .  the youngsters who hardly remember the old ways will become teachers  and then the youngsters who were born here will teach .  this will be the critical point .  once the native born are in charge  there will be no memories to destroy morale .  this will be their life and they will have a goal to strive for  something to fight for .  .  . a whole world to win once more .  if  van  if we keep alive the knowledge of physical science on the graduate level .  you understand why  don t you .         of course i understand     said vandermeer irritably     but that doesn t make it possible .         giving up will make it impossible .  that s for sure .         well .  i   ll try     said vandermeer in a whisper .   so kittredge moved to his own cot and closed his eves and wished desperately that he might be standing in his protective suit on the planet s surface .  just for a little while .  just for a little while .  he would stand beside the shell of the ship that had been dismantled and cannibalized to create the bubble of life here below .  then he could rouse his own courage just after sunset by looking up and seeing  once more  just once more as it gleamed through the thin  cold atmosphere of mars  the bright  dead evening star that was earth .              some people accuse me of getting every last bit of mileage out of everything i write .  it s not a deliberate policy of mine  actually  but i must admit that the mileage does seem to mount up .  even as long ago as      it was happening .   i had written let s not for my school  and  of course  i was not paid for it and didn t expect to be .  shortly thereafter  though  martin greenberg of gnome press asked me for an introduction for a new anthology he was planning  all a bout the future  which was slated for publication in      .   i did not really like to refuse because i liked martin greenberg  even though he was years behind in his royalty payments .  on the other hand  i did not wish to reward him with more material  so i compromised .      how about a little story instead .     i said  and offered him let s not .  he ran it as one of the introductions  the other  a more conventional one  was by robert a .  heinlein  and  wonder of wonders  paid me ten dollars .     in that same year another turning point was hitting me .   odd how many turning points there are in one s life  and how difficult it is to recognize them when they come .    i had been writing nonfiction to a small extent ever since the days of my doctoral dissertation .  there were scientific papers dealing with my research  for instance .  these were not many  because i was not long in finding out that i was not really an enthusiastic researcher .  then  too  writing the papers was a dreadful chore  since scientific writing is abhorrently stylized and places a premium on poor quality .   the textbook was more enjoyable but in writing it i had been constantly hampered and tied down because of my two collaborators wonderful men  both  but with styles different from my own .  my frustration led me to a desire to write a biochemistry book on my own  not for medical students but for the general public .  i looked upon it as only a dream  however  for i could not really see past my own science fiction .   however  my collaborator  bill boyd  had written a popular book on genetics  genetics and the races of man  little brown         and in      there came from new york one henry schuman  owner of a small publishing house named after himself .  he tried to persuade bill to write a book for him but bill was busy and  being a kindhearted soul  tried to let mr .  schuman down easily by introducing him to me  with the suggestion that he get me to write a book .   of course  i agreed and wrote the book promptly .  when publication time rolled around  however  henry schuman had sold his firm to another small firm  abelard .  when my book appeared  then  it was the chemicals of life  abelard schuman         .   it was the first nonfiction hook that ever appeared with my name on it and no other  the first nonfiction book i ever wrote for the general public .   what s more  it had turned out to be a very easy task  much easier than my science fiction .  i took only ten weeks to write the book  never spending more than an hour or two a day on it  and it was intense fun .  i instantly began to think of other  similar nonfiction books i could do  and that began a course of action that was to fill my life though i did not have any inkling at the time that this would happen .   that same year  too  it began to look as though a second offspring was on its way .  this one also caught us by surprise and created a serious problem .   when we had first moved into our waltham apartment  in the spring of       there were just the two of us .  we slept in one bedroom  and the other bedroom was the office .  my book the currents of space  doubleday        was written in that second bedroom .   after david was born and grew large enough to need a room of his own  he got the second bedroom and my office was moved into the master bedroom  and that s where the caves of steel  doubleday .        was written .   then  on february           my daughter  robyn joan  was born  and i moved into the corridor in anticipation .  it was the only place left to me .  the fourth of my lucky start novels was begun on the very day she was brought home from the hospital .  it was lucky starr and the big sun of mercury  doubleday        and it was dedicated    to robyn joan  who did her best to interfere .      the interfering was entirely too efficient .  with a child in each bedroom and me in the corridor it was bad enough  but eventually robyn joan would be large enough to need a room of her own  so we made up our mind to look for a house .   that was traumatic .  i had never lived in a house .  for all my thirty five years of life  i had lived in a series of rented apartments .  what had to be  however  had to be .  in january      we found a house in newton  massachusetts  just west of boston  and on march           we moved in .   on march           boston had one of its worst blizzards in memory  and three feet of snow fell .  having never had to shovel snow before  i found myself starting with a lulu in a deep  broad driveway .  i had barely dug myself out when  on march           a second blizzard struck and four more feet fell .   the melting snow packed against the outer walls of the house found its way past the wood and into the basement and we had a small flood .     heavens  how we wished ourselves back in the apartment .   but we survived that  and then came a graver worry for me at least .  my life had changed so radically  what with two children  a house  and a mortgage  that i began to wonder if i would still be able to write .   my novel the naked sun  doubleday        had been finished two days  before the move .   you know  one gets such a feeling that a writer is a delicate plant who must be carefully nurtured or he will wither  that any traumatic change in one s way of life is bound to give the feeling of all the blossoms being lopped off .   what with the blizzards and the snow shoveling and the basement pumping and everything else  i didn t get a chance to try to write for a while .   but then bob lowndes asked me to do a story for future  and in june      i began my first writing job in the new house .  it was the first heat wave of the season but the basement was cool  so i set up my typewriter there in the unique luxury of being able to feel cool in a heat wave .   there was no trouble .  i could still write .  i turned out each an explorer and it appeared in issue     of future  the issues of this magazine were so irregular at this time that it was not felt safe to put a month designation on the issues  .       each an explorer     herman chouns was a man of hunches .  sometimes he was right  sometimes he was wrong   about fifty fifty .  still  considering that one has the whole universe of possibilities from which to pull a right answer  fifty fifty begins to look pretty good .   chouns wasn t always as pleased with the matter as might be expected .  it put too much of a strain on him .  people would huddle around a problem  making nothing of it  then turn to him and say     what do you think  chouns .  turn on the old intuition .      and if he came up with something that fizzled  the responsibility for that was made clearly his .   his job  as field explorer  rather made things worse .     think that planet s worth a closer look .     they would say .     what do you think  chouns .      so it was a relief to draw a two man spot for a change  meaning that the next trip would be to some low priority place  and the pressure would be off  and  on top of it  to get allen smith as partner .   smith was as matter of fact as his name .  he said to chouns the first day out     the thing about you is that the memory files in your brain are on extraspecial can .  faced with a problem  you remember enough little things that maybe the rest of us don t come up with to make a decision .  calling it a hunch just makes it mysterious  and it isn t .      he rubbed his hair slickly back as he said that .  he had light hair that lay down like a skull cap .   chouns  whose hair was very unruly  and whose nose was snub and a bit off center  said softly  as was his way       i think maybe it s telepathy .         what .         nuts .     said smith  with loud derision  as was his way  .     scientists have been tracking psionics for a thousand years and gotten nowhere .  there s no such thing  no precognition  no telekinesis  no clairvoyance  and no telepathy .         i admit that  but consider this .  if i get a picture of what each of a group of people are thinking   even though i might not be aware of what was happening i could integrate the information and come up with an answer .  i would know more than any single individual in the group  so i could make a better judgment than the others sometimes .         do you have any evidence at all for that .     chouns turned his mild brown eyes on the other .     just a hunch .      they got along well .  chouns welcomed the other s refreshing practicality  and smith patronized the other s speculations .  they often disagreed but never quarreled   even when they reached their objective  which was a globular cluster that had never felt the energy thrusts of a human designed nuclear reactor before  increasing tension did not worsen matters .   smith said     wonder what they do with all this data back on earth .  seems a waste sometimes .      chouns said     earth is just beginning to spread out .  no telling how far humanity will move out into the galaxy  given a million years or so .  all the data we can get on any world will come in handy someday         you sound like a recruiting manual for the exploration teams  think there ll be anything interesting in that thing .     he indicated the visi plate on which the no longer distant cluster was centered like spilled talcum powder .      maybe .  i ve got a hunch     chouns stopped  gulped  blinked once or twice  and then smiled weakly .   smith snorted     let s get a fix on the nearest stargroups and make a random pass through the thickest of it .  one gets you ten  we find a mckomin ratio under   .           you ll lose     murmured chouns .  he felt the quick stir of excitement that always came when new worlds were about to be spread beneath them .  it was a most contagious feeling  and it caught hundreds of youngsters each year .  youngsters  such as he had been once  flocked to the teams  eager to see the worlds their descendants someday would call their own  each an explorer     they got their fix  made their first close quarters hyperspatial jump into the cluster  and began scanning stars for planetary systems .  the computers did their work  the information files grew steadily  and all proceeded in satisfactory routine until at system     shortly after completion of the jump  the ship s hyperatomic motors failed .   chouns muttered     funny .  the analyzers don t say what s wrong .      he was right .  the needles wavered erratically  never stopping once for a reasonable length of time  so that no diagnosis was indicated .  and  as a consequence  no repairs could be carried through .      never saw anything like it     growled smith .     we ll have to shut everything off and diagnose manually .         we might as well do it comfortably     said chouns  who was already at the telescopes .     nothing s wrong with the ordinary spacedrive  and there are two decent planets in this system .         oh .  how decent and which ones .         the first and second out of four  both water oxygen .  the first is a bit warmer and larger than earth  the second a bit colder and smaller .  fair enough .         life .         both .  vegetation  anyway .     smith grunted .  there was nothing in that to surprise anyone  vegetation occurred more often than not on water oxygen worlds .  and  unlike animal life  vegetation could be seen telescopically or  more precisely  spectroscopically .  only four photochemical pigments had ever been found in any plant form  and each could be detected by the nature of the light it reflected .   chouns said     vegetation on both planets is chlorophyll type  no less .  it ll be just like earth  real homey .      smith said     which is closer .         number two  and we re on our way .  i have a feeling it s going to be a nice planet .         i ll judge that by the instruments  if you don t mind     said smith .   but this seemed to be one of chouns s correct hunches .   the planet was a tame one with an intricate ocean network that insured a climate of small temperature range .  the mountain ranges were low and rounded  and the distribution of vegetation indicated high and widespread fertility .   chouns was at the controls for the actual landing .   smith grew impatient .     what are you picking and choosing for .  one place is like another .         i   m looking for a bare spot      said chouns .     no use burning up an acre of plant life .         what if you do .         what if i don t .     said chouns  and found his bare spot .   it was only then  after landing  that they realized a small part of what they had tumbled into .      jumping space warps     said smith .   chouns felt stunned .  animal life was much rarer than vegetation  and even the glimmerings of intelligence were far rarer still  yet here  not half a mile away from landing point  was a clustering of low  thatched huts that were obviously the product of a primitive intelligence .      careful      said smith dazedly .      i don t think there s any harm     said chouns .  he stepped out onto the surface of the planet with firm confidence  smith followed .   chouns controlled his excitement with difficulty .     this is terrific .  no one s ever reported anything better than caves or woven tree branches before .         i hope they re harmless .         it s too peaceful for them to be anything else .  smell the air .      coming down to landing  the terrain to all points of horizon  except where a low range of hills broke the even line   had been colored a soothing pale pink  dappled against the chlorophyll green .  at closer quarters the pale pink broke up into individual flowers  fragile and fragrant .  only the areas in the immediate neighborhood of the huts were amber with something that looked like a cereal grain .   creatures were emerging from the huts  moving closer to the ship with a kind of hesitating trust .  they had four legs and a sloping body which stood three feet high at the shoulders .  their heads were set firmly on those shoulders  with bulging eyes  chouns counted six  set in a circle and capable of the most disconcertingly independent motion .   that makes up for the immovability of the head  thought chouns .    each animal had a tail that forked at the end  forming two sturdy fibrils that each animal held high .  the fibrils maintained a rapid tremor that gave them a hazy  blurred look .      come on     said chouns .     they won t hurt us  i m sure of it .      the animals surrounded the men at a cautious distance .  their tails made a modulated humming noise .      they might communicate that way     said chouns .      and i think it s obvious they re vegetarians .     he pointed toward one of the huts  where a small member of the species sat on its haunches  plucking at the amber grain with his tails  and flickering an ear of it through his mouth like a man sucking a series of maraschino cherries off a toothpick .      human beings eat lettuce     said smith     but that doesn t prove anything .      more of the tailed creatures emerged  hovered about the men for a moment  then vanished off into the pink and green .      vegetarians     said chouns firmly .     look at the way they cultivate the main crop .      the main crop  as chouns called it  consisted of a coronet of soft green spikes  close to the ground .  out of the center of the coronet grew a hairy stem which  at two inch intervals  shot out fleshy  veined buds that almost pulsated  they seemed so    vitally alive .  the stem ended at the tip with the pale pink blossoms that  except for the color  were the most earthly thing about the plants .   the plants were laid out in rows and files with geometric precision .  the soil about each was well loosened and powdered with a foreign substance that could be nothing but fertilizer .  narrow passageways  just wide enough for an animal to pass along  crisscrossed the field  and each passageway was lined with narrow sluiceways  obviously for water .   the animals were spread through the fields now  working diligently  heads bent .  only a few remained in the neighborhood of the two men .   chouns nodded .     they re good farmers .         not bad     agreed smith .  he walked briskly toward the nearest of the pale pink blooms and reached for one  but six inches short of it he was stopped by the sound of tail vibrations keening to shrillness  and by the actual touch of a tail upon his arm .  the touch was delicate but firm  interposing itself between smith and the plants .   smith fell back .     what in space        he had half reached for his blaster when chouns said     no cause for excitement  take it easy .      half a dozen of the creatures were now gathering about the two  offering stalks of grain humbly and gently  some using their tails  some nudging it forward with their muzzles .   chouns said     they re friendly enough .  picking a bloom might be against their customs  the plants probably have to be treated according to rigid rules .  any culture that has agriculture probably has fertility rites  and lord knows what that involves .  the rules governing the cultivation of the plants must be strict  or there wouldn t be those accurate measured rows .   .  .  . space  won t they sit up back home when they hear this .      the tail humming shot up in pitch again  and the creatures near them fell back .  another member of the species was emerging from a larger hut in the center of the group .      the chief  i suppose     muttered chouns .  the new one advanced slowly  tail high  each fibril encircling a small black object .  at a distance of five feet its tail arched forward .      he s giving it to us     said smith in astonishment     and chouns  for god s sake  look at it .      chouns was doing so  feverishly .  he choked out     they re gamow hyperspatial sighters .  those are ten thousand dollar instruments .      smith emerged from the ship again  after an hour within .  he shouted from the ramp in high excitement     they work .  they re perfect .  we re rich .      chouns called back     i ve been checking through their huts .  i can t find any more .         don t sneeze at just two .  good lord  these are as negotiable as a handful of cash .      but chouns still looked about  arms akimbo  exasperated .  three of the tailed creatures had dogged him from hut to hut patiently  never interfering  but remaining always between him and the geometrically cultivated pale pink blossoms .  now they stared multiply at him .   smith said     it s the latest model  too .  look here .     he pointed to the raised lettering which said model x    .  gamow products .  warsaw .  european sector .   chouns glanced at it and said impatiently     what interests me is getting more .  i know there are more gamow sighters somewhere  i want them .     his cheeks were flushed and his breathing heavy .   the sun was setting  the temperature dropped below the comfortable point .  smith sneezed twice  then chouns .      we ll catch pneumonia     snuffled smith .      i   ve got to make them understand     said chouns stubbornly .  he had eaten hastily through a can of pork sausage  had gulped down a can of coffee  and was ready to try again .   he held the sighter high .     more     he said     more     making encircling movements with his arms .  he pointed to one sighter  then to the other  then to the imaginary additional ones lined up before him .     more .      then  as the last of the sun dipped below the horizon  a vast hum arose from all parts of the field as every creature in sight ducked its head  lifted its forked tail  and vibrated it into screaming invisibility in the twilight .      what in space     muttered smith uneasily .     hey  look at the blooms .     he sneezed again .   the pale pink flowers were shriveling visibly .  chouns shouted to make himself heard above the hum     it may be a reaction to sunset .  you know  the blooms close at night .  the noise may be a religious observance of the fact .      a soft flick of a tail across his wrist attracted chouns s instant attention .  the tail he had felt belonged to the nearest creature  and now it was raised to the sky  toward a bright object low on the western horizon .  the tail bent downward to point to the sighter  then up again to the star .   chouns said excitedly     of course the inner planet  the other habitable one .  these must have come from there .     then  reminded by the thought  he cried in sudden shock     hey  smith  the hyperatomic motors are still out .      smith looked shocked  as though he had forgotten  too  then he mumbled     meant to tell you they re allright .         you fixed them .         never touched them .  but when i was testing the sighters i used the hyperatomics and they worked .  i didn t pay any attention at the time  i forgot there was anything wrong .  anyway  they worked .         then let s go     said chouns at once .  the thought of sleep never occurred to him .     neither one slept through the six hour trip .  they remained at the controls in an almost drug fed passion .  once again they chose a bare spot on which to land .   it was hot with an afternoon subtropical heat  and a broad  muddy river moved placidly by them .  the near bank was of hardened mud  riddled with large cavities .   the two men stepped out onto planetary surface and smith cried hoarsely     chouns  look at that .      chouns shook off the other s grasping hand .  he said     the same plants .  i ll be damned .      there was no mistaking the pale pink blossoms  the stalk with its veined buds  and the coronet of spikes below .  again there was the geometric spacing  the careful planting and fertilization  the irrigation canals .   smith said     we haven t made a mistake and circled         oh  look at the sun  it s twice the diameter it was be   fore .  and look there .      out of the nearest burrows in the river bank smoothly tan and sinuous objects  as limbless as snakes  emerged .  they were a foot in diameter  ten feet in length .  the two ends were equally featureless  equally blunt .  midway along their upper portions were bulges .  all the bulges  as though on signal  grew before their eyes to fat ovals  split in two to form lipless  gaping mouths that opened and closed with a sound like a forest of dry sticks clapping together .   then  just as on the outer planet  once their curiosities were satisfied and their fears calmed  most of the creatures drifted away toward the carefully cultivated field of plants .   smith sneezed .  the force of expelled breath against the sleeve of his jacket raised a powdering of dust .   he stared at that with amazement  then slapped himself and said     damn it  i m dusty .     the dust rose like a pale pink fog .     you  too     he added  slapping chouns .   both men sneezed with abandon .      picked it up on the other planet  i suppose     said chouns .      we can work up an allergy .         impossible .     chouns held up one of the sighters and shouted at the snake things     do you have any of these .      for a while there was nothing in answer but the splashing of water  as some of the snake things slid into the river and emerged with silvery clusters of water life  which they tucked beneath their bodies toward some hidden mouth .   but then one snake thing  longer than the others  came thrusting along the ground  one blunt end raised questingly some two inches  weaving blindly side to side .  the bulb in its center swelled gently at first  then alarmingly  splitting in two with an audible pop .  there  nestling within the two halves  were two more sighters  the duplicates of the first two .   chouns said ecstatically     lord in heaven  isn t that beautiful .      he stepped hastily forward .  reaching out for the objects .  the swelling that held them thinned and lengthened  forming what were almost tentacles .  they reached out toward him .   chouns was laughing .  they were gamow sighters all right  duplicates  absolute duplicates  of the first two .  chouns fondled them .   smith was shouting     don t you hear me .  chouns  damn it  listen to me .      chouns said     what .     he was dimly aware that smith had been yelling at him for over a minute .      look at the flowers  chouns .      they were closing  as had those on the other planet  and among the rows the snake things reared upward  balancing on one end and swaying with a queer  broken rhythm .  only the blunt ends of them were visible above the pale pink .   smith said     you can t say they re closing up because of nightfall .  it s broad day .      chouns shrugged .     different planet  different plant .  come on .  we ve only got two sighters here  there must be more .         chouns  let s go home .     smith firmed his legs into two stubborn pillars and the grip he held on chouns s collar tightened .   chouns s reddened face turned back toward him indignantly .     what are you doing .         i   m getting ready to knock you out if you don t come back with me at once  into the ship .      for a moment chouns stood irresolute  then a certain wildness about him faded  a certain slackening took place  and he said     all right .       they were halfway out of the starcluster .  smith said     how are you .      chouns sat up in his bunk and rumpled his hair .     normal  i guess  sane again .  how long have i been sleeping .         twelve hours .         what about you .         i ve catnapped .     smith turned ostentatiously to the instruments and made some minor adjustments .  he said self consciously     do you know what happened back there on those planets .      chouns said slowly     do you .         i think so .         oh .  may i hear .      smith said     it was the same plant on both planets .  you ll grant that .         i most certainly do .         it was transplanted from one planet to the other  somehow .  it grows on both planets perfectly well  but occasionally to maintain vigor  i imagine there must be crossfertilization  the two strains mingling .  that sort of thing happens on earth often enough .         crossfertilization for vigor .  yes .         but we were the agents that arranged for the mingling .  we landed on one planet and were coated with pollen .  remember the blooms closing .  that must have been just after they released their pollen  and that s what was making us sneeze  too .  then we landed on the other planet and knocked the pollen off our clothes .  a new hybrid strain win start up .  we were just a pair of two legged bees  chouns  doing our duty by the flowers .      chouns smiled tentatively .      an inglorious role  in a way .         hen  that s not it .  don t you see the danger .  don t you see why we have to get back home fast .         why .         because organisms don t adapt themselves to nothing .  those plants seem to be adapted to interplanetary fertilization .  we even got paid off  the way bees are  not with nectar  but with gamow sighters .         well .         well  you can t have interplanetary fertilization unless something or someone is there to do the job .  we did it this time  but we were the first humans ever to enter the cluster .  so  before this  it must be nonhumans who did it  maybe the same nonhumans who transplanted the blooms in the first place .  that means that somewhere in this cluster there is an intelligent race of beings  intelligent enough for space travel .  and earth must know about that .      slowly chouns shook his head .  smith frowned .     you find flaws somewhere in the reasoning .      chouns put hi .   head between his own palms and looked miserable .     let s say you ve missed almost everything .         what have i missed .     demanded smith angrily .      your crossfertilization theory is good  as far as it goes  but you haven t considered a few points .  when we approached that stellar system our hyperatomic motor went out of order in a way the automatic controls could neither diagnose nor correct .  after we landed we made no effort to adjust them .  we forgot about them  in fact  and when you handled them later you found they were in perfect order  and were so unimpressed by that that you didn t even mention it to me for another few hours .      take something else  how conveniently we chose landing spots near a grouping of animal life on both planets .  just luck .  and our incredible confidence in the good will of the creatures .  we never even bothered checking atmospheres for trace poisons before exposing ourselves .      and what bothers me most of all is that i went completely crazy over the gamow sighters .  why .  they re valuable  yes  but not that valuable   and i don t generally go overboard for a quick buck .      smith had kept an uneasy silence during all that .  now he said     i don t see that any of that adds up to anything .         get off it  smith  you know better than that .  isn t it obvious to you that we were under mental control from the outside .      smith s mouth twisted and caught halfway between derision and doubt .      are you on the psionic kick again .         yes  facts are facts .  i told you that my hunches might be a form of rudimentary telepathy .         is that a fact  too .  you didn t think so a couple of days ago .         i think so now .  look  i m a better receiver than you  and i was more strongly affected .  now that it s over  i understand more about what happened because i received more .  understand .         no     said smith harshly .      then listen further .  you said yourself the  gamow sighters were the nectar that bribed us into pollination .  you said that .         all right .         well  then  where did they come from .  they were earth products  we even read the manufacturer s name and model on them  letter by letter .  yet  if no human beings have ever been in the cluster  where did the sighters come from .  neither one of us worried about that  then  and you don t seem to worry about it even now .         well           what did you do with the sighters after we got on board ship  smith .  you took them from me  i remember that .         i put them in the safe     said smith defensively .     have you touched them since .         no .         have i .         not as far as i know .         you have my word i didn t .  then why not open the safe now .      smith stepped slowly to the safe .  it was keyed to his fingerprints  and it opened .  without looking he reached in .  his expression altered and with a sharp cry he first stared at the contents  then scrabbled them out .   he held four rocks of assorted color  each of them roughly rectangular .      they used our own emotions to drive us     said chouns softly  as though insinuating the words into the other s stubborn skull one at a time .     they made us think the hyperatomics were wrong so we could land on one of the planets  it didn t matter which  i suppose .  they made us think we had precision instruments in our hand after we landed on one so we would race to the other .         who are  they  .     groaned smith .     the tails or the snakes .  or both .         neither     said chouns .     it was the plants .         the plants .  the flowers .         certainly .  we saw two different sets of animals tending the same species of plant .  being animals ourselves  we assumed the animals were the masters .  but why should we assume that .  it was the plants that were being taken care of .         we cultivate plants on earth  too  chouns .         but we eat those plants     said chouns .      and maybe those creatures eat their plants  too .         let s say i know they don t     said chouns .     they maneuvered us well enough .  remember how careful i was to find a bare spot on which to land .         i felt no such urge .         you weren t at the controls  they weren t worried about you .  then  too  remember that we never noticed the pollen  though we were covered with it not till we were safely on the second planet .  then we dusted the pollen off  on order .         i never heard anything so impossible .         why is it impossible .  we don t associate intelligence with plants  because plants have no nervous systems  but these might have .  remember the fleshy buds on the stems .  also  plants aren t free moving  but they don t have to be if they develop psionic powers and can make use of free moving animals .  they get cared for  fertilized  irrigated  pollinated  and so on .  the animals tend them with single minded devotion and are happy over it because the plants make them feel happy .         i m sorry for you     said smith in a monotone .     if you try to tell this story back on earth  i m sorry for you .         i have no illusions     muttered chouns     yet what can i do but try to warn earth .  you see what they do to animals .         they make slaves of them  according to you .         worse than that .  either the tailed creatures or the snake things  or both  must have been civilized enough to have developed space travel once  otherwise the plants couldn t be on both planets .  but once the plants developed psionic powers  a mutant strain  perhaps   that came to an end .  animals at the atomic stage are dangerous .  so they were made to forget  they were reduced to what they are .   damn it  smith  those plants are the most dangerous things in the universe .  earth must be informed about them  because some other earthmen may be entering that cluster .      smith laughed .     you know  you re completely off base .  if those plants really had us under control  why would they let us get away to warn the others .      chouns paused .     i don t know .     smith s good humor was restored .  he said     for a minute you had me going  i don t mind telling you .      chouns rubbed his skull violently .  why were they let go .  and for that matter  why did he feel this horrible urgency to warn earth about a matter with which earthmen would not come into contact for millennia perhaps .   he thought desperately and something came glimmering .  he fumbled for it  but it drifted away .  for a moment he thought desperately that it was as though the thought had been pushed away  but then that feeling  too  left .   he knew only that the ship had to remain at full thrust  that they had to hurry .     so .  after uncounted years  the proper conditions had come about again .  the protospores from two planetary strains of the mother plant met and mingled  sifting together into the clothes and hair and ship of the new animals .  almost at once the hybrid spores formed  the hybrid spores that alone had all the capacity and potentiality of adapting themselves to a new planet .   the spores waited quietly  now  on the ship which  with the last impulse of the mother plant upon the minds of the creatures aboard  was hurtling them at top thrust toward a new and ripe world where free moving creatures would tend their needs .   the spores waited with the patience of the plant  the all conquering patience no animal can ever know  for their arrival on a new world   each  in its own tiny way  an explorer                the stories in this book have not been much anthologized .  that is the very reason i have chosen them  and it was one of the points doubleday urged on me .  each an explorer has  however  been anthologized twice  once by judith merril in      and once by vic ghidalia in      .   that still isn t much  though .  some of my stories tend to appear many times .  a little story i wrote called the fun they had has appeared  to date  at least forty two times since it was first published  in       and is currently in press for eight more appearances .  it may have appeared in other places  too  but i only have forty two in my library .   you can find the story  if you wish  in my book earth is room enough  doubleday        .  that s one of the forty two places .     editors are always trying to think up gimmicks .  sometimes i am the victim .   on november           i was in the office of infinity science fiction  talking to the editor  larry shaw .  we got along well together  he and i      i mustn t make that sound exceptional .  i get along with nearly everyone .   and i often dropped in to see him when i visited new york .   that day he had an idea .  he was to give me the title for a story the least inspirational title he could think of and i was to write a short short  on the spot  based on that title .  then he would give the same title to two other writers and they would do the same .   i asked  cautiously  what the title was  and he said     blank .         blank .     i said .      blank     he said .   so i thought a little and wrote the following story  with the title of blank .   with an exclamation point  .   randall garrett wrote a story entitled blank .  with a question mark  and harlan ellison wrote one called blank with no punctuation at all .       blank .         presumably     said august pointdexter     there is such a thing as overweening pride .  the greeks called it hubris  and considered it to be defiance of the gods  to be followed always by ate  or retribution .     he rubbed his pale blue eyes uneasily .      very pretty     said dr .  edward barron impatiently .     has that any connection with what i said .     his forehead was high and had horizontal creases in it that cut in sharply when he raised his eyebrows in contempt .      every connection     said pointdexter .     to construct a time machine is itself a challenge to fate .  you make it worse by your flat confidence .  how can you be sure that your time travel machine will operate through all of time without the possibility of paradox .      barron said     i didn t know you were superstitious .  the simple fact is that a time machine is a machine like any other machine  no more and no less sacrilegious .  mathematically  it is analogous to an elevator moving up and down its shaft .  what danger of retribution lies in that .      pointdexter said energetically     an elevator doesn t involve paradoxes .  you can t move from the fifth floor to the fourth and kill your grandfather as a child .      dr .  barron shook his head in agonized impatience .     i was waiting for that .  for exactly that .  why couldn t you suggest that i would meet myself or that i would change history by telling mcclellan that stonewall jackson was going to make a flank march on washington  or anything else .  now i m asking you point blank .  will you come into the machine with me .      pointdexter hesitated .     i .  .  . i don t think so .         why do you make things difficult .  i ve explained already that time is invariant .  if i go into the past it will be because i ve already been there .  anything i decided to do and proceed to do .  i will have already done in the past all along  so i ll be changing nothing and no paradoxes will result .  if i decided to kill my grandfather as a baby  and did it i would not be here .  but i am here .  therefore i did not kill my grandfather .  no matter how i try to kill him and plan to kill him  the fact is i didn t kill him and so i won t kill him .  nothing would change that .  do you understand what i m explaining .         i understand what you say  but are you right .         of course i m right .  for god s sake  why couldn t you have been a mathematician instead of a machinist with a college education .     in his impatience  barron could scarcely hide his contempt .     look  this machine is only possible because certain mathematical relationships between space and time hold true .  you understand that  don t you  even if you don t follow the details of the mathematics .  the machine exists  so the mathematical relations i worked out have some correspondence in reality .  right .  you ve seen me send rabbits a week into the future .  you ve seen them appear out of nothing .  you ve watched me send a rabbit a week into the past one week after it appeared .  and they were unharmed .         all right .  i admit all that .         then will you believe me if i tell you that the equations upon which this machine is based assume that time is composed of particles that exist in an unchanging order  that time is invariant .  if the order of the particles could be changed in any way any way at all the equations would be invalid and this machine wouldn t work  this particular method of time travel would be impossible .      pointdexter rubbed his eyes again and looked thoughtful .     i wish i knew mathematics .      barron said     just consider the facts .  you tried to send the rabbit two weeks into the past when it had arrived only one week in the past .  that would have created a paradox  wouldn t it .  but what happened .  the indicator stuck at one week and wouldn t budge .  you couldn t create a paradox .  will you come .      pointdexter shuddered at the edge of the abyss of agreement and drew back .  he said     no .      barron said     i wouldn t  . ask you to help if i could do this alone  but you know it takes two men to operate the machine for intervals of more than a month .  i need someone to control the standards so that we can return with precision .  and you re the one i want to use .  we share the the glory of this thing now .  do you want to thin it out  but in a third person .  time enough for that after we ve established ourselves as the first time travelers in history .  good lord  man  don t you want to see where we ll be a hundred years from now  or a thousand  don t you want to see napoleon  or jesus  for that matter .  we ll be like   like      barron seemed carried away      like gods .         exactly     mumbled pointdexter .     hubris .  time travel isn t godlike enough to risk being stranded out of my own time .         hubris .  stranded .  you keep making up fears .  we re just moving along the particles of time like an elevator along the floors of a building .  time travel is actually safer because an elevator cable can break  whereas in the time machine there ll be no gravity to pun us down destructively .  nothing wrong can possibly happen .  i guarantee it     said barron  tapping his chest with the middle finger of his right hand .     i guarantee it .         hubris     muttered pointdexter  but fell into the abyss of agreement nevertheless  overborne at last .   together they entered the machine .     pointdexter did not understand the controls in the sense barron did  for he was no mathematician  but he knew how they were supposed to be handled .   barron was at one set  the propulsions .  they supplied the drive that forced the machine along the time axis .  pointdexter was at the standards that kept the point of origin fixed so that the machine could move back to the original starting point at any time .   pointdexter s teeth chattered as the first motion made itself felt in his stomach  like an elevator s motion it was  but not quite  it was something more subtle  yet very real .  he said     what if        barron snapped out     nothing can go wrong .  please .     and at once there was a jar and pointdexter fell heavily against the wall .   barron said     what the devil .         what happened .     demanded pointdexter breathlessly .     i don t know  but it doesn t matter .  we re only twenty two hours into the future .  let s step out and check .      the door of the machine slid into its recessed panel and the breath went out of pointdexter s body in a panting whoosh .  he said     there s nothing there .      nothing .  no matter .  no light .  blank .   pointdexter screamed .     the earth moved .  we forgot that .  in twenty two hours  it moved thousands of miles through space  traveling around the sun .         no     said barron faintly     i didn t forget that .  the machine is designed to follow the time path of earth wherever that leads .  besides  even if earth moved  where is the sun .  where are the stars .      barron went back to the controls .  nothing budged .  nothing worked .  the door would no longer slide shut .  blank .   pointdexter found it getting difficult to breathe  difficult to move .  with effort he said     what s wrong  then .      barron moved slowly toward the center of the machine .  he said painfully     the particles of time .  i think we happened to stall .  .  . between two .  .  . particles .      pointdexter tried to clench a fist but couldn t .     don t understand .         like an elevator .  like an elevator .     he could no longer sound the words  but only move his lips to shape them .     like an elevator  after all .  .  . stuck between the floors .      pointdexter could not even move his lips .  he thought  nothing can proceed in nontime .  all motion is suspended  all consciousness  all everything .  there was an inertia about themselves that had carried them along in time for a minute or so  like a body leaning forward when an automobile comes to a sudden halt but it was dying fast .   the light within the machine dimmed and went out .  sensation and awareness chilled into nothing .   one last thought  one final  feeble  mental sigh  hubris  ate .   then thought stopped  too .   stasis .  nothing .  for all eternity  where even eternity was meaningless  there would only be blank .              all three blanks were published in the june      issue of infinity and the idea of the gimmick  i suppose  was to let the reader compare them and note how three different imaginations took off from a single  nondescript title .   perhaps you wish you could have all three stories here  so that you could make the comparison yourself .  well  you can t .   in the first place  i d have to get permissions from randall and from harlan and i don t want to have to go through that  in the second place  you underestimate my self centered nature .  i don t want their stories included with mine .   then  too  i must explain that i always dismantle magazines with my stories in them  because i just can t manage to keep intact those magazines containing my stories .  there are too many magazines and not enough room .  i take out my own particular stories and bind them into volumes for future reference  as in the preparation of this book  .  actually  i am running out of room for the volumes .   anyway  when it came to dismantling the june      infinity i abstracted only blank .  and discarded blank .  and blank .   or  perhaps  you don t underestimate my self centered nature and expect me as a matter of course  to do that sort of thing .   back in the middle     s  when some of the less affluent science fiction magazines  not that any of them were really affluent  asked me for a story  it was my practice to request the rates that astounding and galaxy paid if any magazine expected a story written especially for them .  they would do so  quite confident that if i said a story was written especially for them  it was  and that it had not been slipped out of the bottom of the barrel .   there are times when having a reputation as being too dumb to be crooked comes in handy .    the corollary of that  of course  is that if a story of mine is ever rejected by editor a  it is incumbent upon me to tell this to editor b when i offer it anew .  in the first place  a rejection of a story with my name on it must give rise to thoughts such as    wow .  this story must be a stinker .     and it s only fair to give the second editor a chance to agree .  secondly  even if the second editor accepts the story he need not feel called upon to pay me more than his own standard fees .  it meant an occasional loss of a few dollars but it made me more comfortable inside my wizened little soul .   anyway  does a bee care .  was written in october       after i had discussed it with robert p .  mills  of fantasy and science fiction  who had taken over the editorship of a new sister magazine of f   sf  which was to be called venture science fiction .   i guess the execution fell short of the promise  because mills rejected it and it was deemed unworthy both for venture and for f   sf .  so i passed it on to if  worlds of science fiction with the word of the rejection and i got less than top rates for it .  it appeared in the june      issue .   now the sad part is that i can never tell what there is about a story that makes the difference between acceptance and rejection  or which editor  the rejecting one or the accepting one  is correct .  that s why i m not an editor and never intend to be .   but you can judge for yourself .       does a bee care .      the ship began as a metal skeleton .  slowly a shining skin was layered on without and odd shaped vitals were crammed within .   thornton hammer  of all the individuals  but one  involved in the growth  did the least physically .  perhaps that was why he was most highly regarded .  he handled the mathematical symbols that formed the basis for lines on drafting paper  which  in turn  formed the basis for the fitting together of the various masses and different forms of energy that went into the ship .   hammer watched now through close fitting spectacles somberly .  their lenses caught the light of the fluorescent tubes above and sent them out again as highlights .  theodore lengyel  representing personnel of the corporation that was footing the bill for the project  stood beside him and said  as he pointed with a rigid  stabbing finger      there he is .  that s the man .     hammer peered .     you mean kane .         the fellow in the green overalls  holding a wrench .         that s kane .  now what is this you ve got against him .         i want to know what he does .  the man s an idiot .     lengyel had a round  plump face and his jowls quivered a bit .   hammer turned to look at the other  his spare body assuming an air of displeasure along every inch .     have you been bothering him .         bothering him .  i ve been talking to him .  it s my job to talk to the men  to get their viewpoints  to get information out of which i can build campaigns for improved morale .         how does kane disturb that .         he s insolent .  i asked him how it felt to be working on a ship that would reach the moon .  i talked a little about the ship being a pathway to the stars .  perhaps i made a little speech about it  built it up a bit  when he turned away in the rudest possible manner .  i called him back and said   where are you going .   and he said   i get tired of that kind of talk .  i m going out to look at the stars .       hammer nodded .     all right .  kane likes to look at the stars .         it was daytime .  the man s an idiot .  i ve been watching him since and he doesn t do any work .         i know that .         then why is he kept on .      hammer said with a sudden  tight fierceness     because i want him around .  because he s my luck .         you luck .     faltered lengyel .     what the hell does that mean .         it means that when he s around i think better .  when he passes me  holding his damned wrench  i get ideas .  it s happened three times .  i don t explain it  i m not interested in explaining it .  it s happened .  he stays .         you re joking .         no  i m not .  now leave me alone .      kane stood there in his green overalls  holding his wrench .   dimly he was aware that the ship was almost ready .  it was not designed to carry a man  but there was space for a man .  he knew that the way he knew a lot of things  like keeping out of the way of most people most of the time  like carrying a wrench until people grew used to him carrying a wrench and stopped noticing it .  protective coloration consisted of little things  really like carrying the wrench .   he was full of drives he did not fully understand  like looking at the stars .  at first  many years back  he had just looked at the stars with a vague ache .  then  slowly  his attention had centered itself on a certain region of the sky  then to a certain pinpointed spot .  he didn t know why that certain spot .  there were no stars in that spot .  there was nothing to see .   that spot was high in the night sky in the late spring and in the summer months and he sometimes spent most of the night watching the spot until it sank toward the southwestern horizon .  at other times in the year he would stare at the spot during the day .   there was some thought in connection with that spot which he couldn t quite crystallize .  it had grown stronger  come nearer to the surface as the years passed  and it was almost bursting for expression now .  but still it had not quite come clear .   kane shifted restlessly and approached the ship .  it was almost complete  almost whole .  everything fitted just so .  almost .   for within it  far forward  was a hole a little larger than a man  and leading to that hole was a pathway a little wider than a man .  tomorrow that pathway would be filled with the last of the vitals  and before that was done the hole had to be filled  too .  but not with anything they planned .   kane moved still closer and no one paid any attention to him .  they were used to him .   there was a metal ladder that had to be climbed and a catwalk that had to be moved along to enter the last opening .  he knew where the opening was as exactly as if he had built the ship with his own hands .  he climbed the ladder and moved along the catwalk .  there was no one there at the mo     he was wrong .  one man .   that one said sharply     what are you doing here .     kane straightened and his vague eyes stared at the speaker .  he lifted his wrench and brought it down on the speaker s head lightly .  the man who was struck  and who had made no effort to ward off the blow  dropped  partly from the effect of the blow .   kane let him lie there  without concern .  the man would not remain unconscious for long  but long enough to allow kane to wriggle into the hole .  when the man revived he would recall nothing about kane or about the fact of his own unconsciousness .  there would simply be five minutes taken out of his life that he would never find and never miss .   it was dark in the hole and  of course  there was no ventilation  but kane paid no attention to that .  with the sureness of instinct  he clambered upward toward the hold that would receive him  then lay there  panting  fitting the cavity neatly  as though it were a womb .   in two hours they would begin inserting the last of the vitals  close the passage  and leave kane there  unknowingly .  kane would be the sole bit of flesh and blood in a thing of metal and ceramics and fuel .   kane was not afraid of being prematurely discovered .  no one in the project knew the hole was there .  the design didn t call for it .  the mechanics and construction men weren t aware of having put it in .   kane had arranged that entirely by himself .  he didn t know how he had arranged it but he knew he had .  he could watch his own influence without knowing how it was exerted .  take the man hammer  for instance  the leader of the project and the most clearly influenced .  of all the indistinct figures about kane  he was the least indistinct .  kane would be very aware of him at times  when he passed near him in his slow and hazy journeys about the grounds .  it was all that was necessary   passing near him .   kane recalled it had been so before  particularly with theoreticians .  when lise meitner decided to test for barium among the products of the neutron bombardment of uranium  kane had been there  an unnoticed plodder along a corridor nearby .   he had been picking up leaves and trash in a park in      when the young einstein had passed by  pondering .  einstein s steps had quickened with the impact of sudden thought .  kane felt it like an electric shock .   but he didn t know how it was done .  does a spider know architectural theory when it begins to construct its first web .   it went further back .  the day the young newton had stared at the moon with the dawn of a certain thought  kane had been there .  and further back still .     the panorama of new mexico  ordinarily deserted  was alive with human ants crawling about the metal shaft lancing upward .  this one was different from all the similar structures that had preceded it .   this would go free of earth more nearly than any other .  it would reach out and circle the moon before falling back .  it would be crammed with instruments that would photograph the moon and measure its heat emissions  probe for radioactivity  and test by microwave for chemical structure .  it would  by automation  do almost everything that could be expected of a manned vehicle .  and it would learn enough to make certain that the next ship sent out would be a manned vehicle .   except that  in a way  this first one was a manned vehicle after all .   there were representatives of various governments  of various industries  of various social and economic groupings .  there were television cameras and feature writers .   those who could not be there watched in their homes and heard numbers counted backward in painstaking monotone in the manner grown traditional in a mere three decades .   at zero the reaction motors came to life and ponderously the ship lifted .     kane heard the noise of the rushing gases  as though from a distance  and felt the gathering acceleration press against him .   he detached his mind  lifting it up and outward  freeing it from direct connection with his body in order that he might be unaware of the pain and discomfort .   dizzily  he knew his long journey was nearly over .  he would no longer have to maneuver carefully to avoid having people realize he was immortal .  he would no longer have to fade into the background  no longer wander eternally from place to place  changing names and personality  manipulating minds .   it had not been perfect  of course .  the myths of the wandering jew and the flying dutchman had arisen  but he was still here .  he had not been disturbed .   he could see his spot in the sky .  through the mass and solidity of the ship he could see it .  or not    see    really .  he didn t have the proper word .   he knew there was a proper word  though .  he could not say how he knew a fraction of the things he knew  except that as the centuries had passed he had gradually grown to know them with a sureness that required no reason .   he had begun as an ovum  or as something for which    ovum    was the nearest word he knew   deposited on earth before the first cities had been built by the wandering hunting creatures since called    men .     earth had been chosen carefully by his progenitor .  not every world would do .   what world would .  what was the criterion .  that he still didn t know .   does an ichneumon wasp study ornithology before it finds the one species of spider that will do for her eggs  and stings it just so in order that it may remain alive .   the ovum spilt him forth at length and he took the shape of a man and lived among men and protected himself against men .  and his one purpose was to arrange to have men travel along a path that would end with a ship and within the ship a hole and within the hole  himself .   it had taken eight thousand years of slow striving and stumbling .   the spot in the sky became sharper now as the ship moved out of the atmosphere .  that was the key that opened his mind .  that was the piece that completed the puzzle .   stars blinked within that spot that could not be seen by a man s eye unaided .  one in particular shone brilliantly and kane yearned toward it .  the expression that had been building within him for so long burst out now .      home     he whispered .   he knew .  does a salmon study cartography to find the headwaters of the fresh water stream in which years before it had been born .   the final step was taken in the slow maturing that had taken eight thousand years  and kane was no longer larval  but adult .   the adult kane fled from the human flesh that had protected the larva  and fled the ship  too .  it hastened onward  at inconceivable speeds  toward home  from which someday it  too  might set off on wanderings through space to fertilize some planet with its ovum .   it sped through space  giving no thought to the ship carrying an empty chrysalis .  it gave no thought to the fact that it had driven a whole world toward technology and space travel in order only that the thing that had been kane might mature and reach its fulfillment .   does a bee care what has happened to a flower when the bee has done and gone its way .              going through does a bee care .  makes me think of the many editors with whom i have dealt  and with the way in which they sometimes vanish into limbo .   there had been editors whom  for a period of time  i saw frequently  and with whom i felt quite close .  then  for one reason or another  they left their positions and vanished out of my ken .  i haven t seen horace gold for many years  for instance and i haven t seen james l .  quinn  who bought does a bee care .  and a few other stories of mine .   he had a southern accent  i remember  and was a delightful person and now i don t know where he is or even if he is still alive .     the next story  silly asses  is one that i had better say very little about or the commentary will be longer than the story .  i wrote it on july           and it was rejected by two different magazines before bob lowndes kindly made a home for it .  it appeared in the february      issue of future .       silly asses     naron of the long lived rigellian race was the fourth of his line to keep the galactic records .   he had the large book which contained the list of the numerous races throughout the galaxies that had developed intelligence  and the much smaller book that listed those races that had reached maturity and had qualified for the galactic federation .  in the first book  a number of those listed were crossed out  those that  for one reason or another  had failed .  misfortune  biochemical or biophysical shortcomings  social maladjustment took their toll .  in the smaller book  however  no member listed had yet blanked out .   and now naron  large and incredibly ancient  looked up as a messenger approached .      naron     said the messenger .     great one .         well  well  what is it .  less ceremony .          another group of organisms has attained maturity .         excellent .  excellent .  they are coming up quickly now .  scarcely a year passes without a new one .  and who are these .      the messenger gave the code number of the galaxy and the coordinates of the world within it .      ah  yes     said naron .     i know the world .     and in flowing script he noted it in the first book and transferred its name into the second  using  as was customary  the name by which the planet was known to the largest fraction of its populace .  he wrote  earth .   he said     these new creatures have set a record .  no other group has passed from intelligence to maturity so quickly .  no mistake  i hope .         none  sir     said the messenger .     they have attained to thermonuclear power  have they .         yes .  sir .         well  that s the criterion .     naron chuckled .     and soon their ships will probe out and contact the federation .         actually  great one     said the messenger  reluctantly     the observers tell us they have not yet penetrated space .      naron was astonished .     not at all .  not even a space station .         not yet  sir .         but if they have thermonuclear power  where then do they conduct their tests and detonations .         on their own planet  sir .      naron rose to his full twenty feet of height and thundered     on their own planet .         yes  sir .      slowly naron drew out his stylus and passed a line through the latest addition in the smaller book .  it was an unprecedented act  but  then  naron was very wise and could see the inevitable as well as anyone in the galaxy .      silly asses     he muttered .              this is another story with a moral  i m afraid .  but  you see  the nuclear danger had escalated when both the united states and the soviet union developed the fusion h bomb  and i was bitter again .     as      ended another turning point was upon me .  it came about in this wise   when walker  boyd  and i wrote our textbook we all spent school time freely on it  though naturally much of the work overflowed into evenings and weekends   . it was a scholarly endeavor and part of our job .   when i wrote the chemicals of life i felt that that  too  was a scholarly endeavor  and worked on it during school hours without any qualms .  i worked on other books of the sort during school hours  too .      i must stress .  again .  that i never worked on science fiction during school hours .   by the end of      i had in this fashion written seven nonfiction books for the general public .   meanwhile  though  james faulkner  the sympathetic dean  and burnham s .  walker  the sympathetic department head  had resigned their positions and there had come replacements who viewed me without sympathy .   dean faulkner   s replacement did not approve of my activities  and he had a point  i suppose .  in my eagerness to write nonfiction i had completely abandoned research  and he thought it was research on which the school s reputation depended .  to an extent that is true  but it is not always true  and in my case it wasn t .   we had a conference and i presented my view in a frank and straightforward manner  as my unworldly father had always taught me to do .      sir     i said    as a writer i am outstanding and my work will reflect luster on the school .  as a researcher  however  i am merely competent  and if there is one thing boston university school of medicine does not need  it is another merely competent researcher .      i supose  sic  i might have been more diplomatic  for that seemed to end the discussion .  i was taken off the payroll and the spring semester of      was the last in which i taught regular classes  after nine years at that game .   it didn t bother me very much .  concerning the school salary i cared nothing .  even after two pay raises it only came to sixty five hundred dollars a year  and my writing earned me considerably more than that already .   nor did i worry about losing the chance to do research  i had abandoned that already .  as for teaching  my nonfiction books  and even my science fiction  were forms of teaching that satisfied me with their great variety far more than teaching a limited subject matter could .  i didn t even fear missing the personal interaction of lecturing  since from      onward i had been establishing myself as a professional lecturer and was beginning to earn respectable fees in that manner .   however  it was the new dean s intention to deprive me of my title  too  and kick me out of the school altogether .  that i would not allow .  i maintained that i had earned tenure  for i had become an associate professor in       and could not be deprived of the title without cause .  the fight went on for two years and i won .  i retained the title  and i still retain the title right now .  i am still associate professor of biochemistry at boston university school of medicine .   what s more  the school is now happy about it .  my adversary retired at last and has since died .   he wasn t really a bad fellow  we just didn t see eye to eye .   and lest i give a false impression  let me state emphatically that  except for that one period involving just one or two people  the school  and everyone in it  has always treated me with perfect kindness .   i still do not teach and am not on the payroll  but that is my own choice .  i have been asked to come back in one way or another a number of times  but have explained why i cannot .  i do give lectures at school when requested  and on may           i gave the commencement address at the medical school so all is well  you see .   nevertheless  when i found i had time on my hands  with no classes to take care of and no commuting to do  i found that my impulse was to put that extra time into nonfiction  with which i had fallen completely and helplessly and hopelessly in love .   remember  too  that on october          sputnik i had gone into orbit  and in the excitement that followed i grew very fervent concerning the importance of writing science for the layman .  what s more  the publishers were now fiercely interested in it as well  and in no time at all i found i had been hounded into so many projects that it became difficult and even impossible to find time to work on major science fiction projects  and  alas  it has continued so to the present day .   mind you  i didn t quit science fiction altogether .  no year has passed that hasn t seen me write something  even if only a couple of short pieces .  on january           as i was getting ready to start my last semester and before the full impact of my decision had struck home  i wrote the following story for bob mills and his  alas  short lived venture .  it appeared in the may      issue .       buy jupiter     he was a simulacron  of course  but so cleverly contrived that the human beings dealing with him had long since given up thinking of the real energy entities  waiting in white hot blaze in their field enclosure    ship    miles from earth .   the simulacron  with a majestic golden beard and deep brown  wide set eyes  said gently     we understand your hesitations and suspicions  and we can only continue to assure you we mean you no harm .  we have  i think  presented you with proof that we inhabit the coronal haloes of o spectra stars  that your own sun is too weak for us  while your planets are of solid matter and therefore completely and eternally alien to us .      the terrestrial negotiator  who was secretary of science and  by common consent  had been placed in charge of negotiations with the aliens  said     but you have admitted we are now on one of your chief trade routes .         now that our new world of kimmonoshek has developed new fields of protonic fluid  yes .      the secretary said     well  here on earth  positions on trade routes can gain military importance out of proportion to their intrinsic value .  i can only repeat  then  that to gain our confidence you must tell us exactly why you need jupiter .      and as always  when that question or a form of it was asked  the simulacron looked pained .     secrecy is important .  if the lamberj people         exactly     said the secretary .     to us it sounds like war .  you and what you call the lamberj people      the simulacron said hurriedly     but we are offering you a most generous return .  you have only colonized the inner planets of your system and we are not interested in those .  we ask for the world you call jupiter  which  i understand  your people can never expect to live on  or even land on .  its size     he laughed indulgently     is too much for you .      the secretary  who disliked the air of condescension  said stiffly     the jovian satellites are practical sites for colonization  however  and we intend to colonize them shortly .         but the satellites will not be disturbed in any way .  they are yours in every sense of the word .  we ask only jupiter itself  a completely useless world to you  and for that the return we offer is generous .  surely you realize that we could take your jupiter  if we wished  without your permission .  it is only that we prefer payment and a legal treaty .  it will prevent disputes in the future .  as you see  i m being completely frank .      the secretary said stubbornly     why do you need jupiter .         the lamberj          are you at war with the lamberj .         it s not quite         because you see that if it is war and you establish some sort of fortified base on jupiter  the lamberj may  quite properly  resent that  and retaliate against us for granting you permission .  we cannot allow ourselves to be involved in such a situation .         nor would i ask you to be involved .  my word that no harm would come to you .  surely     he kept coming back to it     the return is generous .  enough power boxes each year to supply your world with a full year of power requirement .      the secretary said     on the understanding that future increases in power consumption will be met .         up to a figure five times the present total .  yes .         well  then  as i have said  i am a high official of the government and have been given considerable powers to deal with you but not infinite power .  i  myself  am inclined to trust you  but i could not accept your terms without understanding exactly why you want jupiter .  if the explanation is plausible and convincing  i could perhaps persuade our government and  through them  our people  to make the agreement .  if i tried to make an agreement without such an explanation  i would simply be forced out of office and earth would refuse to honor the agreement .  you could then  as you say  take jupiter by force  but you would be in illegal possession and you have said you don t wish that .      the simulacron clicked its tongue impatiently .     i cannot continue forever in this petty bickering .  the lamberj     again he stopped  then said     have i your word of honor that this is all not a device inspired by the lamberj people to delay us until         my word of honor     said the secretary .   the secretary of science emerged  mopping his forehead and looking ten years younger .  he said softly     i told him his people could have it as soon as i obtained the president s formal approval .  i don t think he ll object  or congress  either .  good lord  gentlemen  think of it  free power at our fingertips in return for a planet we could never use in any case .      the secretary of defense  growing purplish with objection  said     but we had agreed that only a mizzarett lamberj war could explain their need for jupiter .  under those circumstances  and comparing their military potential with ours  a strict neutrality is essential .         but there is no war  sir     said the secretary of science .     the simulacron presented an alternate explanation of their need for jupiter so rational and plausible that i accepted at once .  i think the president will agree with me  and you gentlemen  too  when you understand .  in fact  i have here their plans for the new jupiter  as it will soon appear .      the others rose from their seats  clamoring .      a new jupiter .     gasped the secretary of defense .      not so different from the old  gentlemen     said the secretary of science .     here are the sketches provided in form suitable for observation by matter beings such as ourselves .      he laid them down .  the familiar banded planet was there before them on one of the sketches  yellow  pale green  and light brown with curled white streaks here and there and all against the speckled velvet background of space .  but across the bands were streaks of blackness as velvet as the background  arranged in a curious pattern .      that     said the secretary of science     is the day side of the planet .  the night side is shown in this sketch .      there  jupiter was a thin crescent enclosing darkness  and within that darkness were the same thin streaks arranged in similar pattern  but in a phosphorescent glowing orange this time .       the marks     said the secretary of science     are a purely optical phenomenon  i am told  which will not rotate with the planet  but will remain static in its atmospheric fringe .         but what is it .     asked the secretary of commerce .     you see     said the secretary of science     our solar system is now on one of their major trade routes .  as many as seven of their ships pass within a few hundred million miles of the system in a single day  and each ship has the major planets under telescopic observation as they pass .  tourist curiosity  you know .  solid planets of any size are a marvel to them .         what has that to do with these marks .         that is one form of their writing .  translated  those marks read   use mizzarett ergone vertices for health and glowing heat .          you mean jupiter is to be an advertising billboard .     exploded the secretary of defense .      right .  the lamberj people  it seems  produce a competing ergone tablet  which accounts for the mizzarett anxiety to establish full legal ownership of jupiter in case of lamberj lawsuits .  fortunately  the mizzaretts are novices at the advertising game  it appears .         why do you say that .     asked the secretary of the interior .      why  they neglected to set up a series of options on the other planets .  the jupiter billboard will be advertising our system  as well as their own project .  and when the competing lamberj people come storming in to check on the mizzarett title to jupiter  we will have saturn to sell to them .  with its rings .  as we will be easily able to explain to them  the rings will make saturn much the better spectacle .         and therefore     said the secretary of the treasury  suddenly beaming     worth a much better price .      and they all suddenly looked very cheerful .              buy jupiter was not my original title for the story .  i am usually indignant when an editor changes the title i have given a story  and change it back when it appears in one of my own collections and then mutter about it in the commentary .     but not this time .   i called the story it pays  an utterly undistinguished title .  bob mills  without even consulting me  quietly changed it to buy jupiter and i fell in love with that as soon as the change came to my attention .  to a punster like myself  it is the perfect title for the story so perfect that i have given it to this entire collection  which  as you know  is buy jupiter and other stories .   bob mills gets the credit .     during those early years in which  with a certain amount of uneasy horror  i was watching my science fiction writing begin to fall off  i would occasionally get into a state of blue funk .   could it be that i could no longer write science fiction at all .  suppose i wanted to write science fiction   could i .   i was driving down to marshfield  massachusetts  on july           to begin a three week vacation which i dreaded    dread all vacations   . i deliberately set about thinking up a plot to keep my mind off that vacation and to see if i could .  a statue for father was the result .  i sold it to a new magazine  satellite science fiction  and it appeared in the february      issue .       a statue for father     first time .  really .  but of course you have heard of it .  yes  i was sure you had .   if you re really interested in the discovery  believe me  i ll be delighted to tell you .  it s a story i ve always liked to tell  but not many people give me the chance .  i ve even been advised to keep the story under wraps .  it interferes with the legends growing up about my father .   still  i think the truth is valuable .  there s a moral to it .  a man can spend his life devoting his energies solely to the satisfaction of his own curiosity and then  quite accidentally  without ever intending anything of the sort  find himself a benefactor of humanity .   dad was just a theoretical physicist  devoted to the investigation of time travel .  i don t think he ever gave a thought to what time travel might mean to homo sapiens .  he was just curious about the mathematical relationships that governed the universe  you see .   hungry .  all the better .  i imagine it will take nearly half an hour .  they will do it properly for an official such as yourself .  it   s a matter of pride .   to begin with  dad was poor as only a university professor can be poor .  eventually  though  he became wealthy .  in the last years before his death he was fabulously rich  and as for myself and my children and grandchildren well  you can see for yourself .   they ve put up statues to him  too .  the oldest is on the hillside right here where the discovery was made .  you can just see it out the window .  yes .  can you make out the inscription .  well  we re standing at a bad angle .  no matter .   by the time dad got into time travel research the whole problem had been given up by most physicists as a bad job .  it had begun with a splash when the chrono funnels were first set up .   actually  they re not much to see .  they re completely irrational and uncontrollable .  what you see is distorted and wavery   two feet across at the most  and it vanishes quickly .  trying to focus on the past is like trying to focus on a feather caught in a hurricane that has gone mad .   they tried poking grapples into the past but that was just as unpredictable .  sometimes it was carried off successfully for a few seconds with one man leaning hard against the grapple .  but more often a pile driver couldn t push it through .  nothing was ever obtained out of the past until   well  i ll get to that .   after fifty years of no progress  physicists just lost interest .  the operational technique seemed a complete blind alley  a dead end .  i can t honestly say i blame them as i look back on it .  some of them even tried to show that the funnels didn t actually expose the past  but there had been too many sightings of living animals through the funnels animals now extinct .   anyway  when time travel was almost forgotten  dad stepped in .  he talked the government into giving him a grant to set up a chrono funnel of his own  and tackled the matter all over again .   i helped him in those days .  i was fresh out of college  with my own doctorate in physics .   however  our combined efforts ran into bad trouble after a year or so .  dad had difficulty in getting his grant renewed .  industry wasn t interested and the university decided he was besmirching their reputation by being so single minded in investigating a dead field .  the dean of the graduate school  who understood only the financial end of scholarship  began by hinting that he switch to more lucrative fields and ended by forcing him out .   of course  the dean still alive and still counting grant dollars when dad died probably felt quite foolish  i imagine  when dad left the school a million dollars free and clear in his will  with a codicil canceling the bequest on the ground that the dean lacked vision .  but that was merely posthumous revenge .  for years before that    don t wish to dictate  but please don t have any more of the breadsticks .  the clear soup  eaten slowly to prevent a too sharp appetite  will do .   anyway  we managed somehow .  dad kept the equipment we had bought with the grant money  moved it out of the university and set it up here .   those first years on our own were brutal  and i kept urging him to give up .  he never would .  he was indomitable  always managing to find a thousand dollars somewhere when we needed it .   life went on  but he allowed nothing to interfere with his research .  mother died  dad mourned and returned to his task .  i married  had a son  then a daughter  couldn t always be at his side .  he carried on without me .  he broke his leg and worked with the cast impeding him for months .   so i give him an the credit .  i helped  of course .  i did consulting work on the side and carried on negotiation with washington .  but he was the life and soul of the project .   despite an that  we weren t getting anywhere .  an the money we managed to scrounge might just as well have been poured into one of the chrono funnels not that it would have passed through .   after an  we never once managed to get a grapple through a funnel .  we came near on only one occasion .  we had the grapple about two inches out the other end when focus changed .  it snapped off clean and somewhere in the mesozoic there is a man made piece of steel rod rusting on a riverbank .   then one day  the crucial day  the focus held for ten long minutes something for which the odds were less than one in a trillion .  lord  the frenzies of excitement we experienced as we set up the cameras .  we could see living creatures just the other side of the funnel  moving energetically .   then  to top it off  the chrono funnel grew permeable  until you might have sworn there was nothing but air between the past and ourselves .  the low permeability must have been connected with the long holding of focus  but we ve never been able to prove that it did .   of course  we had no grapple handy  wouldn t you know .  but the low permeability was clear enough because something just fen through  moving from the then into the now .  thunderstruck  acting simply on blind instinct  i reached forward and caught it .   at that moment we lost focus  but it no longer left us embittered and despairing .  we were both staring in wild surmise at what i held .  it was a mass of caked and dried mud  shaved off clean where it had struck the borders of the chrono funnel  and on the mud cake were fourteen eggs about the size of duck eggs .   i said     dinosaur eggs .  do you suppose they really are .      dad said     maybe .  we can t tell for sure .         unless we hatch them     i said in sudden  almost uncontrollable excitement .  i put them down as though they were platinum .  they felt warm with the heat of the primeval sun .  i said     dad  if we hatch them  we ll have creatures that have been extinct for over a hundred million years .  it will be the first case of something actually brought out of the past .  if we announce this      i was thinking of the grants we could get  of the publicity  of all that it would mean to dad .  i was seeing the look of consternation on the dean s face .   but dad took a different view of the matter .  he said firmly .     not a word  son .  if this gets out  we ll have twenty research teams on the trail of the chrono funnels  cutting off my advance .  no  once i ve solved the riddle of the funnels  you can make all the announcements you want .  until then we keep silent .  son  don t look like that .  i ll have the answer in a year .  i m sure of it .   i was a little less confident  but those eggs  i felt convinced  would arm us with all the proof we d need .  i set up a large oven at bloodheat  i circulated air and moisture .  i rigged up an alarm that would sound at the first signs of motion within the eggs .   they hatched at   a . m .  nineteen days later  and there they were fourteen wee kangaroos with greenish scales  clawed hindlegs  plump little thighs  and thin  whiplash tails .   i thought at first they were tyrannosauri  but they were too small for that species of dinosaur .  months passed  and i could see they weren t going to grow any larger than moderate sized dogs .   dad seemed disappointed  but i held on  hoping he would let me use them for publicity  . one died before maturity and one was killed in a scuffle .  but the other twelve survived five males and seven females .  i fed them on chopped carrots  boiled eggs  and milk  and grew quite fond of them .  they were fearfully stupid and yet gentle .  and they were truly beautiful .  their scales  oh  well  it s silly to describe them .  those original publicity pictures have made their rounds .  though  come to think of it  i don t know about mars   oh  there  too .  well  good .   but it took a long time for the pictures to make an impression on the public  let alone a sight of the creatures in the flesh .  dad remained intransigent .  a year passed  two  and finally three .  we had no luck whatsoever with the chrono funnels .  the one break was not repeated  and still dad would not give in .   five of our females laid eggs and soon i had over fifty of the creatures on my hands .      what shall we do with them .     i demanded .     kill them off     he said .   well  i couldn t do that  of course .  henri  is it almost ready .  good .   we had reached the end of our resources when it happened .  no more money was available .  i had tried everywhere  and met with consistent rebuffs .  i was even glad because it seemed to me that dad would have to give in now .  but with a chin that was firm and indomitably set  he coolly set up another experiment .   i swear to you that if the accident had not happened the truth would have eluded us forever .  humanity would have been deprived of one of its greatest boons .   it happens that way sometimes .  perkin spots a purple tinge in his gunk and comes up with aniline dyes .  remsen puts a contaminated finger to his lips and discovers saccharin .  goodyear drops a mixture on the stove and finds the secret of vulcanization .   with us  it was a half grown dinosaur wandering into the main research lab .  they had become so numerous i hadn t been able to keep track of them .   the dinosaur stepped right across two contact points which happened to be open just at the point where the plaque immortalizing the event is now located .  i m convinced that such a happenstance couldn t occur again in a thousand years .  there was a blinding flash  a blistering short circuit  and the chrono funnel which had just been set up vanished in a rainbow of sparks .   even at the moment  really  we didn t know exactly what we had .  all we knew was that the creature had short circuited and perhaps destroyed two hundred thousand dollars worth of equipment and that we were completely ruined financially .  all we had to show for it was one thoroughly roasted dinosaur .  we were slightly scorched ourselves  but the dinosaur got the full concentration of field energies .  we could smell it .  the air was saturated with its aroma .  dad and i looked at each other in amazement .  i picked it up gingerly in a pair of tongs .  it was black and charred on the outside  but the burnt scales crumbled away at a touch  carrying the skin with it .  under the char was white  firm flesh that resembled chicken .   i couldn t resist tasting it  and it resembled chicken about the way jupiter resembles an asteroid .   believe me or not  with our scientific work reduced to rubble about us  we sat there in seventh heaven and devoured dinosaur .  parts were burnt  parts were nearly raw .  it hadn t been dressed .  but we didn t stop until we had picked the bones clean .   finally i said     dad  we ve got to raise them gloriously and systematically for food purposes .      dad had to agree .  we were completely broke .   i got a loan from the bank by inviting the president to dinner and feeding him dinosaur .   it has never failed to work .  no one who has once tasted what we now call    dinachicken    can rest content with ordinary fare .  a meal without dinachicken is a meal we choke down to keep body and soul together .  only dinachicken is food .   our family still owns the only herd of dinachickens in existence and we are the only suppliers for the worldwide chain of restaurants this is the first and oldest which has grown up about it .   poor dad .  he was never happy  except for those unique moments when he was actually eating dinachicken .  he continued working on the chrono funnels and so did twenty other research teams which  as he had predicted would happen  jumped in .  nothing ever came of any of it  though  to this day .  nothing except dinachicken .   ah  pierre  thank you .  a superlative job  now  sir  if you will allow me to carve .  no salt  now  and just a trace of the sauce .  that   s right .  .  .  . ah  that is precisely the expression i always see on the face of a man who experiences his first taste of the delight .   a grateful humanity contributed fifty thousand dollars to have the statue on the hillside put up  but even that tribute failed to make dad happy .   all he could see was the inscription  the man who gave dinachicken to the world .   you see  to his dying day  he wanted only one thing  to find the secret of time travel .  for all that he was a benefactor of humanity  he died with his curiosity unsatisfied .              my original title had been benefactor of humanity  which i thought carried a fine flavor of irony  and i chafed when leo margulies of satellite changed that title .  when the saturday evening post asked permission to reprint the story  and it appeared in the march april      issue of that magazine  i made it a condition that they restore the original title .  but then  when i saw my own title in print  i thought about it and decided that leo s title was better .  so it appears here as a statue for father again .     bob mills  by the way  whom i mentioned in connection with buy jupiter  was a very close friend of mine when he was working with f   sf and with venture .  he is not one of those with whom i have lost contact  either .  he has sold his soul to the devil and is now an agent  but we see each other now and then and are as friendly as ever .   it was bob who contributed to my switch to nonfiction  too .  since i hated writing research pieces  i began  in       to write imaginative pieces on chemistry for the journal of chemical education .  i had done about half a dozen before it occurred to me that i was getting nothing for them and was not reaching my audience .   i began writing nonfiction articles for the science fiction magazines  therefore  articles that gave me far more scope and far more variety than any scholarly journal could .  the first of these was hemoglobin and the universe  which appeared in the february      astounding .   in september       however  bob mills called me up and asked if i would do a regular science article for venture .  i agreed with alacrity and the first of these  fecundity limited  appeared in the january      venture .  alas  venture lasted only a very few more issues before folding  but i was then asked to do the same column for f   sf .  the first of these was dust of ages  which appeared in the november      issue of that magazine .   the f   sf series lasted and flourished .  the request had been for a fifteen hundred word column at first and that was the length of all those in venture and the first in f   sf .  the request came quickly to raise the wordage to four thousand and  beginning with catching up with newton  in the december      issue of f   sf  they were the longer length .   the f   sf series has been amazingly successful .  my two hundredth article in the series appeared in the june      issue of f   sf .  so far i have not missed an issue  and it may be the longest series of items by one author  other than the editor  ever to have appeared in a science fiction magazine .  these articles are periodically collected by doubleday into books of essays  of which at this time of writing there have been eleven .   most important of all  though  is the fun i get out of these monthly articles .  to this day i get more pleasure out of them than out of any other writing assignment i get .  i am constantly anywhere from one to two months ahead of deadline  because i can t wait  but the editors don t seem to mind .   in a way it was bob mills who helped establish my present article writing style  one of intense informality that has managed to leak across into my fiction collections too  as this book bears witness   . while i wrote that column for him he constantly referred to me as    the god doctor     while i called him    the kindly editor     and we had fun kidding each other in the footnotes till he resigned his post .   no  that was not cause and effect .    anyway  the articles helped confirm me in my nonfiction and made it even harder to get to fiction .  bob  you must understand  did not approve of my not writing fiction .  sometimes he suggested plots for stories in an attempt to lure me into writing  and sometimes i liked his suggestions .  for instance  one of his suggestions ended as unto the fourth generation  which appeared in the  april      issue of f   sf and was then included in nightfall and other stories .  that story is one of my  personal favorites .   i thought he had suggested another winner when i wrote up one of his ideas in rain  rain  go away .  i wrote it on november          submitted to him on november    and had it rejected on november   .  kindly editor  indeed .   eventually i found a home for it  though  and it appeared in the september      issue of fantastic universe science fiction .       rain  rain  go away        there she is again     said lillian wright as she adjusted the venetian blinds carefully .     there she is  george .         there who is .     asked her husband  trying to get satisfactory contrast on the tv so that he might settle down to the ball game .      mrs .  sakkaro     she said  and then  to forestall her husband s inevitable    who s that .     added hastily     the new neighbors  for goodness sake .         oh .         sunbathing .  always sunbathing .  i wonder where her boy is .  he s usually out on a nice day like this  standing in that tremendous yard of theirs and throwing the ball against the house .  did you ever see him  george .         i ve heard him .  it s a version of the chinese water torture .  bang on the wall  bill on the ground  smack in the hand .  bang  bill  smack  bang  bill         he s a nice boy  quiet and well behaved .  i wish tommie would make friends with him .  he s the right age  too  just about ten  i should say .         i didn t know tommie was backward about making friends .         well  it s hard with the sakkaros  they keep so to themselves .  i don t even know what mr .  sakkaro does .         why should you .  it s not really anyone s business what he does .         it s odd that i never see him go to work .         no one ever sees me go to work .         you stay home and write .  what does he do .         i dare say mrs .  sakkaro knows what mr .  sakkaro does and is all upset because she doesn t know  what i do         oh  george .     lillian retreated from the window and glanced with distaste at the television .   schoendienst was at bat .      i think we should make an effort  the neighborhood should .         what kind of an effort .     george was comfortable on the couch now  with a king size coke in his hand  freshly opened and frosted with moisture .      to get to know them .         well  didn t you  when she first moved in .  you said you called .         i said hello but  well  she d just moved in and the house was still upset  so that s all it could be  just hello .  it s been two months now and it s still nothing more than hello  sometimes .     she s so odd .         is she .         she s always looking at the sky  i ve seen her do it a hundred times and she s never been out when it s the least bit cloudy .  once  when the boy was out playing  she called to him to come in  shouting that it was going to rain .  i happened to hear her and i thought  good lord  wouldn t you know and me with a wash on the line  so i hurried out and  you know  it was broad sunlight .  oh  there were some clouds  but nothing  really .         did it rain  eventually .         of course not .  i just had to run out in the yard for nothing .      george was lost amid a couple of base hits and a most embarrassing bobble that meant a run .  when the excitement was over and the pitcher was trying to regain his composure  george called out after lillian  who was vanishing into the kitchen     well  since they re from arizona  i dare say they don t know rainclouds from any other kind .      lillian came back into the living room with a patter of high heels .     from where .         from arizona  according to tommie .         how did tommie know .         he talked to their boy  in between ball chucks  i guess  and he told tommie they came from arizona and then the boy was called in .  at least  tommie says it might have been arizona  or maybe alabama or some place like that .  you know tommie and his nontotal recall .  but if they re that nervous about the weather  i guess it s arizona and they don t know what to make of a good rainy climate like ours .         but why didn t you ever tell me .         because tommie only told me this morning and because i thought he must have told you already and  to tell the absolute truth  because i thought you could just manage to drag out a normal existence even if you never found out .  wow      the ball went sailing into the right field stands and that was that for the pitcher .   lillian went back to the venetian blinds and said     i ll simply just have to make her acquaintance .  she looks very nice .   oh  lord  look at that  george .      george was looking at nothing but the tv .   lillian said     i know she s staring at that cloud .  and now she ll be going in .  honestly .        george was out two days later on a reference search in the library and came home with a load of books .  lillian greeted him jubilantly .   she said     now  you re not doing anything tomorrow .         that sounds like a statement  not a question .         it is a statement .  we re going out with the sakkaros to murphy s park .      with         with the next door neighbors  george .  haw can you never remember the name .         i m gifted .  how did it happen .         i just went up to their house this morning and rang the bell .         that easy .         it wasn t easy .  it was hard .  i stood there  jittering  with my finger on the doorbell  till i thought that ringing the bell would be easier than having the door open and being caught standing there like a fool .         and she didn t kick you out .         no .  she was sweet as she could be .  invited me in  knew who i was  said she was so glad i had come to visit .  yau know .         and you suggested we go to murphy s park .         yes .  i thought if i suggested something that would let the children have fun  it would be easier for her to go along with it .  she wouldn t want to spoil a chance for her boy .         a mother s psychology .         but you should see her home .         ah .  you had a reason for all this .  it comes out .  you wanted the cook s tour .  but  please  spare me the color scheme details .  i m not interested in the bedspreads  and the size of the closets is a topic with which i can dispense .      it was the secret of their happy marriage that lillian paid no attention to george .  she went into the color scheme details  was most meticulous about the bedspreads  and gave him an inch by inch description of closet size .      and clean .  i have never seen any place so spotless .         if you get to know her  then  she ll be setting you impossible standards and you ll have to drop her in self defense .         her kitchen     said lillian  ignoring him     was so spanking clean you just couldn t believe she ever used it .  i asked for a drink of water and she held the glass underneath the tap and poured slowly so that not one drop fell in the sink itself .  it wasn t affectation .  she did it so casually that i just knew she always did it that way .  and when she gave me the glass she held it with a clean napkin .  just hospital sanitary .         she must be a lot of trouble to herself .  did she agree to come with us right off .         well not right off .  she called to her husband about what the weather forecast was  and he said that the newspapers all said it would be fair tomorrow but that he was waiting for the latest report on the radio .         all the newspapers said so  eh .         of course  they all just print the official weather forecast  so they would all agree .  but i think they do subscribe to all the newspapers .  at least i   ve watched the bundle the newsboy leaves         there isn t much you miss  is there .         anyway     said lillian severely     she called up the weather bureau and had them tell her the latest and she called it out to her husband and they said they d go  except they said they d phone us if there were any unexpected changes in the weather .         all right .  then we ll go .      the sakkaros were young and pleasant  dark and handsome .  in fact  as they came down the long walk from their home to where the wright automobile was parked  george leaned toward his wife and breathed into her ear     so he s the reason .         i wish he were     said lillian .     is that a handbag he s carrying .         pocket radio .  to listen to weather forecasts  i bet .     the sakkaro boy came running after them  waving  something which turned out to be an aneroid barometer  and all three got into the back seat .  conversation was turned on and lasted  with neat give and take on impersonal subjects  to murphy s park .   the sakkaro boy was so polite and reasonable that even tommie wright  wedged between his parents in the front seat  was subdued by example into a semblance of civilization .  lillian couldn t recall when she had spent so serenely pleasant a drive .   she was not the least disturbed by the fact that  barely to be heard under the flow of the conversation  mr .  sakkaro s small radio was on  and she never actually saw him put it occasionally to his ear .   it was a beautiful day at murphy s park  hot and dry without being too hot  and with a cheerfully bright sun in a blue  blue sky .  even mr .  sakkaro  though he inspected every quarter of the heavens with a careful eye and then stared piercingly at the barometer  seemed to have no fault to find .  i  lillian ushered the two boys to the amusement section and bought enough tickets to allow one ride for each on every variety of centrifugal thrill that the park offered .      please     she had said to a protesting mrs .  sakkaro     let this be my treat .  i ll let you have your turn next i time .      when she returned  george was alone .     where     she began .      just down there at the refreshment stand .  i told them i d wait here for you and we would join them .     he sounded gloomy .      anything wrong .         no  not really  except that i think he must be independently wealthy .         what .         i don t know what he does for a living .  i hinted         now who s curious .         i was doing it for you .  he said he s just a student of human nature .         how philosophical .  that would explain all those newspapers .         yes  but with a handsome  wealthy man next door  it looks as though i ll have impossible standards set for me  too .         don t be silly .         and he doesn t come from arizona .         he doesn t .         i said i heard he was from arizona .  he looked so surprised  it was obvious he didn t .  then he laughed and asked if he had an arizona accent .      lillian said thoughtfully     he has some kind of accent  you know .  there are lots of spanish ancestry people in the southwest  so he could still be from arizona .  sakkaro could be a spanish name .         sounds japanese to me .   come on  they re waving .  oh  good lord  look what they ve bought .      the sakkaros were each holding three sticks of cotton candy  huge swirls of pink foam consisting of threads of sugar dried out of frothy syrup that had been whipped about in a warm vessel .  it melted sweetly in the mouth and left one feeling sticky .   the sakkaros held one out to each wright  and out of politeness the wrights accepted .   they went down the midway  tried their hand at darts  at the kind of poker game where balls were rolled into holes  at knocking wooden cylinders off pedestals .  they took pictures of themselves and recorded their voices and tested the strength of their handgrips .   eventually they collected the youngsters  who had been reduced to a satisfactorily breathless state of roiled up insides  and the sakkaros ushered theirs off instantly to the refreshment stand .  tommie hinted the extent of his pleasure at the possible purchase of a hot dog and george tossed him a quarter .  he ran off  too .      frankly     said george     i prefer to stay here .  if i see them biting away at another cotton candy stick i ll turn green and sicken on the spot .  if they haven t had a dozen apiece  i ll eat a dozen myself .         i know  and they re buying a handful for the child now .         i offered to stand sakkaro a hamburger and he just looked grim and shook his head .  not that a hamburger s much  but after enough cotton candy  it ought to be a feast .         i know .  i offered her an orange drink and the way she jumped when she said no  you d think i d thrown it in her face .   still  i suppose they ve never been to a place like this before and they ll need time to adjust to the novelty .  they ll fill up on cotton candy and then never eat it again for ten years .         well  maybe .     they strolled toward the sakkaros .     you know  lil  it s clouding up .      mr .  sakkaro had the radio to his ear and was looking anxiously toward the west .      uh oh     said george     he s seen it .  one gets you fifty  he ll want to go home .      all three sakkaros were upon him  polite but insistent .  they were sorry  they had had a wonderful time  a marvelous time  the wrights would have to be their guests as soon as it could be managed  but now  really  they had to go home .  it looked stormy .  mrs .  sakkaro wailed that all the forecasts had been for fair weather .   george tried to console them .     it s hard to predict a local thunderstorm  but even if it were to come  and it mightn t  it wouldn t last more than half an hour on the outside .      at which comment  the sakkaro youngster seemed on the verge of tears  and mrs .  sakkaro s hand  holding a handkerchief  trembled visibly .      let s go home     said george in resignation .     the drive back seemed to stretch interminably .  there was no conversation to speak of .  mr .  sakkaro s radio was quite loud now as he switched from station to station  catching a weather report every time .  they were mentioning    local thundershowers    now .   the sakkaro youngster piped up that the barometer was falling  and mrs .  sakkaro  chin in the palm of her hand  stared dolefully at the sky and asked if george could not drive faster  please .      it does look rather threatening  doesn t it .     said lillian in a polite attempt to share their guests  attitude .  but then george heard her mutter     honestly .     under her breath .   a wind had sprung up  driving the dust of the weeks dry road before it  when they entered the street on which they lived  and the leaves rustled ominously .  lightning flickered .   george said     you ll be indoors in two minutes  friends .  we ll make it .      he pulled up at the gate that opened onto the sakkaro s spacious front yard and got out of the car to open the back door .  he thought he felt a drop .  they were just in time .   the sakkaros tumbled out  faces drawn with tension  muttering thanks  and started off toward their long front walk at a dead run .      honestly     began lillian     you would think they were      the heavens opened and the rain came down in giant drops as though some celestial dam had suddenly burst .  the top of their car was pounded with a hundred drum sticks  and halfway to their front door the sakkaros stopped and looked despairingly upward .   their faces blurred as the rain hit  blurred and shrank and ran together .  all three shriveled  collapsing within their clothes  which sank down into three sticky wet heaps .   and while the wrights sat there  transfixed with horror  lillian found herself unable to stop the completion of her remark        made of sugar and afraid they would melt .                  my book the early asimov did sufficiently well for doubleday to decide to do other  similar books by other writers who have been writing long enough to have had an early period of some worth .  the next book in the series is the early del rey  doubleday        by my good old friend lester del rey .   lester doesn t have his book filled with autobiographical minutiae  as i do  but has meant his book to be a more sober device for describing his views on how to write science fiction .   i would cheerfully do the same except that i don t know how to write science fiction  or anything else .  what i do  i do by blind instinct .   however  something does occasionally occur to me  and one little tiny rule comes up in connection with rain  rain  go away .  if you re going to write a story  avoid contemporary references .  they date a story and they have no staying power .  the story mentions schoendienst as having been at bat during a baseball game .  well  who the heck was schoendienst .  do you remember .  does the name have meaning to you a decade and a half later .   and if it does  is there any point in reminding the reader that the story is a decade and a half old .     of course  i spend pages telling you how old my stories are and everything else about them  but that s different .  you  re all friends of mine .     the drift to nonfiction continued .  in the spring of      leon svirsky of basic books  inc .   persuaded me to do a large book to be called the intelligent man s guide to science  which was published in      .  it was my first real success in the nonfiction field .  it got numerous favorable reviews  and my annual income suddenly doubled .   i wasn t doing it all primarily for money  you understand  but my family was growing and i wasn t going to throw money away  either .  so there was again that much less urge to return to fiction .     frederik pohl  who had succeeded horace gold as editor of galaxy  tried to lure a story out of me in march      by sending me a cover painting he intended to run  and asked me to write a story about it .     you have the cover .     he said     so it will be easy .      no  it wasn t .  i looked at the cover  which featured a large  sad  space helmeted face  with several crude crosses in the background  and with a space helmet balanced on each cross .  i could make nothing of it .  i would have told fred this  but he was an old friend  and i didn t want to break his heart with the knowledge that there was something i couldn t do .  so i made a supreme effort and wrote the following  which appeared in the august      galaxy .       founding father     the original combination of catastrophes had taken place five years ago   five revolutions of this planet  hc     d by the charts  and nameless otherwise .  six plus revolutions of earth  but who was counting anymore .   if the men back home knew  they might say it was a heroic fight  an epic of the galactic corps  five men against a hostile world  holding their bitter own for five  or six plus  years .  and now they were dying  the battle lost after all .  three were in final coma  a fourth had his yellow tinged eyeballs still open  and a fifth was yet on his feet .   but it was no question of heroism at all .  it had been five men fighting off boredom and despair and maintaining their metallic bubble of livability only for the most unheroic reason that there was nothing else to do while life remained .   if any of them felt stimulated by the battle  he never mentioned it .  after the first year they stopped talking of rescue  and after the second a moratorium descended on the word    earth .      but one word remained always present .  if unspoken it had to be found in their thoughts     ammonia .      it had come first while the landing was being scratched out  against all odds  on limping motors and in a battered space can .   you allow for bad breaks  of course  you expect a certain number   but one at a time .  a stellar flare fries out the hypercircuits   that can be repaired  given time .  a meteorite disaligns the feeder valves they can be straightened  given time .  a trajectory is miscalculated under tension and a momentarily unbearable acceleration tears out the jump antennae and dulls the senses of every man on board but antennae can be replaced and senses will recover  given time .   the chances are one in countless many that all three will happen at once  and still less that they will all happen during a particularly tricky landing when the one necessary currency for the correction of all errors  time  is the one thing that is most lacking .   the cruiser john hit that one chance in countless many  and it made a final landing  for it would never lift off a planetary surface again .   that it had landed essentially intact was itself a near miracle .  the five were given life for some years at least .  beyond that  only the blundering arrival of another ship could help  but no one expected that .  they had had their life s share of coincidences  they knew  and all had been bad .   that was that .  and the key word was    ammonia .     with the surface spiraling upward  and death  mercifully quick  facing them at considerably better than even odds  chou somehow had time to note the absorption spectrograph  which was registering raggedly .      ammonia     he cried out .  the others heard but there was no time to pay attention .  there was only the wrenching fight against a quick death for the sake of a slow one .   when they landed finally  on sandy ground with sparse bluish  bluish .   vegetation  reedy grass  stunted treelike objects with blue bark and no leaves  no sign of animal life  and with a greenish  greenish .   cloud streaked sky above the word came back to haunt them .      ammonia .     said petersen heavily .  chou said     four per cent .         impossible     said petersen .  but it wasn t .  the books didn t say impossible .  what the galactic corps had discovered was that a planet of a certain mass and volume and a certain temperature was an ocean planet and had one of two atmospheres  nitrogen  oxygen or nitrogen  carbon dioxide .  in the former case  life was advanced  in the latter  it was primitive .   no one checked beyond mass  volume  and temperature any longer .  one took the atmosphere  one or the other of them  for granted .  but the books didn t say it had to be so  just that it always was so .  other atmospheres were thermodynamically possible  but extremely unlikely  so they weren t found in actual practice .   until now .  the men of the cruiser john had found one and were bathed for the rest of such life as they could eke out by a nitrogen carbon dioxide ammonia atmosphere .     the men converted their ship into an underground bubble of earth type surroundings .  they could not lift off the surface  nor could they drive a communicating beam through hyperspace  but all else was salvageable .  to make up for inefficiencies in the cycling system  they could even tap the planet s own water and air supply  within limits  provided  of course  they subtracted the ammonia .   they organized exploring parties since their suits were in excellent condition and it passed the time .  the planet was harmless  no animal life  sparse plant life everywhere .  blue  always blue  ammoniated chlorophyll  ammoniated protein .   they set up laboratories  analyzed the plant components  studied microscopic sections  compiled vast volumes of findings .  they tried growing native plants in ammonia free atmosphere and failed .  they made themselves into geologists and studied the planet s crust  astronomers  and studied the spectrum of the planet s sun .   barr  re would say sometimes     eventually  the corps will reach this planet again and we ll leave a legacy of knowledge for them .  it s a unique planet after all .  there might not be another earth type with ammonia in all the milky way .         great     said sandropoulos bitterly .     what luck for us .      sandropoulos worked out the thermodynamics of the situation .      a metastable system     he said .     the ammonia disappears steadily through geochemical oxidation that forms nitrogen  the plants utilize nitrogen and re form ammonia  adapting themselves to the presence of ammonia .  if the rate of plant formation of ammonia dropped two per cent  a declining spiral would set in .  plant life would wither  reducing the ammonia still further  and so on .         you mean if we killed enough plant life     said vlassov     we could wipe out the ammonia .         if we had air sleds and wide angle blasters  and a year to work in  we might     said sandropoulos     but we haven t and there s a better way .  if we could get our own plants going  the formation of oxygen through photosynthesis would increase the rate of ammonia oxidation .  even a small localized rise would lower the ammonia in the region  stimulate earth plant growth further and inhibit the native growth  drop the ammonia further  and so on .      they became gardeners through all the growing season .  that was  after all  routine for the galactic corps .  life on earth type planets was usually of the water protein type  but variation was infinite and other world food was rarely nourishing and even more rarely palatable .  one had to try earth plants of different sorts .  it often happened  not always  but often  that some types of earth plants would overrun and drown out the native flora .  with the native flora held down  other earth plants could take root .   dozens of planets had been converted into new earths in this fashion .  in the process earthly plants developed hundreds of hardy varieties that flourished under extreme conditions .     all the better with which to seed the next planet .   the ammonia would kill any earth plant  but the seeds at the disposal of the cruiser john were not true earth plants but otherworld mutations of these plants .  they fought hard but not well enough .  some varieties grew in a feeble  sickly manner and then died .   at that they did better than did microscopic life .  the planet s bacterioids were far more flourishing than was the planet s straggly blue plant life .  the native micro organisms drowned out any attempt at competition from earth samples .  the attempt to seed the alien soil with earthtype bacterial flora in order to aid the earth plants failed .   vlassov shook his head .     it wouldn t do anyway .  if our bacteria survived  it would only be by adapting to the presence of ammonia .      sandropoulos said     bacteria won t help us .  we need the plants  they carry the oxygen manufacturing systems .         we could make some ourselves     said petersen .     we could electrolyze water .         how long will our equipment last .  if we could only get our plants going  it would be like electrolyzing water forever  little by little  but year after year  till the planet gave up .      barr  re said     let s treat the soil then .  it s rotten with ammonium salts .  we ll bake the salts out and replace the ammonia free soil .         and what about the atmosphere .     asked chou .     in ammonia free soil  they may catch hold despite the atmosphere .  they almost make it as is .      they worked like longshoremen  but with no real end in view .  none really thought it would work  and there was no future for themselves  personally  even if it did work .  but working passed the days .   the next growing season  they had their ammonia free soil  but earth plants still grew only feebly .  they even placed domes over several shoots and pumped ammonia free air within .  it helped slightly but not enough .  they adjusted the chemical composition of the soil in every possible fashion .  there was no reward .   the feeble shoots produced their tiny whiffs of oxygen  but not enough to topple the ammonia atmosphere off its narrow base .      one more push     said sandropoulos     one more .  we re rocking it  we re rocking it  but we can t knock it over .      their tools and equipment blunted and wore out with time and the future closed in steadily .  each month there was less room for maneuver .   when the end came at last it was with almost gratifying suddenness .  there was no name to place on the weakness and vertigo .  no one actually suspected direct ammonia poisoning .  still  they were living off the algal growths of what had once been ship hydroponics for years  and the growths were themselves aberrant with possible ammonia contamination .   it could have been the workings of some native microorganism which might finally have learned to feed off them .  it might even have been an earthly microorganism  mutated under the conditions of a strange world .   so three died at last  and did so  circumstances be praised  painlessly .  they were glad to go  and leave the useless fight .   chou said in a voiceless whisper     it s foolish to lose so badly .      petersen  alone of the five to be on his feet  was he immune  whatever it was .   turned a grieving face toward his only living companion .     don t die     he said     don t leave me alone .      chou tried to smile .     i have no choice .     but you can follow us old friend .  why fight .  the tools are gone and there is no way of winning now  if there ever was .      even now  petersen fought off final despair by concentrating on the fight against the atmosphere .  but his mind was weary  his heart worn out  and when chou died the next hour he was left with four corpses to work with .   he stared at the bodies  counting over the memories  stretching them back  now that he was alone and dared wail  to earth itself  which he had last seen on a visit nearly eleven years before .   he would have to bury the bodies .  he would break off the bluish branches of the native leafless trees and build crosses of them .  he would hang the space helmet of each man on top and prop the oxygen cylinders below .  empty cylinders to symbolize the lost fight .   a foolish sentiment for men who could no longer care  and for future eyes that might never see .   but he was doing it for himself  to show respect for his friends  and respect for himself  too  for he was not the kind of man to leave his friends untended in death while he himself could stand .   besides     besides .  he sat in weary thought for some moments .  while he was still alive he would fight with such tools as were left .  he would bury his friends .   he buried each in a spot of ammonia free soil they had so laboriously built up  buried them without shroud and without clothing  leaving them naked in the hostile ground for the slow decomposition that would come with their own micro organisms before those  too  died with the inevitable invasion of the native bacterioids .   petersen placed each cross  with its helmet and oxygen cylinders  propped each with rocks  then turned away  grim and sad eyed  to return to the buried ship that he now inhabited alone .   he worked each day and eventually the symptoms came for him  too .  he struggled into his spacesuit and came to the surface for what he knew would be one last time .   he fell to his knees on the garden plots .  the earth plants were green .  they had lived longer than ever before .  they looked healthy  even vigorous .   they had patched the soil  babied the atmosphere  and now petersen had used the last tool  the only one remaining at his disposal  and he had given them fertilizer as well  out of the slowly corrupting flesh of the earthmen came the nutrients that supplied the final push .  out of the earth plants came the oxygen that would beat back the ammonia and push the planet out of the unaccountable niche into which it had stuck .   if earthmen ever came again  when .  a million years hence .   they would find a nitrogen oxygen atmosphere and a limited flora strangely reminiscent of earth s .   the crosses would rot and decay  the metal  rust and decompose .  the bones might fossilize and remain to give a hint as to what happened .  their own records  sealed away  might be found .   but none of that mattered .  if nothing at all was ever found  the planet itself  the whole planet  would be their monument .   and petersen lay down to die amid their victory .              fred pohl changes titles more frequently than most editors do  and in some cases drove me to distraction by doing so .  in this case  though  my own title was the last tool  and once again the editorial change was for the better  so i kept founding father .   i hate when fred changes me for the better  but he won t stop .      by      it had been ten years since i had switched to nonfiction  and ten years since i had sold anything to john campbell .   john was just rounding out his third decade as editor of astounding .  as the       opened  however  he changed its name to analog  and i had never had any fiction in the magazine in its new incarnation .   so i wrote exile to hell and sent it in to john .  he took it  thank goodness  and it was a great pleasure to appear in the pages of the magazine again  in the may      issue  even if it was just a short short .       exile to hell        the russians     said dowling  in his precise voice     used to send prisoners to siberia in the days before space travel had become common .  the french used devil s island for the purpose .  the british sailed them off to australia .      he considered the chessboard carefully and his hand hesitated briefly over the bishop .   parkinson  at the other side of the chess board  watched the pattern of the pieces absently .  chess was  of course  the professional game of computer programmers  but  under the circumstances  he lacked enthusiasm .  by rights  he felt with some annoyance  dowling should have been even worse off  he was programming the prosecution s case .   there was  of course  a tendency for the programmer to take over some of the imagined characteristics of the computer the unemotionality  the imperviousness to anything but logic .  dowling reflected that in his precise hair part and in the restrained elegance of his clothing .   parkinson  who preferred to program the defense in the law cases in which he was involved  also preferred to be deliberately careless in the minor aspects of his costume .   he said     you mean exile is a well established punishment and therefore not particularly cruel .         no  it is particularly cruel  but also it is well established  and nowadays it has become the perfect deterrent .      dowling moved the bishop and did not look upward .  parkinson  quite involuntarily  did .   of course  he couldn t see anything .  they were indoors  in the comfortable modem world tailored to human needs  carefully protected against the raw environment .  out there  the night would be bright with its illumination .   when had he last seen it .  not for a long time .  it occurred to him to wonder what phase it was in right now .   full .  gleaming .  or was it in its crescent phase .  was it a bright fingernail of light low in the sky .   by rights it should be a lovely sight .  once it had been .  but that had been centuries ago  before space travel had become common and cheap  and before the surroundings all about them had grown sophisticated and controlled .  now the lovely light in the sky had become a new and more horrible devil s island hung in space .      no one even used its name any longer  out of sheer distaste .  it was    it .     or it was less than that  just a silent  upward movement of the head .   parkinson said     you might have allowed me to program the case against exile generally .         why .  it couldn t have affected the result .         not this one  dowling .  but it might have affected future cases .  future punishments might be commuted to the death sentence .         for someone guilty of equipment damage .  you re dreaming .         it was an act of blind anger .  there was intent to harm a human being  granted  but there was no intent to harm equipment .          nothing  it means nothing .  lack of intent is no excuse in such cases .  you know that .         it should be an excuse .  that s my point  the one i  wanted to make .     parkinson advanced a pawn now  to cover his knight .  dowling considered .     you re trying to hang onto the queen s attack  parkinson  and i m not going to let you .   let s see  now .     and while he pondered he said     these are not primitive times  parkinson .  we live in a crowded world with no margin for error .  as small a thing as a blown out consistor could endanger a sizable fraction of our population .  when anger endangers and subverts a power line  it s a serious thing .         i don t question that           you seemed to be doing so  when you were constructing the defense program .         i was not .  look  when jenkins  laser beam cut through the field warp  i myself was as close to death as anyone .  a quarter hour s additional delay would have meant my end  too  and i m completely aware of that .  my point is only that exile is not the proper punishment .      he tapped his finger on the chessboard for emphasis  and dowling caught the queen before it went over .     adjusting  not moving     he mumbled .   dowling s eyes went from piece to piece and he continued to hesitate .     you re wrong  parkinson .  it is the proper punishment  because there s nothing worse and that matches a crime than which there is nothing worse .  look  we all feel our absolute dependence on a complicated and rather fragile technology .  a breakdown might kill us all  and it doesn t matter whether the breakdown is   deliberate  accidental  or caused by incompetence .  human beings demand the maximum punishment for any such i deed as the only way they can feel secure .  mere death is i not sufficient deterrent .         yes  it is .  no one wants to die .         they want to live in exile up there even less .  that s why we ve only had one such case in the last ten years  and only one exile .   there  do something about that .     i and dowling nudged his queen s rook one space to the right .   a light flashed .  parkinson was on his feet at once .     the programming is finished .  the computer will have its verdict now .      dowling looked up phlegmatically     you ve no doubt about what the verdict will be  have you .     keep the board standing .  we ll finish afterward .      parkinson was quite certain he would lack the heart to continue the game .  he hurried down the corridor to the courtroom  light and quick on his feet  as always .   shortly after he and dowling had entered  the judge took his seat  and then in came jenkins  flanked by two guards .   jenkins looked haggard  but stoical .  ever since the blind rage had overcome him and he had accidentally i thrown a sector into unpowered darkness while striking out at a fellow worker  he must have known the inevitable consequence of this worst of all crimes .  it helps to have no illusions .   parkinson was not stoical .  he dared not look squarely at jenkins .  he could not have done so without wondering  painfully  as to what might be going through jenkins  mind at that moment .  was he absorbing  through every sense  all the perfections of familiar comfort before being thrust forever into the luminous hell that rode the night sky .   was he savoring the clean and pleasant air in his nostrils  the soft lights  the equable temperature  the pure water on call  the secure surroundings designed to cradle humanity in tame comfort .   while up there     the judge pressed a contact and the computer s decision was converted into the warm  unmannered sound of a standardized human voice .      a weighing of all pertinent information in the light of the law of the land and of all relevant precedents leads to the conclusion that anthony jenkins is guilty on all counts of the crime of equipment damage and is subject to the maximum penalty .      there were only six people in the courtroom itself  but the entire population was listening by television  of course .   the judge spoke in prescribed phraseology .     the defendant will be taken from here to the nearest spaceport and  on the first available transportation  be removed from this world and sent into exile for the term of his natural life .      jenkins seemed to shrink within himself  but he said no word .   parkinson shivered .  how many  he wondered  would now feel the enormity of such a punishment for any crime .  how long before there would be enough humanity among men to wipe out forever the punishment of exile .   could anyone really think of jenkins up there in space  without flinching .  could they think  and endure the thought  of a fellow man thrown for all his life among the strange  unfriendly  vicious population of a world of unbearable heat by day and frigid cold by night  of a world where the sky was a harsh blue and the ground a harsher  clashing green  where the dusty air moved raucously and the viscous sea heaved eternally .   and the gravity  that heavy   heavy   heavy   eternal   pull .   who could bear the horror of condemning someone  for whatever reason  to leave the friendly home of the i moon for that hell in the sky   the earth .              considering what john campbell means to me  i hate to point out any editorial bad points he had but he was a terrible blurb writer .  in those little editorial comments at the beginning of a story  comments that are supposed to lure you into reading it  he all too often gave away the point of the story  when the writer was doing his best to conceal the point till the proper moment .   here is john s blurb for exile to hell     hell is  of course  the worst imaginable place you least want to be forced to experience .  it s an attitude about a place fiji for an eskimo  baffin island for a polynesian .  .  .  .     if you read the blurb first and then read my story  exile to hell will have the impact of a strand of wet spaghetti .     as the drought of science fiction intensified  it became important to me not to allow any item to go to waste .   a friend of mine  ed berkeley  ran a little periodical devoted to computers and automation .   it was even called computers and automation  as i recall .   in      he asked me to do a little story for him  for friendship s sake  and since i always have trouble fighting off anything put to me in that fashion  i wrote key item for him and he paid me a dollar for it .     but then he never printed it .   eight years passed and i finally said to him     hey  ed  i what happened to my story key item .     and he told me he had decided not to publish science fiction .      give it back  then     i said  and he said     oh  can you use it .      yes  i could use it .  i sent it in to f   sf and they took it and ran it in the july      issue of that magazine .       key item     jack weaver came out of the vitals of multivac looking utterly worn and disgusted .   from the stool  where the other maintained his own stolid watch  todd nemerson said     nothing .         nothing     said weaver .     nothing  nothing  nothing .  no one can find anything wrong with it .         except that it won t work  you mean .         you re no help sitting there .         i m thinking .         thinking .     weaver showed a canine at one side of his mouth .   nemerson stirred impatiently on his stool .     why not .  there are six teams of computer technologists roaming around in the corridors of multivac .  they haven t come up with anything in three days .  can t you spare one person to think .         it s not a matter of thinking .  we ve got to look .  somewhere a relay is stuck .         it s not that simple  jack .         who says it s simple .  you know how many million relays we have there .         that doesn t matter .  if it were just a relay  multivac would have alternate circuits  devices for locating the flaw  and facilities to repair or replace the ailing part .  the trouble is  multivac won t only not answer the original question  it won t tell us what s wrong with it .     and meanwhile  there ll be panic in every city if we don t do something .  the world s economy depends on multivac  and everyone knows that .         i know it  too .  but what s there to do .         i told you  think .  there must be something we re missing completely .  look  jack  there isn t a computer bigwig in a hundred years who hasn t devoted himself to making multivac more complicated .  it can do so much now   hell  it can even talk and listen .  it s practically as complex as the human brain .  we can t understand the human brain  so why should we understand multivac .         aw  come on .  next you ll be saying multivac is human .         why not .     nemerson grew absorbed and seemed to sink into himself .     now that you mention it  why not .  could we tell if multivac passed the thin dividing line where it stopped being a machine and started being human .  is there a dividing line  for that matter .  if the brain is just more complex than multivac  and we keep making multivac more complex  isn t there a point where .  .  .     he mumbled down into silence .   weaver said impatiently     what are you driving at .  suppose multivac were human .  how would that help us find out why it isn t working .         for a human reason  maybe .  suppose you were asked the most probable price of wheat next summer and didn t answer .  why wouldn t you answer .         because i wouldn t know .  but multivac would know .  we ve given it an the factors .  it can analyze futures in weather  politics  and economics .  we know it can .  it s done it before .          all right .  suppose i asked the question and you knew the answer but didn t tell me .  why not .      weaver snarled     because i had a brain tumor .  because i had been knocked out .  because i was drunk .  damn it  because my machinery was out of order .  that s just what we re trying to find out about multivac .  we re looking for the place where its machinery is out of order  for the key item .         only you haven t found it .     nemerson got off his stool .     listen  ask me the question multivac stalled on .         how .  shall i run the tape through you .         come on  jack .  give me the talk that goes along with it .  you do talk to multivac  don t you .         i ve got to .  therapy .      nemerson nodded .     yes  that s the story .  therapy .  that s the official story .  we talk to it in order to pretend it s a human being so that we don t get neurotic over having a machine know so much more than we do .  we turn a frightening metal monster into a protective father image .         if you want to put it that way .         well  it s wrong and you know it .  a computer as complex as multivac must talk and listen to be efficient .  just putting in and taking out coded dots isn t sufficient .  at a certain level of complexity  multivac must be made to seem human because  by god  it is human .  come on  jack  ask me the question .  i want to see my reaction to it .      jack weaver flushed .     this is silly .         come on  will you .      it was a measure of weaver s depression and desperation that he acceded .  half sullenly  he pretended to be feeding the program into multivac  speaking as he did so in his usual manner .  he commented on the latest information concerning farm unrest  talked about the new equations describing jet stream contortions  lectured on the solar constant .   he began stiffly enough  but warmed to this task out of long habit  and when the last of the program was slammed home  he almost closed contact with a physical snap at todd nemerson s waist .   he ended briskly     all right  now .  work that out and give us the answer pronto .      for a moment  having done  jack weaver stood there  nostrils flaring  as though he was feeling once more the excitement of throwing into action the most gigantic and glorious machine ever put together by the mind and hands of man .   then he remembered and muttered      all right .  that s it .      nemerson said      at least i know now why i wouldn t answer  so let s try that on multivac .  look  clear multivac  make sure the investigators have their paws off it .  then run the program into it and let me do the talking .  just once .      weaver shrugged and turned to multivac s control wall  filled with its somber  unwinking dials and lights .  slowly he cleared it .  one by one he ordered the teams away .   then  with a deep breath  he began once more feeding the program into multivac .  it was the twelfth time all told  the dozenth time .  somewhere a distant news commentator would spread the word that they were trying again .  all over the world a multivac dependent people would be holding its collective breath .   nemerson talked as weaver fed the data silently .  he talked diffidently  trying to remember what it was that weaver had said  but waiting for the moment when the key item might be added .   weaver was done and now a note of tension was in nemerson s voice .  he said     all right  now  multivac .  work that out and give us the answer .     he paused and added the key item .  he said    please .      and all over multivac  the valves and relays went joyously to work .  after all  a machine has feelings   when it isn t a machine anymore .              the story didn t stop at f   sf  by the way .   the saturday evening post had died in       shortly after serializing my novel fantastic voyage  houghton mifflin         though i don t think there was any connection .  it came back to life  however  and its editors were interested in some of my stories .  they reprinted a statue for father  and they also did key item  under the title the computer that went on strike  in their spring      issue .     the slick magazines were interested in science fiction now .  it was not only the saturday evening post that was after me for stories .  boys  life was  too .  they sent me a painting hoping it would inspire a story  and i tried .  i turned out the proper study  which appeared in the september      issue of boys  life .       the proper study        the demonstration is ready     said oscar harding softly  half to himself  when the phone rang to say that the general was on his way upstairs .   ben fife  harding s young associate  pushed his fists deep into the pockets of his laboratory jacket .     we won t get anywhere     he said .     the general doesn t change his mind .     he looked sideways at the older man s sharp profile  his pinched cheeks  his thinning gray hair .  harding might be a wizard with electronic equipment  but he couldn t seem to grasp the kind of man the general was .   and harding said mildly     oh  you can never tell .        the general knocked once on the door  but it was for i show only .  he walked in quickly  without waiting for a response .  two soldiers took up their position in the corridor  one on each side of the door .  they faced outward  rifles ready .   general gruenwald said crisply     professor harding .     he nodded briefly in fife s direction and then  for a moment  studied the remaining individual in the room .  that was a blank faced man who sat apart in a straight backed chair  half obscured by surrounding equipment .   everything about the general was crisp  his walk  the way he held his spine  the way he spoke .  he was an straight lines and angles  adhering rigidly at all points to the etiquette of the born soldier .   .      won t you sit down  general     murmured harding .     thank you .  it s good of you to come  i ve been trying to see you for some time .  i appreciate the fact you re a busy man .         since i am busy     said the general     let us get to the point .          as near the point as i can  sir .  i assume you know about our project here .  you know about the neurophotoscope .         your top secret project .  of course .  my scientific aides keep me abreast of it as best they can .  i won t object to some further clarification .  what is it you want .      the suddenness of the question made harding blink .  then he said     to be brief   declassification .  i want the world to know that           why do you want them to know anything .         neurophotoscopy is an important problem  sir  and enormously complex .  i would like all scientists of all nationalities working on it .         no  no .  that s been gone over many times .  the discovery is ours and we keep it .         it will remain a very small discovery if it remains ours .  let me explain once more .      the general looked at his watch .     it will be quite useless .         i have a new subject .  a new demonstration .  as long as you ve come here at all  general  won t you listen for just a little while .  i ll omit scientific detail as much as possible and say only that the varying electric potentials of brain cells can be recorded as tiny  irregular waves .         electroencephalograms .  yes  i know .  we ve had them for a century .  and i know what you do with it .         uh yes .     harding grew more earnest .     the brain waves by themselves carry their information too compactly .  they give us the whole complex of changes from a hundred billion brain cells at once .  my discovery was of a practical method for converting them to colored patterns .         with your neurophotoscope     said the general  pointing .     you see  i recognize the machine .     every campaign ribbon and medal on his chest lay in its proper place to within the millimeter .      yes .  the  scope produces color effects  real images that seem to fill the air and change very rapidly .  they can be photographed and they re beautiful .         i have seen photographs     the general said coldly .     have you seen the real thing  in action .         once or twice .  you were there at the time .         oh  yes .     the professor was disconcerted .  he said     but you haven t seen this man  our new subject .     he pointed briefly to the man in the chair  a man with a sharp chin  a long nose  no sign of hair on his skull  and still that vacant look in his eye .      who is he .     asked the general .      the only name we use for him is steve .  he is mentally retarded but produces the most intense patterns we have yet found .  why this should be we don t know .  whether it has something to do with his mental           do you intend to show me what he does .     broke in the general .      if you will watch  general .     harding nodded at fife  who went into action at once .     the subject  as always  watched fife with mild interest  doing as he was told and making no resistance .  the light plastic helmet fitted snugly over his shaved cranium and each of the complicated electrodes was adjusted properly .  fife tried to work smoothly under the unusual tension of the occasion .  he was in agony lest the general look at his watch again  and leave .   he stepped away  panting .     shall i activate it now  professor harding .         yes .  now .     fife closed a contact gently and at once the air above steve s head seemed filled with brightening color .  circles appeared and circles within circles  turning  whirling  and splitting apart .   fife felt a clear sensation of uneasiness but pushed it away impatiently .  that was the subject s emotion   steve s   not his own .  the general must have felt it too  for he shifted in his chair and cleared his throat loudly .   harding said casually     the patterns contain no more information than the brain waves  really  but are much more easily studied and analyzed .  it is like putting germs under a strong microscope .  nothing new is added  but what is there can be seen more easily .      steve was growing steadily more uneasy .  fife could sense it was the harsh and unsympathetic presence of the general that was the cause .  although steve did not change his position or give any outward sign of fear  the colors in the patterns his mind created grew harsher  and within the outer circles there were clashing interlocks .   the general raised his hand as though to push the flickering lights away .  he said     what about all this  professor .         with steve  we can jump ahead even faster than we have been .  already we have learned more in the two years since i devised the first  scope than in the fifty years before that .  with steve  and with others like him  perhaps  and with the help of the scientists of the world         i have been told you can use this to reach minds     said the general sharply .      reach minds .     harding thought a moment .     you mean telepathy .  that s quite exaggerated .  minds are too different for that .  the fine details of your way of thinking are not like mine or like anyone else s  and raw brain patterns won t match .  we have to translate thoughts into words  a much cruder form of communication  and even then it is hard enough for human beings to make contact .         i don t mean telepathy .  i mean emotion .  if the subject feels anger  the receiver can be made to experience anger .  right .         in a manner of speaking .      the general was clearly agitated .     those things right there       his finger jabbed toward the patterns  which were whirling most unpleasantly now .     they can be used for emotion control .  with these  broadcast on television  whole populations can be emotionally manipulated .  can we allow such power to fall into the wrong hands .         if it were such power     said harding mildly     there would be no right hands .      fife frowned .  that was a dangerous remark .  every once in a while harding seemed to forget that the old days of democracy were gone .   but the general let it go .  he said     i didn t know you had this thing so far advanced .  i didn t know you had this steve .  you get others like that .  meanwhile  the army is taking this over .  completely .         wait  general  just ten seconds .     harding turned to fife .     give steve his book  will you  ben .      fife did so with alacrity .  the book was one of the new kaleido volumes that told their stories by means of colored photographs that slowly twisted and changed once the book was opened .  it was a kind of animated cartoon in hard covers and steve smiled as he reached out eagerly for it .   almost at once the colored patterns that clustered above his plastic helmet changed in nature .  they slowed their turning and the colors softened .  the patterns within the circle grew less discordant .   fife sighed his relief and let warmth and relaxation sweep over him .   harding said     general  don t let the possibility of emotion control alarm you .  the  scope offers less possibility for that than you think .  surely there are men whose emotions can be manipulated  but the  scope isn t necessary for them .  they react mindlessly to catch words  music  uniforms  almost anything .  hitler once controlled germany without even television  and napoleon controlled france without even radio or mass circulation newspapers .  the  scope offers nothing new .         i don t believe that     muttered the general  but he had grown thoughtful again .   steve stared earnestly at the kaleido volume  and the patterns over his head had almost stilled into warmly colored and intricately detailed circles that pulsed their pleasure .   harding s voice was almost coaxing .     there are always the people who resist conformity  who don t go along  and they are the important ones of society .  they won t go along with colored patterns any more than with any other form of persuasion .  so why worry about the useless bogey of emotion control .  let us instead see the neurophotoscope as the first instrument through which mental function can be truly analyzed .  that s what should concern us above an .  the proper study of mankind is man  as alexander pope once said  and what is man but his brain .      the general remained silent .      if we can solve the manner of the brain s workings     went on harding     and learn at last what makes a man a man  we are on our way to understanding ourselves  and nothing more difficult   or more worthwhile faces us .  and how can this be done by just one man  by one laboratory .  how can it be done in secrecy and fear .  the whole world of science must cooperate .     general  declassify the project .  throw it open to all men .      slowly the general nodded .     i think you re right after all .         i have the proper document .  if you ll sign it and key it with your fingerprint  if you use your two guards outside as witnesses  if you alert the executive board by closed video  if you        it was all done .  before fife s astonished eyes it was all done .   when the general was gone  the neurophotoscope dismantled  and steve taken back to his quarters  fife finally overcame his amazement long enough to speak .      how could he have been persuaded so easily  professor harding .  you ve explained your point of view at length in a dozen reports and it never helped a bit .         i ve never presented it in this room  with the neurophotoscope working     said harding .     i ve never had anyone as intensely projective as steve before .  many people can withstand emotion control  as i said  but some people cannot withstand it .  those who have a tendency to conform are easily led to agree with others .  i took the gamble that any man who feels comfortable in uniform and who lives by the military book is liable to be swayed  no matter how powerful he imagines himself to be .         you mean   steve           of course  i let the general feel the uneasiness first  then you handed steve the kaleido volume and the air filled with happiness .  you felt it  didn t you .         yes .  certainly .         it was my guess the general couldn t resist that happiness so suddenly following the unease  and he didn t .  anything would have sounded good at that moment .          but he ll get over it  won t he .         eventually  i suppose  but so what .  the key progress reports concerning neurophotoscopy are being sent out right now to news media all over the world .  the general might suppress it here in this country  but surely not elsewhere .     no  he will have to make the best of it .  mankind can begin its proper study in earnest  at last .        the painting was simply a crudely done head surrounded by a series of aimless psychedelic designs .  it meant nothing to ine and i had a terrible time thinking up the proper study .  foul anderson also wrote a story based on the same painting and probably had no trouble at all .   the two stories appeared in the same issue and i suppose it might be interesting to compare the stories and try to get an idea of the different workings of poul s brain   and mine   but  as in the case of blank .   i didn t save the other story .  besides  i don t want you to compare brains .  poul is awfully bright and you might come to me with some hard truths i d rather not face .     in early      ibm magazine came to me with a quote from j .  b .  priestley which went as follows     between midnight and dawn  when sleep will not come and all the old wounds begin to ache  i often have a nightmare vision of a future world in which there are billions of people  all numbered and registered  with not a gleam of genius anywhere  not an original mind  a rich personality  on the whole packed globe .      the editor of the magazine asked me to write a story based on the quote  and i did the job in late april and mailed it in .  the story was      a . d .   and in it i took i priestley s quotation seriously and tried to describe the world of his nightmares .   and ibm magazine sent it back .  they said they didn t want a story that backed the quotation  they wanted one i that refuted the quotation .  well  they had never said so .   under ordinary circumstances i might have been very indignant and might have written a rather scathing letter .  however  these were hard times for me and there was another turning point  and a very sad one  coming up in my life .   my marriage had been limping for some years and it finally broke down .  on july          with our twenty eighth anniversary nearly upon us  i moved out and went to new york .  i took a two room hotel suite that i was to use as an office for nearly five years .   you can t make a change like that without all kinds of worries  miseries  and guilts .  and among them all  i being what i am  one of my worries  as i sat in the two rooms in a strange environment  with my reference library still undelivered      as long as i was a fiction writer i needed very little in the way of a library and could write anywhere .  one of the less pleasant aspects of my switch to nonfiction was that i gradually built up an enormous reference library which nails me to the ground .   was whether i would still be able to write .   i remembered my story      a . d .   which ordinarily i might have abandoned in indignation .  now  just to see if i could do it  i began another story  on july          five days after my move  one which would refute priestley s quotation .  i called it the greatest asset .   i sent it to ibm magazine  and you ll never believe me but after reading my second story they decided to take my first one after all .  it was utterly confusing .  was my second story so bad that it made the first look good .  or had they changed their mind before i had written the second story and had they not gotten round to telling me .  i suspect the latter .  anyway       a . d .  was published in the october      issue of ibm magazine .            a . d .      between midnight and dawn  when sleep will not come and all the old wounds begin to ache  i often have a nightmare vision of a future world in which there are billions of people  all numbered and registered  with not a gleam of genius anywhere  not an original mind  a rich personality  on the whole packed globe .      j . b .  priestly .        he ll talk to us     said alvarez when the other stepped out the door .      good     said bunting .     social pressure is bound to get to him eventually .  an odd character .  how he escaped genetic adjustment i ll never know .     but you do the talking .  he irritates me past tact .      together they swung down the corridor along the executive trail  which was  as always  sparsely occupied .  they might have taken the moving strips  but there were only two miles to go and alvarez enjoyed walking  so i bunting didn t insist .  i  alvarez was tall and rather thin  with the kind of athletic figure one would expect of a person who cherished the muscular activities  who routinely used the stairs and rampways  for instance  almost to the edge of being considered an unsettling character himself .  bunting  softer and rounder  avoided even the sunlamps  and was quite pale .   bunting said dolefully     i hope the two of us will be enough .         i should think so .  we want to keep it in our sector  if we can .         yes .  you know  i keep thinking why does it have to be our sector .  fifty million square miles of seven hundred level living space  and it has to be in our apartment bloc .         rather a distinction  in a grisly kind of way     said alvarez .   bunting snorted .      and a little to our credit     alvarez added softly     if we settle the matter .  we reach peak .  we reach end .  we reach goal .  all mankind .  and we do it .      bunting brightened .  he said     you think they ll look at it that way .         let s see to it that they do .      their footsteps were muted against the plastic knit crushed rock underfoot .  they passed crosscorridors and saw the endless crowds on the moving strips in the middle distance .  there was a fugitive whiff of plankton in its varieties .  once  almost by instinct  they could tell that up above  far above  was one of the giant conduits leading in from the sea .  and by symmetry they knew there would be another conduit  just as large  far below  leading out to sea .   their destination was a dwelling room set well back from the corridor  but one that seemed different from the thousands they had passed .  there was about it an intangible and disconcerting note of space  for on either side  for hundreds of feet  the wall was blank .  and there was something in the air .      smell it .     muttered bunting .      i ve smelled it before     said alvarez .     inhuman .         literally .     said bunting .     he won t expect us to look at them  will he .         if he does  it s easy enough to refuse .     they signaled  then waited in silence while the hum of infinite life sounded all around them in utterly disregarded manner  for it was always there .   the door opened .  cranwitz was waiting .  he looked sullen .  he wore the same clothes they all did  light  simple  gray .  on him  though  they seemed rumpled .  he seemed rumpled  his hair too long  his eyes bloodshot and shifting uneasily .      may we enter .     asked alvarez with cold courtesy .   cranwitz stood to one side .   the odor was stronger inside .  cranwitz closed the door behind them and they sat down .  cranwitz remained standing and said nothing .   alvarez said     i must ask you  in my capacity as sector representative  with bunting here as vice representative  whether you are now ready to comply with social necessity .      cranwitz seemed to be thinking .  when he finally spoke his deep voice was choked and he had to clear his throat .     i don t want to     he said .     i don t have to .  there is a contract with the government of long standing .  my family has always had the right           we know all this and there s no question of force involved     said bunting irritably .     we re asking you to accede voluntarily .      alvarez touched the other s knee lightly .     you understand the situation is not what it was in your father s time  or even  really  what it was last year .      cranwitz s long jaw quivered slightly .     i don t see that .  the birth rate has dropped this year by the amount computerized  and everything else has changed correspondingly .  that goes on from year to year .  why should this i year be different .      his voice somehow did not carry conviction .  alvarez was sure he did know why this year was different  and he said softly     this year we ve reached the goal .  the birth rate now exactly matches the death rate  the population level is now exactly steady  construction is now confined to replacement entirely  and the sea farms are in a steady state .  only you stand between all mankind and perfection .  .  .      because of a few mice .         because of a few mice .  and other creatures .  guinea pigs .  rabbits .  some kinds of birds and lizards .  i haven t taken a census           but they re the only ones left in all the world .  what harm do they do .         what good .     demanded bunting .   cranwitz said     the good of being there to look at .  there was once a time when        alvarez had heard that before .  he said  with as much sympathy as he could pump into his voice  and  to his surprise  with a certain amount of real sympathy  too      i know .  there was once a time .  centuries ago .  there were vast numbers of life forms like those you care for .  and millions of years before that there were dinosaurs .  but we have microfilms of everything .  no man need go ignorant of them .         how can you compare microfilms with the real thing .     asked cranwitz .   bunting s lips quirked .     the microfilms don t smell .         the zoo was much larger once     said cranwitz .     year by year we ve had to get rid of so many .  all the large animals .  all the carnivores .  the trees .  there s nothing left but small plants  tiny creatures .  let them be .      alvarez said     what is there to do with them .  no one wants to see them .  mankind is against you .         social pressure           we couldn t persuade people against real resistance .  people don t want to see these life distortions .  they re sickening  they really are .  what s there to do with them .     alvarez s voice was insinuating .   cranwitz sat down now .  a certain feverishness heightened the color in his cheeks .     i ve been thinking .  someday we ll reach out .  mankind will colonize other worlds .  he ll want animals .  he ll want other species in these new  empty worlds .  he ll start a new ecology of variety .  he ll .  .  .      his words faded under the hostile stare of the other two .   bunting said     what other worlds are we going to colonize .         we reached the moon in          said cranwitz .      sure  and we established a colony  and we abandoned it .  there s no world in all the solar system capable of supporting human life without prohibitive engineering .      cranwitz said     there are worlds circling other stars .  earthlike worlds by the hundred of millions .  there must be .      alvarez shook his head .     out of reach .  we have finally exploited earth and filled it with the human species .  we have made our choice  and it is earth .  there is no margin for the kind of effort needed to build a starship capable of crossing light years of space .   have you been immersing yourself in twentieth century history .         it wasn   t the last century of the open world     said cranwitz .      so it was     said alvarez dryly .     i hope you haven t over romanticized it .  i ve studied its madness  too .  the world was empty then  only a few billions  and they thought it was crowded and with  good reason .  they spent more than half their substance on war and preparations of war  ran their economy without forethought  wasted and poisoned at will  let pure chance govern the genetic pool  and tolerated the deviants from norm of all descriptions .  of course  they dreaded what they called the population explosion  and dreamed of reaching other worlds as a kind of escape .  so would we under those conditions .      i needn t tell you the combination of events and of scientific advances that changed everything  but just let me remind you briefly in case you are trying to forget .  there was the establishment of a world government  the development of fusion power  and the growth of the art of genetic engineering  with planetary peace  plentiful energy  and a placid humanity men could multiply peacefully  and science kept up with the multiplication .      it was known in advance exactly how many men the earth could support .  so many calories of sunlight reached the earth  and  using that  only so many tons of carbon dioxide could be fixed by green plants each year  and only so many tons of animal life could be supported by those plants .  the earth could support two trillion tons of animal life      cranwitz finally broke in     and why shouldn t all two trillion tons be human .         exactly .         even if it meant killing off all other animal life .         that s the way of evolution .     said bunting angrily .     the fit survive .      alvarez touched the other s knee again .     bunting is right  cranwitz     he said gently .     the toleosts replaced the placoderms  who had replaced the trilobites .  the reptiles replaced the amphibians and were in turn replaced by the mammals .  now  at last  evolution has reached its peak .  earth bears its mighty population of fifteen trillion human beings           but how .     demanded cranwitz .     they live in one vast building over all the face of the dry land  with no plants and no animals beside  except what i have right here .  and all the uninhabited ocean has become a plankton soup  no life but plankton .  we harvest it endlessly to feed our people  and as endlessly we restore organic matter to feed the plankton .         we live very well     said alvarez .     there is no war  there is no crime .  our births are regulated  our deaths are peaceful .  our infants are genetically adjusted and on earth there are now twenty billion tons of normal brain  the largest conceivable quantity of the most complex conceivable matter in the universe .         and all that weight of brain doing what .      bunting heaved an audible sigh of exasperation but alvarez  still calm  said     my good friend  you confuse the journey with the destination .  perhaps it comes from living with your animals .  when the earth was in process of development  it was necessary for life to experiment and take chances .  it was even worthwhile to be wasteful .  the earth was empty then .  it had infinite room and evolution had to experiment with ten million species or more   till it found the species .      even after mankind came  it had to learn the way .  while it was learning  it had to take chances  attempt the impossible  be foolish or mad .     but mankind has come home  now .  men have filled the planet and need only to enjoy perfection .      alvarez paused to let that sink in  then said     we want it  cranwitz .  the whole world wants perfection .  it is in our generation that perfection has been reached  and we want the distinction of having reached it .  your animals are in the way  .      cranwitz shook his head stubbornly .     they take up so little room  consume so little energy .  if all were wiped out  you might have room for what .  for twenty five more human beings .  twenty five in fifteen trillion .      bunting said     twenty five human beings represent another seventy five pounds of human brain .  with what measure can you evaluate seventy five pounds of human brain .         but you already have billions of tons of it .         i know     said alvarez     but the difference between perfection and not quite perfection is that between life and not quite life .  we are so close now .  all earth is prepared to celebrate this year of      ad .  this is the year when the computer tens us that the planet is fun at last  the goal is achieved  all the striving of evolution crowned .  shall we fan short by twenty five   even out of fifteen trillion .  it is such a tiny  tiny flaw  but it is a flaw .      think  cranwitz .  earth has been waiting for five billion years to be fulfilled .  must we wait longer .  we cannot and will not force you  but if you yield voluntarily you will be a hero to everyone .      bunting said     yes .  in all future time men win say that cranwitz acted and with that one single act perfection was reached .      and cranwitz said  imitating the other s tone of voice     and men will say that alvarez and bunting persuaded him to do so .         if we succeed .     said alvarez with no audible annoyance .     but tell me  cranwitz  can you hold out against the enlightened will of fifteen trillion people forever .  whatever your motives   and i recognize that in your own way i you are an idealist   can you withhold that last bit of perfection from so many .      cranwitz looked down in silence and alvarez s hand waved gently in bunting s direction and bunting said not a word .  the silence remained unbroken while slow minutes crept by .   then cranwitz whispered     can i have one more day with my animals .         and then .         and then   i won t stand between mankind and perfection .      and alvarez said     i   ll let the world know .  you will be honored .     and he and bunting left .     over the vast continental buildings some five trillion human beings placidly slept  some two trillion human beings placidly ate  half a trillion carefully made love .  other trillions talked without heat  or tended the computers quietly  or ran the vehicles  or studied the machinery  or organized the microfilm libraries  or amused their fellows .  trillions went to sleep  trillions woke up  and the routine never varied .   the machinery worked  tested itself  repaired itself .  the plankton soup of the planetary ocean basked under the sun and the cells divided  and divided  and divided  while dredges endlessly scooped them up and dried them and by the millions of tons transferred them to conveyors and conduits that brought them to every corner of the endless buildings .     and in every corner of the buildings human wastes were gathered and irradiated and dried  and human corpses were ground and treated and dried and endlessly the residue was brought back to the ocean .  and for hours  while all this was going on  as it had gone on for decades  and might be doomed to go on for millennia  cranwitz fed his little creatures a last time  stroked his guinea pig  lifted a tortoise to gaze into its uncomprehending eye  felt a blade of living grass between his fingers .   he counted them over  all of them   the last living things on earth that were neither humans nor food for humans   and then he seared the soil in which the plants grew and killed them .  he flooded the cages and rooms in which the animals moved with appropriate vapors  and they moved no more and soon they lived no more .   the last of them was gone and now between mankind and perfection there was only cranwitz  whose thoughts still rebelliously departed from the norm .  but for cranwitz there were also the vapors  and he didn   t want to live .   and  after that  there was really perfection  for over all the earth  through all its fifteen trillion inhabitants and over all its twenty billion tons of human brain  there was  with cranwitz gone  not one unsettling thought  not one unusual idea  to disturb the universal placidity that meant that the exquisite nothingness of uniformity had at last been achieved .              even though      a . d .  was published  and had been paid for very generously indeed  it left my neurotic fears unallayed .  that story  which had been accepted  was written i while i still lived in newton .  the one which had not been taken was written in new york .   so i took the greatest asset to john campbell  we were now in the same city again for the first time in twenty one years  and told him the story of ibm magazine .  i said i was handing him the one that they had rejected  but i wouldn t if he would scorn to look at a story under those conditions .   good old john shrugged and said     one editor doesn t necessarily agree with another .      he read the story and bought it .  i hadn t told him about my crazy worry about being unable to write in new york  because i was ashamed of it and john was still the great man before whom i feared to show myself in my role as jackass .  still  by taking that story he had added one more favor to the many  many  he had done for me .    and in case you re worried  i might as well tell you that my years in new york have so far been even more prolific than the newton years were .  i stayed    months in my two room office and in that period of time published    books .      note  the population of earth in      is estimated to be   .    billion .  the present rate of increase doubles that population every    years .  if this present rate of increase can be maintained for     years then in the year      a . d .  the weight of human flesh and blood will be equal to the total weight of animal life now present on earth .  to that extent  the story above is not fiction .       the greatest asset     the earth was one large park .  it had been tamed utterly .  lou tansonia saw it expand under his eyes as he watched somberly from the lunar shuttle .  his prominent nose split his lean face into inconsiderable halves and each looked sad always but this time in accurate reflection of his mood .   he had never been away so long almost a month   and he anticipated a none too pleasant acclimation period once earth s large gravity made its grip fiercely evident .   but that was for later .  that was not the sadness of now as he watched earth grow larger .   as long as the planet was far enough to be a circle of white spirals  glistening in the sun that shone over the ship s shoulders  it had its primeval beauty .  when the occasional patches of pastel browns and greens peeped through the clouds  it might still have been the planet it was at any time since three hundred million years before  when life had first stretched out of the sea arid moved over the dry land to fill the valleys with green .   it was lower  lower   when the ship sank down   that the tameness began to show .   there was no wilderness anywhere .  lou had never seen earthly wilderness  he had only read of it  or seen it in old films .   the forests stood in rank and file  with each tree carefully ticketed by species and position .  the crops grew in their fields in orderly rotation  with intermittent and automated fertilization and weeding .  the few domestic animals that still existed were numbered and lou wryly suspected that the blades of grass were as well .   animals were so rarely seen as to be a sensation when glimpsed .  even the insects had faded  and none of the large animals existed anywhere outside the slowly dwindling number of zoos .   the very cats had become few in number  for it was much more patriotic to keep a hamster  if one had to have a pet at all .   correction .  only earth s nonhuman animal population had diminished .  its mass of animal life was as great as ever  but most of it  about three fourths of its total  was one species only   homo sapiens .  and  despite everything the terrestrial bureau of ecology could do  or said it could do   that fraction very slowly increased from year to year .   lou thought of that  as he always did  with a towering sense of loss .  the human presence was unobtrusive  to be sure .  there was no sign of it from where the shuttle made its final orbits about the planet  and  lou knew  there would be no sign of it even when they sank much lower .   the sprawling cities of the chaotic pre planetary days were gone .  the old highways could be traced from the air by the imprint they still left on the vegetation  but they were invisible from close quarters .  individual men themselves rarely troubled the surface  but they were there  underground .  all mankind was  in all its billions  with the factories  the food processing plants  the energies  the vacu tunnels .   the tame world lived on solar energy and was free of strife  and to lou it was hateful in consequence .   yet at the moment he could almost forget  for  after months of failure  he was going to see adrastus  himself .  it had meant the pulling of every available string .   ino adrastus was the secretary general of ecology .  it was not an elective office  it was little known .  it was simply the most important post on earth  for it controlled everything .     jan marley said exactly that  as he sat there  with a sleepy look of absent minded dishevelment that made one i think he would have been fat if the human diet were so i uncontrolled as to allow of fatness .   he said     for my money this is the most important post on earth  and no one seems to know it .  i want to write it up .      adrastus shrugged .  his stocky figure  with its shock of hair  once a light brown and now a brown flecked gray  his faded blue eyes nested in darkened surrounding tissues  finely wrinkled  had been an unobtrusive part of the administrative scene for a generation .  he had been secretary general of ecology ever since the regional ecological councils had been combined into the terrestrial bureau .  those who knew of him at all found it impossible to think of ecology without him .   he said     the truth is i hardly ever make a decision truly my own .  the directives i sign aren t mine  really .  i sign them because it would be psychologically uncomfortable to have computers sign them .  but  you know  it s only the computers that can do the work .      the bureau ingests an incredible quantity of data each day  data forwarded to it from every part of the globe and dealing not only with human births  deaths  population shifts  production  and consumption  but with all the tangible changes in the plant and animal population as well  to say nothing of the measured state of the major segments of the environment   air  sea  and soil .  the information is taken apart  absorbed  and assimilated into crossfiled memory indices of staggering complexity  and from that memory comes answers to the questions we ask .      marley said  with a shrewd  sidelong glance     answers to all questions .      adrastus smiled .     we learn not to bother to ask questions that have no answer .         and the result     said marley     is ecological balance .         right  but a special ecological balance .  all through the planet s history  the balance has been maintained  but always at the cost of catastrophe .  after temporary imbalance  the balance is restored by famine  epidemic  drastic climatic change .  we maintain it now without catastrophe by daily shifts and changes  by never allowing imbalance to accumulate dangerously .      marley said     there s what you once said    man s greatest asset is a balanced ecology .          so they tell me i said .         it s there on the wall behind you .         only the first three words     said adrastus dryly .   there it was on a long shimmer plast  the words winking and alive  man s greatest asset .  .  .      you don t have to complete the statement .         what else can i tell you .         can i spend some time with you and watch you at your work .         you ll watch a glorified clerk .         i don t think so .  do you have appointments at which i may be present .         one appointment today  a young fellow named tansonia  one of our moon men .  you can sit in .         moon men .  you mean           yes  from the lunar laboratories .  thank heaven for the moon .  otherwise all their experimentation would take place on earth  and we have enough trouble containing the ecology as it is .         you mean like nuclear experiments and radiational pollution .         i mean many things .        lou tansonia s expression was a mixture of barely suppressed excitement and barely suppressed apprehension .     i m glad to have this chance to see you  mr .  secretary     he said breathlessly  puffing against earth s gravity .      i m sorry we couldn t make it sooner     said adrastus smoothly .     i have excellent reports concerning your work .  the other gentleman present is jan marley  a science writer  and he need not concern us .      lou glanced at the writer briefly and nodded  then turned eagerly to adrastus .     mr .  secretary         sit down     said adrastus .   lou did so  with the trace of clumsiness to be expected of one acclimating himself to earth  and with an air  somehow  that to pause long enough to sit was a waste of time .  he said     mr .  secretary  i am appealing to you personally concerning my project application num         i know it .         you ve read it  sir .         no  i haven t  but the computers have .  it s been rejected .         yes .  but i appeal from the computers to you .      adrastus smiled and shook his head .     that s a difficult appeal for me .  i don t know from where i could gather the courage to override the computer .         but you must     said the young man earnestly .     my field is genetic engineering .         yes  i know .         and genetic engineering     said lou  running over the interruption     is the handmaiden of medicine and it shouldn t be so .  not entirely  anyway .         odd that you think so .  you have your medical degree  and you have done impressive work in medical genetics .  i have been told that in two years time your work may lead to the full suppression of diabetes mellitus for good .         yes  but i don t care .  i don t want to carry that through .  let someone else do it .  curing diabetes is just a detail and it will merely mean that the death rate will go down slightly and produce just a bit more pressure in the direction of population increase .  i m not interested in achieving that .         you don t value human life .         not infinitely .  there are too many people on earth .         i know that some think so .         you re one of them  mr .  secretary .  you have written articles saying so .  and it s obvious to any thinking man   to you more than anyone   what it s doing .  over population means discomfort  and to reduce the discomfort private choice must disappear .  crowd enough people into a field and the only way they can all sit down is for all to sit down at the same time .  make a mob dense enough and they can move from one point to another quickly only by marching in formation .  that is what men are becoming  a blindly marching mob knowing nothing about where it is going or why .         how long have you rehearsed this speech  mr .  tansonia .      lou flushed slightly .      and the other life forms are decreasing in numbers of species and individuals  except for the plants we eat .  the ecology gets simpler every year .         it stays balanced .         but it loses color and variety and we don t even know how good the balance is .  we accept the balance only because it s all we have .         what would you do .          ask the computer that rejected my proposal .  i want to initiate a program for genetic engineering on a wide variety of species from worms to mammals .  i want to create new variety out of the dwindling material at hand before it dwindles out altogether .         for what purpose .         to set up artificial ecologies .  to set up ecologies based on plants and animals not like anything on earth .         what would you gain .         i don t know .  if i knew exactly what i would gain there would be no need to do research .  but i know what we ought to gain .  we ought to learn more about what makes an ecology tick .  so far  we ve only taken what nature has handed us and then ruined it and broken it down and made do with the gutted remains .  why not build something up and study that .         you mean build it blindly .  at random .         we don t know enough to do it any other way .  genetic engineering has the random mutation as its basic driving force .  applied to medicine  this randomness must be minimized at all costs  since a specific effect is sought .  i want to take the random component of genetic engineering and make use of it .      adrastus frowned for a moment .      and how are you going to set up an ecology that s meaningful .  won t it interact with the ecology that already exists  and possibly unbalance it .  that is something we can t afford .         i don t mean to carry out the experiments on earth     said lou .     of course not .         on the moon .         not on the moon  either .   on the asteroids .  i ve thought of that since my proposal was fed to the computer which spit it out .  maybe this will make a difference .  how about small asteroids  hollowed out  one per ecology .  assign a certain number of asteroids for the purpose .  have them properly engineered  outfit them with energy sources and transducers  seed them with collections of life forms which might form a closed ecology .  see what happens .  if it doesn t work  try to figure out why and subtract an item  or  more likely  add an item  or change the proportions .  we ll develop a science of applied ecology  or  if you prefer  a science of ecological engineering  a science one step up in complexity and significance beyond genetic engineering .         but the good of it  you can t say .         the specific good  of course not .  but how can it avoid some good .  it will increase knowledge in the very field we need it most .     he pointed to the shimmering lettering behind adrastus .     you said it yourself   man s greatest asset is a balanced ecology .   i m offering you a way of doing basic research in experimental ecology  something that has never been done before .         how many asteroids will you want .     lou hesitated .     ten .     he said with rising inflection .     as a beginning .         take five     said adrastus  drawing the report toward himself and scribbling quickly on its face  canceling out the computer s decision .     afterward  marley said     can you sit there and tell me that you re a glorified clerk now .  you cancel the computer and hand out five asteroids .  like that .         the congress will have to give its approval .  i m sure it will .         then you think this young man s suggestion is really a good one .         no  i don t .  it won t work .  despite his enthusiasm  the matter is so complicated that it will surely take far more men than can possibly be made available for far more years than that young man will live to carry it through to any worthwhile point .         are you sure .         the computer says so .  it s why his project was rejected .         then why did you cancel the computer s decision .         because i  and the government in general  are here in order to preserve something far more important than the ecology .      marley leaned forward .     i don t get it .         because you misquoted what i said so long ago .  because everyone misquotes it .  because i spoke two sentences and they were telescoped into one and i have never been able to force them apart again .  presumably  the human race is unwilling to accept my remarks as i made them .         you mean you didn t say  man s greatest asset is a i balanced ecology  .         of course not .  i said   man s greatest need is a balanced ecology .          but on your shimmer plast you say   man s greatest asset            that begins the second sentence  which men refuse to quote  but which i never forget    man s greatest asset is the unsettled mind .   i haven t overruled the computer for the sake of our ecology .  we only need that to live .  i overruled it to save a valuable mind and keep it at work  an unsettled mind .  we need that for man to be man   which is more important than merely to live .      marley rose .     i suspect  mr .  secretary  you wanted me here for this interview .  it s this thesis you want me to publicize  isn t it .         let s say     said adrastus     that i m seizing the chance to get my remarks correctly quoted .                 alas  that was my last sale to john .  the check arrived on august           and less than a year later he was dead .   when the story appeared in the january      issue of analog my good and gentle friend  ben bova  was editor of the magazine .  it isn t possible to fill john campbell s shoes  but ben is filling his own very successfully .     the next story was written as the result of a comedy of errors .  in january       as a result of a complicated set of circumstances  i promised bob silverberg that i would write a short story for an anthology of originals he was preparing .      you may be surprised that i don t explain the complicated set of circumstances  since i am such a blabbermouth  but bob finds my version a little on the offensive side  so we   ll let it go .    i wrote the short story but it turned out not to be a short story .  to my enormous surprise  i wrote a novel  the gods themselves  doubleday         my first science fiction novel in fifteen years  if you don t count fantastic voyage  which wasn t entirely mine  .   it wasn t a bad novel at all  since it won the hugo and the nebula  and showed the science fiction world that the old man still had it .  nevertheless  it put me in a hole since there was the short story i had promised bob .  i wrote another  therefore  take a match  and it appeared in bob s anthology new dimensions ii  doubleday        .       take a match     space was black  black an around in every direction .  there was nothing to be seen  not a star .   it was not because there were no stars     actually the thought that there might be no stars  literally no stars  had chilled per hanson s vitals .  it was the old nightmare that rested just barely subliminally beneath the skin of every deep spacer s brain .   when you took the jump through the tachyon universe  how sure were you where you would emerge .  the timing and quantity of the energy input might be as tightly controlled as you liked  and your fusionist might be the best in space  but the uncertainty principle reigned supreme and there was always the chance  even the inevitability of a random miss .   and by way of tachyons  a paper thin miss might be a thousand light years .   what  then  if you landed nowhere  or at least so distant from anywhere that nothing could possibly ever  guide you to knowledge of your own position and nothing  therefore  could guide you back to anywhere .   impossible  said the pundits .  there was no place in the universe from which the quasars could not be seen  and from those alone you could position yourself .  besides  the chance that in the course of ordinary jumps mere chance would take you outside the galaxy was only one in about ten million  and to the distance of  say  the andromeda galaxy or maffei    perhaps one in a quadrillion .   forget it  said the pundits .   so when a ship comes out of its jump  and returns from the weird paradoxes of the faster than light tachyons to the healthy we know it all of an the tardyons from protons down to protons up  there must be stars to be seen .  if they are not seen nevertheless  you are in a dust cloud  it is the only explanation .  there are smoggy areas in the galaxy  or in any spiral galaxy  as once there were on earth  when it was the sole home of humanity  rather than the carefully preserved  weather controlled  life preserve museum piece it now was .   hanson was tall and gloomy  his skin was leathery  and what he didn t know about the hyperships that ploughed the length and breadth of the galaxy and immediately neighboring regions always barring the fusionists  mysteries was yet to be worked out .  he was alone  now  in the captain s corner  as he liked to be .  he had at hand all that was needed to be connected with any man or woman on board  and with the results of any device and instrument  and it pleased him to be the unseen presence .      though now nothing pleased him .  he closed contact and said     what else  strauss .         we re in an open cluster     said strauss s voice .   hanson did not turn on the visual attachment  it would have meant revealing his own face and he preferred his look of sick worry to be held private .       at least     strauss continued     it seems to be an open cluster  from the level of radiation we can get in the far infrared and microwave regions .  the trouble is we just can t pinpoint the positions well enough to locate ourselves .  not a hope .         nothing in visible light .         nothing at all  or in the near infrared  either .  the dust cloud is as thick as soup .         how big is it .         no way of telling .         can you estimate the distance to the nearest edge .         not even to an order of magnitude .  it might be a light week .  it might be ten light years .  absolutely no way of telling .         have you talked to viluekis .      strauss said briefly     yes .         what does he say .         not much .  he s sulking .  he s taking it as a personal insult  of course .         of course .     hanson sighed noiselessly .  fusionists were as childish as children and because theirs was the romantic role in deep space  they were indulged .  he said     i suppose you told him that this sort of thing is unpredictable and could happen at any time .         i did .  and he said  as you can guess    not to viluekis .           except that it did  of course .  well  i can t speak to him .  nothing i say will mean anything at all except that i m trying to pull rank and then we ll get nothing further out of him .     he won t start the scoop .         he says he can t .  he says it will be damaged .         how can you damage a magnetic field .      strauss grunted .     don t say that to him .  he ll tell you there s more to a fusion tube than a magnetic field and then say you re trying to downgrade him .         yes  i know .     well  look  put everyone and everything on the cloud .  there must be some way to make some sort of guess as to the direction and distance of the nearest edge .     he broke connection .   hanson frowned into the middle distance  then .   nearest edge .  it was doubtful if at the ship s speed  relative to the surrounding matter  they dared expend the energy required for radical alteration of course .   they had moved into the jump at half light speed relative to the galactic nucleus in the tardyon universe  and they emerged from the jump at  of course  the same speed .  there always seemed an element of risk in that .  after all  suppose you found yourself  on the return  in the near neighborhood of a star and heading toward it at half light speed .   the theoreticians denied the possibility .  to get dangerously close to a massive body by way of a jump was not reasonably to be expected .  so said the pundits .  gravitational forces were involved in the jump and for the transition from tardyon to tachyon and back to tardyon those forces were repulsive in nature .  in fact  it was the random effect of a net gravitational force that could never be worked out in complete detail that accounted for a good deal of the uncertainty in the jump .   besides  they would say  trust to the fusionist s instinct .  a good fusionist never goes wrong .   except that this fusionist had jumped them into a cloud .      oh  that .  it happens all the time .  it doesn t matter .  do you know how thin most clouds are .  you won t even know you re in one .    not this cloud  o pundit .       in fact  clouds are good for you .  the scoops don t have to work so long or so hard to keep fusion going and energy storing .    not this cloud  o pundit .       well  then  rely on the fusionist to think of a way out .    but if there was no way out .    hanson shied away from that last thought .  he tried hard not to think it .     but how do you not think a thought that is the loudest thing in your head .     henry strauss  ship s astronomer  was himself in a mood of deep depression .  if what had taken place were undiluted catastrophe  it might be accepted .  no one on the hyperships could entirely close his eyes to the possibility of catastrophe .  you were prepared for that  or you tried to be .     though it was worse for the passengers  of course .   but when the catastrophe involved something that you would give your eye teeth to observe and study  and when you find that the professional find of a lifetime was precisely what was killing you     he sighed heavily .   he was a stout man  with tinted contact lenses that gave a spurious brightness and color to eyes that would otherwise have precisely matched a colorless personality .   there was nothing the captain could do .  he knew that .  the captain might be autocrat of all the rest of the ship  but a fusionist was a jaw to himself  and always had been .  even to the passengers  he thought with some disgust  the fusionist is the emperor of the spaceways and everyone beside dwindles to impotence .   it was a matter of supply and demand .  the computers might calculate the exact quantity and timing of the energy input and the exact place and direction  if    direction     had any meaning in the transition from tardyon to tachyon   but the margin of error was huge and only a talented fusionist could lower it .  what it was that gave a fusionist his talent  no one knew they were born  not made .  but fusionists knew they had the talent and there was never one that didn t trade on that .   viluekis wasn t bad as fusionists went though they never went far .  he and strauss were at least on speaking terms  even though viluekis had effortlessly collected the prettiest passenger on board after strauss had seen her first .   that was somehow part of the imperial rights of the fusionists en route .    strauss contacted anton viluekis .  it took time for it to go through and when it did  viluekis looked irritated in a rumpled  sad eyed way .      how s the tube .     asked strauss gently .     i think i shut it down in time .  i ve gone over it and i don t see any damage .  now     he looked down at himself     i ve got to clean up .         at least it isn t harmed .         but we can t use it         we might use it  vil     said strauss in an insinuating voice .     we can t say what will happen out there .  if the tube were damaged  it wouldn t matter what happened out there  but  as it is  if the cloud cleans up           if   if   if   i ll tell you an  if .   if you stupid astronomers had known this cloud was here  i might have avoided it .      that was flatly irrelevant  and strauss did not rise to the bait .  he said     it might clear up .         what s the analysis .         not good  vil .  it s the thickest hydroxyl cloud that s ever been observed .  there is nowhere in the galaxy  as far as i know  a place where hydroxyl has been concentrated so densely .          and no hydrogen .         some hydrogen  of course .  about five per cent        not enough     said viluekis curtly .     there s something else there besides hydroxyl .  there s something that gave me more trouble than hydroxyl could .  did you locate it .         oh  yes .  formaldehyde .  there s more formaldehyde than hydrogen .  do you realize what it means  vil .  some process has concentrated oxygen and carbon in space in unheard of amounts  enough to use up the hydrogen over a volume of cubic light years  perhaps .  there isn t anything i know or can imagine which would account for such a thing .         what are you trying to say  strauss .  are you telling me that this is the only cloud of this type in space and i am stupid enough to land in it .         i m not saying that  vil .  i only say what you hear me say and you haven t heard me say that .  but  vil  to get out we re depending on you .  i can t call for help because i can t aim a hyperbeam without knowing where we are  i can t find out where we are because i can t pinpoint any stars           and i can t use the fusion tube  so why am i the villain .  you can t do your job  either  so why is the fusionist always the villain .     viluekis was simmering .     it s up to you  strauss  up to you .  tell me where to cruise the ship to find hydrogen .  tell me where the edge of the cloud is .     or to hell with the edge of the cloud  find me the edge of the hydroxyl formaldehyde business .         i wish i could     said strauss     but so far i can t detect anything but hydroxyl and formaldehyde as far as i can probe .         we can t fuse that stuff .         i know .         well     said viluekis violently     this is an example of why it s wrong for the government to try to legislate supersafety instead of leaving it to the judgment of the fusionist on the spot .  if we had the capacity for the double jump  there d be no trouble .      strauss knew perfectly well what viluekis meant .  there was always the tendency to save time by making two jumps in rapid succession  but if one jump involved certain unavoidable uncertainties  two in succession greatly multiplied those uncertainties  and even the best fusionist couldn t do much .  the multiplied error almost invariably greatly lengthened the total time of the trip .   it was a strict rule of hypernavigation that one full day of cruising between jumps was necessary   three full days was preferable .  that gave time enough to prepare the next jump with all due caution .  to avoid breaking that rule  each jump was made under conditions that left insufficient energy supply for a second .  for at least some time  the scoops had to gather and compress hydrogen  fuse it  and store the energy  building up to jump ignition .  and it usually took at least a day to store enough to allow a jump .   strauss said     how far short in energy are you  vil .         not much .  this much .     viluekis held his thumb and forefinger apart by a quarter of an inch .     it s enough  though .         too bad     said strauss flatly .  the energy supply was recorded and could be inspected  but even so  fusionists had been known to organize the records in such a way as to leave themselves some leeway for that second jump .      are you sure .     he said .     suppose you throw in the emergency generators  turn off all the lights           and the air circulation and the appliances and the hydroponics apparatus .  i know .  i know .  i figured that all in and we don t quite make it .     there s your stupid double jump safety regulation .      strauss still managed to keep his temper .  he knew   everyone knew   that it had been the fusionist brotherhood that had been the driving force behind that regulation .  a double jump  sometimes insisted on by the captain  much more often than not made the fusionist look bad .   but then  there was at least one advantage .  with an obligatory cruise between every jump  there ought to be at least a week before the passengers grew restless and suspicious  and in that week something might happen .  so far  it was not quite a day .   he said     are you sure you can t do something with your system  filter out some of the impurities .         filter them out .  they re not impurities  they re the whole thing .  hydrogen is the impurity here .  listen  i ll need half a billion degrees to fuse carbon and oxygen atoms  probably a full billion .  it can t be done and i m not going to try .  if i try something and it doesn t work  it s my fault  and i won t stand for that .  it s up to you to get me to the hydrogen and you do it .  you just cruise this ship to the hydrogen .  i don t care how long it takes .      strauss said     we can t go faster than we re going now  considering the density of the medium  vil .  and at halflight speed we might have to cruise for two years maybe twenty years        well  you think of a way out .  or the captain .      strauss broke contact in despair .  there was just no way of carrying on a rational conversation with a fusionist .  he d heard the theory advanced  and perfectly seriously  that repeated jumps affected the brain .  in the jump  every tardyon in ordinary matter had to be turned into an equivalent tachyon and then back again to the original tardyon .  if the double conversion was imperfect in even the tiniest way  surely the effect would show up first in the brain  which was by far the most complex piece of matter ever to make the transition .  of course  no ill effects had ever been demonstrated experimentally  and no class of hypership officers seemed to deteriorate with time past what could be attributed to simple aging .  but perhaps whatever it was in the fusionists  brains that made them fusionists and allowed them to go  by sheer intuition  beyond the best of computers might be particularly complex and therefore particularly vulnerable .   nuts .  there was nothing to it .  fusionists were merely spoiled .   he hesitated .  ought he to try to reach cheryl .  she could smooth matters if anyone could  and once old vil baby was properly dandled  he might think of a way to put the fusion tubes into operation   hydroxyl or not .   did he really believe viluekis could  under any circumstances .  or was he trying to avoid the thought of cruising for years .  to be sure  hyperships were prepared for such an eventuality  in principle  but the eventuality had never come to pass and the crews   and still less the passengers   were surely not prepared for it .   but if he did talk to cheryl  what could he say that wouldn t sound like an order for seduction .  it was only one day so far and he was not yet ready to pimp for a fusionist .   wait .  awhile  anyway .     viluekis frowned .  he felt a little better having bathed and he was pleased that he had been firm with strauss .  not a bad fellow  strauss  but like all of them     them     the captain  the crew  the passengers  all the stupid non fusionists in the universe  he wanted to shed responsibility .  put it all on the fusionist .  it was an old  old song  and he was one fusionist who wouldn t take it .   that talk about cruising for years was just a way of trying to frighten him .  if they really put their minds to it  they could work out the limits of the cloud and somewhere there had to be a nearer edge .  it was too much to ask that they had landed in the precise center .  of course  if they had landed near one edge and were heading for the other     viluekis rose and stretched .  he was tall and his eyebrows hung over his eyes like canopies .   suppose it did take years .  no hypership had ever cruised for years .  the longest cruise had been eighty eight days and thirteen hours  when one of them had managed to find itself in an unfavorable position with respect to a diffuse star and had to recede at speeds that built up to over   .   light before it was reasonably able to jump .   they had survived and that was a quarter year cruise .  of course  twenty years  but that was impossible .   the signal light flashed three times before he was fully aware of it .  if that was the captain coming to see him personally  he would leave at a rather more rapid rate than he had come .      anton .      the voice was soft  urgent  and part of his annoyance seeped away .  he allowed the door to recede into its socket and cheryl came in .  the door closed again behind her .   she was about twenty five  with green eyes  a firm chin  dull red hair  and a magnificent figure that did not hide its light under a bushel .   she said      anton .  is there something wrong .      viluekis was not caught so entirely by surprise as to admit any such thing .  even a fusionist knew better than to reveal anything prematurely to a passenger .     not at all .  what makes you think so .         one of the other passengers says so .  a man named martand .         martand .  what does he know about it .     then  suspiciously      and what are you doing listening to some fool passenger .  what does he look like .      cheryl smiled wanly .     just someone who struck up a conversation in the lounge .  he must be nearly sixty years old  and quite harmless  though i imagine he would like not to be .  but that s not the point .  there are no stars in view .  anyone can see that  and martand said it was significant .         did he .  we re just passing through a cloud .  there are lots of clouds in the galaxy and hyperships pass through them all the time .         yes  but martand says you can usually see some stars even in a cloud .         what does he know about it .     viluekis repeated .     is he an old hand at deep space .         no o     admitted cheryl .     actually  it s his first trip  i think .  but he seems to know a lot .         i ll bet .  listen  you go to him and tell him to shut up .  he can be put in solitary for this .  and don t you repeat stories like that  either .      cheryl put her head to one side .     frankly  anton  you sound as though there were trouble .  this martand   louis martand is his name   is an interesting fellow .  he s a schoolteacher   eighth grade general science .         a grade school teacher .  good lord  cheryl           but you ought to listen to him .  he says that teaching children is one of the few professions where you have to know a little bit about everything because kids ask questions and can spot phonies .         well  then  maybe your specialty should be spotting phonies  too .  now  cheryl  you go and tell him to shut up  or i will .         all right .  but first   is it true that we re going through a hydroxyl cloud and the fusion tube is shut down .      viluekis s mouth opened  then shut again .  it was quite a while before he said     who told you that .         martand .  i ll go now .         no     said viluekis sharply .     wait awhile .  how many others has martand been telling all this .         nobody .  he said he doesn t want to spread panic .  i was there when he was thinking about it  i suppose  and i guess he couldn t resist saying something .         does he know you know me .      cheryl s forehead furrowed slightly .     i think i mentioned something about it .      viluekis snorted     don t you suppose that this crazy old man you ve picked up is bound to try to show you how great he is .  it s me he s trying to impress through you .         nothing of the sort     said cheryl .     in fact  he specifically said i wasn t to tell you anything .         knowing  of course  that you d come to me at once .         why should he want me to do that .         to show me up .  do you know what it s like being a fusionist .  to have everyone resenting you  against you  because you re so needed  because you        cheryl said     but what s any of that got to do with it .  if martand s all wrong  how would that show you up .  and if he s right   is he right  anton .         well  exactly what did he say .         i m not sure i can remember it all  of course     cheryl said thoughtfully .     it was after we came out of the jump  actually quite a few hours after .  by that time all anyone was talking about was that there were no stars in view .  in the lounge everyone was saying there ought to be another jump soon because what was the good of deep space travel without a view .  of course  we knew we had to cruise at least a day .  then martand came in  saw me  and came over to speak to me .     i think he rather likes me .         i think i rather don t like him     said viluekis grimly .     go on .         i said to him that it was pretty dreary without a view and he said it would stay that way for a while  and he sounded worried .  naturally i asked why he said such a thing and he said it was because the fusion tube had been turned off .         who told him that .     demanded viluekis .   he said there was a low hum that you could hear in one of the men s rooms that you couldn t hear anymore .  and he said there was a place in the closet of the game room where the chess sets were kept where the wall felt warm because of the fusion tube and that place was not warm now .         is that all the evidence he has .         cheryl ignored that and went on     he said there were no stars visible because we were in a dust cloud and the fusion tubes must have stopped because there was no hydrogen to speak of in it .  he said there probably wouldn t be enough energy to spark another jump and that if we looked for hydrogen we might have to cruise years to get out of the cloud .      viluekis s frown became ferocious .     he s panic mongering .  do you know what that           he s not .  he told me not to tell anyone because he said it would create panic and that besides it wouldn t happen .  he only told me because he had just figured it out and was all excited about it and had to talk to someone  but he said there was an easy way out and that the fusionist would know what to do so that there was no need to worry at all .     but you re the fusionist  so it seemed to me i had to ask whether he was really right about the cloud and whether you had really taken care of it .      viluekis said     this grade school teacher of yours knows nothing about anything .  just stay away from him .     uh  did he say what his so called easy way out was .         no .  should i have asked him .         no .  why should you have asked him .  what would he know about it .  but then again    all right  ask him .  i m curious what the idiot has in mind .  ask him .      cheryl nodded .     i can do that .  but are we in trouble .     viluekis said shortly .     suppose you leave that to me .   we re not in trouble till i say we re in trouble .      he looked for a long time at the closed door after she had left  both angry and uneasy .  what was this louis martand   this grade school teacher   doing with his lucky guesses .   if it finally came about that an extended cruise was necessary  the passengers would have to have it broken to them carefully  or none of them would survive .  with martand shouting it to all who would listen     almost savagely viluekis clicked shut the combination that would bring him the captain .     martand was slim and of neat appearance .  his lips seemed forever on the verge of a smile  though his face and bearing were marked by a polite gravity  an almost expectant gravity  as though he was forever waiting for the person with him to say something truly important .   cheryl said to him     i spoke to mr .  viluekis .     he s the fusionist  you know .  i told him what you said .      martand looked shocked and shook his head .     i m afraid you shouldn t have done that .         he did seem displeased .         of course .  fusionists are very special people and they don t like to have outsiders           i could see that .  but he insisted there was nothing to worry about .         of course not     said martand  taking her hand and patting it in a consoling gesture  but then continuing to hold it .     i told you there was an easy way out .  he s probably setting it up now .  still  i suppose it could be awhile before he thinks of it .         thinks of what .     then  warmly     why shouldn t he think of it  if you have .         but he s a specialist  you see  my dear young lady .  specialists think in their speciality and have a hard time getting out of it .  as for myself  i don t dare fall into rots .  when i set up a class demonstration i ve got to improvise most of the time .  i have never yet been at a school where proton micropiles have been available  and i   ve had to work up a kerosene thermoelectric generator when we re off on field trips .         what s kerosene .     asked cheryl .   martand laughed .  he seemed delighted .     you see .  people forget .  kerosene is a kind of flammable liquid .  a still more primitive source of energy that i have many times had to use was a wood fire which you start by friction .  did you ever come across one of those .  you take a match        cheryl was looking blank and martand went on indulgently     well  it doesn t matter .  i m just trying to get across the notion that your fusionist will have to think of something more primitive than fusion and that will take him a while .  as for me  i m used to working with primitive methods .   for instance  do you know what s out there .      he gestured at the viewing port  which was utterly featureless  so featureless that the lounge was virtually depopulated for lack of a view .      a cloud  a dust cloud .         ah  but what kind .  the one thing that s always to be found everywhere is hydrogen .  it s the original stuff of the universe and hyperships depend on it .  no ship can carry enough fuel to make repeated jumps or to accelerate to near light speed and back repeatedly .  we have to scoop the fuel out of space .         you know  i ve always wondered about that .  i thought outer space was empty .         nearly empty  my dear  and  nearly  is as good as a feast .  when you travel at a hundred thousand miles a second  you can scoop up and compress quite a bit of hydrogen  even when there s only a few atoms per cubic centimeter .  and small amounts of hydrogen  fusing steadily  provide all the energy we need .  in clouds the hydrogen is usually even thicker  but impurities may cause trouble  as in this one .         how can you tell this one has impurities .         why else would mr .  viluekis have shut down the fusion tube .  next to hydrogen  the most common elements in the universe are helium  oxygen  and carbon .  if the fusion pumps have stopped  that means there s a shortage of fuel  which is hydrogen  and a presence of something that will damage the complex fusion system .  this can t be helium  which is harmless .  it is possibly hydroxyl groups  an oxygen hydrogen combination .  do you understand .         i think so     said cheryl .     i had general science in college  and some of it is coming back .  the dust is really hydroxyl groups attached to solid dust grains .         or actually free in the gaseous state  too .  even hydroxyl is not too dangerous to the fusion system  in moderation  but carbon compounds are .  formaldehyde is most    likely and i should imagine with a ratio of about one of those to four hydroxyls .  do you see now .         no  i don t     said cheryl flatly .      such compounds won t fuse .  if you heat them to a few hundred million degrees  they break down into single atoms and the concentration of oxygen and carbon will simply damage the system .  but why not take them in at ordinary temperatures .  hydroxyl will combine with formaldehyde  after compression  in a chemical reaction that will cause no harm to the system .  at least  i m sure a good fusionist could modify the system to handle a chemical reaction at room temperature .  the energy of the reaction can be stored and  after a while  there will be enough to make a jump possible .      cheryl said     i don t see that at all .  chemical reactions produce hardly any energy  compared to fusion .         you re quite right  dear .  but we don t need much .  the previous jump has left us with insufficient energy for an immediate second jump   that s regulations .  but i ll bet your friend  the fusionist  saw to it that as little energy as possible was lacking .  fusionists usually do that .  the little extra required to reach ignition can be collected from ordinary chemical reactions .  then  once a jump takes us out of the cloud  cruising for a week or so will refill our energy tanks and we can continue without harm .  of course       martand raised his eyebrows and shrugged .      yes .         of course     said martand     if for any reason mr .  viluekis should delay  there may be trouble .  every day we spend before jumping uses up energy in the ordinary life of the ship  and after a while chemical reactions won t supply the energy required to reach jump ignition .  i hope he doesn t wait long .         well  why don t you tell him .  now .      martand shook his head .     tell a fusionist .  i couldn t do that  dear .         then i will .         oh  no .  he s sure to think of it himself .  in fact  i ll make a bet with you  my dear .  you tell him exactly what i said and say that i told you he had already thought of it himself and that the fusion tube was in operation .  and  of course  if i win        martand smiled .   cheryl smiled  too .     i ll see     she said .   martand looked after her thoughtfully as she hastened away  his thoughts not entirely on viluekis s possible reaction .   he was not surprised when a ship s guard appeared from almost nowhere and said     please come with me  mr .  martand .      martand said quietly .     thank you for letting me finish .  i was afraid you wouldn t .        something more than six hours passed before martand was allowed to see the captain .  his imprisonment  which was what he considered it  was one of isolation  but was not onerous  and the captain  when he did see him  looked tired and not particularly hostile .   hanson said     it was reported to me that you were spreading rumors designed to create panic among the passengers .  that is a serious charge .         i spoke to one passenger only  sir  and for a purpose .         so we realize .  we put you under surveillance at once  and i have a report  a rather full one  of the conversation you had with miss cheryl winter .  it was the second conversation on the subject .         yes  sir .         apparently you intended the meat of the conversation to be passed on to mr .  viluekis .         yes  sir .         you did not consider going to mr .  viluekis personally .         i doubt that he would have listened  sir .         or to me .         you might have listened  but how would you pass on the information to mr .  viluekis .  you might then have had to use miss winter yourself .  fusionists have their peculiarities .      the captain nodded abstractedly .     what was it you expected to happen when miss winter passed on the information to mr .  viluekis .         my hope  sir     said martand     was that he would be less defensive with miss winter than with anyone else  that he would feel less threatened .  i was hoping that he would laugh and say the idea was a simple one that had occurred to him long before  and that  indeed  the scoops were already working  with the intent of promoting the chemical reaction .  then  when he got rid of miss winter  and i imagine he would do that quickly  he would start the scoops and report his action to you  sir  omitting any reference to myself or miss winter .         you did not think he might dismiss the whole notion as unworkable .         there was that chance  but it didn t happen .         how do you know .         because half an hour after i was placed in detention  sir  the lights in the room in which i was kept dimmed perceptibly and did not brighten again .  i assumed that energy expenditure in the ship was being cut to the bone  and assumed further that viluekis was throwing everything into the pot so that the chemical reaction would supply enough for ignition .      the captain frowned .     what made you so sure you could manipulate mr .  viluekis .  surely you have never dealt with fusionists  have you .         ah  but i teach the eighth grade  captain .  i have dealt with other children .      for a moment the captain s expression remained wooden .  and then slowly it relaxed into a smile .     i like you  mr .  martand     he said     but it won t help you .  your expectations did come to pass  as nearly as i can tell  exactly as you had hoped .  but do you understand what followed .         i will  if you tell me .         mr .  viluekis had to evaluate your suggestion and decide  at once  whether it was practical .  he had to make a number of careful adjustments to the system to allow chemical reactions without knocking out the possibility of future fusion .  he had to determine the maximum safe rate of reaction  the amount of stored energy to save  the point at which ignition might safely be attempted  the kind and nature of the jump .  it all had to be done quickly and no one else but a fusionist could have done it .  in fact  not every fusionist could have done it  mr .  viluekis is exceptional even for a fusionist .  do you see .         quite well .     the captain looked at the timepiece on the wall and activated his viewport .  it was black  as it had been now for the better part of two days .     mr .  viluekis has informed me of the time at which he will attempt jump ignition .  he thinks it will work and i am confident in his judgment .         if he misses     said martand somberly     we may find ourselves in the same position as before  but stripped of energy .         i realize that     said hanson     and since you might feel a certain responsibility over having placed the idea in the fusionist s mind  i thought you might want to wait through the few moments of suspense ahead of us .      both men were silent now  watching the screen  while first seconds  then minutes  moved past .  hanson had not mentioned the exact deadline and martand had no way of telling how imminent it was or whether it had passed .  he could only shift his glance  occasionally and momentarily  to the captain s face  which maintained a studied expressionlessness .   and then came that queer internal wrench that disappeared almost at once  like a tic in the abdominal wall .  they had jumped .      stars .     said hanson in a whisper of deep satisfaction .  the viewport had burst into a riot of them  and at that moment martand could recall no sweeter sight in all his life .      and on the second     said hanson .      a beautiful job .  we re energy stripped now  but we ll be full again in anywhere from one to three weeks  and during that time the passengers will have their view .      martand felt too weak with relief to speak .   the captain turned to him .     now  mr .  martand .  your idea had merit .  one could argue that it saved the ship and everyone on it .  one could also argue that mr .  viluekis was sure to think of it himself soon enough .  but there will be no argument about it at all  for under no conditions can your part in this be known .  mr .  viluekis did the job and it was a great one of pure virtuosity even after we take into account the fact that you may have sparked it .  he will be commended for it and receive great honors .  you will receive nothing .      martand was silent for a moment .  then he said     i understand .  a fusionist is indispensable and i am of no account .  if mr .  viluekis s pride is hurt in the slightest  he may become useless to you  and you can t afford to lose him .  for myself well  be it as you wish .  good day  captain .         not quite     said the captain .     we can t trust you .         i won t say anything .         you may not intend to  but things happen .  we can t take the chance .  for the remainder of the flight you will be under house arrest .      martand frowned .     for what .  i saved you and your damned ship   and your fusionist .         for exactly that .  for saving it .  that s the way it works out .         where s the justice .      slowly the captain shook his head .     it s a rare commodity  i admit  and sometimes too expensive to afford .  you can t even go back to your room .  you will be seeing no one in what remains of the trip .      martand rubbed the side of his chin with one finger .     surely you don t mean that literally  captain .         i m afraid i do .         but there is another who might talk   accidentally and without meaning to .  you had better place miss winter under house arrest  too .         and double the injustice .         misery loves company     said martand .   and the captain smiled .     perhaps you re right     he said .              writer friends come and go  too  alas .  after i moved to new york  i frequently saw a number of writers whom  while i was in boston  i had seen only occasionally .  lester del rey and robert silverberg are examples .  but then in      bob moved to california and i lost him again .     i had a chance to do one last thing for john campbell  by the way .  it occurred to harry harrison to do an anthology of stories of the kind that john campbell had made famous by the authors he had made famous .  naturally  i was one of the authors  and in march      i offered to do another    thiotimoline    article .   i had done three in my time and they had made a considerable stir .  the first was the endochronic properties of resublimated thiotimoline and it had appeared in the march       astounding under circumstances described in the early asimov  where the article was reprinted   .   the second was the micropsychiatric applications of thiotimoline  which appeared in the december      astounding .  it  along with the first  was included in my collection only a trillion  abelard schuman        .   the third was thiotimoline and the space age  which appeared in the september      analog and was included in my book opus      houghton mifflin        .   now i wrote a fourth  a quarter century after the first  and it was thiotimoline to the stars .       thiotimoline to the stars        same speech  i suppose     said ensign feet wearily .      why not .     said lieutenant frohorov  closing his eyes and carefully sitting down on the small of his back .     he s given it for fifteen years  once to each graduating class of the astronautic academy .         word for word  i ll bet     said feet  who had heard it the year before for the first time .      as far as i can tell .     what a pompous bore .  oh  for a pin that would puncture pretension .      but the class was filing in now  uniformed and expectant  marching forward  breaking into rows with precision  each man and woman moving to his or her assigned seat to the rhythm of a subdued drumbeat  and then all sitting down to one loud boom .   at that moment admiral vernon entered and walked stiffly to the podium .      graduating class of      welcome .  your school days are over .  your education will now begin .      you have learned all there is to know about the classic theory of space flight .  you have been filled to overflowing with astrophysics and celestial relativistic mechanics .  but you have not been told about thiotimoline .      that s for a very good reason .  telling you about it in class will do you no good .  you will have to learn to fly with thiotimoline .  it is thiotimoline and that alone that will take you to the stars .  with all your book learning  you may still never learn to handle thiotimoline .  if so  there will yet be many posts you can fill in the astronautic way of life .  being a pilot will not  however  be one of them .      i will start you off on this  your graduation day  with the only lecture you will get on the subject .  after this  your dealings will thiotimoline will be in flight and we will find out quickly whether you have any talent for it at all .      the admiral paused  and seemed to be looking from face to face as though he was trying to assay each man s talent to begin with .  then he barked      thiotimoline .  first mentioned in       according to legend  by azimuth or  possibly  asymptote  who may  very likely  never have existed .  there is no record of the original article supposed to have been written by him  merely vague references to it  none earlier than the twenty first century .      serious study began with almirante  who either discovered thiotimoline  or rediscovered it  if the azimuth asymptote tale is accepted .  almirante worked out the theory of hypersteric hindrance and showed that the molecule of thiotimoline is so distorted that one bond is forced into extension through the temporal dimension into the past  and another into the future .      because of the future extension  thiotimoline can interact with an event that has not yet taken place .  it can  for instance  to use the classic example  dissolve in water approximately one second before the water is added .      thiotimoline is  of course  a very simple compound  comparatively .  it has  indeed  the simplest molecule capable of displaying endochronic properties   that is  the past future extension .  while this makes possible certain unique devices  the true applications of endochronicity had to await the development of more complicated molecules  polymers that combined endochronicity with firm structure .      pellagrini was the first to form endochronic resins and plastics  and  twenty years later  cudahy demonstrated the technique for binding endochronic plastics to metal .  it became possible to make large objects endochronic   entire spaceships  for instance .      now let us consider what happens when a large structure is endochronic .  i will describe it qualitatively only  it is all that is necessary .  the theoreticians have it all worked out mathematically  but i have never known a physics johnny yet who could pilot a starship .  let them handle the theory  then  and you handle the ship .      the small thiotimoline molecule is extraordinarily sensitive to the probabilistic states of the future .  if you are certain you are going to add the water  it will dissolve before the water is added .  if there is even the slightest doubt in your mind as to whether you will add the water  the thiotimoline will not dissolve until you actually add it .      the larger the molecule possessing endochronicity  the less sensitive it is to the presence of doubt .  it will dissolve  swell  change its electrical properties  or in some way interact with water  even if you are almost certain you may not add the water .  but then what if you don t  in actual fact  add the water .  the answer is simple .  the endochronic structure will move into the future in search of water  not finding it  it will continue to move into the future .      the effect is very much that of the donkey following the carrot fixed to a stick and held two feet in front of the donkey s nose  except that the endochronic structure is not as smart as the donkey  and never gets tired .      if an entire ship is endochronic   that is  if endochronic groupings are fixed to the hull at frequent intervals   it is easy to set up a device that will deliver water to key spots in the structure  and yet so arrange that device that although it is always apparently on the point of delivering the water  it never actually does .      in that case  the endochronic groupings move forward in time  carrying all the ship with it and all the objects on board the ship  including its personnel .      of course  there are no absolutes .  the ship is moving forward in time relative to the universe  and this is precisely the same as saying that the universe is moving backward in time relative to the ship .  the rate at which the ship is moving forward  or the universe is moving backward  in time  can be adjusted with great delicacy by the necessary modification of the device for adding water .  the proper way of doing this can be taught  after a fashion  but it can be applied perfectly only by inborn talent .  that is what we will find out about you all  whether you have that talent .      again he paused and appraised them .  then he went on  amid perfect silence      but what good is it all .  let s consider starflights and review some of the things you have learned in school .      stars are incredibly far apart and to travel from one to another  considering the light speed limit on velocity  takes years  centuries  millennia .  one way of doing it is to set up a huge ship with a closed ecology  a tiny  self contained universe .  a group of people will set out and the tenth generation thereafter reaches a distant star .  no one man makes the journey  and even if the ship eventually returns home  many centuries may have passed .      to take the original crew to the stars in their own lifetime  freezing techniques may keep them in suspended animation for virtually all the trip .  but freezing is a very uncertain procedure  and even if the crew survives and returns home  they will find that many centuries have passed on earth .      to take the original crew to the stars in their own lifetime  without freezing them  it is only necessary to accelerate to near light velocities .  subjective time slows  and it will seem to the crew that it will have taken them only months to make the trip .  but time travels at the normal rate for the rest of the universe  and when the crew returns they will find that although they  themselves  have aged and experienced no more than two months of time  perhaps  the earth itself will have experienced many centuries .      in every case  star travel involves enormous duration of time on earth  even if not to the crew .  one must return to earth  if one returns at all  far into the earth s future  and this means interstellar travel is not psychologically practical .      but    but  graduates        he peered piercingly at them and said in a low  tense voice     if we use an endochronic ship  we can match the time dilatation effect exactly with the endochronic effect .  while the ship travels through space at enormous velocity  and experiences a large slowdown in rate of experienced time  the endochronic effect is moving the universe back in time with respect to the ship .  properly handled  when the ship returns to earth  with the crew having experienced  say  only two months of duration  the entire universe will have likewise experienced only two months  duration .  at last  interstellar travel became practical .      but only if very delicately handled .      if the endochronic effect lags a little behind the time dilatation effect  the ship will return after two months to find an earth four months older .  this is not much  perhaps  it can be lived with  you might think  but not so .  the crew members are out of phase .  they feel everything about them to have aged two months with respect to themselves .  worse yet  the general population feels that the crew members are two months younger than they ought to be .  it creates hard feelings and discomforts .      similarly  if the endochronic effect races a little ahead of the time dilatation effect  the ship may return after two months to find an earth that has not experienced any time duration at all .  the ship returns  just as it is rising into the sky .  the hard feelings and discomforts will still exist .      no  graduates  no interstellar flight will be considered successful in this star fleet unless the duration to the crew and the duration to earth match minute for minute .  a sixty second deviation is a sloppy job that will gain you no merit .  a hundred twenty second deviation will not be tolerated .      i know  graduates  very well what questions are going through your minds .  they went through mine when i graduated .  do we not in the endochronic ship have the equivalent of a time machine .  can we not  by proper adjustment of our endochronic device  deliberately travel a century into the future  make our observations  then travel a century into the past to return to our starting point .  or vice versa  can we not travel a century into the past and then back into the future to the starting point .  or a thousand years  or a billion .  could we not witness the earth being born  life evolving  the sun dying .      graduates  the mathematical johnnies tell us that this sort of thing creates paradoxes and requires too much energy to be practical .  but   tell you the hen with paradoxes .  we can t do it for a very simple reason .  the endochronic properties are unstable .  molecules that are puckered into the time dimension are sensitive indeed .  relatively small effects will cause them to undergo chemical changes that will allow unpuckering .  even if there are no effects at all  random vibrations will produce the changes that will unpucker them .      in short  an endochronic ship will slowly go isochronic and become ordinary matter without temporal extension .  modem technology has reduced the rate of unpuckering enormously and may reduce it further still  but nothing we do  theory tells us  will ever create a truly stable endochronic molecule .      this means that your starship has only a limited life as a starship .  it must get back to earth while its endochronicity still holds  and that endochronicity must be restored before the next trip .      now  then  what happens if you return out of time .  if you are not very nearly in your own time  you will have no assurance that the state of the technology will be such as to enable you to re endochronicize your ship .  you may be lucky if you are in the future  you will certainly be unlucky in the past .  if  through carelessness on your part  or simply through lack of talent  you come back a substantial distance into the past  you will be certain to be stuck there because there will be no way of treating your ship in such a fashion as to bring it back into what will then be your future .      and i want you to understand  graduates     here he slapped one hand against the other  as though to emphasize his words     there is no time in the past where a civilized astronautic officer would care to spend his life .  you might  for instance  be stranded in sixth century france or  worse still  twentieth century america .      refrain  then  from any temptation to experiment with time .      let us now pass on to one more point which may not have been more than hinted at in your formal school days  but which is something you will be experiencing .      you may wonder how it is that a relatively few endochronic atomic bonds placed here and there among matter which is overwhelmingly isochronic can drag an with it .  why should one endochronic bond  racing toward water  drag with it a quadrillion atoms with isochronic   bonds .  we feel this should not happen  because of our lifelong experience with inertia .      there is  however  no inertia in the movement toward past or future .  if one part of an object moves toward the past or future  the rest of the object does so as well  and at precisely the same speed .  there is no mass factor at all .  that is why it is as easy for the entire universe to move backward in time as for this single ship to move forward   and at the same rate .      but there is even more to it than that .  the time dilatation effect is the result of your acceleration with respect to the universe generally .  you learned that in grade school  when you took up elementary relativistic physics .  it is part of the inertial effect of acceleration .      but by using the endochronic effect  we wipe out the time dilatation effect .  if we wipe out the time dilatation effect  then we are  so to speak  wiping out that which produces it .  in short  when the endochronic effect exactly balances the time dilatation effect  the inertial effect of acceleration is canceled out .      you cannot cancel out one inertial effect without canceling them all .  inertia is therefore wiped out altogether and you can accelerate at any rate without feeling it .  once the endochronic effect is well adjusted  you can accelerate from rest relative to earth  to         miles per second relative to earth in anywhere from a few hours to a few minutes .  the more talented and skillful you are at handling the endochronic effect  the more rapidly you can accelerate .      you are experiencing that now  gentlemen .  it seems to you that you are sitting in an auditorium on the surface of the planet earth  and i m sure that none of you has had any reason or occasion to doubt the truth of that impression .  but it s wrong just the same .      you are in an auditorium  i admit  but it is not on the surface of the planet  earth  not anymore .  you   i   all of us   are in a large starship  which took off the moment i began this speech and which accelerated at an enormous rate .  we reached the outskirts of the solar system while i ve been talking  and we are now returning .       at no time have any of you felt any acceleration  either through change in speed  change in direction of travel  or both  and therefore you have all assumed that you have remained at rest with respect to the surface of the earth .      not at all  graduates .  you have been out in space all the time i was talking  and have passed  according to calculations  within two million miles of the planet saturn .      he seemed grimly pleased at the distinct stir in the audience .      you needn t worry  graduates .  since we experience no inertial effects  we experience no gravitational effects either  the two are essentially the same   so that our course has not been affected by saturn .  we will be back on earth s surface any moment now .  as a special treat we will be coming down in the united nations port in lincoln  nebraska  and you will all be free to enjoy the pleasures of the metropolis for the weekend .      incidentally  the mere fact that we have experienced no inertial effects at all shows how well the endochronic effect matched the time dilatation .  had there been any mismatch  even a small one  you would have felt the effects of acceleration another reason for making no effort to experiment with time .      remember  graduates  a sixty second mismatch is sloppy and a hundred twenty second mismatch is intolerable .  we are about to land now  lieutenant prohorov  will you take over in the conning tower and oversee the actual landing .      prohorov said briskly     yes  sir     and went up the ladder in the rear of the assembly hall  where he had been sitting .   admiral vernon smiled .     you will all keep your seats .  we are exactly on course .  my ships are always exactly on course .      but then prohorov descended again and came running up the aisle to the admiral .  he reached him and spoke in a whisper .     admiral  if this is lincoln  nebraska  something is wrong .  all i can see are indians  hordes of indians .  indians in nebraska  now  admiral .      admiral vernon turned pale and made a rattling sound in his throat .  he crumpled and collapsed  while the graduating class rose to its feet uncertainly .  ensign peet had followed prohorov onto the platform and had caught his words and now stood there thunderstruck .   prohorov raised his arms .     all s well  ladies and gentlemen .  take it easy .  the admiral has just had a momentary attack of vertigo .  it happens on landing  sometimes  to older men .      peet whispered harshly     but we re stuck in the past  prohorov .      prohorov raised his eyebrows .     of course not .  you didn t feel any inertial effects  did you .  we can t even be an hour off .  if the admiral had any brains to go with his uniform  he would have realized it  too .  he had just said it  for god s sake .         then why did you say there was something wrong .  why did you say there are indians out there .         because there was and there are .  when admiral sap comes to  he won t be able to do a thing to me .  we didn t land in lincoln  nebraska  so there was something wrong all right .  and as for the indians well  if i read the traffic signs correctly  we ve come down on the outskirts of calcutta .                 harry harrison s anthology  in which thiotimoline to the stars appeared  was called simply astounding .  it had been harry s aim to make it one last issue of that magazine .  not analog now  but astounding .   there is nothing wrong with analog  but to us old timers no name change can possibly replace astounding in our hearts .     in the spring of      the saturday evening post  having reprinted a couple of my short pieces  asked me to write an original piece for them .  on may          caught in the grip of inspiration  i wrote light verse in one quick session at the typewriter and scarcely had to change a word in preparing final copy .  it appeared in the september october      issue of the saturday evening post .       light verse     the very last person anyone would expect to be a murderer was mrs .  avis lardner .  widow of the great astronaut martyr  she was a philanthropist  an art collector  a hostess extraordinary  and  everyone agreed  an artistic genius .  but above all  she was the gentlest and kindest human being one could imagine .   her husband  william j .  lardner  died  as we all know  of the effects of radiation from a solar flare  after he had deliberately remained in space so that a passenger vessel might make it safely to space station   .   mrs .  lardner had received a generous pension for that  and she had then invested wisely and well .  by late middle age she was very wealthy .   her house was a showplace  a veritable museum  containing a small but extremely select collection of extraordinarily beautiful jeweled objects .  from a dozen different cultures she had obtained relics of almost every conceivable artifact that could be embedded with jewels and made to serve the aristocracy of that culture .  she had one of the first jeweled wristwatches manufactured in america  a jeweled dagger from cambodia  a jeweled pair of spectacles from italy  and so on almost endlessly .   all was open for inspection .  the artifacts were not insured  and there were no ordinary security provisions .  there was no need for anything conventional  for mrs .  lardner maintained a large staff of robot servants  all of whom could be relied on to guard every item with imperturbable concentration  irreproachable honesty  and irrevocable efficiency .   everyone knew the existence of those robots and there is no record of any attempt at theft  ever .   and then  of course  there was her light sculpture .  how mrs .  lardner discovered her own genius at the art  no guest at her many lavish entertainments could guess .  on each occasion  however  when her house was thrown open to guests  a new symphony of light shone throughout the rooms  three dimensional curves and solids in melting color  some pure and some fusing in startling  crystalline effects that bathed every guest in wonder and somehow always adjusted itself so as to make mrs .  lardner s blue white hair and soft  unlined face gently beautiful .   it was for the light sculpture more than anything else that the guests came .  it was never the same twice  and never failed to explore new experimental avenues of art .  many people who could afford light consoles prepared light sculptures for amusement  but no one could approach mrs .  lardner s expertise .  not even those who considered themselves professional artists .   she herself was charmingly modest about it .     no  no     she would protest when someone waxed lyrical .     i wouldn t call it  poetry in light .   that s far too kind .  at most  i would say it was mere  light verse .      and everyone smiled at her gentle wit .   though she was often asked  she would never create light sculpture for any occasion but her own parties .     that would be commercialization     she said .   she had no objection  however  to the preparation of elaborate holograms of her sculptures so that they might be made permanent and reproduced in museums of art an over the world .  nor was there ever a charge for any use that might be made of her light sculptures .      i couldn t ask a penny     she said  spreading her arms wide .     it s free to all .  after all  i have no further use for it myself .     it was truer she never used the same light sculpture twice .   when the holograms were taken  she was cooperation itself .  watching benignly at every step  she was always ready to order her robot servants to help .     please  courtney     she would say     would you be so kind as to adjust the step ladder .      it was her fashion .  she always addressed her robots with the most formal courtesy .   once  years before  she had been almost scolded by a government functionary from the bureau of robots and mechanical men .     you can t do that     he said severely .     it interferes with their efficiency .  they are constructed to follow orders  and the more clearly you give those orders  the more efficiently they follow them .  when you ask with elaborate politeness  it is difficult for them to understand that an order is being given .  they react more slowly .      mrs .  lardner lifted her aristocratic head .     i do not ask for speed and efficiency     she said .     i ask goodwill .  my robots love me .      the government functionary might have explained that robots cannot love  but he withered under her hurt but gentle glance .   it was notorious that mrs .  lardner never even returned a robot to the factory for adjustment .  their positronic brains are enormously complex  and once in ten times or so the adjustment is not perfect as it leaves the factory .  sometimes the error does not show up for a period of time  but whenever it does  u .  s .  robots and mechanical men  inc .   always makes the adjustment free of charge .   mrs .  lardner shook her head .     once a robot is in my house     she said     and has performed his duties  any minor eccentricities must be borne with .  i will not have him manhandled .      it was the worse thing possible to try to explain that a robot was but a machine .  she would say very stiffly     nothing that is as intelligent as a robot can ever be but a machine .  i treat them as people .      and that was that .   she kept even max  although he was almost helpless .  he could scarcely understand what was expected of him .  mrs .  lardner denied that strenuously  however .     not at all     she would say firmly .     he can take hats and coats and store them very well  indeed .  he can hold objects for me .  he can do many things .         but why not have him adjusted .     asked a friend  once .      oh  i couldn t .  he s himself .  he s very lovable  you know .  after all  a positronic brain is so complex that no one can ever tell in just what way it s off .  if he were made perfectly normal there would be no way to adjust him back to the lovability he now has .  i won t give that up .         but if he s maladjusted     said the friend  looking at max nervously     might he not be dangerous .         never     laughed mrs .  lardner .     i ve had him for years .  he s completely harmless and quite a dear .      actually he looked like all the other robots  smooth  metallic  vaguely human but expressionless .   to the gentle mrs .  lardner  however  they were all individual  all sweet  all lovable .  it was the kind of woman she was .   how could she commit murder .     the very last person anyone would expect to be murdered would be john semper travis .  introverted and gentle  he was in the world but not of it .  he had that peculiar mathematical turn of mind that made it possible for him to work out in his mind the complicated tapestry of the myriad positronic brain paths in a robot s mind .   he was chief engineer of u . s .  robots and mechanical men  inc .   but he was also an enthusiastic amateur in light sculpture .  he had written a book on the subject  trying to show that the type of mathematics he used in working out positronic brain paths might be modified into a guide to the production of aesthetic light sculpture .   his attempt at putting theory into practice was a dismal failure  however .  the sculptures he himself produced  following his mathematical principles  were stodgy  mechanical  and uninteresting .   it was the only reason for unhappiness in his quiet  introverted  and secure life  and yet it was reason enough for him to be very unhappy indeed .  he knew his theories were right  yet he could not make them work .  if he could but produce one great piece of light sculpture     naturally  he knew of mrs .  lardner s light sculpture .  she was universally hailed as a genius  yet travis knew she could not understand even the simplest aspect of robotic mathematics .  he had corresponded with her but she consistently refused to explain her methods  and he wondered if she had any at all .  might it not be mere intuition .     but even intuition might be reduced to mathematics .  finally he managed to receive an invitation to one of her parties .  he simply had to see her .   mr .  travis arrived rather late .  he had made one last attempt at a piece of light sculpture and had failed dismally .   he greeted mrs .  lardner with a kind of puzzled respect and said     that was a peculiar robot who took my hat and coat .         that is max     said mrs .  lardner .      he is quite maladjusted  and he s a fairly old model .  how is it you did not return it to the factory .         oh  no     said mrs .  lardner .     it would be too much trouble .         none at all  mrs .  lardner     said travis .     you would be surprised how simple a task it was .  since i am with u .  s .  robots  i took the liberty of adjusting him myself .  it took no time and you ll find he is now in perfect working order .      a queer change came over mrs .  lardner s face .  fury found a place on it for the first time in her gentle life  and it was as though the lines did not know how to form .      you adjusted him .     she shrieked .     but it was he who created my light sculptures .  it was the maladjustment  the maladjustment  which you can never restore  that   that        it was really unfortunate that she had been showing her collection at the time and that the jeweled dagger from cambodia was on the marble tabletop before her .   travis s face was also distorted .     you mean if i had studied his uniquely maladjusted positronic brain paths i might have learned        she lunged with the knife too quickly for anyone to stop her and he did not try to dodge .  some said he came to meet it   as though he wanted to die .              in sending the story to the saturday evening post i was anxious to make it clear that i had not sent them an old story .  i explained rather emphatically that    i have written it today .      in doing this i had forgotten the prejudice many people have against any story that is written quickly .  there is the legend that a good story must be written and rewritten and must take days and days of agony for each pain wracked paragraph .  i think writers spread that piece of embroidery to collect public sympathy for themselves .   anyway  i don t write slowly  but editors who don t have much experience with me don t realize it .  i got a letter from the post people raving about the story and expressing the utmost astonishment that i had managed to write it in one day .  i kept quiet and said nothing .   however  i can tell you because you re my friends .  from the moment of sitting down at the typewriter to the moment of placing the envelope in the mailbox  it did not take me one day .  it took me two and a half hours .  but don t tell the post .     what  then  is left to tell you to bring you up to date .   well  on november           i married a second time .  my wife is janet jeppson .  she is a psychiatrist  a writer  and a wonderful woman  in order of increasing importance .  she has published a science fiction novel of her own  the second experiment  houghton mufflin        and received final word of the acceptance of that novel on november           half an hour after we had been married .  it was a big day .   i  for one  wish that her professional career left her a little more time for writing .  then we could perhaps work up a man and wife collection someday .
