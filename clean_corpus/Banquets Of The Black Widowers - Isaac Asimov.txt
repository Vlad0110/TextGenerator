banquets of the black widowers  isaac asimov        sixty million trillion combinations  since it was thomas trumbull who was going to act as host for the black widowers that month  he did not  as was his wont  arrive at the last minute  gasping for his preprandial drink .   there he was  having arrived in early dignity  conferring with henry  that peerless waiter  on the details of the menu for the evening  and greeting each of the others as he arrived .   mario gonzalo  who arrived last  took off his light overcoat with care  shook it gently  as though to remove the dust of the taxicab  and hung it up in the cloakroom .  he came back  rubbing his hands  and said   there s an autumn chill in the air .  i think summer s over .     good riddance   called out emmanuel rubin  from where he stood conversing with geoffrey avalon and james drake .    i m not complaining   called back gonzalo .  then  to trumbull   hasn t your guest arrived yet .    trumbull said distinctly  as though tired of explaining   i have not brought a guest .     oh .   said gonzalo  blankly .  there was nothing absolutely irregular about that .  the rules of the black widowers did not require a guest  although not to have one was most unusual .   well  i guess that s all right .     it s more than all right   said geoffrey avalon  who had just drifted in their direction  gazing down from his straight   backed height of seventy   four inches .  his thick graying eyebrows hunched over his eyes and he said   at least that guarantees us one meeting in which we can talk aimlessly and relax .    gonzalo said   i don t know about that .  i m used to the problems that come up .  i don t think any of us will feel comfortable without one .  besides  what about henry .    he looked at henry as he spoke and henry allowed a discreet smile to cross his unlined  sixtyish face .   please don t be concerned  mr .  gonzalo .  it will be my pleasure to serve the meal and attend the conversation even if there is nothing of moment to puzzle us .     well   said trumbull  scowling  his crisply waved hair startlingly white over his tanned face   you won t have that pleasure  henry .  i m the one with the problem and i hope someone can solve it  you at least  henry .    avalon s lips tightened   now by beelzebub s brazen bottom  tom  you might have given us one old   fashioned      trumbull shrugged and turned away  and roger halsted said to avalon in his soft voice   what s that beelzebub bit .  where d you pick that up .    avalon looked pleased .   oh  well  manny is writing some sort of adventure yarn set in elizabeth s england   elizabeth i of course   and it seems      rubin  having heard the magic sound of his name  approached and said   it s a sea story .    halsted said   are you tired of mysteries .     it s a mystery also   said rubin  his eyes flashing behind the thick lenses of his glasses .   what makes you think you can t have a mystery angle to any kind of story .     in any case   said avalon   manny has one character forever swearing alliteratively and never the same twice and he needs a few more resounding oaths .  beelzebub s brazen bottom is good  i think .     or mammon s munificent mammaries   said halsted .   trumbull said  violently   there you are .  if i don t come up with some problem that will occupy us in worthwhile fashion and engage our henry s superlative mind  the whole evening would degenerate into stupid triplets   by tutankhamen s tin trumpet .     it gets you after a while   grinned rubin  unabashed .    well  get off it   said trumbull .   is dinner ready  henry .     yes it is  mr .  trumbull .     all right  then .  if you idiots keep this alliteration up for more than two minutes  i m walking out  host or no host .    the table seemed empty with only six about it  and conversation seemed a bit subdued with no guest to sparkle before .   gonzalo  who sat next to trumbull  said   i ought to draw a cartoon of you for our collection since you re your own guest  so to speak .   he looked up complacently at the long list of guest   caricatures that lined the wall in rank and file .   we re going to run out of space in a couple of years .     then don t bother with me   said trumbull  sourly   and we can always make space by burning those foolish scrawls .     scrawls .   gonzalo seemed to debate within himself briefly concerning the possibility of taking offense .  then he compromised by saying   you seem to be in a foul mood  tom .     i seem so because i am .  i m in the situation of the chaldean wise men facing nebuchadnezzar .    avalon leaned over from across the table .   are you talking about the book of daniel  tom .     that s where it is  isn t it .    gonzalo said   pardon me  but i didn t have my bible lesson yesterday .  what are these wise men .     tell him  jeff   said trumbull .   pontificating is your job .    avalon said   it s not pontificating to tell a simple tale .  if you would rather      gonzalo said   i d rather you did  jeff .  you do it much more authoritatively .     well   said avalon   it s rubin  not i  who was once a boy preacher  but i ll do my poor best .  the second chapter of the book of daniel tells that nebuchadnezzar was once troubled by a bad dream and he sent for his chaldean wise men for an interpretation .  the wise men offered to do so at once as soon as they heard the dream but nebuchadnezzar couldn t remember the dream  only that he had been disturbed by it .  he reasoned  however  that if wise men could interpret a dream  they could work out the dream  too  so he ordered them to tell him both the dream and the interpretation .  when they couldn t do this  he very reasonably   by the standards of oriental potentates   ordered them all killed .  fortunately for them daniel  a captive jew in babylon  could do the job .    gonzalo said   and that s your situation  too  tom .     in a way .  i have a problem that involves a cryptogram   but i don t have the cryptogram .  i have to work out the cryptogram .     or you ll be killed .   asked rubin .    no .  if i fail  i won t be killed  but it won t do me any good  either .    gonzalo said   no wonder you didn t feel it necessary to bring a guest .  tell us all about it .     before the brandy .   said avalon  scandalized .    tom s host   said gonzalo  defensively .   if he wants to tell us now       i don t   said trumbull .   we ll wait for the brandy as we always do  and i ll be my own griller  if you don t mind .    when henry was pouring the brandy  trumbull rang his spoon against his water glass and said   gentlemen  i will dispense with the opening question by admitting openly that i cannot justify my existence .  without pretending to go on by question   and   answer  i will simply state the problem .  you are free to ask questions  but for god s sake  don t get me off on any wild   goose chases .  this is serious .    avalon said   go ahead  tom .  we will do our best to listen .    trumbull said  with a certain weariness   it involves a fellow named pochik .  i ve got to tell you a little about him in order to let you understand the problem but  as is usual in these cases  i hope you don t mind if i tell you nothing that isn t relevant .    in the first place he s from eastern europe  from someplace in slovenia  i think  and he came here at about fourteen .  he taught himself english  went to night school and to university extension  working every step of the way .  he worked as a waiter for ten years  while he was taking his various courses  and you know what that means .  sorry  henry .    henry said  tranquilly   it is not necessarily a pleasant occupation .  not everyone waits on the black widowers  mr .  trumbull .     thank you  henry .  that s very diplomatic of you .  however  he wouldn t have made it  if it weren t plain from the start that he was a mathematical wizard .  he was the kind of young man that no mathematics professor in his right mind wouldn t have moved heaven and earth to keep in school .  he was their claim to a mark in the history books   that they had taught pochik .  do you understand .    avalon said   we understand  tom .    trumbull said   at least  that s what they tell me .  he s working for the government now  which is where i come in .  they tell me he s something else .  they tell me he s in a class by himself .  they tell me he can do things no one else can .  they tell me they ve got to have him .  i don t even know what he s working on  but they ve got to have him .    rubin said   well  they ve got him  haven t they .  he hasn t been kidnapped and hijacked back across the iron curtain  has he .     no  no   said trumbull   nothing like that .  it s a lot more irritating .  look  apparently a great mathematician can be an idiot in every other respect .     literally an idiot .   asked avalon .   usually idiots savants have remarkable memories and can play remarkable tricks in computation  but that is far from being any kind of mathematician  let alone a great one .     no  nothing like that  either .   trumbull was perspiring and paused to mop at his forehead .   i mean he s childish .  he s not really learned in anything but mathematics and that s all right .  mathematics is what we want out of him .  the trouble is that he feels backward  he feels stupid .  damn it  he feels inferior  and when he feels too inferior  he stops working and hides in his room .    gonzalo said   so what s the problem .  everyone just has to keep telling him how great he is all the time .     he s dealing with other mathematicians and they re almost as crazy as he is .  one of them  sandino  hates being second best and every once in a while he gets pochik into a screaming fit .  he s got a sense of humor  this sandino  and he likes to call out to pochik   hey  waiter  bring the check .   pochik can t ever learn to take it .    drake said   read this sandino the riot act .  tell him you ll dismember him if he tries anything like that again .     they did   said trumbull   or at least as far as they quite dared to .  they don t want to lose sandino either .  in any case  the horseplay stopped but something much worse happened .  you see there s something called  if i ve got it right   goldbach s conjecture  .    roger halsted galvanized into a position of sharp interest at once .   sure   he said .   very famous .     you know about it .   said trumbull .   halsted stiffened .   i may just teach algebra to junior high school students  but yes  i know about goldbach s conjecture .  teaching a junior high school student doesn t make me a junior       all right .  i apologize .  it was stupid of me   said trumbull .   and since you re a mathematician  you can be temperamental too .  anyway  can you explain goldbach s conjecture .    because i m not sure i can .     actually   said halsted   it s very simple .  back in       i think  a russian mathematician  christian goldbach  stated that he believed every even number greater than   could be written as the sum of two primes  where a prime is any number that can t be divided evenly by any other number but itself and i .  for instance                                                           and so on  as far as you want to go .    gonzalo said   so what s the big deal .     goldbach wasn t able to prove it .  and in the two hundred and something years since his time  neither has anyone else .  the greatest mathematicians haven t been able to show that it s true .    gonzalo said   so .    halsted said patiently   every even number that has ever been checked always works out to be the sum of two primes .  they ve gone awfully high and mathematicians are convinced the conjecture is true   but no one can prove it .    gonzalo said   if they can t find any exceptions  doesn t that prove it .     no  because there are always numbers higher than the highest we ve checked  and besides we don t know all the prime numbers and can t  and the higher we go  then the harder it is to tell whether a particular number is prime or not .  what is needed is a general proof that tells us we don t have to look for exceptions because there just aren t any .  it bothers mathematicians that a problem can be stated so simply and seems to work out  too  and yet that it can t be proved .    trumbull had been nodding his head .   all right  roger  all right .  we get it .  but tell me  does it matter .  does it really matter to anyone who isn t a mathematician whether goldbach s conjecture is true or not  whether there are any exceptions or not .     no   said halsted .   not to anyone who isn t a mathematician  but to anyone who is and who manages either to prove or disprove goldbach s conjecture  there is an immediate and permanent niche in the mathematical hall of fame .    trumbull shrugged .   there you are .  what pochik s really doing is of great importance .  i m not sure whether it s for the department of defense  the department of energy  nasa  or what  but it s vital .  what he s interested in  however  is goldbach s conjecture  and for that he s been using a computer .     to try higher numbers .   asked gonzalo .   halsted said promptly   no  that would do no good .  these days  though  you can use computers on some pretty recalcitrant problems .  it doesn t yield an elegant solution  but it is a solution .  if you can reduce a problem to a finite number of possible situations   say  a million   you can program a computer to try every one of them .  if every one of them checks out as it s supposed to  then you have your proof .  they recently solved the four   color mapping problem that way  a problem as well known and as recalcitrant as goldbach s conjecture .     good   said trumbull   then that s what pochik s been doing .  apparently  he had worked out the solution to a particular lemma .  now what s a lemma .    halsted said   it s a partway solution .  if you re climbing a mountain peak and you set up stations at various levels  the lemmas are analogous to those stations and the solution to the mountain peak .     if he solves the lemma  will he solve the conjecture .     not necessarily   said halsted   any more than you ll climb the mountain if you reach a particular station on the slopes .  but if you don t solve the lemma  you re not likely to solve the problem  at least not from that direction .     all right  then   said trumbull  sitting back .   well  sandino came up with the lemma first and sent it in for publication .    drake was bent over the table  listening closely .  he said   tough luck for pochik .    trumbull said   except that pochik says it wasn t luck .  he claims sandino doesn t have the brains for it and couldn t have taken the steps he did independently  that it is asking too much of coincidence .    drake said   that s a serious charge .  has pochik got any evidence .     no  of course not .  the only way that sandino could have stolen it from pochik would have been to tap the computer for pochik s data and pochik himself says sandino couldn t have done that .     why not .   said avalon .    because   said trumbull   pochik used a code word .  the code word has to be used to alert the computer to a particular person s questioning .  without that code word  everything that went in with the code word is safely locked away .    avalon said   it could be that sandino learned the code word .     pochik says that is impossible   said trumbull .   he was afraid of theft  particularly with respect to sandino  and he never wrote down the code word  never used it except when he was alone in the room .  what s more  he used one that was fourteen letters long  he says .  millions of trillions of possibilities  he says .  no one could have guessed it  he says .    rubin said   what does sandino say .     he says he worked it out himself .  he rejects the claim of theft as the ravings of a madman .  frankly  one could argue that he s right .    drake said   well  let s consider .  sandino is a good mathematician and he s innocent till proven guilty .  pochik has nothing to support his claim and pochik actually denies that sandino could possibly have gotten the code word  which is the only way the theft could possibly have taken place .  i think pochik has to be wrong and sandino right .    trumbull said   i said one could argue that sandino s right  but the point is that pochik won t work .  he s sulking in his room and reading poetry and he says he will never work again .  he says sandino has robbed him of his immortality and life means nothing to him without it .    gonzalo said   if you need this guy so badly can you talk sandino into letting him have his lemma .     sandino won t make the sacrifice and we can t make him unless we have reason to think that fraud was involved .  if we get any evidence to that effect we can lean on him hard enough to squash him flat .    but now listen  i think it s possible sandino did steal it .    avalon said   how .     by getting the code word .  if i knew what the code word was  i m sure i could figure out a logical way in which sandino could have found it out or guessed it .  pochik  however simply won t let me have the code word .  he shrieked at me when i asked .  i explained why  but he said it was impossible .  he said sandino did it some other way   but there is no other way .    avalon said   pochik wants an interpretation but he won t tell you the dream  and you have to figure out the dream first and then get the interpretation .     exactly .  like the chaldean wise men .     what are you going to do .     i m going to try to do what sandino must have done .  i m going to try to figure out what the fourteen   letter code word was and present it to pochik .  if i m right  then it will be clear that what i could do  sandino could do  and that the lemma was very likely stolen .    there was a silence around the table and then gonzalo said   do you think you can do it  tom .     i don t think so .  that s why i ve brought the problem here .  i want us all to try .  i told pochik i would call him before       p . m .  tonight    trumbull looked at his watch    with the code word just to show him it could be broken .  i presume he s waiting at the phone .    avalon said   and if we don t get it .     then we have no reasonable way of supposing the lemma was stolen and no really ethical way of trying to force it away from sandino .  but at least we ll be no worse off .    avalon said   then you go first .  you ve clearly been thinking about it longer than we have  and it s your line of work .    trumbull cleared his throat .   all right .  my reasoning is that if pochik doesn t write the thing down  then he s got to remember it .  there are some people with trick memories and such a talent is fairly common among mathematicians .  however  even great mathematicians don t always have the ability to remember long strings of disjointed symbols and  upon questioning of his coworkers  it would seem quite certain that pochik s memory is an ordinary one .  he can t rely on being able to remember the code unless it s easy to remember .    that would limit it to some common phrase or some regular progression that you couldn t possibly forget .  suppose it were albert einstein  for instance .  that s fourteen letters and there would be no fear of forgetting it .  or sir isaac newton  or abcdefghijklmn  or  for that matter  nmlkjihgfedcba .  if pochik tried something like this  it could be that sandino tried various obvious combinations and one of them worked .    drake said   if that s true  then we haven t a prayer of solving the problem .  sandino might have tried any number of different possibilities over a period of months .  one of them finally worked .  if he got it by hit   and   miss over a long time  we have no chance in getting the right one in an hour and a half  without even trying any of them on the computer .     there s that  of course   said trumbull   and it may well be that sandino had been working on the problem for months .  sandino pulled the waiter routine on pochik last june  and pochik  out of his mind  screamed at him that he would show him when his proof was ready .  sandino may have put this together with pochik s frequent use of the computer and gotten to work .  he may have had months  at that .     did pochik say something on that occasion that gave the code word away .   asked avalon .    pochik swears all he said was  i ll show you when the proof is ready   but who knows .  would pochik remember his own exact words when he was beside himself .    halsted said   i m surprised that pochik didn t try to beat up this sandino .    trumbull said   you wouldn t be surprised if you knew them .  sandino is built like a football player and pochik weighs     pounds with his clothes on .    gonzalo said  suddenly   what s this guy s first name .    trumbull said   vladimir .    gonzalo paused a while  with all eyes upon him  and then he said   i knew it .  vladimir pochik has fourteen letters .  he used his own name .    rubin said   ridiculous .  it would be the first combination anyone would try .     sure  the purloined letter bit .  it would be so obvious that no one would think to use it .  ask him .    trumbull shook his head .   no .  i can t believe he d use that .    rubin said  thoughtfully   did you say he was sitting in his room reading poetry .     yes .     is that a passion of his .  poetry .  i thought you said that outside mathematics he was not particularly educated .    trumbull said  sarcastically   you don t have to be a ph . d .  to read poetry .    avalon said  mournfully   you would have to be an idiot to read modern poetry .     that s a point   said rubin .   does pochik read contemporary poetry .    trumbull said   it never occurred to me to ask .  when i visited him  he was reading from a book of wordsworth s poetry  but that s all i can say .     that s enough   said rubin .   if he likes wordsworth then he doesn t like contemporary poetry .  no one can read that fuddy   duddy for fun and like the stuff they turn out these days .     so .  what difference does it make .   asked trumbull .    the older poetry with its rhyme and rhythm is easy to remember and it could make for code words .  the code word could be a fourteen   letter passage from one of wordsworth s poems  possibly a common one  lonely as a cloud has fourteen letters .  or any fourteen   letter combinations from such lines as  the child is father of the man  or  trailing clouds of glory  or  milton .  thou shouldst be living at this hour .   or maybe from some other poet of the type .    avalon said   even if we restrict ourselves to passages from the classic and romantic poets  that s a huge field to guess from .    drake said   i repeat .  it s an impossible task .  we don t have the time to try them all .  and we can t tell one from another without trying .    halsted said   it s even more impossible than you think  jim .  i don t think the code word was in english words .    trumbull said  frowning   you mean he used his native language .     no  i mean he used a random collection of letters .  you say that pochik said the code word was unbreakable because there were millions of trillions of possibilities in a fourteen   letter combination .  well  suppose that the first letter could be any of the twenty   six  and the second letter could be any of the twenty   six  and the third letter  and so on .  in that case the total number of combinations would be    x    x     and so on .  you would have to get the product of fourteen    s multiplied together and the result would be    he took out his pocket calculator and manipulated it for a while    about    million trillion different possibilities .    now  if you used an english phrase or a phrase in any reasonable european language  most of the letter combinations simply don t occur .  you re not going to have an hgf or a qxz or an llllc .  if we include only possible letter combinations in words then we might have trillions of possibilities  probably less  but certainly not millions of trillions .  pochik  being a mathematician  wouldn t say millions of trillions unless he meant exactly that  so i expect the code word is a random set of letters .    trumbull said   he doesn t have the kind of memory      halsted said   even a normal memory will handle fourteen random letters if you stick to it long enough .    gonzalo said   wait awhile .  if there are only so many combinations  you could use a computer .  the computer could try every possible combination and stop at the one that unlocks it .    halsted said   you don t realize how big a number like    million trillion really is  mario .  suppose you arranged to have the computer test a billion different combinations every second .  it would take two thousand solid years of work  day and night  to test all the possible combinations .    gonzalo said   but you wouldn t have to test them all .  the right one might come up in the first two hours .  maybe the code was aaaaaaaaaaaaaa and it happened to be the first one the computer tried .     very unlikely   said halsted .   he wouldn t use a solid   a code anymore than he would use his own name .  besides sandino is enough of a mathematician not to start a computer attempt he would know could take a hundred lifetimes .    rubin said  thoughtfully   if he did use a random code  i bet it wasn t truly random .    avalon said   how do you mean  manny .     i mean if he doesn t have a superlative memory and he didn t write it down  how could he go over and over it in his mind in order to memorize it .  just repeat fourteen random letters to yourself and see if you can be confident of repeating them again in the exact order immediately afterward .  and even if he had worked out a random collection of letters and managed to memorize it  it s clear he had very little self   confidence in anything except mathematical reasoning .  could he face the possibility of not being able to retrieve his own information because he had forgotten the code .     he could start all over   said trumbull .    with a new random code .  and forget that  too .   said rubin .   no .  even if the code word seems random  i ll bet pochik has some foolproof way of remembering it  and if we can figure out the foolproof way  we d have the answer .  in fact  if pochik would give us the code word  we d see how he memorized it and then see how sandino broke the code .    trumbull said   and if nebuchadnezzar would only have remembered the dream  the wise men could have interpreted it .  pochik won t give us the code word  and if we work it with hindsight  we ll never be sufficiently sure sandino cracked it without hindsight .    all right  we ll have to give it up .     it may not be necessary to give it up   said henry  suddenly .   i think      all turned to henry  expectantly .   yes  henry   said avalon .   i have a wild guess .  it may be all wrong .  perhaps it might be possible to call up mr .  pochik  mr .  trumbull  and ask him if the code word is wealtmditebiat   said henry .   trumbull said   what .    halsted said  his eyebrows high   that s some wild guess  all right .  why that .    gonzalo said   it makes no sense .    no one could recall ever having seen henry blush  but he was distinctly red now .  he said   if i may be excused .  i don t wish to explain my reasoning until the combination is tried .  if i am wrong  i would appear too foolish .  and  on second thought  i don t urge it be tried .    trumbull said   no  we have nothing to lose .  could you write down that letter combination  henry .     i have already done so  sir .    trumbull looked at it  walked over to the phone in the corner of the room  and dialled .  he waited for four rings  which could be clearly heard in the breath   holding silence of the room .  there was then a click  and a sharp  high   pitched  hello .    trumbull said   dr .  pochik .  listen .  i m going to read some letters to you   no  dr .  pochik  i m not saying i ve worked out the code .  this is an exper   it s an experiment sir .  we may be wrong   no  i can t say how   listen  w  e  a  l   oh  good god .   he placed his hand over the mouthpiece .   the man is having a fit .     because it s right or because it s wrong .   asked rubin .    i don t know .   trumbull put the phone back to his ear .   dr .  pochik  are you there .    dr .  pochik .    the rest is    he consulted the paper    t  m  d  i  t  e  b  i  a  t .   he listened .   yes  sir  i think sandino cracked it  too  the same way we did .  we ll have a meeting with you and dr .  sandino  and we ll settle everything .  yes please  dr .  pochik  we will do our best .    trumbull hung up  heaved an enormous sigh  then said   sandino is going to think jupiter fell on him .    all right  henry  but if you don t tell us how you got that  you won t have to wait for jupiter .  i will kill you personally .     no need  mr .  trumbull   said henry .   i will tell you at once .  i merely listened to all of you .  mr .  halsted pointed out it would have to be some random collection of letters .  mr .  rubin said  backing my own feeling in the matter  that there had to be some system of remembering in that case .  mr .  avalon  early in the evening was playing the game of alliterative oaths  which pointed up the importance of initial letters .  you yourself mentioned mr .  pochik s liking for old   fashioned poetry like that of wordsworth .    it occurred to me then that fourteen was the number of lines in a sonnet  and if we took the initial letters of each line of some sonnet we would have an apparently random collection of fourteen letters that could not be forgotten as long as the sonnet was memorized or could  at worst  be looked up .    the question was  which sonnet .  it was very likely to be a well   known one  and wordsworth had written some that were .  in fact  mr .  rubin mentioned the first line of one of them   milton .  thou shouldst be living at this hour .   that made me think of milton  and it came to me that it had to be his sonnet  on his blindness  which as it happens  i know by heart .  please note the first letters of the successive lines .  it goes    when i consider how my light is spent  ere half my days  in this dark world and wide   and that one talent which is death to hide   lodged with me useless  though my soul more bent  to serve therewith my maker  and present  my true account  lest he returning chide    doth god exact day   labor  light denied .    i fondly ask  but patience  to prevent  that murmur  soon replies   god doth not need  either man s work or his own gifts  who best  bear his mild yoke  they serve him best .  his state  is kingly .  thousands at his bidding speed  and post o er land and ocean without rest   .   .   .     henry paused and said softly   i think it is the most beautiful sonnet in the language  shakespeare s not excepted  but that was not the reason i felt it must hold the answer .  it was that dr .  pochik had been a waiter and was conscious of it  and i am one  which is why i have memorized the sonnet .  a foolish fancy  no doubt but the last line  which i have not quoted  and which is perhaps among the most famous lines milton ever constructed       go ahead  henry   said rubin .   say it .     thank you  sir   said henry  and then he said  solemnly     they also serve who only stand and wait .     afterword  i have a feeling that titles are an important part of a story and i take considerable care in choosing one .  in fact  i cannot start a story until i have chosen a title .   however  i don t follow certain clever rules in making the choice .  i don t really know what makes a title good   or the reverse .  it s just a gut feeling with me .  i pick one that seems to suit the story  and even add to it .   and often fred dannay  the editor of eqmm  would disagree with me   and i would then disagree with him and restore my own title when i put the story into a collection .   on the other hand  sometimes fred would choose a title that is an improvement  or so it would seem to me  and  since i am not a willfully stubborn man  i would go along with him .   for instance  i called the story you have just finished  fourteen letters  which is  after all  what it s about  but fred  when it appeared in the may          issue of eqmm  called it  sixty million trillion combinations   which is also what it s about  and fred s is infinitely more dramatic so i accepted it   with my usual annoyance at myself for not having thought of it to begin with .   the woman in the bar  the hits and outs of baseball did not  as a rule  disturb the equanimity  or lack of it  of a black widowers banquet .  none of the black widowers were sportsmen in the ordinary sense of the word  although mario gonzalo was known to bet on the horses on occasion .   over the rack of lamb  however  thomas trumbull brushed at his crisply waved white hair  looked stuffily discontented  and said   i ve lost all interest in baseball .  once they started shifting franchises  they broke up the kind of loyalties you inherited from your father .  i was a new york giants fan when i was a young man  as was my father before me .  the san francisco giants are strangers to me and as for the mets  well  they re just not the same .     there are still the new york yankees   said geoffrey avalon  deftly cutting meat away from bone and bending his dark eyebrows in concexuration on the task   and in my own town  we still have the phillies  though we lost the athletics .     chicago still has both its teams   said mario gonzalo   and there are still the cleveland indians  the cincinnati reds  the st .  louis       it s not the same   said trumbull  violently .   even if i were to switch to the yankees  half the teams they play are teams lou gehrig and bill dickey never heard of .  and now you have each league in two divisions  with playoffs before the world series  which becomes almost anticlimactic  and a batting average of  .     marks a slugger .  hell  i remember when you needed  .     if you were to stand a chance at cleanup position .    emmanuel rubin listened with the quiet dignity he considered suitable to his position as host   at least until his guest turned to him and said   is trumbull a baseball buff  manny .    at that  rubin reverted to his natural role and snorted loudly .  his sparse beard bristled .   who  tom .  he may have watched a baseball game on tv  but that s about it .  he thinks a double is two jiggers of scotch .    gonzalo said   come on  manny  you think a pitcher holds milk .    rubin stared at him fixedly through his thick lensed spectacles  and then said   it so happens i played a season of semi pro baseball as shortstop in the late      s .     and a shorter stop     began gonzalo and then stopped and reddened .   rubin s guest grinned .  though rubin was only five inches above the five   foot mark  the guest fell three inches short of that .  he said   i d be a shorter stop if i played .    gonzalo  with a visible attempt to regain his poise  said   you re harder to pitch to when you re less than average height  mr .  just .  there s that .     you re heavily underestimated in other ways  too  which is convenient at times   agreed just .   and  as a matter of fact  i m not much of a baseball buff myself .  i doubt if i could tell a baseball from a golf ball in a dim light .    darius just looked up sharply at this point .   waiter   he said   if you don t mind  i ll have milk rather than coffee .    james drake  waiting expectantly for his own coffee  said   is that just a momentary aberration  mr .  just  or don t you drink coffee .     don t drink it   said just .   or smoke  or drink alcohol .  my mother explained it all to me very carefully .  if i drank my milk and avoided bad habits  i would grow to be big and strong  so i did   and i didn t .  at least  not big .  i m strong enough .  it s all very un   american  i suppose  like not liking baseball .  at least you can fake liking baseball  though that can get you in trouble  too .    here s the milk .  how did that get there .    gonzalo smiled .   that s our henry .  noiseless and efficient .   just sipped his milk contentedly .  his facial features were small but alive and his eyes seemed restlessly aware of everything in the room .  his shoulders were broad  as though they had been made for a taller man  and he carried himself like an athlete .   drake sat over his coffee  quiet and thoughtful  but when rubin clattered his water glass with his spoon  the quiet ended .  drake s hand was raised and he said   manny  may i do the honors .     if you wish .   rubin turned to his guest .   jim is one of the more reserved black widowers  darius  so you can t expect his grilling to be a searching one .  in fact  the only reason he s volunteering is that he s written a book himself and he wants to rub shoulders with other writers .    just s eyes twinkled with interest .    what kind of a book  mr .  drake .     pop science   said drake   but the questions go the other way .  henry  since mr .  just doesn t drink  could you substitute ginger ale for the brandy .  i don t want him to be at a disadvantage .     certainly  mr .  drake   murmured henry  that miracle of waiters   if mr .  just would like that .  with all due respect  however  it does not seem to me that mr .  just is easily placed at a disadvantage .     we ll see   said drake  darkly .   mr .  just  how do you justify your existence .    just laughed .   it justifies itself to me now and then when it fills me with gladness .  as far as justification to the rest of the world is concerned  that can go hang .  with all due respect  as henry would say .     perhaps   said drake   the world will go hang even without your permission .  for the duration of this evening  however  you must justify your existence to us by answering our questions .  now i have been involved with the black widowers for more than half of a reasonably lengthy existence and i can smell out remarks that are worth elaboration .  you said that you could get in trouble if you faked the liking of baseball .  i suspect you did once  and i would like to hear about it .    just looked surprised  and rubin said  staring at his brandy   i warned you  darius .     you know the story  do you  manny .   said drake .    i know there is one but i don t know the details   said rubin .   i warned darius we d have it out of him .    just picked up the caricature mario gonzalo had drawn of him .  there was a face   splitting grin on it and arms with prodigious biceps were lifting weights .    i m not a weight lifter   he said .    it doesn t matter   said gonzalo .   that is how i see you .     weight lifting   said just   slows you .  the successful attack depends entirely on speed .     you re not being speedy answering my request   said drake  lighting a cigarette .    there is a story   said just .    good   said drake .    but it s an unsatisfactory one .  i can t supply any rationale  any explanation       better and better .  please begin .     very well   said just .    i like to walk .  it s an excellent way of keeping in condition and one night i had made my goal the new apartment of a friend i hadn t seen in a while .  i was to be there at   p . m .   and it was a moderately long walk by night  but i don t much fear the hazards of city streets in the dark though i admit i do not seek out particularly dangerous neighborhoods .    however  i was early and a few blocks from my destination  i stopped at a bar .  as i said  i don t drink  but i m not an absolute fanatic about it and i will  on rare occasions  drink a bloody mary .    there was a baseball game on the tv when i entered  but the sound was turned low  which suited me .  there weren t many people present  which also suited me .  there were two men at a table against the wall  and a woman on a stool at the bar itself .    i took the stool next but one to the woman  and glanced at her briefly after i ordered my drink .  she was reasonably pretty  reasonably shapely  and entirely interesting .  pretty and shapely is all right   what s not to like   but interesting goes beyond that and it can t be described easily .  it s different for each person  and she was interesting in my frame of reference .    among my abstentions  women are not included .  i even speculated briefly if it were absolutely necessary that i keep my appointment with my friend  who suffered under the disadvantage  under the circumstances  of being male .    i caught her eye just long enough before looking away .  timing is everything and i am not without experience .  then i looked up at the tv and watched for a while .  you don t want to seem too eager .    she spoke .  i was rather surprised .  i won t deny i have a way with women  despite my height  but my charm doesn t usually work that quickly .  she said   you seem to understand the game .   it was just make   talk .  she couldn t possibly know my relationship with baseball from my glazed   eye stare at the set .    i turned  smiled  and said   second nature .  i live and breathe it .     it was a flat lie  but if a woman leads  you go along with the lead .    she said  rather earnestly   you really understand it .   she was looking into my eyes as though she expected to read the answer on my retina .    i continued to follow and said   dear  there isn t a move in the game i can t read the motivations of .  every toss of the ball  every crack of the bat  every stance of the fielder  is a note in a symphony i can hear in my head .   after all  i m a writer  i can lay it on .    she looked puzzled .  she looked at me doubtfully  then  briefly  at the men at the table .  i glanced in their direction  too .  they didn t seem interested   until i noticed their eyes in the wall mirror .  they were watching our reflection .    i looked at her again and it was like a kaleidoscope shifting and suddenly making sense .  she wasn t looking for a pickup  she was scared .  it was in her breathing rate and in the tension of her hands .    and she thought i was there to help her .  she was expecting someone and she had spoken to me with that in mind .  what i answered was close enough   by accident   to make her think i might be the man  but not close enough to make her sure of it .    i said   i m leaving soon .  do you want to come along .   it sounded like a pickup  but i was offering to protect her if that was what she wanted .  what would happen afterward   well  who could tell .    she looked at me unenthusiastically .  i knew the look .  it said    you re five   foot   two  what can you do for me .     it s a chronic underestimate that plays into my hands .  whatever i do do is so much more than they expect that it assumes enormous proportions .  i m the beneficiary of a low baseline .    i smiled .  i looked in the direction of the two men at the table  looked back  let my smile widen and said   don t worry .     there were containers of cocktail amenities just behind the bar where she sat .  she reached over for the maraschino cherries  took a handful and twisted the stems off  then one by one nicked them broodingly toward me  keeping her eyes fixed on mine .    i didn t know what her game was .  perhaps she was just considering whether to take a chance on me and this was a nervous habit she always indulged in when at a bar .  but i always say  play along .    i had caught four and wondered how many she would flick at me  and when the barman would come over to rescue his supply  when my attention shifted .    one of the men who had been seated was now between the woman and myself  and was smiling at me without humor .  i had been unaware of his coming .  i was caught like an amateur  and the kaleidoscope suddenly shifted again .  that s the trouble with kaleidoscopes .  they keep shifting .    sure the woman was afraid .  she wasn t afraid of the men at the table .  she was afraid of me .  she didn t think i was a possible rescuer  she thought i was a possible spoiler .  so she kept my attention riveted while one of her friends got in under my guard   and i had let it happen .    i shifted my attention to the man now  minutes after i should have done so .  he had a moon face  dull eyes  and a heavy hand .  that heavy hand  his right one  rested on my left hand on the bar  pinning it down immovably .    he said   i think you re annoying the lady  chum .     he underestimated me  too  took me for what i was not .    you see  i ve never been any taller than i am now .  when i was young i was  in point of fact  smaller and slighter .  when i was nineteen  i would have had to gain five pounds to be a ninety   six   pound weakling .    the result you can guess .  the chivalry and sportsmanship of young people is such that i was regularly beaten up to the cheers of the multitude .  i did not find it inspiring .    from nineteen on  therefore  i was subscribing to build   yourself   up courses .  i struggled with chest expanders .  i took boxing lessons at the y .  bit by bit  i ve studied every one of the martial arts .  it didn t make me any taller  not one inch  but i grew wider and thicker and stronger .  unless i run into a brigade  or a gun  i don t get beaten up .    so the fact that my left arm was pinned did not bother me .  i said   friend  i don t like having a man hold my hand  so i think i will have to ask you to remove it .   i had my own right hand at eye level  palm up  something that might have seemed a gesture of supplication .    he showed his teeth and said   don t ask anything  pal .  i ll ask .     he had his chance .  you must understand that i don t fight to kill  but i do fight to maim .  i m not interested in breaking a hold  i want to be sure there won t be another one .    my hand flashed across between us .  speed is of the essence  gentlemen  and my nails scraped sideways across his throat en route  as the arc of my hand brought its edge down upon his wrist .  hard .    i doubt that i broke his wrist that time  but it would be days  perhaps weeks  before he would be able to use that hand on someone else as he had on me .  my hand was free in a moment .  the beauty of the stroke  however  was that he could not concentrate on the smashed wrist .  his throat had to be burning and he had to be able to feel the stickiness of blood there .  it was just a superficial wound  literally a scratch  but it probably frightened him more than the pain in his wrist did .    he doubled up  his left hand on his throat  his right arm dangling .  he was moaning .    it was all over quickly  but time was running out .  the second man was approaching  so was the bartender  and a newcomer was in the doorway .  he was large and wide and i was in no doubt that he was a member of the charming group i had run into .    the risks were piling up and the fun flattening out  so i walked out rapidly   right past the big fellow  who didn t react quickly enough  but stood there  confused and wondering  for the five seconds i needed to push past and out .    i didn t think they d report the incident to the police  somehow .  nor did i think i d be followed  but i waited for a while to see .  i was on a street with row houses  each with its flight of steps leading to the main door well above street level .  i stepped into one of the yards and into the shadow near the grillwork door at the basement level of a house that had no lights showing .    no one came out of the barroom .  they weren t after me .  they weren t sure who i was and they still couldn t believe that anyone as short as i was could be dangerous .  it was the providential underestimate that had done well for me countless times .    so i moved briskly along on my original errand  listening for the sound of footsteps behind me or the shifting of shadows cast by the streetlights .    i wasn t early any longer and i arrived on the corner where my friend s apartment house was located without any need for further delay .  the green light glimmered and i crossed the street  and then found matters were not as straightforward as i had expected .    the apartment house was not an only child but was a member of a large family of identical siblings .  i had never visited the complex before and i wasn t sure in which particular building i was to find my friend .  there seemed no directory  no kiosk with a friendly information guide .  there seemed the usual assumption underlying everything in new york that if you weren t born with the knowledge of how to locate your destination  you had no business having one .    the individual buildings each had their number displayed  but discreetly   in a whisper .  nor were they illuminated but by the glint of the streetlights  so finding them was an adventure .    one tends to wander at random at first  trying to get one s bearings .  eventually  i found a small sign with an arrow directing me into an inner courtyard with the promise that the number i wanted was actually to be found there .    another moment and i would have plunged in when i remembered that i was  or just conceivably might be  a marked man .  i looked back in the direction from which i had come .    i was spared the confusion of crowds .  even though it was not long after   p . m .   the street bore the emptiness characteristic of night in any american city of the universal automobile age .  there were automobiles  to be sure  in an unending stream  but up the street i had walked  i could see only three people in the glow of the streetlights  two men and a woman .    i could not see faces  or details of clothing  for though i have       vision  i see no better than that .  however  one of the men was tall and large and his outline was irresistibly reminiscent of the man in the doorway whom i had dodged past in leaving the bar .    they had been waiting for him  of course  and now they had emerged .  they would probably have come out sooner  i thought  but there had been the necessity of taking care of the one i had damaged and  i supposed  they had left him behind .    nor  i gathered  were they coming in search of me .  even from a distance i could tell their attention was not on something external to the group  as though they were searching for someone .  attention was entirely internal .  the two men were on either side of the woman and were hurrying her along .  it seemed to me that she was reluctant to move  that she held back  that she was being urged forward .    and once again  the kaleidoscope shifted .  she was a woman in distress after all .  she had thought i was her rescuer and i had left her cold   and still in distress .    i ran across the avenue against the lights  dodging cars  and racing toward them .  don t get me wrong .  i am not averse to defending myself  i rather enjoy it as anyone would enjoy something he does well .  just the same i am not an unreasoning hero .  i do not seek out a battle for no reason .  i am all for justice  purity  and righteousness  but who s to say which side  if either  in any quarrel represents those virtues .    a personal angle is something else  and in this cue  i had been asked for help and i had quailed .    oh  i quailed .  i admit i had honestly decided the woman was not on my side and needed no help  but i didn t really stay to find out .  it was that large man i was ducking  and i had to wipe out that disgrace .    at least that s what i decided in hot blood .  if i had had time to think  or to let the spasm of outrage wear off  i might have just visited my friend .  maybe i would have called the police from a street phone without leaving my name and then visited my friend .    but it was hot blood  and i ran toward trouble  weighing the odds very skimpily .    they were no longer on the street  but i had seen which gate they had entered  and they had not gone up the steps .  i chased into the front yard after them and seized the grillwork door that led to the basement apartment .  it came open but there was a wooden door beyond that did not .  the window blinds were down but there was a dim light behind them .    i banged at the wooden door furiously but there was no answer .  if i had to break it down  i would be at a disadvantage .  strength  speed  and skill are not as good at breaking down a door as sheer mass is  and mass i do not have .    i banged again and then kicked at the knob .  if it were the wrong apartment  it was breaking and entry  which it also was if it was the right apartment .  the door trembled at my kick  but held .  i was about to try again  wondering if some neighbor had decided to get sufficiently involved to call the police   when the door opened .  it was the large man   which meant it was the right apartment .    i backed away .  he said   you seem uncomfortably anxious to get in  sir .   he had a rather delicate tenor voice and the tone of an educated man .    i said   you have a woman here .  i want to see her .      we do not have a woman here .  she has us here .  this is a woman s apartment and we are here by her invitation .      i want to see her .      very well  then  come in and meet her .   he stepped back .    i waited  weighing the risks   or i tried to  at any rate  but an unexpected blow from behind sent me staggering forward .  the large man seized my arm and the door closed behind me .    clearly  the second man had gone one floor upward  come out the main door  down the stairs and behind me .  i should have been aware of him  but i wasn t .  i fall short of superman standards frequently .    the large man led me into a living room .  it was dimly lit .  he said   as you see  sir   our hostess .     she was there .  it was the woman from the bar but this time the kaleidoscope stayed put .  the look she gave me was unmistakable .  she saw me as a rescuer who was failing her .     now   said the large man   we have been polite to you although you treated my friend in the bar cruelly .  we have merely asked you in when we might have hurt you .  in response  will you tell us who you are and what you are doing here .     he was right .  the smaller man did not have to push me in .  he might easily have knocked me out  or done worse .  i presume  though  that they were puzzled by me .  they didn t know my part in it and they had to find out .    i looked about quickly .  the smaller man remained behind me  moving as i did .  the large man  who must have weighed     pounds  with little of it actually fat  remained quietly in front of me .  despite what happened in the bar  they still weren t afraid of me .  it was  once again  the advantage of small size .    i said   this young woman and i have a date .  we ll leave and you two continue to make yourself at home here .     he said   that is no answer  sir .     he nodded and i saw the smaller man move out of the corner of my eye .  i lifted my arms to shoulder level as he seized me about the chest .  there was no use allowing my arms to be pinned if i could avoid it .  the smaller man held tightly  but it would have taken more strength than he had at his disposal to break my ribs .  i waited for the correct positioning and i hoped the large man would give it to me .    he said   i do need an answer  sir  and if i do not get one very quickly  i will have to hurt you .     he came closer  one hand raised to slap .    what followed took less time than it will to explain but it went something like this .  my arms went up and back  and around the smaller man s head to make sure i had a firm backing  and then my feet went up .    my left shoe aimed at the groin of the large gentleman and the man doesn t live who won t flinch from that .  the large man s hips jerked backward and his head automatically bent downward and encountered the heel of my right shoe moving upward .  it s not an easy maneuver  but i ve practiced it enough times .    as soon as my heel made contact  i tightened my arm grip and tossed my head backward .  my head and that of the smaller man made hard contact and i didn t enjoy it at all  but the back of my head was not as sensitive as the nose of the man behind me .    from the woman s point of view  i imagine  there could be no clear vision of what had happened .  one moment  i seemed helplessly immobilized and then  after a flash of movement  i was free  while both of my assailants were howling .    the smaller man was on the floor with one hand over his face .  i stamped on one ankle hard to discourage him from attempting to get up .  no  it was not marquis of queensberry rules  but there were no referees around .    i then turned to face the larger man .  he brought his hands away from his face .  i had caught him on the cheekbone and he was bleeding freely .  i was hoping he had no fight left in him  but he did .  with one eye rapidly puffing shut  he came screaming toward me in a blind rage .    i was in no danger from his mad rush as long as i could twist away  but once he got a grip on me in his present mood  i would be in serious trouble .  i backed away  twisted .  i backed away  twisted again .  i waited for a chance to hit him again on the same spot .    unfortunately  i was in a strange room .  i backed away  twisted  and fell heavily over a hassock .  he was on me  his knee on my thighs  his hands on my throat  and there was no way i could weaken that grasp in time .    i could hear the loud thunk even through the blood roaring in my ears and the large man fell heavily on me   but his grip on my throat had loosened .  i wiggled out from below with the greatest difficulty though the woman did her best to lift him .    she said   i had to wait for him to stop moving .   there was a candle holder lying near him  a heavy wrought   iron piece .    i remained on the floor  trying to catch my breath .  i gasped out   have you killed him .      i wouldn t care if i did   she said  indifferently   but he s still breathing .     she wasn t exactly your helpless heroine .  it was her apartment so she knew where to find the clothesline  and she was tying both of them at the wrists and ankles very efficiently .  the smaller man screamed when she tightened the ropes at his ankle  but she didn t turn a hair .    she said   why the hell did you mess up the response in the bar when i asked you about baseball .  and why the hell didn t you bring people with you .  i admit you re a pint   sized windmill  but couldn t you have brought one backup .     well  i don t really expect gratitude  but   i said   lady  i don t know what you re talking about .  i don t know about the baseball bit  and i don t go about in squadrons .    she looked at me sharply .   don t move .  i m making a phone call .      the police .      after a fashion .     she went into the other room to call .  for privacy  i suppose .  she trusted me to stay where i was and do nothing .  or thought me stupid enough to do so .  i didn t mind .  i wasn t through resting .    when she came back  she said   you re not one of us .  what was that remark about baseball .     i said   i don t know who us is  but i m not one of anybody .  my remark about baseball was a remark .  what else .     she said   then how   well  you had better leave .  there s no need for you to be mixed up in this .  i ll take care of everything .  get out and walk some distance before you hail a taxi .  if a car pulls up at this building while you re within earshot  don t turn around and for god s sake  don t come back .     she was pushing and i was out in the yard when she said   but at least you knew what i was telling you in the bar .  i am glad you were here and waiting .     at last .  gratitude .  i said   lady  i don t know what     but the door was closed behind me .    i made it over very quickly to my friend s apartment .  he said nothing about my being an hour late or being a little the worse for wear and i said nothing about what had happened .    and what did happen was nothing .  i never heard a thing .  no repercussions .  and that s why it s an unsatisfactory story .  i don t know who the people were  what they were doing  what it was all about     don t know whether i was helping the good guys or the bad guys  or whether there were any good guys involved .  i may have bumped into two competing bands of terrorists playing with each other .    but that s the story about my faking a knowledge of baseball .    when just was done  a flat and rather unpleasant silence hung over the room  a silence that seemed to emphasize that for the first time in living memory a guest had told a rather long story without ever having been interrupted .   finally  trumbull heaved a weary sigh and said   i trust you won t be offended  mr .  just  if i tell you that i think you are pulling our leg .  you ve invented a very dramatic story for our benefit  and you ve entertained us   me  at least   but i can t accept it .    just shrugged  and didn t seem offended .   i ve embroidered it a little  polished it up a bit   i m a writer  after all   but it s true enough .    avalon cleared his throat .   mr .  just  tom trumbull is sometimes hasty in coming to conclusions but in this case i am forced to agree with him .  as you say  you re a writer .  i m sorry to say i have read none of your works but i imagine you write what are called tough   guy detective stories .     as a matter of fact  i don t   said just  with composure .   i have written four novels that are  i hope  realistic  but are not unduly violent .     it s a fact  jeff   said rubin  grinning .   gonzalo said   do you believe him  manny .    rubin shrugged .   i ve never found darius to be a liar  and i know something happened  but it s hard for a writer to resist the temptation to fictionalize for effect .  forgive me  darius  but i wouldn t swear to how much of it was true .    just sighed .   well  just for the record  is there anyone here who believes i told you what actually happened .    the black widowers sat in an embarrassed silence  and then there was a soft cough from the direction of the sideboard .    i hesitate to intrude  gentlemen   said henry   but despite the over   romantic nature of the story  it seems to me there is a chance that it is true .     a chance .   said just  smiling .   thank you  waiter .     don t underestimate the waiter   said trumbull  stiffly .   if he thinks there is a chance the story is true  i m prepared to revise my opinion .    what s your reasoning  henry .     if the story were fiction  mr .  trumbull  it would be neatly tied .  this one has an interesting loose end which  if it makes sense  cannot be accidental .    mr .  just  just at the end of the story  you told us that the woman remarked at her relief that you knew what she was telling you in the bar .  what had she told you .    just said   this is a loose end  because she didn t tell me a damn thing .  i could easily make something up  if i weren t telling the truth .     or you could let it remain loose now   said halsted   for the sake of verisimilitude .    henry said   and yet if your story is accurate  she may indeed have told you  and the fact that you don t understand that is evidence of its truth .     you speak in riddles  henry   said just .   henry said   you did not  in your story  mention precise locations  neither the location of the bar  nor of the apartment complex in which your friend lives .  there are a number of such apartment complexes in manhattan .     i know   interposed rubin   i live in one of them .     yours  mr .  rubin   said henry   is on west end avenue .  i suspect that the apartment complex of mr .  just s friend is on first avenue .    just looked astonished .   it is .  now how did you know that .    henry said   consider the opening scene of your story .  the woman at the bar knew she was in the hands of her enemies and would not be allowed to leave except under escort .  the two men in the bar were merely waiting for their large confederate .  they would then take her to her apartment for reasons of their own .  the woman thought you were one of her group  felt you could do nothing in the bar  but wanted you on the spot  near her apartment  with reinforcements .    she therefore flicked maraschino cherries at you   an apparently harmless and  possibly  flirtatious gesture  though even that roused the suspicions of the two men in the bar .    just said   what of that .    henry said   she had to work with what she could find .  the cherries were small spheres   little balls   and she sent you four  one at a time .  you had claimed to be a baseball fanatic .  she sent you four balls  and  in baseball parlance   as almost anyone knows   four balls  that is  four pitches outside the strike zone  means the batter may advance to first base .  more colloquially  he  walks to first  .  that s what she was telling you and you  quite without understanding this  did indeed walk to first avenue for reasons for your own .    just looked stupefied .   i never thought of that .     it s because you didn t and yet incorporated the incident into the account   said henry   that i think your story is essentially true .    afterword  i once wrote a mystery novel entitled murder at the aba in which my hero was a little guy named darius just .  i liked the book very much .    i usually like my own books very much  which is a lucky thing .  can you imagine how miserable my life would be if i disliked my books  considering how many of them i write .    i particularly liked darius and i kept planning to write other books in the series  but somehow i never got the chance .  in the first place there were so many nonfiction books i had to write and then  when the time came when doubleday grabbed me by the throat and told me i had to write more fiction  they made it plain that by fiction they meant science fiction .   so my hopes for additional darius just novels went glimmering   for a while anyway .   but then it occurred to me that there was nothing to prevent me from putting darius into an occasional short story and i thought up  the woman in the bar  specifically for him .   when fred published the story in the june           issue of eqmm  by the way  he called it  the man who pretended to like baseball  and that is an example of a title i didn t like .  too long and too off   center in my opinion .  so back to  the woman in the bar .    the driver  roger halsted looked over his drink and said in his soft voice   successful humor has its incongruity .  that is why people laugh .  the sudden change in point of view does it and the more sudden and extreme the change  the louder the laugh .   his voice took on the slight stutter that marked his more earnest moments .   james drake thought about it .   well  maybe  roger .  there are lots of theories about humor  but for my money  once you ve dissected a joke  you re about where you are when you ve dissected a frog .  it s dead .     but you ve learned something .    think of a joke .    drake said   i m trying to .    mario gonzalo  resplendent in a turtlenecked shin in rich purple under a beige jacket  said   try manny rubin .    emmanuel rubin  having glowered at gonzalo  and turned away with a look of unmistakable pain  said   i claim no expertise in humor .  my writing is invariably serious .    gonzalo said   i m not talking about your writing .  i m talking about you .    rubin said   i d answer that  mario  but dressed as you are  you re taking an unfair advantage .  i keep fighting nausea .    the monthly banquet of the black widowers was in full swing and henry  the indispensable waiter at these functions  announced that dinner was served .    easy on the food  manny   said mario   it s roast beef and yorkshire pudding today  henry tells me  and we don t want trouble with your delicate intestines and gross wit .     writing your own material  i see   said rubin .   too bad .    ah  there s tom .    tom trumbull s white thatch of hair showed as he moved hastily up the stairs  followed by the rest of him   apologies  gentlemen  minor family crisis  all taken care of and   thank you  henry .   he seized his scotch and soda gratefully .   you haven t begun eating yet .    geoffrey avalon said gravely   roger is buttering his roll but that s as far as we ve gotten .    drake said   tom trumbull  meet my guest  kirn magnus .  he s an exobiologist .    trumbull shook hands   pardon me  mr .  magnus .  i didn t quite get jim s job description .    magnus was tall and thin  with lank black hair worn at medium length and a boyish face .  he spoke quickly  but with intervals of careful enunciation .   exobiologist  mr .  trumbull .  e   x   o  a greek prefix meaning  outside .   personally  i prefer  xenobiologist   which sounds as though it starts with a z  but is x   e   n   o from a greek word meaning  stranger .   either way it s the study of life on other worlds .     like martians   said trumbull .    or mario in his shirt   said rubin .   magnus smiled .   the subject evokes laughter  i admit .  there is a certain incongruity in a field of study that includes no known cases and  as mr .  halsted was saying  incongruity is the very stuff of humor .     exactly   said halsted  swallowing a mouthful of kidney   on   toast .   i ll give you an example .  jack is sitting glumly in a bar  staring at his beer .  bob walks in  looks at jack and says   what s the matter .   says jack   my wife ran away with my best friend .   bob says   what are you talking about .  i m your best friend .   and jack says   not anymore .     there was general laughter and even trumbull condescended to smile .    you see   said halsted   you re allowed to assume that jack is weighted down with grief until the last three       we got it  rog   said rubin .   no need to belabor it .     or take the following       praise the lord   said trumbull when drake rattled his spoon on the water glass .   henry  make mine a double brandy .    oh  you have .     yes  sir   said henry  blandly   i anticipated the need when mr .  halsted began to quote limericks .     i ve already remembered you in my will  henry  and more of these sessions will hasten your role as beneficiary .    what .     i said   said drake  patiently   that i would like you to do the honors  tom  and grill our exobiologist .     my pleasure   said trumbull   if i may be allowed one invigorating sip .    ah .  now  mr .  magnus  it is usual for us to begin by asking a guest to justify his existence but i will make the question less general .    how does your role as exobiologist justify your existence .    magnus smiled .   would you believe the glory of seeking knowledge .     for yourself  certainly  and for me  maybe   but your researches draw heavily on the public purse .  how do you justify your existence to the taxpayer .     i wish i could  mr .  trumbull .  i wish i could say to him loudly enough to be heard    sir  the world pays out     billion dollars each year for its various sets of armed forces in order to buy nothing but the increasing certainty of destruction .  let us have one tenth of one percent of that to gain what may be fundamental knowledge concerning the universe .    avalon shook his head severely and said   that won t work  dr .  magnus .  the public sees national defense as their security against invasion and oppression by hated foreigners .  they may be wrong  but what have you to offer instead .  what if you do discover life on mars .  who cares .  why should anyone care .    magnus sighed .   somehow i didn t expect philistinism here .    avalon said   i plead the philistine case on behalf of my exorbitant tax bill .  what is your answer .     that your tax bill is exorbitant for reasons that have nothing to do with exobiology or science and a great deal to do with folly and corruption  worldwide .  if we did discover life on mars  which  since the viking landings  is unlikely  then no matter how simple it is  it will offer us for observation  for the first time  a life structure not in any way related to ourselves .    all life forms on earth  plant  animal  bacterial  and viral  are built around the same scheme  all the two million or so species are interconvertible in the sense that any one of them can be part of a food chain that ends in any other .  martian life  however simple it might be  would instantly double the varieties of life we know  with results of possibly incalculable benefits to the biologist and  of course  to all of us .  after all  the better we can understand life  the better our chances for such things as disease cure and life extension .    rubin interposed .   but the fact is that there is probably no life on mars  however simple .    magnus said   the odds now are that there isn t .     or anywhere in the solar system .     possibly not .     and if there were  it might after all be built on the same plan as is earth life .     that is conceivable .     and if it isn t  the difference may not help us understand ourselves at all .     i would hate to believe that  but i suppose that might be so .    rubin said   then  playing the devil s advocate  wouldn t you say that the odds you offer aren t worth the money you ask .    trumbull said   manny  it s worse than that .  i don t think exobiology concerns itself with the solar system only .  aren t there plans for trying to detect radio signals of intelligent origin from other stars .     from planets circling other stars  yes   said magnus .    and wouldn t that cost millions of dollars .     many millions if done properly .     and if we locate this life and draw their attention to us  then what .  do they invade us and take us over .  is that what we ll pay those many millions for .    for the first time  magnus allowed a look of impatience to cross his face .   in the first place   he said   we are merely listening .  the process is seti   search for extraterrestrial intelligence .   if we receive signals  we need not try to answer  if we do not wish to .  in the second place  the chances are that if we do receive signals  the source will be anywhere from dozens to hundreds of light   years away .  that means it will take them decades to centuries to receive any message we send them and with conversations like that danger wouldn t seem to be imminent .  in the third place  even if they could move faster than light and wanted to reach us  we have no reason to suppose conquest and destruction are what they have in mind .  we think that only because we insist on transferring our own bestiality to them .  in the fourth place  we have  in any case  given away our existence .  we have been leaking electromagnetic radiation of clearly intelligent origin for eight decades and the leakage has been growing steadily more intense every year .  so they ll know we re here if they want to listen .  and in the fifth place     he stopped suddenly .   trumbull said   you rattle that off as though you have much occasion to go through the list .     i do   said magnus .    then why did you stop .  have you forgotten the fifth place .     no  it is  in fact  the easiest one to remember .  we re not spending millions of dollars  you see  so the taxpayer has no worries for either his bankroll or his life .  in point of fact  we re spending almost nothing .    rubin said   what about project cyclops .    over a thousand radio telescopes computerized into unison to listen for signals from any star within a thousand light   years  one by one .  don t tell me that won t cost a fortune .     of course it would  and a bargain  too  at almost any price .  even if we pick up no signals of intelligent origin at all  who can tell what bizarre and unexpected discoveries we will make when we probe the universe with an instrument whole orders of magnitude more refined than anything we use now .     exactly   said rubin .   who can tell .  no one .  for it may come up with nothing .     well  no point in arguing   said magnus .   it s very doubtful we d ever get the necessary funds voted us by congress .  so far  it s been hard enough to get the money for some of us to attend international conferences on the subject and even that may be phased out  thanks to the damndest set of circumstances .   a spasm of unhappiness crossed his face .   there was a short silence and then avalon  drawing his formidable eyebrows together said   would you care to describe the circumstances  dr .  magnus .     there s not much to describe   said magnus .   there s a dull fog of suspicion that won t lift and that plays right into the hands of the millions   for   defense   but   not   one   cent   for   survival band of fools .    gonzalo looked delighted .   a dull fog of suspicion is just what we like to hear .  tell us the details .     it would scarcely be discreet to do so .    trumbull said at once   nothing said here is ever repeated outside .  we are all discreet and that includes our esteemed waiter  henry .     when i say it would not be discreet to tell you the details   said magnus  sadly   i am referring to my own folly .  i am afraid it is i who caused the trouble and i find it embarrassing to discuss .     if that s what s bothering you   said trumbull   then please tell us .  confession is good for the soul and even if it weren t  the condition of the dinner  as jim has no doubt told you  is submission to our grilling .     he told me   said magnus .   very well       some time ago   said magnus   we held an international meeting for those interested in seti in new brunswick  in canada .  the soviets sent a sizable contingent of some of their top   flight astronomers  and  of course  we ourselves were present in force as were canadians  british  french  australians  japanese  and a scattering of others  including a few eastern europeans .    there were also auxiliary personnel   translators  for instance  though most of those attending could speak very good english .  oddly enough  the purest and most smoothly colloquial english came from the sole bulgarian delegate  who sounded perfectly ohio at our social gatherings  but insisted on speaking bulgarian and using an interpreter in the formal sessions  perhaps to show his orthodox side to the soviets   but that s neither here nor there .    included also were  i am quite certain  a few soviet ringers who were  in actual fact  part of their security apparatus .  i am equally certain that american security personnel were also present .    gonzalo said   what for  mr .  magnus .  where s the danger in listening to the stars .  are the soviets afraid we ll make an alliance with some little green men against them .     or vice versa .   asked halsted  dryly .   magnus said   no  but knowledge is indivisible .  those of us who are experts on radio astronomy know a good deal about such things as reconnaissance satellites and killer satellites  and on handling  misleading  and aborting electronic reconnaissance .  both sides  therefore  would be anxious to prevent their own men from being indiscreet and to trap their opposite numbers into being overtalkative .    avalon said   it seems to me that security would be helpless in such matters .  could a cia operative know when an astronomer was being indiscreet when he probably couldn t understand the subject matter .    magnus said   you underestimate the training special agents undergo .  then  too  actual astronomers on either side might double as security .  i name no names .    trumbull said   no point in going into that any further .  would you go on  dr .  magnus .     certainly   said magnus .   i have stressed the total size of the delegation in order to explain that we could not all be housed in one place .  in fact  the new brunswick site  although suitable as a quasi   neutral spot   an earlier meeting had been held in finland   and although beautiful and isolated  to say nothing of possessing tennis courts and a swimming pool  did not offer adequate housing .  personnel were rather widely scattered and the canadian government supplied transportation .    we had several cars  each with a driver  and these were in constant demand .  the americans used a limousine which could hold six easily  although the driver would readily carry even a single passenger back and forth .  wasteful of gasoline  but convenient .    the driver was alex jones  an eager young man in his late twenties  who seemed to have the fixed notion that we were all astrologers .  he was as ignorant as anyone could be without actually being retarded  but he was fascinated by us .  he knew each one of us and called us all by some weird variety of our name .    i got off rather lightly .  he called me maggins  which is rather close  and once maggots  which is not so close .  i didn t mind and i didn t try to correct him .  alfred binder of arizona state was routinely called bandage  however  and he seethed each time .  sometimes  binder shouted at the young man in a rather uncalled   for manner .    avalon said   may i interrupt  dr .  magnus .  are you getting off the subject .  you sound as though you were reminiscing rather aimlessly .    there was a trace of stiffness in magnus s response   i am sorry  mr .  avalon  but this is all essential to the story .  there is little that is aimless about my manner of thought .    avalon cleared his throat and said in a subdued tone   my apologies  sir   then took a rather agitated sip at what was clearly an empty brandy glass .  henry quietly poured him a refill at once .    no offense  sir   said magnus .   alex was not the only driver  of course .  there were half a dozen at least  but he was the one who usually serviced the american delegation .  binder  i think  occasionally hitched a ride with the canadians or british just to get away from alex .  i suspect he would have ridden with the soviets if he had thought he could clear it with security on both sides .    i must confess that binder s irritation with alex amused me .  my sense of humor tends to be on the unkind side now and then  and when binder was in the car i would encourage alex to ask questions .  he would invariably ask what constellations we were studying  for instance  and which constellation was lucky for that day .  once  i even called binder  dr .  bandage  when we were in the car   not really on purpose   and afterward he blew up at me .    rubin said   people are generally sensitive about their names .     granted   said magnus   and  as i said  i m not really pleased with the direction my sense of humor takes  but when i am caught up in the fury of it  so to speak  i can t resist the joke .    of course  you must not suppose that these interludes in the car were nothing but nonsense .  in fact  i should say most of the delegates spoke about their work with a feverish intensity  since we were there as our own little clique .  alex listened without understanding a word and to me that was an added incentive  for i loved his off   target remarks .  once when someone mentioned cygnus xi   the putative black hole  you know   alex said   we re all sinners but it can t be helped .  it s in the stars .   for a minute there  i didn t see what he meant  but he was never completely off   base .  it was a matter of  cygnus  and  sinner  and alex free   associated them .    but the conference was drawing to its close .  we had all given our talks  we had all had our informal discussions over meals and during evening relaxation  and on the last day but one we were having a symposium  including six of the more vociferous attendees  whose attitudes were sufficiently different to promise some exciting give   and   take .    a group of us were being driven to luncheon  with the symposium slated for the afternoon  and the people in the car were speculating on how hectic the arguments might get .  out of sheer trouble   making i suppose  and in order to bait binder  i said   and what do you think of the people who will be in the symposium  alex .     alex said   pluhtahn   in a low voice and i said   pluhtahn .  who s he .     that was where binder overflowed .   what s the use of asking that idiot .  god knows what poor devil he s plastered with that name or what he s talking about .  why in hell do you encourage him .     that  in turn  made me stubborn .  i said   come on  he may not get the names quite right  but he refers to definite people .     binder said   there s no one in our group who has a name anything like pluhtahn .  it s just idiocy .      he s not an idiot   i said in a low voice  and anxious to prove that  i said   come on  alex  which one of us is pluhtahn .  what s he look like .     but alex looked terribly upset .  i could see him in profile as i leaned over the back of the front seat .  his lips were trembling and he had to swallow before he could say anything .  clearly  binder s rage had frightened him .  he muttered   i guess i must have made a mistake  mr .  maggins .      he was silent for the short remainder of the trip and when we piled out  he skipped his customary wave of the hand and his toothy grin .  poor fellow .  i called out to him but he didn t answer .  i couldn t help but think of binder as a pompous fool .    if i had left it at that  all might have been well but  by pure chance  yuri sat down next to me at lunch .    yuri was a member of the soviet group  of course  a dumpy man  quite stout  who was bald except for a fringe of dark hair  which he kept quite short .  he always wore a gray suit and a maroon tie and  while an excellent radio astronomer  he was given to grumpiness .  i never saw him smile and probably that s why i couldn t resist kidding him .    that  and my troublemaking sense of humor .    i said to him   what s this i hear  yuri  about your driving in our group s limousine .     he put down his knife and stared at me indignantly   what are you talking about .   he spoke english quite well  as did most of the soviets   which was humiliating for us  in a way  since none of us could speak more than a few words of russian .    you see  yuri s last name was platonov  accent on the second syllable  and it just struck me that if alex had had him in the car  the name pluhtahn could well have been wished on him .  of course  i knew that platonov would never have used our car .  of the entire soviet group  he was the least likely to chance anything unorthodox .  he was never friendly and some of us were convinced he was a member of soviet security .    of course  that made my joking seem all the runnier to me .  i said   our driver  alex jones  mentioned you  yuri  so i gather you ve been driving with him and talking to him .  what have you been doing .  trying to get him to defect .     yuri grew furious .  he said   is this a joke .  i warn you  i shall place a protest .  i do not think a sober scientific gathering is the place for tasteless remarks .     well  it was tasteless  i suppose  and besides  yuri had raised his voice and people were looking at us from all parts of the room .  so i backed off .  i said   no offense  yuri .  i just mentioned the symposium to our driver and he mumbled something about pluhtahn and i thought i would tease you .  our driver always gets names wrong and it doesn t mean anything .     yuri said  grumpily   keep your teasing to yourself .   he settled down to eat and neither looked at me nor talked to me during the remainder of the meal .  in fact  he said nothing at all to anybody and seemed rather deep in thought .    my conscience smote me .  he might not be part of soviet security .  he might  in fact  be very vulnerable .  if anyone on the soviet side had heard me  all of yuri s protestations and all my insistence that i was just making a bad joke might do no good .  the unreasoning arrow of suspicion might come to rest on him and  conceivably  his career might be ruined .  by the time i reached that stage in my thoughts  i felt pretty sick  and i did not enjoy the symposium .    in fact  the symposium was just a bit of a fizzle .  yuri  who was one of the participants  had been counted on for fireworks and he didn t offer any .  he seemed almost absentminded  as though he had something on his mind .  i felt terrible and  of course  things got worse      at this point  gonzalo interrupted .   don t tell me this guy platonov got in trouble and has been sent to siberia .    magnus said   no  not as far as i know .  what did happen was that that evening  our last at the conference  alex died .     the driver .   said avalon  clearly astonished .   trumbull said   how did he die .     well  that s it   said magnus .   it was not a natural death .  do you remember i mentioned a bulgarian in the group who spoke excellent english .  well  he was driving one of the smaller cars of those reserved for the soviet contingent to the village on an errand of some sort and he said that alex came staggering into the road in front of him and there was no way of avoiding him .     did it happen in the village .   asked rubin .    no  on the grounds  when the rest of us were gathering for the post   dinner convivial hour  so to speak  and most of us were there when the local police gathered .  it was clear that the bulgarian   his name was gabrilovich  by the way   expected to be imprisoned and charged with murder  and he feared the excesses of the capitalist   imperialist constabulary  but there was nothing like that  of course .  he was an honored foreign guest of the nation and was given the benefit of the doubt .  during the night the autopsy was performed and it seemed that alex had indeed been loaded with alcohol .  he was quite drunk enough to have staggered out into the road helplessly .    we carried on with the final summarizing session the next morning   which gabrilovich did not attend   and had permission to leave and go about our business after lunch .  gabrilovich himself had to stay an extra day to undergo additional questioning  which must have frightened him badly .  several on the soviet side kept him company and then they all left  too .    i called the canadian police a few days later  but the case was closed .  alex had no relatives and no possessions to speak of .  he was buried and that was the end of it .    halsted said  his high forehead pink with suppressed excitement   but you think it was no accident .  right .    magnus nodded .   two reasons .  first  what was gabrilovich doing driving to the village alone when the people on the soviet side  including the eastern europeans  never went in groups of less than three .     come  come   said avalon   that is custom and not cosmic law .     custom is sometimes surer   said magnus   and a man who could speak english perfectly  but used bulgarian to parade his loyalty  would not break that custom .  furthermore  he was going into town to buy himself an electric shaver  he said  because he was tired of nicking himself with his bulgarian straight razor .  however  i had never seen nicks on his face and it seemed to me that he would not so parade his infatuation with western technology .     not so   said avalon .   i imagine that there s nothing wrong with that .  the soviets buy all the effete bourgeois products they can get their hands on .  to give them credit  they make no bones about admiring the technology while claiming to despise the economic principles that go along with it .    magnus shrugged .   maybe .  the second thing that bothers me is that alex simply didn t seem like a drinker to me .  drinkers lard their conversation with casual references to drinks  and alex never did .     that s even weaker than the first reason   said avalon .   you can never tell a secret drinker .  for all you know alex was an alcoholic trying to stay off the booze at a conference where it probably drenched the proceedings at all times .  on the last evening  he couldn t resist a drink  which led to another and another   no  dr .  magnus  his death may not have been an accident but what you advance for thinking so would not suffice to make the police act upon it .    magnus said   but consider the coincidence .  earlier that day i had joked with yuri platonov concerning alex s use of the name of pluhtahn .  that night he was dead .    rubin said  skeptically   do you think the joke was worth a murder .     suppose   said magnus   yuri had been in the automobile which alex was driving .  suppose he had been talking to some westerner  receiving information .  they might well have disregarded alex  who was so clearly not mentally equipped to be dangerous .  but suppose alex had heard the westerner address the other as platonov and had picked up the name .  who knows what else he would remember .  so he was killed to keep from blowing the cover of an important spy in the enemy camp .    avalon said   surely  the chances that an ignorant young man could have heard anything of importance       if he could identify who was with platonov at that time  and he might  that would be enough .    in any case   magnus said  broodingly   i m not the only one who suspects murder and treason .  i strongly suspect that american security has tumbled to the possibility probably because of what i was overheard to say .  i ve been discreetly questioned about events at the conference  and i gather that a few others have been  too .  what s more  there s a certain amount of red tape that is slowing our ability to attend other conferences abroad .     in other words   said trumbull   you think the government suspects that one of the american delegation to the new brunswick conference is a traitor  but it doesn t know which one .    magnus nodded wordlessly .    do you think it s true .   said trumbull .   magnus said   i don t know .  i hate to believe it s true .  but it might be .  the worst of it is that if it hadn t been for my joking in the car and at the luncheon table  there would be no grounds for supposing alex s death to be anything but accident .  and maybe it was accident .    gonzalo said suddenly   no  it wasn t .  it was murder .    rubin looked outraged   on what grounds  mario .     the best in the world   said gonzalo .   when dr .  magnus said alex had died that night  i happened to have my eye on henry   and while the rest of you were registering surprise  henry nodded his head just a little as though he d been expecting it .  come on .  henry  what do you think of that automobile accident .    henry hesitated a moment  then said   clearly murder  i should say  mr .  gonzalo .  i feel it to be uncomfortably melodramatic to say so  but i suspect alex jones was pumped full of alcohol by persuasion or force  then pushed into the road in front of the car which gabrilovich was driving for the sole purpose of committing a murder that was to be made to look like an accident .    everyone stared at henry in astonishment and trumbull said   this time  henry  you ve gone too far .  on what can you possibly base that scenario  which you yourself call melodramatic .    magnus  who looked rather thunderstruck at the sudden participation of the waiter in the discussion  said   yes .  why do you say that .     it s simple enough   said henry .   when you mentioned the symposium  mr .  magnus  alex responded with  pluhtahn .   as it happens  there is a great literary work known as the symposium .  to mention it is bound to give rise  irresistibly  to the name of its author in anyone with a classical education .  the author happens to be plato and  plato s symposium  is practically one word  one implies the other .    magnus said   you mean that when i said  symposium   alex couldn t resist saying  plato  .  alex .  he had no classical education .  i doubt if he finished grade school .    henry said   it is easy to pretend to be uneducated and simple   minded .  if anything  alex worked too hard at it .  this business of mispronouncing names was rather a case of painting the lily  and in itself it arouses suspicion .    magnus said   you can t have it both ways .  if it was  plato  he was trying to say  he pronounced it incorrectly  which blows the theory of education sky   high .     ah   said henry   but he did not mispronounce plato s name  dr .  magnus .  we do .  in the original greek  the name was  platon  and was pronounced closer to  pluhtahn  than to our own  playtoe .   the russians kept both the spelling and the pronunciation and there was a famous high official of the russian church named platon .  i looked him up in the biographical dictionary while you were telling your story just to make sure i remembered correctly .     you remembered correctly   said avalon .   now why on earth didn t i think of that .   platon  is the greek word for  broad  and plato received it as a nickname because of his broad shoulders .  his real name was aristocles .    magnus said   but why should alex use the russian version of the name .    henry said   i suppose because he was russian  and when you said  symposium   the free association trapped him into the russian  rather than the english  version of the name .  i imagine he was a soviet agent  planted as a canadian national  and playing the role of simpleton .  his assignment at the time was  undoubtedly  to listen to the conversations in the car .    however  when he muttered  pluhtahn  and you picked that up  dr .  magnus  the driver realized he might have revealed his identity .  you said he seemed stricken .  you thought it was by dr .  binder s rage  but i suspect it was for a more serious reason .    then  when you joked about it with mr .  platonov  he had no trouble recognizing the author of symposium and it seemed to him  too  that alex had given himself away .  even if you did not see it  dr .  magnus  you might mention it to someone who would .  the soviets might well suppose that alex would no longer be reliable  that he might be picked up  that he might defect out of the fear of the consequences .  and if he had become an embarrassment and danger while alive  he might be better off dead .    magnus was thoughtful for a moment .   i think i ought to report all this .    trumbull said   it would lift some of the undeserved heat from the astronomers at the conference .  if you ll give me permission  i will make a phone call that will set the machinery moving .     yes  yes  of course   said magnus .   how strange for alex to give himself away in such a fashion when he played his part so well .    avalon said  philosophically   oh  well  educated men required to sound silly are under an intolerable strain .  sooner or later  they cannot resist the urge to display their erudition .  it will burst forth .     you demonstrate that all the time  jeff   said gonzalo .    i believe   said avalon  austerely   that i am not the only one here who is guilty in that respect .     i myself   said henry   fear i am not quite innocent   in that respect .    afterword  fred dannay didn t like this one .  at least he sent it back to me .   in a way it was my fault .  this was before i had begun my union club series  and i was going hot and heavy on the black widowers .  as it happened  i wrote two of them in succession   the driver   and  the good samaritan   which follows .   i then  in an attack of hubris  brought them in on the same day and handed them in together .   this is clearly a matter of bad tactics .  if an editor reads two of your stories at the same time  he is very likely to like one of the stories better than the other .  if he had read the weaker story by itself  suitably isolated from a similar story that came previously  it might seem a little weak even so  but perhaps not too weak to publish .  with the direct comparison of the other story  its flaws are magnified  and back it goes .   fred accepted  the good samaritan  and when  the driver  came back  i reread the two stories and decided that fred was right and that  the good samaritan  was the better of the two .   the lesson i learned  then  was not to tempt an editor by giving him two at once .  and  since i m prejudiced  i don t think that  the driver  is so weak that it ought to be discarded altogether .  it appears here  then  for the first time in print .   the good samaritan  the black widowers had learned by hard experience that when mario gonzalo took his turn as host of the monthly banquet  they had to expect the unusual .  they had reached the point where they steeled themselves  quite automatically  for disaster .  when his guest arrived there was a lightening of spirit if it turned out he had the usual quota of heads and could speak at least broken english .   when the last of the black widowers arrived  therefore  and when henry s efficient setting of the table was nearly complete  geoffrey avalon  standing  as always  straight and tall  sounded almost light   hearted as he said   i see that your guest has not arrived yet  mario .    gonzalo  whose crimson velvet jacket and lightly striped blue pants reduced everything else in the room to monochrome said   well      avalon said   what s more  a quick count of the settings placed at the table by our inestimable henry shows that six people and no more are to be seated .  and since all six of us are here  i can only conclude that you have not brought a guest .     thank anacreon   said emmanuel rubin  raising his drink   or whatever spirit it is that presides over convivial banquets of kindred souls .    thomas trumbull scowled and brushed back his crisply waved white hair with one hand .   what are you doing  mario .  saving money .     well     said gonzalo again  staring at his own drink with a totally spurious concentration .   roger halsted said   i don t know that this is so good .  i like the grilling sessions .     it won t hurt us   said avalon  in his deepest voice   to have a quiet conversation once in a while .  if we can t amuse each other without a guest  then the black widowers are not what once they were and we should prepare  sorrowing  for oblivion .  shall we offer mario a vote of thanks for his unwonted discretion .     well     said gonzalo a third time .   james drake interposed  stubbing out a cigarette and clearing his throat .   it seems to me  gentlemen  that mario is trying to say something and is amazingly bashful about it .  if he has something he hesitates to say  i fear we are not going to like it .  may i suggest we all keep quiet and let him talk .     well     said gonzalo  and stopped .  this time  though  there was a prolonged and anxious silence .    well     said gonzalo again   i do have a guest   and once more he stopped .   rubin said   then where the hell is he .     downstairs in the main dining room   ordering dinner   at my expense  of course .    gonzalo received five blank stares .  then trumbull said   may i ask what dunderheaded reason you can possibly advance for that .     aside   said rubin   from being a congenital dunderhead .    gonzalo put his drink down  took a deep breath  and said  firmly   because i thought she would be more comfortable down there .    rubin managed to get out an  and why     before the significance of the pronoun became plain .  he seized the lapels of gonzalo s jacket   did you say  she  .    gonzalo caught at the other s wrists .   hands off  manny .  if you want to talk  use your lips not your hands .  yes  i said  she .     henry  his sixtyish  unlined face showing a little concern  raised his voice a diplomatic notch and said   gentlemen .  dinner is served .    rubin  having released gonzalo  waved imperiously at henry and said   sorry  henry  there may be no banquet .    mario  you damned jackass  no woman can attend these meetings .    there was  in fact  a general uproar .  while no one quite achieved the anger and decibels of rubin  gonzalo found himself at bay with the five others around him in a semicircle .  their individual comments were lost in the general explosion of anger .   gonzalo  waving his arms madly  leaped onto a chair and shouted   let me speak .   over and over until out of exhaustion  it seemed  the opposition died off into a low growl .   gonzalo said   she is not our guest at the banquet .  she s just a woman with a problem  an old woman  and it won t do us any harm if we see her after dinner .    there was no immediate response and gonzalo said   she needn t sit at the table .  she can sit in the doorway .    rubin said   mario  if she comes in here  i go  and if i go  damn it  i may not come back ever .    gonzalo said   are you saying you ll break up the black widowers rather than listen to an old woman in trouble .    rubin said   i m saying rules are rules .    halsted  looking deeply troubled  said   listen  manny  maybe we ought to do this .  the rules weren t delivered to us from mount sinai .     you  too .   said rubin  savagely .   look  it doesn t matter what any of you say .  in a matter as fundamental as this  one blackball is enough  and i cast it .  either she goes or i go and  by god  you ll never see me again .  in view of that  is there anyone who wants to waste his breath .    henry  who still stood at the head of the table  waiting with markedly less than his usual imperturbability for the company to seat itself  said   may i have a word  mr .  rubin .    rubin said   sorry  henry  no one sits down till this is settled .    gonzalo said   stay out  henry .  i ll fight my own battles .    it was at this point that henry departed from his role as the epitome of all olympian waiters and advanced on the group .  his voice was firm as he said   mr .  rubin  i wish to take responsibility for this .  several days ago  mr .  gonzalo phoned me to ask if i would be so kind as to listen to a woman he knew who had the kind of problem he thought i might be helpful with .  i asked him if it was something close to his heart .  he said that the woman was a relative of someone who was very likely to give him a commission for an important piece of work       money .   sneered rubin .    professional opportunity   snapped gonzalo .   if you can understand that .  and sympathy for a fellow human being  if you can understand that .    henry held up his hand .   please  gentlemen .  i told mr .  gonzalo i could not help him but urged him  if he had not already arranged a guest  to bring the woman .  i suggested that there might be no objection if she did not actually attend the banquet itself .    rubin said   and why couldn t you help her otherwise .    henry said   gentlemen  i lay no claims to superior insight .  i do not compare myself  as mr .  gonzalo occasionally does on my behalf  to sherlock holmes .  it is only after you gentlemen have discussed a problem and eliminated what is extraneous that i seem to see what remains .  therefore      drake said   well  look  manny  i m the oldest member here  and the original reason for the prohibition .  we might partially waive it just this once .     no   said rubin  flatly .   henry said   mr .  rubin  it is often stated at these banquets that i am a member of the black widowers .  if so  i wish to take the responsibility .  i urged mr .  gonzalo to do this and i spoke to the woman concerned and assured her that she would be welcomed to our deliberations after dinner .  it was an impulsive act based on my estimate of the characters of the gentlemen of the club .    if the woman is now sent away  mr .  rubin  you understand that my position here will be an impossible one and i will be forced to resign my position as waiter at these banquets .  i would have no choice .    almost imperceptibly the atmosphere had changed while henry spoke and now it was rubin who was standing at bay .  he stared at the semicircle that now surrounded him and said  rather gratingly   i appreciate your services to the club  henry  and i do not wish to place you in a dishonorable position .  therefore  on the stipulation that this is not to set a precedent and reminding you that you must not do this again  i will withdraw my blackball .    the banquet was the least comfortable in the history of the black widowers .  conversation was desultory and dull and rubin maintained a stony silence throughout .   there was no need to clatter the water glass during the serving of the coffee  since there was no babble of conversation to override .  gonzalo simply said   i ll go down and see if she s ready .  her name  by the way  is mrs .  barbara lindemann .    rubin looked up and said   make sure she s had her coffee  or tea  or whatever  downstairs .  she can t have anything up here .    avalon looked disapproving   the dictates of courtesy  my dear manny       she ll have all she wants downstairs at mario s expense .  up here  we ll listen to her .  what more can she want .    gonzalo brought her up and led her to an armchair that henry had obtained from the restaurant office and that he had placed well away from the table .   she was a rather thin woman  with blunt good   natured features  well   dressed and with her white hair carefully set .  she carried a black purse that looked new and she clutched it tightly .  she glanced timidly at the faces of the black widowers and said   good evening .    there was a low chorused rumble in return and she said   i apologize for coming here with my ridiculous story .  mr .  gonzalo explained that my appearance here is out of the ordinary and i have thought over my dinner that i should not disturb you .  i will go if you like  and thank you for the dinner and for letting me come up here .    she made as though to rise and avalon  looking remarkably shamefaced  said   madame  you are entirely welcome here and we would like very much to hear what you have to say .  we cannot promise that we will be able to help you  but we can try .  i m sure that we all feel the same way about this .  don t you agree  manny .    rubin shot a dark look at avalon through his thick   lensed glasses .  his sparse beard bristled and his chin lifted but he said in a remarkably mild tone   entirely  ma am .    there was a short pause  and then gonzalo said   it s our custom  mrs .  lindemann  to question our guests and under the circumstances  i wonder if you would mind having henry handle that .  he is our waiter  but he is a member of our group .    henry stood motionless for a moment  then said   i fear  mr .  gonzalo  that      gonzalo said   you have yourself claimed the privilege of membership earlier this evening  henry .  privilege carries with it responsibility .  put down the brandy bottle  henry  and sit down .  anyone who wants brandy can take his own .  here  henry  take my seat .   gonzalo rose resolutely and walked to the sideboard .   henry sat down .   henry said mildly to mrs .  lindemann   madame  would you be willing to pretend you are on the witness stand .    the woman looked about and her look of uneasiness dissolved into a little laugh .   i never have been and i m not sure i know how to behave on one .  i hope you won t mind if i m nervous .     we won t  but you needn t be .  this will be very informal and we are anxious only to help you .  the members of the club have a tendency to speak loudly and excitably at times  but if they do  that is merely their way and means nothing .    first  please tell us your name .    she said  with an anxious formality   my name is barbara lindemann .  mrs .  barbara lindemann .     and do you have any particular line of work .     no  sir  i am retired .  i am sixty   seven years old as you can probably tell by looking at me   and a widow .  i was once a schoolteacher at a junior high school .    halsted stirred and said   that s my profession  mrs .  lindemann .  what subject did you teach .     mostly i taught american history .    henry said   now from what mr .  gonzalo has told me you suffered an unpleasant experience here in new york and       no  pardon me   interposed mrs .  lindemann   it was  on the whole  a very pleasant experience .  if that weren t so  i would be only too glad to forget all about it .     yes  of course   said henry   but i am under the impression that you have forgotten some key points and would like to remember them .     yes   she said  earnestly .   i am so ashamed at not remembering .  it must make me appear senile  but it was a very unusual and frightening thing in a way   at least pans of it were   and i suppose that s my excuse .    henry said   i think it would be best  then  if you tell us what happened to you in as much detail as you can and  if it will not bother you  some of us may ask questions as you go along .     it won t bother me  i assure you   said mrs .  lindemann .   i ll welcome it as a sign of interest .    she said   i arrived in new york city nine days ago .  i was going to visit my niece  among other things  but i didn t want to stay with her .  that would have been uncomfortable for her and confining for me  so i took a hotel room .    i got to the hotel at about   p . m .  on wednesday and after a small dinner  which was very pleasant  although the prices were simply awful  i phoned my niece and arranged to see her the next day when her husband would be at work and the children at school .  that would give us some time to ourselves and then in the evening we could have a family outing .    of course  i didn t intend to hang about their necks the entire two weeks i was to be in new york .  i fully intended to do things on my own .  in fact  that first evening after dinner  i had nothing particular to do and i certainly didn t want to sit in my room and watch television .  so i thought   well  all of manhattan is just outside  barbara  and you ve read about it all your life and seen it in the movies and now s your chance to see it in real life .    i thought i d just step out and wander about on my own and look at the elaborate buildings and the bright lights and the people hurrying past .  i just wanted to get a feel of the city  before i started taking organized tours .  i ve done that in other cities in these recent years when i ve been travelling and i ve always so enjoyed it .    trumbull said   you weren t afraid of getting lost  i suppose .     oh  no   said mrs .  lindemann  earnestly .   i have an excellent sense of direction and even if i were caught up in my sight   seeing and didn t notice where i had gone  i had a map of manhattan and the streets are all in a rectangular grid and numbered   not like boston  london  or paris  and i was never lost in those cities .  besides  i could always get in a taxi and give the driver the name of my hotel .  in fact  i am sure anyone would give me directions if i asked .    rubin emerged from his slough of despond to deliver himself of a ringing   in manhattan .  hah .     why  certainly   said mrs .  lindemann  with mild reproof .   i ve always heard that manhattanites are unfriendly  but i have not found it so .  i have been the recipient of many kindnesses   not the least of which is the manner in which you gentlemen have welcomed me even though i am quite a stranger to you .    rubin found it necessary to stare intently at his fingernails .   mrs .  lindemann said   in any case  i did go off on my little excursion and stayed out much longer than i had planned .  everything was so colorful and busy and the weather was so mild and pleasant .  eventually  i realized i was terribly tired and i had reached a rather quiet street and was ready to go back .  i reached in one of the outer pockets of my purse for my map      halsted interrupted .   i take it  mrs .  lindemann  you were alone on this excursion .     oh  yes   said mrs .  lindemann   i always travel alone since my husband died .  to have a companion means a perpetual state of compromise as to when to arise  what to eat  where to go .  no  no  i want to be my own woman .     i didn t quite mean that  mrs .  lindemann   said halsted .   i mean to ask whether you were alone on this particular outing in a strange city   at night   with a purse .     yes  sir .  i m afraid so .    halsted said   had no one told you that the streets of new york aren t always safe at night   particularly  excuse me  for older women with purses who look  as you do  gentle and harmless .     oh  dear  of course i ve been told that .  i ve been told that of every city i ve visited .  my own town has districts that aren t safe .  i ve always felt  though  that all life is a gamble  that a no   risk situation is an impossible dream  and i wasn t going to deprive myself of pleasant experiences because of fear .  and i ve gone about in all sorts of places without harm .    trumbull said   until that first evening in manhattan  i take it .    mrs .  lindemann s lips tightened and she said   until then .  it was an experience i remember only in flashes  so to speak .  i suppose that because i was so tired  and then so frightened  and the surroundings were so new to me  much of what happened somehow didn t register properly .  little things seem to have vanished forever .  that s the problem .   she bit her lips and looked as though she was battling to hold back the tears .   henry said softly   could you tell us what you remember .     well   she said  clearing her throat and clutching at her purse   as i said  the street was a quiet one .  there were cars moving past  but no pedestrians  and i wasn t sure where i was .  i was reaching for the map and looking about for a street sign when a young man seemed to appear from nowhere and called out   got a dollar lady .   he couldn t have been more than fifteen years old   just a boy .    well  i would have been perfectly willing to let him have a dollar if i thought he needed it  but really  he seemed perfectly fit and reasonably prosperous and i didn t think it would be advisable to display my wallet  so i said   i m afraid i don t  young man .     of course  he didn t believe me .  he came closer and said   sure you do  lady .  here  let me help you look   and he reached for my purse .  well  i wasn t going to let him have it  of course      trumbull said  firmly   no  of course  about it  mrs .  lindemann .  if it ever happens again  you surrender your purse at once .  you can t save it in any case  and the hoodlums will think nothing of using force  and there is nothing in the purse that can possibly be worth your life .    mrs .  lindemann sighed .   i suppose you re right  but at the time i just wasn t thinking clearly .  i held on to my purse as a reflex action  i suppose  and that s when i start failing to remember .  i recall engaging in a tug   of   war and i seem to recall other young men approaching .  i don t know how many but i seemed surrounded .    then i heard a shout and some very bad language and the loud noise of feet .  there was nothing more for a while except that my purse was gone .  then there was an anxious voice  low and polite   are you hurt  madam .     i said   i don t think so  but my purse is gone .   i looked about vaguely .  i think i was under the impression it had fallen to the street .    there was an older young man holding my elbow respectfully .  he might have been twenty   five .  he said   they got that  ma am  i d better get you out of here before they come back for some more fun .  they ll probably have knives and i don t .     he was hurrying me away .  i didn t see him clearly in the dark but he was tall and wore a sweater .  he said   i live close by  ma am .  it s either get to my place or we ll have a battle .   i think i was aware of other young men in the distance  but that may have been a delusion .    i went with the new young man quite docilely .  he seemed earnest and polite and i ve gotten too old to feel that i am in danger of   uh   personal harm .  besides  i was so confused and light   headed that i lacked any will to resist .    the next thing i remember is being at his apartment door .  i remember that it was apartment     f .  i suppose that remains in my mind because it was such a familiar combination during world war ii .  then i was inside his apartment and setting in an upholstered armchair .  it was a rather run   down apartment  i noticed  but i don t remember getting to it at all .    the man who had rescued me had put a glass into my hand and i sipped at it .  it was some kind of wine  i think .  i did not particularly like the taste  but it warmed me and it seemed to make me less dizzy   rather than more dizzy  as one would suppose .    the man seemed anxious about my possibly being hurt  but i reassured him .  i said if he would just help me get a taxi i would get back to my hotel .  he said i had better rest a while .    he offered to call the police to report the incident  but i was adamant against that .  that s one of the things i remember very clearly .  i knew the police could not recover my purse and i did not want to become a newspaper item .    i think i must have explained that i was from out of town because he lectured me  quite gently  on the dangers of walking on the streets of manhattan .    i ve heard so much on the subject in the last week .  you should hear my niece go on and on about it .    i remember other bits of the conversation .  he wanted to know whether i d lost much cash and i said  well  about thirty or forty dollars  but that i had traveller s checks which could  of course  be replaced .  i think i had to spend some time reassuring him that i knew how to do that  and that i knew how to report my missing credit card .  i had only had one in my purse .    finally  i asked him his name so that i could speak to him properly and he laughed and said   oh  first names will do for that .   he told me his and i told him mine .  and i said   isn t it astonishing how it all fits together  your name  and your address  and what you said back there .   i explained and he laughed and said he would never have thought of that .    so you see i knew his address .    then we went downstairs and it was quite late by then  at least by the clock  though  of course  it wasn t really very late by my insides .  he made sure the streets were clear  then made me wait in the vestibule while he went out to get a cab .  he told me he had paid the driver to take me wherever i wanted to go and then before i could stop him he put a twenty   dollar bill in my hand because he said i mustn t be left with no money at all .    i tried to object  but he said he loved new york  and since i had been so mistreated on my first evening there by new yorkers  it had to be made up for by new yorkers .  so i took it   because i knew i would pay it back .    the driver took me back to the hotel and he didn t try to collect any money .  he even tried to give me change because he said the young man had given him a five   dollar bill but i was pleased with his honesty and i wouldn t take the change .    so you see although the incident began very painfully  there was the extreme kindness of the good samaritan young man and of the taxi driver .  it was as though an act of unkindness was introduced into my life in order that i might experience other acts of kindness that would more than redress the balance .    and i still experience them  yours  i mean .    of course  it was quite obvious that the young man was not well off and i strongly suspected that the twenty   five dollars he had expended on me was far more than he could afford to throw away .  nor did he ask my last name or what my hotel was .  it was as though he knew i would pay it back without having to be reminded .  naturally  i would .    you see  i m quite well   to   do really  and it s not just a matter of paying it back .  the bible says that if you cast your bread upon the waters it will be returned tenfold  so i think it s only fair that if he put out twenty   five dollars  he ought to get two hundred fifty back and i can afford it .    i got back to my room and slept so soundly after all that  it was quite refreshing .  the next morning  i arranged my affairs with respect to the credit card and the traveller s checks and then i called my niece and spent the day with her .    i told her what had happened  but just the bare essentials .  after all  i had to explain why i had no bag and why i was temporarily short of cash .  she went on and on about it .  i bought a new purse   this one   and it wasn t till the end of the day when i was in bed again that i realized that i had not made it my business to repay the young man first thing .  being with family had just preoccupied me .  and then the real tragedy struck me .    mrs .  lindemann stopped and tried to keep her face from crumpling but failed .  she began to weep quietly and to reach desperately into her bag for a handkerchief .   henry said softly   would you care to rest awhile  mrs .  lindemann .    rubin said  just as softly   would you like a cup of tea  mrs .  lindemann  or some brandy .   then he glared about as though daring anyone to say a word .   mrs .  lindemann said   no  i m all right .  i apologize for behaving so  but i found i had forgotten .  i don t remember the young man s address  not at all  though i must have known it that night because i talked about it .  i don t remember his first name .  i stayed awake all night trying to remember  and that just made it worse .  i went out the next day to try to retrace my steps  but everything looked so different by day   and by night  i was afraid to try .    what must the young man think of me .  he s never heard from me .  i took his money and just vanished with it .  i am worse than those terrible young hoodlums who snatched my purse .  i had never been kind to them .  they owed me no gratitude .    gonzalo said   it s not your fault that you can t remember .  you had a rough time .     yes  but he doesn t know i can t remember .  he thinks i m an ungrateful thief .  finally  i told my nephew about my trouble and he was just thinking of employing mr .  gonzalo for something and he felt that mr .  gonzalo might have the kind of worldly wisdom that might help .  mr .  gonzalo said he would try  and in the end   here i am .  but now that i ve heard myself tell the story i realize how hopeless it all sounds .    trumbull sighed .   mrs .  lindemann  please don t be offended at what i am about to ask  but we must eliminate some factors .  are you sure it all really happened .    mrs .  lindemann looked surprised   well  of course it really happened .  my purse was gone .     no   said henry   what mr .  trumbull means i think is that after the mugging  you somehow got back to the hotel and then had a sleep that may have been filled with nightmares so that what you remember now is partly fact and partly dream   which would account for the imperfect memory .     no   said mrs .  lindemann firmly   i remember what i do remember perfectly .  it was not a dream .     in that case   said trumbull  shrugging   we have very little to go on .    rubin said   never mind  tom .  we re not giving up .  if we choose the right name for your rescuer  mrs .  lindemann  would you recognize it  even though you can t remember it now .     i hope so   said mrs .  lindemann   but i don t know .  i ve tried looking in a phone directory to see different first names  but none seemed familiar .  i don t think it could have been a very common name .    rubin said   then it couldn t have been sam .     oh  i m certain that s not it .     why sam  manny .   asked gonzalo .    well  the fellow was a good samaritan .  mrs .  lindemann called him that herself .  sam for samaritan .  his number and street may have represented the chapter and verse in the bible where the tale of the good samaritan begins .  you said his name and address fitted each other and that s the only clue we have .     wait   put in avalon eagerly   the first name might have been the much less common one of luke .  that s the gospel in which the parable is to be found .     i m afraid   said mrs .  lindemann   that doesn t sound right  either .  besides  i m not that well acquainted with the bible .  i couldn t identify the chapter and verse of the parable .    halsted said   let s not get off on impossible tangents .  mrs .  lindemann taught american history in school so it s very likely that what struck her applied to american history .  for instance  suppose the address were      madison avenue and the young man s name was james .  james madison was president during the war of      .     or      columbus avenue   said gonzalo   and the young man was named christopher .     or      lexington avenue and the name paul for paul revere   said trumbull .    or      amsterdam avenue and the name peter   said avalon   for peter minuit  or      hudson avenue and the name henry .  in fact  there are many named streets in lower manhattan .  we can never pick an appropriate one unless mrs .  lindemann remembers .    mrs .  lindemann clasped her hands tightly together .   oh  dear  oh  dear  nothing sounds familiar .    rubin said   of course not  if we re going to guess at random .  mrs .  lindemann  i assume you are at a midtown hotel .     i m at the new york hilton .  is that midtown .     yes .  sixth avenue and fifty   third street .  the chances are you could not have walked more than a mile  probably less  before you grew tired .  therefore  let s stick to midtown .  hudson avenue is much too far south and places like      columbus or      madison are much too far north .  it would have to be midtown  probably west side   and i can t think of anything .    drake said  through a haze of cigarette smoke   you re forgetting one item .  mrs .  lindemann said it wasn t just the name and address that fit but what the young man said back there  that is  at the site of the rescue .  what did he say back there .     it s all so hazy   said mrs .  lindemann .    you said he called out roughly at the muggers .  can you repeat what he said .    mrs .  lindemann colored .   i could repeat some of what he said  but i don t think i want to .  the young man apologized for it afterward .  he said that unless he used bad language the hoodlums would not have been impressed and would not have scattered .  besides  i know i couldn t have referred to that at all .    drake said thoughtfully .   that bites the dust then .  have you thought of advertising .  you know   will the young man who aided a woman in distress    and so on .     i ve thought of it   said mrs .  lindemann   but that would be so dreadful .  he might not see it and so many impostors might arrive to make a claim .  really  this is so dreadful .    avalon  looking distressed  turned to henry and said   well  henry  does anything occur to you .    henry said   i m not certain .    mrs .  lindemann  you said that by the time you took the taxi it was late by the clock but not by your insides .  does that mean you arrived from the west coast by plane so that your perception of time was three hours earlier than the clock .     yes  i did   said mrs .  lindemann .    perhaps from portland  or not too far from there .   asked henry .    why  yes  from just outside portland .  had i mentioned that .     no  you hadn t   interposed trumbull .   how did you know  henry .     because it occurred to me  sir   said henry   that the young man s name was eugene  which is the name of a town only about a hundred miles south of portland .    mrs .  lindemann rose  eyes staring .   my goodness .  the name was eugene .  but that s marvellous .  how could you possibly tell .    henry said   mr .  rubin pointed out the address had to be in midtown manhattan on the west side .  dr .  drake pointed out your reference to what the young man had said at the scene of the rescue and i recalled that one thing you reported him to have said besides the bad language you did not describe specifically was that you had better get to his place or there d be a battle .    mr .  halsted pointed out that the address ought to have some significance in american history and so i thought it might be    west fortieth street  since there is the well   known election slogan of          or fight   the election of       i believe .  it would be particularly meaningful to mrs .  lindemann if she were from the northwest since it pertained to our dispute with great britain over the oregon territory .  when she said she was indeed from near portland  oregon  i guessed that the rescuer s name might be eugene .    mrs .  lindemann sat down   to my dying day  i will never forget this .  that is the address .  how could i have forgotten it when you worked it out so neatly from what little i did remember .    and then she grew excited .  she said   but it s not too late .  i must go there at once .  i must pay him or shove an envelope under his door or something .    rubin said   will you recognize the house if you see it .     oh  yes   said mrs .  lindemann .   i m sure of that .  and it s apartment     f .  i remembered that .  if i knew his last name  i would call  but  no  i want to see him and explain .    rubin said mildly   you certainly can t go yourself  mrs .  lindemann .  not into that neighborhood at this time of night after what you ve been through .  some of us will have to go with you .  at the very least  i will .    mrs .  lindemann said   i very much dislike inconveniencing you  mr .  rubin .     under the circumstances  mrs .  lindemann   said rubin   i consider it my duty .    henry said   i believe we will all accompany you  mrs .  lindemann .  i know the black widowers .    afterword  i am rather stubborn about keeping my black widowers rigidly to the format .  i have sometimes thought about getting them out on a picnic in central park or having them attend a large convention en masse  or separating them and having each do a bit of detective work with henry pulling the strings together at last .   i may try that last bit if i ever do a black widowers novel  which somehow is not a thought that greatly attracts me .   none of these variations strike me as safe  however .  once i begin playing games with the formula  the whole thing might fall apart .   and yet even within the rigidity of the game  there are some rules that can be bent .  might we not have a woman guest despite the die   hard male chauvinism of the black widowers .  might a woman not be in trouble .  and if the black widowers themselves are stupid about it  surely henry wouldn t be .   so i deliberately set about writing  the good samaritan .   i didn t have to .  it might just as easily have been a kindly and unsophisticated elderly gentleman who had gotten into trouble with a mob of kids .    but i wanted a woman  if only to watch manny rubin throw a fit .   the story appeared in the september           issue of eqmm .   the year of the action   sir rupert murgatroyd   caroled geoffrey avalon   his leisure and his riches  he ruthlessly employed in persecuting witches      he was returning from the men s room and was clearly in a happy mood .  his dark eyes twinkled and his formidable eyebrows twitched in friendly fashion .   except that  caroled  is perhaps not the right word to use in connection with any attempt avalon ever made in the direction of song .  it was not that he was either flat or sharp  for on no occasion in the memory of any member of the black widowers had he ever struck a note close enough to the desired one to be either flat or sharp .   thomas trumbull turned on his heel as though he had been jabbed in some tender portion of his anatomy with a thumbtack .  he said   jeff  shut up .  five years ago  when you last did this  i told you that any repetition of this vile noise you make  will induce homicidal mania in everyone and that i fully intended to beat them all to the punch .     come on  tom   said mario gonzalo complacently   the man is just in a gilbert and sullivan mood .  let s put him to some interesting use .  if he doesn t do the words but just hums  we can all try to guess the tune .     except   said james drake  thoughtfully   that it would be a lost cause .  if jeff hummed  yankee doodle  and then  old man river   we couldn t tell them apart .    roger halsted said   i don t think the experiment should be tried without earplugs .    avalon would have drawn himself up  had not his natural stance placed him in a perpetual seventy   four   inch up   drawn position .  his voice  in its natural rich baritone   when he was speaking   was distinctly aggrieved in tone as he said   i had not intended to continue singing after i had emerged from the men s room  and i will cheerfully stop .  but might i remind you that as tonight s banquet host i am within my rights in declaring myself permitted to sing .     to do something   said trumbull  gratingly   that someone  somewhere  at some time  in a state not too close to drunken insensibility can call singing  yes .  that does not  however  include what you do .    henry  that best of waiters  who had listened blandly as he completed the table setting  raised his voice without  somehow  seeming to  and said   gentlemen  please seat yourselves .    they did  and emmanuel rubin  who had been talking to avalon s guest of the evening during the altercation  now drew the guest into the seat next to his .   henry held the seat for the guest and said   welcome to the black widowers  mr .  graff .    the guest looked up in surprise .   do you know me .    he was rather short  not much taller than rubin  round   faced  with a generous mustache like that of a baby walrus  and thick graying hair that covered most of his ears .   henry said   i attended a lecture of yours at new york university about a year ago and enjoyed it very much .    graff beamed .  he said to rubin   see  who needs intellectuals .  with waiters  i m big .    rubin said   don t dismiss henry that easily  graff .  we intellectuals bask in his reflected glory .    graff said   listen  do you guys talk like this all the time .  i never heard such fighting .  over every little thing  too .  with words .  with whole sentences .    and call me herb .    rubin said   you have to understand  herb  that each of us spends most of his time with ordinary people .  we can t pick on them  it wouldn t be fair .  once a month  we re here  and we can let loose .     but you sound as though you re getting mad .  look at jeff avalon .  in one minute  he ll take his knife and carve up everyone here .     not at all   said rubin .   i give him five minutes and he ll be pontificating .  listen     rubin waited five minutes and then  as the roast goose was placed before him  he said   of course  jeff  it is really unjust to say gilbert and sullivan .  it should be sullivan and gilbert .  in any of the numerous parodies of the operettas  gilbert s words are invariably changed but no one would dream of changing a note of sullivan s music .    jeff said   you are quite wrong  manny .  there were other light   opera composers in sullivan s time and after   offenbach  strauss  lehar  romberg  and so on .  many tunes of each one of these lives .  but only in the case of sullivan are any of the tunes ever sung by ordinary people .  no one knows the words   except in the case of sullivan  because only sullivan had the greatest lyricist in the english language working with him .    his ill temper seemed to have evaporated .   gilbert is the one lyricist who used the full strength of the english language and the full vocabulary .  he rhymes  executioner  with  ablutioner    diminutioner   and  you   shun   her .   he     rubin turned to graff and said in a low voice   see .    henry was making the rounds with the brandy bottle  and avalon bestirred himself .  rattling his spoon on the water glass  he said   gentlemen  we come now to the important portion of the evening .  manny  since you were the one person who  earlier in the evening  refrained from needless pseudo   wit at my expense  and showed an odd and unaccustomed gentlemanliness of behavior       odd and unaccustomed .   said rubin indignantly  his sparse beard quivering .   if you re intending that as a compliment  it s a hell of an ungracious way of doing it .     odd and unaccustomed is what i said   said avalon  loftily .   and i am asking you to be in charge of the grilling .     what grilling .   said graff  looking startled .    the question   and   answer period  herb   said avalon  in what was for him a low voice .   i told you .    graff  recollecting  nodded his head .   rubin intoned   may i ask you  herb  just how you justify your existence .    graff sat back in his seat and stared in astonishment at rubin for a moment  before answering .   justify my existence .   he said  with a strong upward inflection .   listen  you step out into the street and take a look at the cockamamie people passing by .  you ever get into an elevator and listen to them talking .  three things you hear .  three .   what did you watch on television last night .     where are you going to go on vacation .     you think the mets will win today .     that is  if they can talk at all .  i should justify my existence .  let them all justify their existence  and i ll justify mine .  not before .    rubin nodded his head .   there s something in what you say .    trumbull interrupted .   you know  jeff s right about you  manny .  are you sure you re emmanuel rubin  or are you a lookalike sent here to drive us mad with unaccustomed sweetness .    rubin said   i received word of a very nice paperback sale yesterday  so i m in a good mood  but don t presume upon it .  for instance  i ll just say politely once not to return to that subject .  now  herb  putting the question of your existence s justification out of court  what is it you do .    graff said   i m a movie maven .     a what .   muttered gonzalo .    maven   said rubin   is from the yiddish  for  expert .      you mean you make movies .   said gonzalo .    not actually   said graff .   i talk about them .  i have  or i can get  almost any old movie that s been made and i show them  or i show clips  and i lecture on them .  people like it .  i give lecture tours  especially on college campuses  and i make a living .  henry  tell these guys about my lectures .    henry s unlined  sixtyish face creased briefly into a gentle smile .   it was indeed an entertaining evening .  i believe the audience  generally  enjoyed themselves .    graff said   there you are  an unpaid testimonial .  but just the same  i might actually be making a movie  or helping make one  if i can only figure out how to handle the crazies .     what kind of movie .   asked rubin .    gilbert and sullivan  actually   said graff  with what seemed a trace of embarrassment .   i ve been talking to jeff avalon about it on the way here and that s what put him into   you should excuse the expression   a singing mood .     is there money in gilbert and sullivan in the movies .   asked drake skeptically .   i should think it just has a small cult following .    graff said   bigger than you think  but you re right .  you can t make a colossal extravaganza out of it .  but then you don t have to spend ten million dollars on it .  you can do it small   scale .  it s been done .  kenny baker sang nanki   poo in a movie version of the mikado and was cut to ribbons by all the d oyly carte types that supported him .  the trouble is  you can t do much with gilbert and sullivan except photograph the stage play .  you can t change the music or the words or the plot because as soon as you change anything it s not gilbert and sullivan and you re nowhere .  so if you re just going to photograph the play  you re not taking advantage of the power of the camera and where are you .     where indeed .   said drake .   graff said   but these guys   i didn t tell you about these guys yet  did i .  two kids in their early twenties  but young as they are  they ve really got it .  you know  in any field of art  it s the young people who look at things with new eyes .  these guys are a pair of crazies  of course  but you ve got to expect that .  their names are sam appelbaum and tim mentz and they re pupils of mine .  i give a course on movie making at the new school and that s how i met them .  they want to do the pirates of penzance  one of the gilbert and sullivan operettas  because they d seen a performance by the village light opera group and were enthusiastic .    they joined the gilbert and sullivan society  which seems to be a very active group here in new york  and they met jeff avalon  who s a gilbert and sullivan aficionado .    is that the way you pronounce the word .     quite   said avalon .   though my singing voice may not be approved by all  i presume that not even the most captious will try to prevent me from listening to music and i know virtually all of gilbert and sullivan by heart .    trumbull growled   you may know gilbert s words by heart  but if you know a single note of sullivan s music   or anyone s   may i be struck by lightning right now .     in any case   said graff   i met jeff through appelbaum and mentz  and a couple of months ago we were talking about what strategy to use in making a movie of pirates  and how limited we were in handling it  and avalon suggested an animated cartoon .  appelbaum and mentz fell over themselves to grab the idea .  you have the voices  the words  the notes  and you have a free hand to be as fantastic as you want .  gilbert and sullivan operettas are always overacted  anyway  on principle .  i m certain that if gilbert and sullivan had worked in the     s instead of the     s  they would have written the operettas for animation in the first place .    james drake stubbed out his cigarette with a violent motion and said   i think that s disgusting .  you ll have a whole bunch of cutesie choruses dancing around prince charming frederic and snow white mabel .     no .   said graff  earnestly .   what do you think .  disney is all there is .  besides  who can spend the money on the kind of animation that disney used in the days of slave labor where you make a thousand different drawings to show dopey picking his nose realistically .  we re counting on surrealism .  in fact  these guys are going to use the techniques of modern an to evoke humor and fantasy in a whole new way .  i can t explain how it will work .  after all  am i an artist .  but when they re through  it will work and you ll see how it works .  it will start a whole new fashion and  on top of that  it will make them trillionaires and it would make me a few shiny pennies  too .  if they do it  that is .     why if .   said halsted .    because they had a fight  that s why .  and they re still fighting   said graff .   and go try and settle it .  they ve got all the money in the world waiting to be scooped in and neither one will move unless the other gives in .     what are they fighting about .   asked rubin .   are they both in love with the same soprano .    graff shook his head .   you don t know the crazies of this world  do you .  crazies don t fight over a woman or over anything sensible .  that s for plain people like you and me .  crazies fight over things you can t imagine   like when did the action of the play take place .  appelbaum says the action begins on march          and mentz says march          and neither one will give in .    you see  you guys in the black widowers argue  but you forget  because you ve got a million things to argue about  so you drop each particular argument in favor of another .  i ve been listening to you do it all through dinner .  my two guys are big talents but they re limited .  they ve only got one thing to fight over so there s no chance of their forgetting .  with them it s                         till you can get sick and die .     i take it   said halsted   that gilbert gives no indication which it is .     no   said graff .   trumbull said  with clear contempt   does it make a difference .    graff said   actually  it does .  the guys want to keep up a running set of montages dating back to victorian times to keep pace with the words and music .  these would be accompaniments and references to whatever was happening  sometimes so fast you couldn t really make out the details  but you would get it  uh  subliminally .    is that how you say it .    it would be a kind of running visual gag  and it could start a cult .  you know  people would say  did you see that picture of disraeli  and who was the other guy with him and what was he doing  and they d go several times just to try to pick up all the clues they could .  well  there are places where what you show would depend on whether it was      or      .    trumbull said   then let them pick one of the two years and get going .  who would care .    graff said   they would care .  neither one will give in .  it s life and death with them .  look  do you know the play .     i don t   said trumbull  flatly .   drake said   i suppose jeff knows it by heart  but i just know the major   general s patter song  which is an example of what jeff was talking about with its fancy vocabulary and ingenious rhymes .   rather surprisingly  he lifted his soft  hoarse voice in song  and with a fair approximation of the notes  went     then i can hum a fugue of which i ve heard the music s din afore  and whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense  pinafore .     which shows   he added   that gilbert could make a little fun of himself  too  since pinafore was his big early success .    graff said  hastily   well  let me just outline the plot quickly  so you can see where the trouble is .  is that all right .     go ahead  herb   said avalon  indulgently .   i m host and what i say goes   or should go   and he bent his formidable frown at trumbull  who shrugged and muttered something under his breath .   graff said   frederic is a pirate   apprentice .  it was all a mistake because his nursery   maid  ruth  had been told to apprentice him to a pilot  but had misheard the word .  unable to return home and explain the mistake  she  too  joined the pirate band .    as the play opens  frederic has just turned twenty   one and entered his twenty   second year so his apprenticeship is over .  as the slave of duty he has remained with the pirates  but now that he has served his term  he will abandon them and  because he is also the soul of honor  he will devote himself to their extermination .    ruth  a maiden of forty   seven  wants to go with him for she loves frederic .  but then they encounter the daughters of major   general stanley  and frederic  realizing that ruth is old and plain  falls in love instead with mabel  the prettiest of the daughters .    the pirates surprise them and make ready to marry all the daughters   anything but marriage being inconceivable to good old gilbert   when their father arrives and sings the major   general s song that jim drake mentioned .  the major   general persuades the pirates to give up their scheme for marrying his daughters by claiming  falsely  to be an orphan boy .  the tenderhearted pirates burst into tears and the first act ends happily .    in the second act  frederic prepares to lead the police against the pirates .  before he can leave with his band  however  the pirate king  together with ruth  come upon him alone and tell him they have just remembered that he was born on leap day  february    .  the apprenticeship papers say he must serve till his twenty   first birthday and  strictly speaking  he has had only five .    frederic  the slave of duty  at once rejoins the band and  as a loyal pirate  now tells them of the major   general s lie .  the furious pirates attack the major   general s estate and  in a battle with the police  emerge the winners .    however  the police produce a union jack and demand the pirates yield in queen victoria s name .  the pirates promptly do so  saying   with all our faults  we love our queen .   as the pirates are about to be led away to jail  ruth quickly explains that all the pirates are just noblemen gone wrong .  the major   general at once frees them saying   with all our faults  we love our house of peers   and everything ends happily .    graff beamed around the table and said   it s actually a very funny and happy play .  there s just one line that creates the problem .  when frederic finds out his apprenticeship goes by birthdays and not by years  he explains to mabel   in      i of age shall be .   that means that on february           he ll celebrate his twenty   first birthday .    drake nodded .  he had lit a new cigarette and he blinked his eyes slowly .   on february           the new york times ran an editorial on frederic s being out of his indentures .  i remember reading it .    graff said   all right  but if there s a leap day every four years      roger halsted interrupted .   but there isn t      graff shook his head violently .   just wait a minute .  if there s a leap day every four years  then frederic was eighty   four years old on his twenty   first birthday  and he was born in      .  he was twenty   one years old in       a year after his fifth birthday .  he would have had to celebrate his coming of age on march          since there is no february    in that year and  appelbaum says  that is therefore the day on which the action of the play opens .     but     said halsted .    but   said graff  raising his voice   apparently the year      should have been a leap year but wasn t .  there was no february          .  that s what you re trying to say  isn t it  roger .  i don t know why that should be .  some pope arranged it .    halsted said   pope gregory xiii in       that part doesn t matter   said graff  impatiently .   the point is that one leap day is missing  so to get twenty   one of them  you have to move four years further back .  frederic would have to have been born in      and become twenty   one in       so that the action of the play opens on march         .  that s what mentz says .    the pirates of penzance opened in early      so      is the logical year  says appelbaum  and gilbert either forgot or didn t know that      was not a leap year .  mentz says it is inconceivable that gilbert would make a mistake about      and that no true aficionado   yes  you told me i said it right   would think so for a minute  so the year was      .  there they stand .  neither one will give in .    there was a silence around the table .  finally  gonzalo said   you really think there s a lot of money in the picture if they make it .    graff said   who can tell about public taste   but there s a good chance .     then can t you make up some argument that would convince them one year or the other was right .  you know  something that sounds good .     like what .   said graff .    the trouble is   said avalon  sententiously   that the world of gilbert and sullivan is not a real one and it doesn t lend itself to logical arguments .  for instance  though it is clearly stated that frederic has just turned twenty   one and that his birthday is on february     nevertheless the major   general s daughters  when they first arrive on the scene  decide to take off their shoes and socks and paddle their feet in the sea .  the scene is set in cornwall  where the town of penzance is located  and you can imagine what it would be like paddling in the english channel in winter .     well   said graff   the daughters call themselves  hardy little lasses  in their first chorus .    gonzalo said   did the major   general have any sons .     no   said graff   just daughters .  in a full performance  there could be as many as twenty   four daughters  all pretty much the same age and no sign of any mother  either .  it is unreal  so how are we going to find some way of deciding between      and      that will hold water .    trumbull said   you have to think of something that sounds good .  it doesn t have to be good  or sensible .  look  wasn t queen victoria empress of india  too .    henry would you be so kind as to go over to the reference shelf and look up queen victoria in the encyclopedia .  maybe it will say when she became empress .    after some moments  henry said   the title was secured for her by benjamin disraeli in       sir  and she was proclaimed empress of india on january         .     ah  perfect .  the whole thing is solved and we can forget about this nonsense .    graff looked doubtful .   how is it solved .     easy .  victoria loved the new title .  anyone wanting to please her would go around calling her  queen   empress .   you quoted the pirates as saying that  with all their faults  they love their queen .  well  if the action opens on march          only two months after victoria gained the imperial title  surely they would refer to her  with pride  as queen   empress .  the fact that they didn t proves it was      .    graff looked still more doubtful     queen   empress  wouldn t rhyme or scan .     don t be an idiot   said trumbull .   i told you the argument doesn t have to make sense .  it just has to sound good .  it s just a piece of gobbledygook designed to settle the matter .     i don t think that would win over appelbaum   said graff .    well  then   said avalon   let s think up more arguments like that  but let s keep them all on one particular year  because if we think up ways of arguing for both years  that won t settle matters .  what else is there we can use for      .  it doesn t have to be sensible .     anything else about kings and queens .   asked gonzalo .   does the pirate king represent anyone .     i don t know that he does   said avalon  shaking his head slowly   but there is some mention of kings in the pirate king s opening solo .  he admits he sinks more ships than a well   bred monarch ought to do  but then he says   many a king on a first   class throne  if he wants to call his crown his own  must manage somehow to get through more dirty work than ever i do .   now can he be referring to some particular king .    rubin stared up through narrowed eyes .   let s see   who were the first   class thrones in the     s .  there was william i of germany .  the german empire had just been established and there was a lot of chicanery there .    drake said   that was the chicanery of otto von bismarck  manny .  william i was just an old man who did what he was told .    rubin said   you re right there  jim .    francis joseph of austria was a dim son of monarch and alexander ii of russia was not bad for a tsar .  those were the only ones whom gilbert would have considered as sitting on a first   class throne .    halsted said   how about napoleon iii of france .  wasn t he ruling about that time .     no   said rubin .   he got kicked out in the franco   prussian war in       and france was a republic in the     s and  in fact  ever since .  too bad  too  because napoleon iii was as crooked as a bolt of lightning .  he was a conniver and an intriguer who made it to the imperial throne by lying and cheating and he could at no time be trusted to keep his word unless you kept a gun trained at him .    gonzalo said   when did he die .    rubin said   i m not sure .  not long afterward  i think .  henry  would you check that little matter .    henry did so .   he died on january         .    gonzalo was enthusiastic .   that s perfect .  gilbert wouldn t make snide remarks against a sitting monarch  because that would create an international incident  but      rubin said   listen  gilbert would not hesitate to       no  no  we re just building an argument   said gonzalo   so let s say he wouldn t .  but a king who was dead would be fair game .  if it were       the pirate king might not think of napoleon iii  but if it were       napoleon iii would have died only two months before  there would have been obituaries and biographies  and he would be fresh in the minds of the pirates .  naturally  they would refer to the  dirty work  he did .  so that s two arguments for      .    avalon said   that won t work  mario .  napoleon iii wasn t a king .  he was an emperor .  france  germany  austria   hungary  and russia were all empires in victoria s time .  so was japan  for that matter .  that was one reason why victoria was so pleased with the imperial title .  without it  every other important monarch outranked her .     so .   said gonzalo .    so   said avalon   tom s argument is that it had to be      because victoria was called a queen and not a queen   empress .  but if you re going to be so picky about titles you can t have the pirate king talk about kings when he is referring to napoleon iii  who was an emperor .     on this point  jeff   said rubin   i side with mario .  gilbert  as a loyal britisher  would certainly not abate one jot of the title of victoria .  however  he isn t going to worry about some french monarch .  in gilbert s time  france was still the traditional enemy of great britain through a series of wars stretching back to henry ii seven centuries before .    graff nodded .   there s something to that .  in ruddigore  there s a song by the sailor  richard dauntless  which makes mild fun of the french and calls them  froggies     parley   voos   and  darned mounseers .      exactly   said rubin .   gilbert wouldn t worry about the precise title of a darned mounseer  so that s two arguments in favor of      .   graff said   yes  but they re    he wiggled his hand in a rapid roll .    all right  then   said avalon .   anything else .    silence .   finally  halsted muttered   i wish i knew the play better .  listen  herb  did you say the pirates were members of the house of peers .     they have to be   said graff .   when the major   general hears that the pirates are noblemen gone wrong  he says   no englishman unmoved that statement hears  because  with all our faults  we love our house of peers .   then he goes on to say to the pirates   peers will be peers  and youth will have its fling .  resume your ranks arid legislative duties    so i suppose they re part of parliament .     ah   said halsted   then that settles it .  in the     s  great britain was the dominant economic power on earth .  in particular  there were heavy british investments in the united states .  if a bunch of notorious pirates were suddenly to flood into parliament  that would make americans feel pretty shaky about the status of the british investments .  you can t trust pirates .  they might withdraw those investments .  that would unsettle the american economy and       you would have the panic of        said rubin  triumphantly .    exactly   said halsted .   rubin said   that really does it .  there was a panic of      .  it was the worst economic downturn the united states had up to the great depression of the     s .    avalon said   there you are  herb .  three arguments in favor of      .  each one by itself is weak  perhaps  but surely all three combined have force .  one  victoria would have been referred to as queen in       but not in      when she was empress as well .  two  napoleon iii would have been referred to as an example of a royal conniver in       soon after he died  but not in      by which time he might have been out of mind .  three  the return of the pirates to parliament could and did set off an american depression in       while there was none in      .    graff nodded gloomily .   yes  that s very nice and i hope it works .  maybe it will work .  anyway  i want to thank you all very much .  if i can get appelbaum to see the force of these arguments     he paused  then said wistfully   there wouldn t be anything else you could feed me  would there .  something  i mean  that doesn t have all that subtle logic .  something simple .    his eyes went from one to the other and met only blankness .   then gonzalo said   if you want something simple  we ought to ask henry .  he hasn t said anything yet .    graff looked up at henry curiously .   don t tell me you go for gilbert and sullivan  too  henry .     not quite  sir   said henry .   i have heard selections from the operettas on occasion  but i have never attended a performance of any of them .     oh  well   said graff .    nevertheless    said henry  and stopped .   avalon said   go on .  henry .  if you ve got argument number four backing       so much the better .     that is the point  mr .  avalon  i haven t .  i admire the ingenuity of the arguments you have all presented and i am rather embarrassed to have to say anything against them .     you mean we re all wrong  henry .   said rubin .    i m afraid so  mr .  rubin .  the dull fact is that      is quite impossible as the time of the action  as one can very simply demonstrate on the basis of what has already been said .    graff said   impossible .  you mean all those logical arguments aren t any good .     completely useless .     why .    henry said   dr .  drake sang a couple of lines from the major   general s song earlier in the evening .  the major   general  if i heard him correctly  boasted that he knew all the airs from that infernal nonsense  pinafore .     damn .   said rubin .   of course .     yes  sir .  as dr .  drake said .  pinafore was an early play of gilbert and sullivan s  earlier than the pirates of penzance .  while i was checking the various points in the encyclopedia  as requested  i found  for myself  that pinafore was produced in      .  we might imagine that the major   general  in view of his high rank  might somehow have gotten an advance look at the music when it was being written in      and could have whistled the airs .  no amount of twisting or logic chopping could explain his being able to whistle the airs in      .    grafts round face had widened in a smile .   of course .  no argument any more  no logic  no fancy reasoning .  the major   general mentions pinafore and that s it .  the time of action has to be      and gilbert forgot  or maybe he didn t know  that      was not a leap year .  mentz will have to give in  and we can go ahead .  thank you  henry   but how is it i didn t see that .     or i .   said drake .   after all  i sang the verses .    henry said   i appear to be gifted with a simple mind  gentlemen   if you wish the simple explanation .    afterword  i have a number of wild enthusiasms  and one of them is gilbert and sullivan .  i am a member of the gilbert and sullivan society and occasionally i like to drag some g   s reference into a story .  finally  i managed to think of a plot in which a g   s angle is central and then you can bet that nothing could stop me from writing the story at once .  fred dannay changed the title to  the gilbert and sullivan mystery  but that struck me as too prosaic  so i kept my own title for this collection .   incidentally  the character herb graff in the story is  in a way  a real person .  he is a dear friend of mine in the dutch treat club  another organization i belong to .  he asked me to put him into a story  using his real name  description  and hobby .  i was doubtful and asked him to give me a piece of paper with his signature on it  giving me permission to do so .  he gladly did so .   i thereupon wrote him into  the year of the action  and gave him a copy of the january          issue of eqmm  in which the story appeared .  that was at a dutch treat luncheon  something we have every tuesday .   the following tuesday i said   how did you like the story .    for i thought he would be pleased at how well i had captured his essence  and he s really one of the nicest guys in the world   funny  intelligent  and with a heart of gold  .   however  i had used a word he had disapproved of and that spoiled everything .  he drew himself up  fixed me with a piercing eye  and said   plump .  .  .    no word is worth hurting the feelings of a friend  so you won t find it in the version in the book .  i have removed it .   can you prove it .   henry  the smoothly functioning waiter at the monthly black widowers banquet  filled the water glass of the evening s guest as though knowing in advance that that guest was reaching into his shirt pocket for a small vial of pills .   the guest looked up .   thank you  waiter   though the pills are small enough to go down au jus  so to speak .    he looked about the table and sighed .   advancing age .  in our modern times we are not allowed to grow old ad lib .  doctors follow the faltering mechanism in detail and insist on applying the grease .  my blood pressure is a touch high and i have an occasional extra systole  so i take a pretty little orange pill four times a day .    geoffrey avalon  who sat immediately across the table  smiled with the self   conscious superiority of a man moderately stricken in years who kept himself in good shape with a vigorous system of calisthenics  and said   how old are you  mr .  smith .     fifty   seven .  with proper care  my doctor assures me i will live out a normal lifetime .    emmanuel rubin s eyes flashed in magnified form behind his thick spectacles as he said   i doubt there s an american who reaches middle age these days who doesn t become accustomed to a regimen of pills of one kind or another .  i take zinc and vitamin e and a few other things .    james drake nodded and said in his soft voice as he peered through his cigarette smoke   i have a special weekly pillbox arrangement to keep the day s dosages correct .  that way you can check on whether you ve taken the second pill of a particular kind .  if it s in the friday compartment still   assuming the day is friday   you haven t taken it .    smith said   i take only this one kind of pill  which simplifies things .  i bought a week s supply three years ago   twenty   eight of them   on my doctor s prescription .  i was frankly skeptical  but they helped me tremendously and i persuaded my doctor to prescribe them for me in bottles of a thousand .  every sunday morning  i put twenty   eight into my original vial  which i carry with me everywhere and at all times and which i still use .  i know at all times how much i should have   right now  i should have four left  having just taken the twenty   fourth of the week  and i do .  in three years  i ve missed a pill only twice .     i   said rubin  loftily   have not yet reached that pitch of senility that requires any mnemonic devices at all .     no .   asked mario gonzalo  spearing his last bit of baba au rhum .   what pitch of senility have you reached .    roger halsted  who was hosting the banquet that night  forestalled rubin s rejoinder by saying  hastily   there s an interesting point to be made here .  as increasing numbers of people pump themselves full of chemicals  there must be fewer and fewer people with untampered tissue chemistry .     none at all   growled thomas trumbull .   the food we eat is loaded with additives .  the water we drink has purifying chemicals .  the air we breathe is half pollution of one sort or another .  if you could analyze an individual s blood carefully enough  you could probably tell where he lived  what he eats  what medicines he takes .    smith nodded .  his short hair exposed prominent ears  something gonzalo had taken full advantage of in preparing his caricature of the evening s guest .  now smith rubbed one of them thoughtfully  and said   maybe you could file everyone s detailed blood pattern in some computer bank .  then if all else fails  your blood would be your identification .  the pattern would be entered into the computer which would compare it with all those in its memory files and  within a minute  words would flash across a screen saying  the man you have here is john smith of fairfield  connecticut   and i would stand up and bow .    trumbull said   if you could stand up and bow  you could stand up and identify yourself .  why bother with a blood pattern .     oh  yes .   said smith  grimly .   halsted said   listen  let s not get involved in this .  henry is distributing the brandy and it s past time for the grilling .  jeff  will you assume the task .     i will be glad to   said avalon in his most solemn tone .   bending his fierce and graying eyebrows over his eyes  avalon said  with incongruous mildness   and just how do you justify your existence  mr .  smith .     well   said smith  cheerfully   i inherited a going business .  i did well with it  sold it profitably  invested wisely  and now live in early retirement in a posh place in fairfield   a widower with two grown children  each on his own .  i toil not  neither do i spin and  like the lilies of the field  my justification is my beauty and the way it illuminates the landscape .   a grin of self   mockery crossed his pleasantly ugly face .   avalon said  indulgently   i suppose we can pass that .  beauty is in the eye of the beholder .  your name is john smith .     and i can prove it   said smith quickly .   name your poison .  i have my card  a driver s license  a variety of credit cards  some personal letters addressed to me  a library card  and so on .     i am perfectly willing to accept your word  sir  but it occurs to me that with a name like john smith you must frequently encounter some signs of cynical disbelief   from hotel clerks  for instance .  do you have a middle initial .     no  sir  i am the real thing .  my parents felt that any modification of the grand cliche would spoil the grandeur .  i won t deny that there haven t been times when i ve longed to say my name was eustace bartholomew wasservogel  but the feeling passes .  of the smiths i am  and of that tribe   variety  john   i remain .    avalon cleared his throat portentously and said   and yet  mr .  smith  i feel you have reason to feel annoyance at your name .  you reacted to tom s suggestion that you could merely announce your name and make the blood identification unnecessary with a clear tone of annoyance .  have you had some special occasion of late when you failed to identify yourself .    trumbull said   let me guess that you did .  your eagerness to demonstrate your ability to prove your identity would show that some past failure to do so rankles .    smith stared around the table in astonishment   good god  does it show that much .    halsted said   no  john  it doesn t  but this group has developed a sixth sense about mysteries .  i told you when you accepted my invitation that if you were hiding a skeleton in your closet  they d have it out of you .     and i told you  roger   said smith   that i had no mystery about me .     and the matter of inability to prove identity .   said rubin .    was a nightmare rather than a mystery   said smith   and it is something i ve been asked not to talk about .    avalon said   anything mentioned within the four walls of a black widowers banquet represents privileged communication .  feel free .     i can t .   smith paused  then said   look  i don t know what it s all about .  i think i was mistaken for someone once when i was visiting europe and after i got out of the nightmare  i was visited by someone from the   by someone  and asked not to talk about it .  though come to think of it  there is a mystery of a sort .     ah   said avalon   and what might that be .     i don t really know how i got out of the nightmare   said smith .   gonzalo  looking pleased and animated  said   tell us what happened and i ll bet we tell you how you got out of it .     i can t very well    began smith .   trumbull s frowning face  having attempted to wither gonzalo  turned to smith .   i understand such things  mr .  smith   he said .   suppose you omit the name of the country involved and the exact dates and any other such identifiable paraphernalia .  just tell it as a story out of the arabian nights   if the nightmare will stand up without the dangerous detail .    smith said   i think it will  but seriously  gentlemen  if the matter does involve national security   and i can imagine ways in which it might   how can i be sure you are all to be trusted .    halsted said   if you trust me  john  i ll vouch for the rest of the black widowers   including  of course  henry  our esteemed waiter .    henry  standing at the sideboard  smiled gently .   smith was visibly tempted .   i don t say i wouldn t like to get this off my chest       if you choose not to   said halsted   i m afraid the banquet ends .  the terms of the invitation were that you were to answer all questions truthfully .    smith laughed .   you also said i would not be asked anything designed to humiliate me or to put me in a disgraceful light   but have it your way .     i was visiting europe last year   said smith   and i ll put the location and date no closer than that .  i was a recent widower  a little lost without my wife  and rather determined to pick up the threads of life once again .  i had not been much of a traveller before my retirement and i was anxious to make up for that .    i travelled alone and i was a tourist .  nothing more than that .  i want to stress that in all truthfulness .  i was not serving any organ of the government   and that s true of any government  not just my own   either officially or unofficially .  nor was i there to gather information for any private organization .  i was a tourist and nothing more and so steeped in innocence that i suppose it was too much to expect that i not get into trouble .    i could not speak the language of the country but that didn t bother me .  i can t speak any language but english and i have the usual provincial american attitude that that s enough .  there would always be someone  anywhere i might be  who would speak and understand english .    and as a matter of fact  that always proved to be correct .    the hotel i stayed at was reasonably comfortable in appearance  though there was so foreign an aura about it that i knew i would not feel at home   but then i didn t expect to feel at home .  i couldn t even pronounce its name  though that didn t bother me .    i only stayed long enough to deposit my luggage and then it was ho  for the great foreign spaces where i could get to know the people .    the man at the desk   the concierge  or whatever he might be called   spoke an odd version of english that  with a little thought  could be understood .  i got a list of tourist attractions from him  some recommended restaurants  a stylized map of the city  not in english  so i doubted it would do me much good   and some general assertions as to how safe the city was and how friendly the inhabitants .    i imagine europeans are always eager to impress that on americans  who are known to live dangerously .  in the nineteenth century they thought every american city lay under imminent threat of indian massacre  in the first half of the twentieth century  every one was full of chicago gangsters  and now they are all full of indiscriminate muggers .  so i wandered off into the city cheerfully .     alone .  without knowing the language .   said avalon  with manifest disapproval .   what time was it .     the shades of evening were being drawn downward by a cosmic hand and you re right in the implication  mr .  avalon .  cities are never as safe as their boosters claim  and i found that out .  but i started off cheerfully enough .  the world was full of poetry and i was enjoying myself .    there were signs of all kinds on buildings and in store windows that were beginning to be lit up in defense against the night .  since i could read none of them  i was spared their deadly prosiness .    the people were friendly .  i would smile and they would smile in return .  many said something   i presume in greeting   and i would smile again and nod and wave .  it was a beautiful  mild evening and i was absolutely euphoric .    i don t know how long i was walking or how far i had gone before i was quite convinced that i was lost  but even that didn t bother me .  i stepped into a tavern to ask my way to the restaurant where i had determined to go and whose name i had painstakingly memorized .  i called out the name of the restaurant  and pointed vaguely in various directions and shrugged my shoulders and tried to indicate that i had lost my way .  several gathered around and one of them asked in adequate english if i was an american .  i said i was and he translated that jubilantly to the others  who seemed delighted .    he said   we don t see many americans here .   they then fell to studying my clothes and the cut of my hair and asking where i was from and trying to pronounce  fairfield  and offering to stand me drinks .  i sang the star   spangled banner  because they seemed to expect it and it was a real love feast .  i did have a drink on an empty stomach and after that things got even love   feastier .    they told me the restaurant i asked for was very expensive  and not very good  and that i should eat right there and they would order for me and it would be on the house .  it was hands across the sea and building bridges  you know  and i doubt if i had ever been happier since before regina had died .  i had another drink or two .    and then after that my memory stops until i found myself out in the street again .  it was quite dark  much cooler .  there were almost no people about  i had no idea where i was  and every idea that i had a splitting headache .    i sat down in a doorway and knew  even before i felt for it  that my wallet was gone .  so was my wristwatch  my pens   in fact  my trousers pockets were empty and so were my jacket pockets .  i had been mickey finned and rolled by my dear friends across the sea and they had probably taken me by car to a distant part of the city and dumped me .    the money taken was not terribly vital .  my main supply was safely back in the hotel .  still i had no money at the moment  i didn t know where i was  i didn t remember the name of the hotel  i felt woozy  sick  and in pain   and i needed help .    i looked for a policeman or for anyone in anything that looked like a uniform .  if i had found a street cleaner  or a bus conductor  he could direct me or  better  take me to a police station .    i found a policeman .  actually  it wasn t difficult .  they are  i imagine  numerous and deliberately visible in that particular city .  and i was then taken to a police station   in the equivalent of a paddy wagon  i think .  my memory has its hazy spots .    when i begin to remember a bit more clearly  i was sitting on a bench in what i guessed to be the police station .  no one was paying much attention to me and my headache was a little better .    a rather short man with a large mustache entered  engaged in conversation with a man behind a massive desk  then approached me .  he seemed rather indifferent  but to my relief he spoke english and quite well  too  though he had a disconcertingly british accent .    i followed him into a rather dingy room  gray and depressing  and there the questioning began .  it was the questioning that was the nightmare  though the questioner remained unfailingly  if distantly  polite .  he told me his name but i don t remember it .  i honestly don t .  it began with a v  so i ll just call him  vee  if i have to .    he said   you say your name is john smith .      yes .     he didn t exactly smile .  he said   it is a very common name in the united states and  i understand  is frequently assumed by those who wish to avoid investigation .      it is frequently assumed because it is common   i said   and since it is common  why shouldn t i be one of the hundreds of thousands who bear it .      you have identification .      i ve been robbed .  i ve come in to complain       vee raised his hand and made hushing noises through his mustache .   your complaint has been recorded  but i have nothing to do with the people here .  they merely made sure you were not wounded and then sent for me .  they have not searched you or questioned you .  it is not their job .  now   do you have identification .     wearily  and quietly  i told him what had happened .     then   he said   you have nothing with which to support your statement that you are john smith of fairfield  connecticut .      who else should i be .      that we would like to find out .  you say you were mistreated in a tavern .  its location  please .      i don t know .      its name .      i don t know .      what were you doing there .      i told you .  i was merely walking through the city        alone .      yes  alone .  i told you .      your starting point .      my hotel .      and you have identification there .      certainly .  my passport is there and all my belongings .      the name of the hotel .     i winced at that .  even to myself my answer would seem too much to accept .   i can t recall   i said in a low voice .     its location .      i don t know .     vee sighed .  he looked at me in a nearsighted way and i thought his eyes seemed sad  but perhaps it was only myopia .    he said   the basic question is  what is your name .  we must have some identification or this becomes a serious matter .  let me explain your position to you  mr .  blank .  nothing compels me to do so  but i am not in love with every aspect of my work and i shall sleep better if i make sure you understand that you are in great danger .     my heart began to race .  i am not young .  i am not a hero .  i am not brave .  i said   but why .  i am a wronged person .  i have been drugged and robbed .  i came voluntarily to the police  sick and lost  looking for help       again  vee held up his hand   quietly .  quietly .  some speak a little english here and it is better we keep this between ourselves for now .  things may be as you have described  or they may not .  you are an american national .  my government has cause to fear americans .  that  at least  is our official position .  we are expecting an american agent of great ability to penetrate our borders on a most dangerous mission .     that means that any strange american   any american encountered under suspicious circumstances   has  for a week now  been referred instantly to my department .  your circumstances were suspicious to begin with and have grown far more suspicious now that i have questioned you .     i stared at him in horror .   do you think i m a spy .  if i were  would i come to the police like this .      you may not be the spy  but you may still be a spy .  there are people who will think so at once .  even i view it as a possibility .      but no kind of spy would come to the police        please .  it will do you good to listen .  you may be a distraction .  if you play chess  you will know what i mean when i say you may be a sacrifice .  you are sent in to confuse and distract us  occupying our time and efforts  while the real work is done elsewhere .     i said   but it hasn t worked  if that s what i m supposed to be .  you re not confused and distracted .  no one could be fooled by anything as silly as this .  it s not a reasonable sacrifice and so it s no sacrifice at all .  it s nothing but the truth i ve been telling you .     vee sighed .   then what s your name .      john smith .  ask me a million times and it will stay my name .      but you can t prove it .    see here   he said   you have two alternatives .  one is to convince me in some reasonable way that you are telling the truth .  mere statements  however eloquent  are insufficient .  there must be evidence .  have you nothing with your name on it .  nothing material you can show me .      i told you   i said  despairingly .   i ve been robbed .      failing that   he said  as though he hadn t heard my remark   it will be assumed you are here to fulfill some function for your country that will not be to the interest of my country  and you will be interrogated with that in mind .  it will not be my job  i am glad to say  but those who interrogate will be most thorough and most patient .  i wish it were not so  but where national security is at stake       i was in utter panic .  i said  stuttering   but i can t tell what i don t know  no matter how you interrogate .      if so  they will finally be convinced  but you will not be well off by then .  and you will be imprisoned  for it will not then be politic to let you go free in your condition .  if your country succeeds in what it may be attempting  there will be anger in this country and you will surely be the victim of that and will receive a long sentence .  your country will not be able to intercede for you .  it will not even try .     i screamed .   that is unjust .  that is unjust .      life is unjust   said vee  sadly .   your own president kennedy said that .      but what am i to do .   i babbled .    he said   convince me your story is true .  show me something .  remember something .  prove your name is john smith .  take me to the tavern  better yet to the hotel .  present me with your passport .  give me anything  however small  as a beginning  and i will have sufficient faith in you to try for the rest   at some risk to myself  i might add .      i appreciate that  but i cannot .  i am helpless .  i cannot .   i was babbling .  all i could think of was that i was facing torture and an extended prison term for the crime of having been drugged and robbed .  it was more than i could bear and i fainted .  i m sorry .  it is not a heroic action  but i told you i wasn t a hero .    halsted said   you don t know what they had put in your drink in the tavern .  you were half   poisoned .  you weren t yourself .     it s kind of you to say so  but the prospect of torture and imprisonment for nothing was not something i could have faced with stoicism on my best day .    the next memory i have is that of lying on a bed with a vague feeling of having been manhandled .  i think some of my clothing may have been removed .    vee was watching me with the same expression of sadness on his face .  he said   i m sorry .  would you care for some brandy .     i remembered .  the nightmare was back .  i shook my head .  all i wanted was to convince him of my utter innocence somehow .  i said   listen .  you must believe me .  every word i have told you is true .  i      he placed his hand on my shoulder and shook it .   stop .  i believe you .     i stared at him stupidly   what .     he said   i believe you .  for one thing  no one who was sent on a task such as yours might have been  could have portrayed utter terror so convincingly  in my opinion .  but that is only my opinion .  it would not have convinced my superiors and i could not have acted on it .  however  no one could be as stupid as you have now proved to be without having been sufficiently stupid to step into a strange tavern so confidingly and to have forgotten the name of your hotel .     but i don t understand .     enough .  i have wasted enough time .  i should  properly  now leave you to the police  but i do not wish to abandon you just yet .  for the tavern and the thieves within  i can do nothing now .  perhaps another time after another complaint .  let us  however  find your hotel .    tell me anything you remember   the decor   the position of the registration desk   the hair color of the man behind it   were there flowers .  come  come  mr .  smith  what kind of street was it on .  were there shops .  was there a doorman .  anything .     i wondered if it were a scheme to trap me into something  but i saw no alternative but to try to answer the questions .  i tried to picture everything as it had been when i had walked into the hotel for the first time less than twelve hours before .  i did my best to describe and he hurried me on impatiently  asking questions faster than i could answer .    he then looked at the hurried notes he had taken and whispered them to another official of some sort  who was on the spot without my having seen him enter   a hotel expert  perhaps .  the newcomer nodded his head wisely and whispered back .    vee said   very well  then .  we think we know what hotel it was  so let us go .  the faster i locate your passport  the better all around .     off we went in an official car .  i sat there  fearful and apprehensive  fearing that it was a device to break my spirit by offering me hope only to smash it by taking me to prison instead .  god knows my spirit needed no breaking .    or what if they took me to a hotel  and it was the wrong one  would they then listen to anything at all that i had to say .    we did speed to a hotel  however .  i shrugged helplessly when vee asked if it was the hotel .  how could i tell in pitch   darkness .  and i feared committing myself to what would turn out to be a mistake .    but it was the correct hotel .  the night man behind the desk didn t know me  of course  but there was the record of a room for a john smith of fairfield .  we went up there and behold   my luggage  my passport  my papers .  quite enough .    vee shook hands with me and said  in a low voice   a word of advice  mr .  smith .  get out of the country quickly .  i shall make my report and exonerate you  but if things go wrong in some ways  someone may decide you should be picked up again .  you will be better off beyond the borders .     i thanked him and never took anyone s advice so eagerly in all my life .  i checked out of the hotel  grabbed a taxi to the nearest station  and i don t think i breathed till i crossed the border .    to this day  i don t know what it was all about   whether the united states really had an espionage project under way in that country at that time or whether  if we did  we succeeded or failed .  as i said  some official asked me to keep quiet about the whole thing  so i suppose the suspicions of vee s government were more or less justified .    in any case  i never plan to go back to that particular country .    avalon said   you were fortunate  mr .  smith .  i see what you mean when you said you were puzzled by the ending .  vee  as you call him  did make a sudden about   face  didn t he .     i don t think so   interposed gonzalo .   i think he was sympathetic to you all along  mr .  smith .  when you passed out  he called some superior  convinced him you were just a poor jerk in trouble  and then let you go .     it might be   said drake   that it was your fainting that convinced him .  if you were actually an agent  you would know the dangers you ran  and you would be more or less steeled for them .  in fact  he said so  didn t he .  he said you couldn t fake fear so convincingly and you therefore had to be what you said you were   or something like that .    rubin said   if you ve told the story accurately  mr .  smith  i would think that vee is out of sympathy with the regime or he wouldn t have urged you to get out of the country as he did .  i should think he stands a good chance of being purged  or has been since that rime .    trumbull said   i hate to agree with you  manny  but i do .  my guess is that vee s failure to hang on to smith may have been the last straw .     that doesn t make me feel very good   muttered smith .   roger halsted pushed his coffee cup out of the way and placed his elbows on the table .  he said earnestly   i ve heard the bare bones of the story before and i ve thought about it and think there s more to it than that .  besides  if all five of you agree on something  that must be wrong .    he turned to smith .   you told me  john  that this vee was a young man .     well  he struck me as being in his early thirties .     all right  then   said halsted   if a youngish man is in the secret police  it must be out of conviction and he must plan to rise in the ranks .  he isn t going to run ridiculous risks for some nonentity .  if he were an old man  he might remember an earlier regime and might be out of sympathy with the new government  but     gonzalo said   how do you know this vee wasn t a double agent .  maybe that s why our government doesn t want smith to be talking about the matter .     if vee were a double agent   said halsted   then  considering his position in the government intelligence there  he would be enormously valuable to us .  all the more reason that he wouldn t risk anything for the sake of a nonentity .  i suspect that there s more than sympathy involved .  he must have thought of something that authenticated john s story .     sometimes i think that s it   said smith  morosely .   i keep thinking of his remark after i came out of my faint to the effect that i was too stupid to be guilty .  he never did explain that remark .     wait a minute   said rubin .   after you came out of your faint  you said you seemed to be in disarray .  while you were out  they inspected your clothes closely  realized they were american make       what would that prove .   demanded gonzalo  scornfully .   an american spy is as likely to wear american clothes as an american jerk is .  no offense  mr .  smith .     none taken   said smith .   besides  i had bought the clothes i was then wearing in paris .    gonzalo said   i guess you didn t ask him why he thought you were stupid .    smith snorted .   you mean did i say to him   hey  wise guy  who re you calling stupid .   no  i didn t say that  or anything like it .  i just held my breath .    avalon said   the comments on your stupidity  mr .  smith  need not be taken to heart .  you have said several times that you were not yourself at any time during that difficult time .  after being drugged  you might well have seemed stupid .  in any case  i don t see that we ll ever know the inwardness of vee s change of mind .  it would be sufficient to accept it and not question the favors of fortune .  it is enough that you emerged safely from the lion s mouth .     well  wait   said gonzalo .   we haven t asked henry for his opinion yet .    smith said  with astonishment   the waiter .   then  in a lower voice   i didn t realize he was listening .  does he understand this is all confidential .    gonzalo said   he s a member of the club and the best man here .  henry  can you understand vee s change of heart .    henry hesitated .   i do not wish to offend mr .  smith .  i would not care to call him stupid  but i can see why this foreign official  vee  thought so .    there was a general stir about the table .  smith said  stiffly   what do you mean  henry .     you say the events of the nightmare took place some time last year .     that s right   said smith .    and you say your pockets were rifled .  were they completely emptied .     of course   said smith .    but that is clearly impossible .  you ve said you still carry the original vial of pills  and that you have carried it everywhere and at all times  so that i suppose you had it with you when you travelled abroad and that you had it with you when you entered the tavern   and therefore still had it with you when you left the tavern .    smith said   well  yes  you re right .  it was in my shirt pocket as always .  either they missed it or decided they didn t want it .     you didn t say anything about that in the course of the tale you have just told us .     it never occurred to me .     nor did you tell vee about them  i suppose .   said henry .    look here   said smith  angrily   i didn t think of them .  but even if i did  i wouldn t voluntarily bring up the matter .  they would use it to place a trumped   up charge of carrying dope against me and in that way justify an imprisonment .     you d be right  if you thought of the pills only  sir   said henry .    what else is there to think of .     the container   said henry  mildly .   the pills were available only by prescription and you told us it was the original vial .  may we see it  mr .  smith .    smith withdrew it from his shin pocket  glanced at it and said  vehemently   hell .     exactly   said henry .   on the label placed on the vial by the pharmacist  there should be printed the pharmacist s name and address  probably in fairfield  and your name should be typed in as well  together with directions for use .     you re right .     and after you had denied having any identification on you  even in the face of torture  vee looked through your pockets while you were unconscious  and found exactly what he had been asking you to give him .     no wonder he thought i was stupid   said smith  shaking his head .   i was stupid .  now i really feel rotten .     and yet   said henry   you have an explanation of something that has puzzled you for a year  and that should make you feel good .    afterword      here s another story in which i accepted fred s title and discarded my own .  i had called this story  what s my name .   and it seems to me that  can you prove it .   is much more successful .  there s an air of hostility about  can you prove it .   that instantly increases the tension even before you begin the story .   incidentally  this  like  the driver   is one of those stories that derives its tension from the fact that the world contains two superpowers that have confronted each other for forty years now  each with weapons of destruction so unparalleled that a war between them would mean loss  perhaps irreversible loss  for all mankind .   it is for that reason that i hate to write stories involving the confrontation  or even to read them .  it strikes me that anything that serves to increase hatred and suspicion just increases the chances that in a moment of anger or miscalculation the nuclear button will be pushed .   and yet  sometimes  the exigencies of plotting force me into it  and then as i reread the story i can t help but think sardonically that with the change of very few words  with just a substitution here and there of minor extent  the story could very well have been written by someone on the other side .    and that s rather sad  too .   the story appeared in the june           issue of eqmm .   the phoenician bauble  geoffrey avalon  a patent lawyer by profession  did not often admit to reading light fiction .  on the occasion of this particular black widowers banquet  however  he stirred the ice in his second drink  which had reached its halfway point and would be sipped no more  and said   i read an interesting science fiction story yesterday .    james drake  a retired chemist  who had spent the better part of an otherwise misspent life in reading every kind of popular fiction periodical  said   did it hurt .     not at all .  i was at a friend s place  saw a magazine  leafed through it  began reading  and  i must admit  rather enjoyed it .  the premise was that to a man who had developed total recall there could be no secrets .  if i were to recall everything you said  jim  together with intonations and expressions  and combined it with what others said  and what i already knew  i would be able to deduce everything about you .  no matter what it was you didn t want me   or anyone   to know  you would give it away a dozen times a day without knowing it .  it s only that in real life we pay no attention   or don t hear   or forget   that secrets remain secrets .  in the story  of course  the protagonist gets into trouble with his wild talent .     as they always do   said drake  unimpressed .   it s a literary convention as old as midas s golden touch .  the story you read was  i suspect   lest we remember  by isaac asimov  in a recent issue of his own magazine .     that s right   said avalon .   mario gonzalo  who had arrived late and had just placed his rubbers and raincoat in the cloakroom  for new york was not really enjoying the rain it badly needed for its reservoirs   ordered his drink from henry with a small gesture  and said   asimov .  isn t he manny s friend  the one who s even more stuck on himself than manny is  if you can believe it .    emmanuel rubin turned his entire body to face gonzalo and pointed his finger .   asimov is not my friend .  he merely dogs my footsteps because he needs help on various simple points of science before he can write his so   called stories .     i looked him up in books in print  manny   said gonzalo  grinning .   he writes a lot more       books than i do   rubin finished .   yes  i know .  that s because i don t sacrifice quality for quantity .  here  meet my guest .  mr .  enrico pavolini .  this is mario gonzalo  who represents himself to be an artist and who will disprove the fact by concocting a caricature of you shortly .  mr .  pavolini is curator at the city museum of ancient art .    pavolini bowed with continental courtesy  and said   i listen sadly to the science fiction story you are discussing .  i fear that even a perfect memory could not penetrate some secrets  except in romances .  and always those secrets that badly need penetrating prove the most opaque .   his english was perfect but his vowels had a subtle distortion to them that made it clear he was not born to the language .   trumbull said   my feeling is that most secrets are safe because no one really cares .  most so   called secrets are so damned dull  it is only those who are desperately bored who would take the trouble to ferret them out .     that may be so in some cases  my dear sir     began pavolini  but was interrupted by henry s quiet announcement that dinner was served .  the guests sat down to an array of greek appetizers that bore a promise of moussaka to come .  roger halsted made a small sound of pleasure as he draped his napkin over his thighs and rubin  having speared a stuffed grape leaf  looked at it approvingly  placed it in his mouth  and ground it to nothingness .   rubin then said  his mind clearly running on his earlier reference to quality versus quantity    one of the unfortunate consequences of the era of pulp fiction  between      and       is that it raised a generation of asimovs who learned to write without thought  in the pursuit of quantity only .     that s not entirely bad   said drake .   it s far more common for a writer to fall into the opposite trap of postponing execution in a useless search for nonexistent perfection .     i m not talking about perfection   said rubin .   i m suggesting just a little extra trouble to move away from abysmal junk .     if you ll read some of the better pulp  you ll find it is far away from abysmal junk   said drake  stiffly .   a lot of it  in fact  is recognized now as an important contribution to literature and its techniques are well worth study .  dashiell hammett  raymond chandler  cornell woolrich   come on  manny  it s your own field .  don t knock it .     they weren t pulp .  they were real writers who had to make use of the available markets     drake laughed .   it s easy to prove that all pulp is bad  if  when examples of the contrary are cited  you say  if it s good  it isn t pulp .     gonzalo said   once something is old  it gets slavered over by critics who would slap it down hard if they were contemporaries of the object criticized .  i ve heard manny say a hundred times that shakespeare was a hack writer who was despised in his own day .     for every shakespeare   said rubin  violently  his sparse beard bristling   who was far ahead of the puny minds of his time  there were a hundred  or maybe a thousand  scribblers who were dismissed as zeroes in their own time and who are exactly zero today  if they are remembered at all .     that s the point   said pavolini .   surely survival is the best testimony of worth .     not always   said rubin  characteristically shifting ground at once .   accident must play a role .  aeschylus and sophocles wrote over ninety plays each  and in each case only seven survive .  who can possibly say those were the seven best .  sappho was considered by the ancient greeks to be in a class with homer himself  and yet virtually nothing of her work survives .    a curious silence fell over the black widowers  as though in appreciation of true tragedy   the loss of the irreplaceable work of human genius .  the conversation was quieter and more general thereafter .   and finally  rubin  as host  called for the grilling .   not you  mario   he said .   you ll try to prove you re an artist and bore mr .  pavolini to death and he s too good a friend for me to lose .  jim  do the honors .    enrico pavolini looked expectant .  his smile  which seemed always radiant  gave every indication of welcoming all questions .  he might have been in his fifties  but his neat mustache  his ungraying hair  his unlined face  his unsorrowing eyes  would have made the forties an equally reasonable guess .   drake cleared his throat and said   mr .  pavolini  how do you justify your existence .    pavolini showed no surprise at all at the question .  he said   by doing what one man can do to prevent the tragedy of which we spoke earlier in the dinner .  i labor to save those products of artistic genius that might otherwise be lost .  in so doing  of course  i must deal  often  with thieves and criminals  and compound their felonies   but the nature of my work justifies even that .    drake said   who are these thieves and criminals you speak of .     throughout history   said pavolini   works of art have been hidden  sometimes purposely as when they are buried with dead rulers or aristocrats  or when they are concealed from marauding bands of armed men  sometimes accidentally as when a temple is destroyed by an earthquake or a ship sinks at sea .  and throughout history  there have been people in search of treasure  persistent robbers with spades who break into pyramids and tombs  who follow the legends of buried treasure  who poke about in sunken ships .  caches of coins  ingots of precious metals  jewels  works of art  are always turning up .  sometimes they are broken up  melted down  sold as bullion or stones .  sometimes  especially in the last two hundred years  they are left intact and placed on the open market .  that s where i  and others like myself  come in .  we bid for the material .  every museum of art in the world is filled with illegal loot .    drake said   what makes these so   called looters criminals .  are they supposed to leave works of art buried   the property of  for instance  a pharaoh who has been dead for thirty   five centuries .     in the first place   said pavolini   many looters are criminals against humanity .  they are ignorant people who may come across a treasure either by accident  or design  but who  from the start  or in the end  are interested only in the negotiable .  everything they do not see as intrinsically valuable  they are liable to destroy  not so much out of malice as out of indifference .  they are quite likely to break up priceless artwork in order to salvage a few emeralds or strips of gold .    secondly  they are criminals in the eyes of the law .  over the last century  nations have come increasingly to consider various relics of the past as part of their national heritage and therefore the property of the state .  searches should  in theory  be conducted under strict supervision  and finds cannot be sold to foreign museums .  even trained archeologists who flout these rules are  strictly speaking  criminals .    still  many governments are too inefficient to conduct proper searches  too corrupt to resist bribery  and human cupidity is such that consideration of national pride can almost never compete with the fact that a better price can be obtained from foreigners .    drake said   if all museums combined in a policy of refusing to deal with looters      pavolini shook his head vigorously .   it would do no good .  the museums are run by human beings  or by governments  with their own prides  cupidities  and corruptibilities .  no museum would want to lose a real find to another museum .  and even if the museums were to stand firm as a group  items might be sold to private collections   or be broken up and melted down .  some looters have resorted to blackmail and have used the threat of destruction to force a higher price .    drake said   is it all worth it .  surely not everything is a great work of art .     some is   said pavolini  smiling with a touch of condescension   by any standards  as  for instance  the bust of nefertiti  the cretan snake goddess  venus de milo .  that  however  is secondary  in a way .  every artifact of a past era is important as a living evidence of a society that is gone .  the commonest pot of terra   cotta was once used  was part of a way of life  was formed to fill a purpose .  each is as important and as indispensable to an archeologist as the fossil tooth of an extinct shark would be to a paleontologist .    trumbull said   may i interpose  jim .    i presume the city museum of ancient art has its share of past artifacts  mr .  pavolini .    pavolini s smile broadened .   it certainly has  mr .  trumbull .  you must come visit us sometime and see for yourself .  we are a comparatively young museum and do not have the resources of the metropolitan  but we are more finely focussed and our collection of pre   columbian mexican art is world   famous .     i will certainly visit you at my first opportunity   said trumbull   but i seem to remember that before dinner  you said something about secrets not being easily penetrated .    pavolini looked suddenly grave .   did i .     yes .  there was some mention of some idiotic science fiction story about a perfect memory being all that was required to penetrate any secret and you said      ah  yes  i remember .     well  then  were you referring to anything specific  anything that had to do with your work .     as a matter of fact  yes .   pavolini shrugged his shoulders .   a small thing that has been haunting me for some time  but of no importance outside my own feelings  i suppose .     tell us about it   said trumbull  conjugating himself abruptly into the imperative .   pavolini blinked .   as i said  utterly unimportant .    rubin put in gently   tell us anyway  enrico .  it s the price of the dinner .  you remember i explained about the grilling .     yes  emmanuel   said pavolini   but it is not a thing i can discuss indiscriminately .  from a strictly legal standpoint     rubin said   we are all as silent as one of your pre   columbian artifacts .  that includes  particularly  our esteemed waiter and fellow member  henry .  please continue  enrico .    pavolini smiled  ruefully .   our artifacts are not by any means silent  since they speak to us eloquently of past cultures  so it was an unfortunate simile .  however   there was a phoenician bauble on the market of the museum world   the black market  i suppose .    it had been dug up in cyprus  where the confusion of the past decade has made it possible for looters to obtain and smuggle out valuable material .  this was a small cup of gold and enamel  dating back to some time about      b . c .  there was some question as to whether it showed mycenean influence and it bore promise of modifying some of our notions of events in the time of the trojan war .    naturally  we wanted it  and so  i imagine  did a dozen other major museums in the world .  it wasn t  of course  a matter of mere bidding .  the person offering it for sale had to cover his tracks for he wanted to get back to cyprus  to obtain other pieces perhaps  without being stripped of his gains and being thrown into prison besides by the cypriot authorities .  for that reason  he needed to have certain precautions accepted  certain guaranties made .  and  of course  it helped to have a good man on the spot  a persuasive man .    rubin said   you once told me about one of your people who you said was exactly like that   jelinsky .    pavolini nodded .   the name is not merely jelinsky .  you forget how it came about i mentioned him to you in the first place .  his full name was emmanuel jelinsky .  that is actually how i came to know you  emmanuel .  it is an unusual first name and when i was introduced to you  i thought at once of my emmanuel .  it drew my attention to you .  we talked about him and then i had my chance to get to know you .  my emmanuel  however  is now dead .     i m sorry   said rubin .    a heart attack .  he was sixty   five and it was not entirely unexpected  but  if i may be permitted to view it selfishly  it was tragic  for with his death went all chance of obtaining the phoenician bauble .   pavolini sighed heavily .   to be honest  it was with the greatest difficulty that i persuaded myself to attend the banquet tonight   but i had accepted your invitation nearly a month ago and my wife rather insisted i go .  she said she did not want me brooding and tearing my hair .  she said   have one evening out .  forget .   so here i am  and i m not forgetting after all .    there was an uneasy silence at that  and then gonzalo  the ever   hopeful  said   sometimes it turns out that we can help people with problems .    trumbull said with instant fury   will you stop making ridiculous statements like that .     i said sometimes   said gonzalo  defensively   and i intend to continue the grilling .  how about it  manny .  you re the host .    rubin looked uncomfortable .   do you mind if we continue  enrico .    pavolini managed a smile .   not talking will not bring him back  nor the bauble  either .     all right  then   said gonzalo .   you said that jelinsky s death lost you that phoenician whatever   it   was .  which museum got it .     i wish one of them did .  that would be better for the world generally .  the trouble is that the object has simply disappeared .     how .  why .   burst out trumbull .   pavolini sighed .   well  then  from the beginning .  let me explain about jelinsky .  he was with the museum longer than i was and he was simply invaluable .  i don t wish to overdramatize but in some respects museums must engage in activities that have about them some of the atmosphere of espionage work .  there are delicate negotiations to be carried through  clandestine contacts to be made  objects to be purchased illegally and  therefore  secretly  other museums to spy on and measures to be taken to foil the spies of others .    of course  it is all small potatoes since the apparatuses involved and the stakes  too  are far smaller than those which governments or even industries can dispose of .  on the other hand  we don t have great power to fall back on for protection  and to us  at least  if to no one else  the stakes are high .    jelinsky was what we would consider a master spy  if he were an employee of the cia .  he could trace valuable items and make his contacts before anyone else was fairly in the field .  he was persuasive  could talk a bird out of a tree and into his hand  could close a deal to the greatest advantage of ourselves even while others were after the same item with offers that were double what we could offer .  we never knew how he did it .    i asked him once about that but he just let one eyelid close and said   you ll never know  enrico .  after all  if you ever fire me  i would have to find work elsewhere and it would be inconvenient if you knew my methods then .     he had one peculiarity  however  that we all knew about .  it was impossible to miss .  he doodled .  he was never without a scratch pad and at any time that scratch pad had the top sheet covered with fascinating abstractions .  they were never quite the same but they were always neatly geometric   triangles  squares  trapezoids  octagons  either alone or in bizarre combinations .  sometimes there would be words built up of letters neatly printed in geometric form .  sometimes i could tell it was a word that occupied his mind at the time of the doodling .  i remember once  when we were in conference  he wrote the first few letters of my name  each letter constructed in a series of egg   shaped segments .  i asked him if he would let me have it as a curio and he looked at it with astonishment as if not aware he had done it .  he gave it to me with an air of wondering why i could possibly want it .  i still have it .    i asked him once why he doodled and he said he wasn t sure .  he said   maybe it is what i do instead of jiggling my feet or tapping my fingernails .  i have a restless mind and this focuses it and keeps it from darting off in unwanted directions .  maybe .  and maybe it just serves as an outlet for some artistic impulse that lies dormant in me .  i don t know .  in any case  i never notice that i m doodling when i m doodling .  but at least i stick to geometry so i never give away my thoughts .      except when you write letters   i said  and he flushed and insisted they never meant anything .    gonzalo said  with satisfaction  as he sipped at his brandy and then held up the glass for henry to renew the infusion   i ll bet one of jelinsky s doodles has a part in all this .     yes   said pavolini  sadly   or i should not have gone on at such length about it .  obviously .  two weeks ago  i received a call from jelinsky .  he was in halifax .  he did not speak of the phoenician artifact directly for   and again i do not wish to overdramatize   he well knew his room might be bugged or his wire tapped .  some of our competitors are at least as unscrupulous as we ourselves are .    i understood well the significance of what he was saying  however .  he had closed the deal and he had the object .  why the deal was closed in halifax  i don t know and didn t ask .  the looter may have been canadian or jelinsky may have persuaded him to come to that unlikely city to throw off the scent as far as the others in the field were concerned .  it didn t matter .    though jelinsky had physical possession of the object  he did not intend to carry it with him to new york .  he had checked it in an unobtrusive place in the form of a package that gave no outward clue to its contents or its value  and under conditions where it was clear to the people keeping it that it might be some time before it was called for .  he was coming to new york with the information and someone else would then fly to halifax to get the object .  all this was told me most indirectly  virtually in code .     isn t all this indirection overdrawn .   said halsted .    i know it sounds paranoid   said pavolini   but jelinsky was a known man .  he might be followed  his baggage might be tampered with .  after all  why hesitate to steal an object that was already stolen .  in any case  jelinsky did not feel it safe to carry the object to new york .  we could send some unknown to carry the object  someone who would be safe because he was unknown .     except that he died   said gonzalo  excitedly   before he could pass on the necessary information .     of a heart attack  as i told you   said pavolini   at kennedy airport .  naturally  he never had a chance to tell us where he had checked the object .    avalon looked grave and said   i scarcely wish to outdo you in overdramatizing the matter  so i will ask you to reassure us and tell us that there is no chance that jelinsky was murdered and the information taken from his body .     not at all possible   said pavolini .   there were those who saw him collapse  there was his history of heart disease  and there was a careful autopsy .  there was no question but that it was a natural death  and a most unfortunate one for us .  for one thing  we had lost an irreplaceable man  but he would have died eventually .  it was the precise moment of his death that was the calamity .    we don t know where the object is .  we presume it is somewhere in halifax   but that is all .  essentially  the phoenician bauble is once again buried  and it will be recovered only by accident and by   who can tell who .    even if it were found by someone and were placed on the market again  the fact that we have already paid a substantial sum for it would mean nothing .  we are not likely to be able to prove ownership and  what is worse  we are even less likely to prove legal ownership .  if found  and if the find is publicized too openly  the greek cypriot government will claim it and will probably receive it .  we can live with the loss of the money  but the loss of the object itself is hard to bear .  very hard .   pavolini shook his head despondently .   pavolini went on   what makes it more frustrating is that there is absolutely no reason to think he was robbed .  he was under observation by many  as i said  when he collapsed  and airport guards were at his side almost at once .  his pockets were filled with the usual   a wallet reasonably supplied with cash  including both american and canadian bills .  there were coins  credit cards  keys  handkerchief  and so on .     nothing of interest at all .   asked halsted  incredulously .    well  one of the items was a claim check .  we  as his employers  were able to effect a claim to that   though not without considerable legal problems .  however  it doesn t help us at all .  i suspect   i hope   that the claim check is for the package containing the object  but what good does that do me .  the claim check is entirely without distinguishing mark .  it is red and rectangular and made of cardboard .  on it in black block letters is the number    .  on the other side is nothing .  there is no way of identifying where on earth   or  at least  where in halifax   the ticket belonged .    trumbull said   nothing else .  no address book .  no folded slip of paper in his wallet .     believe me  we went over everything in his pockets and in his baggage  under the eyes of the police  i might add   and there seemed nothing that could indicate the place where he had checked the package .  there was an address book  of course  but in it was not one halifax address  nor was there one non   halifax address that seemed in any way suspicious .  there was his scratch pad  too .  if that had not been present  i would have been sure he was robbed .  still  under the closest scrutiny  there was no address on any page of it .  we might have tested everything for secret writing   i thought of that   but why on earth should he have gone to such lengths .     i suppose   said halsted   you might use force majeure .  you might go to every place in halifax that could conceivably use such claim checks and try to recover a package at each one .     every hotel .  every restaurant .  every train or bus terminal .  every airport .   said pavolini .   that would truly be an act of desperation .  no .    we tried cutting down the possibilities instead .     the doodles .   cried out gonzalo .    you haven t forgotten   said pavolini .   yes  there were doodles on the top page of the scratch pad .  they might have been made on the plane  but he doodled chiefly when in conference  and that must have been in halifax .     but you said   avalon pointed out   that there was no address on any page of the scratch pad .     that s right  but there were other things .  there were his characteristic geometric constructions  as identifiable as fingerprints .  if that were all there was  it would be useless  but there was more .  it was one of those rare occasions when he constructed letters and i knew there must have been some word  some phrase  which had attracted his attention .  unfortunately  he had written down only part of it .  there was a capital b  a small i  and a small f each in ornate script .  those letters were absolutely identifiable as his handiwork  too .  in other words   bif  was the beginning of some word that had caught his attention  when he was negotiating the sale  and if we could work out what the word was and where he had seen it  i have the feeling we would know where he had checked the package .    trumbull said   for all you know  that doodle may have been made the day before the negotiations  or the week before .  it may have no connection with the negotiations at all .     possible   said pavolini   but not likely .  in my experience  jelinsky never kept them long but disposed of the used top sheet when beginning another .  therefore  it could not have been very old .     but you cannot be sure   said trumbull  persisting .    no  i cannot be sure but i have nothing else to go by   said pavolini  exasperated .   gonzalo said  eagerly   do you have the paper with you .     no   said pavolini  lifting his arms up and then letting them drop .   how can you think i would carry it with me .  it is in my office safe .  could i have imagined this matter would come up in the evening s discussion .     it s just that it seemed to me   said gonzalo   that if we could see the doodles  we might get something out of it you didn t .  could you reproduce them for us .    pavolini lifted his upper lip in disdain .   i am not an artist .  i could not do it .  i could not even reproduce the curlicues in the letters .  believe me  there is nothing there but the letters  and nothing of any significance but the letters .  nothing .    halsted said   the letters don t seem very significant to me .  what word starts with  bif  anyway .      bifurcate   said rubin  at once .    fine .   said pavolini .   a useful word  indeed .  where would jelinsky see  bifurcate  in the course of the negotiations .  my friends  i did not sit about and puzzle out the matter .  i used the unabridged dictionary .   bifurcate  means  to divide in two .   there is also  bifid  meaning  in two parts .   there are chemical terms   biformate    bifluoride   and so on .  these are all useless .  it is not in the realm of possibility that he was looking at any of these words while he was sitting   wherever he was sitting   with the man who was selling the artifact .  there is only one word  only one  that seemed as though it might be useful and that word is  bifocals .     rubin said   was the man jelinsky dealt with an optometrist .     i know nothing about the man  but it seems reasonable that the negotiations might have taken place at an optometrist s  or  more likely  across the street from an optometrist s .  with the word  bifocals  staring him in the face  jelinsky might well have started writing it absently .     it s possible   said avalon  judiciously .   but pavolini folded his arms across his chest  looked sadly at the men assembled about the table  and said   it did not work .  i had a couple of our men scour the city to find optometrists in whose window  or on whose signs  there might be the word  bifocals .   we have not yet found one .  optometrists do not stress bifocals .  those are for elderly people .  they do their best to impress the public with beauty and with the chic qualities of their spectacles .  everything for youth or pretended youth .  nevertheless  we are not done looking .    drake said   you might be looking in the wrong direction .  if jelinsky made his letters with curlicues they might not be easily identifiable at all .  for instance  it s easy to draw a small e and have it look like a small i .  jelinsky may not have intended  bif  at all .  he may have intended  bef .   his pen might have skipped the little curve because the paper was greasy at that spot .     what would you have with  bef  .   asked rubin .    i don t know .  he might have been starting to write  beforehand   let us say  because he had outthought his rivals and had gotten to the seller beforehand .     that wouldn t help find the package   said rubin .    who says it has to .   demanded halsted .   what jelinsky wrote might have nothing to do with the package and might be of no help at all .  we re only trying to find out the truth  and if the truth doesn t suit us    drake spread his arms in fatalistic resignation .   pavolini said   no  no .  let me stop you .  i cannot say whether it would help us if we penetrated the meaning of the word .  perhaps not .  but at least i am quite certain that the word begins with  bif  and nothing else .  the i was an i and not an e because  for one thing  jelinsky had placed a dot above it .  in fact  jelinsky even curlicued the dot so that it was a triple dot .     a triple dot .   said gonzalo .   what do you mean .     like this   said pavolini .   i can draw this much  anyway .  it looked like this .   he withdrew a small pad from an inner jacket pocket  tore out a sheet of paper  and drew three short vertical lines  closely spaced .    there .   he said .   it was very small .    it was at this point that henry interrupted .   mr .  pavolini  may i see that piece of paper .    pavolini stared at henry for a moment  then  with a trace of amusement  he said   if you wish to look at it  waiter  here it is .  perhaps you will have a theory  too .    gonzalo said   i wouldn t take that attitude  mr .  pavolini .  henry might have a theory at that .    pavolini said   very well .  go ahead  waiter .  from those three little lines  can you tell me where the package is hidden .     not exactly  mr .  pavolini   said henry  with careful deference .   i can think of two places and there may possibly be one or two others  but i can t pin it down precisely to one place .     indeed .   said pavolini .   you can give me two  possibly four  places  and the package will be in one of them .     i believe so  sir .     you believe so .  wonderful .  in that case just give me the four .  i challenge you .   pavolini s voice had risen to a shout .    may i first point out that since there is no really hopeful word in english that begins with  bif   it may be that mr .  jelinsky was not writing an english word .     take my word for it   said pavolini  freezingly .   jelinsky knew no language other than english .  he was not an educated man and   except for his specialty   really knew very little .     i will accept that   said henry   but we have to ask ourselves not which word he knew and understood  but which word he encountered in the place in which he was negotiating the sale .  if they were seated in a french restaurant  that restaurant   located in a city of british culture   might well sell steak  but would  of course  have it on the menu  or in the window  or on the sign  according to a spelling all their own .   beefsteak   in french  becomes bifteck .    pavolini said  in a small voice   bifteck .     yes  sir .  i know of two good french restaurants in halifax and there may be one or two more .  i suggest you try the cloakroom in all four  if necessary .    pavolini said   you are guessing .     not really  sir .  not after i saw the three little lines you drew .  might those lines have looked a bit more like this  sir .   on the same sheet of paper  henry drew .   because if they did  that is a fleur   de   lis  which you would find prominently displayed in one place or another in almost any french restaurant .  if we take the three letters and the fleur   de   lis together  then one can scarcely doubt where jelinsky was sitting when he prepared this doodle .    pavolini s mouth was open  and now he closed it with an audible  snap .   by heaven  you are right .  i will leave  gentlemen .  i will leave now .  good   bye to all of you  with my thanks for a wonderful dinner   but i have work to do .   he began to hurry out  then stopped and turned .   my thanks to you particularly  henry  but how did you do it .    henry said  gravely   restaurants are my specialty  sir .    afterword  this is the twenty   eighth black widowers story that fred dannay bought for eqmm and  alas  the last  for death  as it must to all  finally came to the man who probably did more for the mystery field than any other single person since conan doyle .  he will always be missed by all those who read his ellery queen stories  by all who dealt with him as editor  and by all who knew him as friend .   in connection with the story you have just read  by the way  i received a letter from a museum curator who pointed out that the story does not describe the actual methods used by museums to obtain their exhibits  and that it perpetuates a false stereotype of museums as promoters of skullduggery .   i m sure he s right and i apologize to all museums .  the fact is that i know nothing about the actual workings of museum acquisitions and i make it all up out of my head in such a way as to have it fit in with the plot .  i suspect  though  that that s the way it s got to be  if the hardworking mystery writer is to make a living .   consider  for instance  the writings of agatha christie  that model of everything a mystery writer ought to be  even if she did have very peculiar notions about how americans talk and act  .  if she were to be taken seriously  there is not an upper   class family in all of england that did not have a member done to death in the library  with a paper knife skewering his heart and a look of indescribable horror on his face  and that did not have another member who did the deed .  but we accept that   suspension of disbelief   and don t expect the world of the mystery to be in one   to   one correspondence with the world of reality .   the story appeared in the may      issue of eqmm .   a monday in april  charles soskind was strikingly handsome .  that much was obvious from the moment thomas trumbull introduced him to the membership of the black widowers on the occasion of their monthly banquet .   it was  in fact  obvious even before he was introduced .  he was tall  slim  dark haired .  he had a pale complexion with eyes that were all the more startlingly dark for that .  he had astonishingly regular features  firm lips with just a trace of sensuousness about them  and an engaging smile .  he shook hands with a strong grip and his fingernails were well cared for .  he exuded just a trace of after   shave lotion and the paleness of his cheeks was shadowed by the blueness of a buried beard   for there was no visible stubble .  he was well   barbered and he seemed like a throwback to a gibson collar ad .   trumbull said   charles is relatively new at the department .  he took his degree in slavic studies at the university of michigan .    hands were shaken all around and each black widower displayed that quite detectable air of distrust with which ordinary males meet an extraordinary specimen of their own kind .   mario gonzalo was perhaps most obvious in his reaction .  he managed to locate his reflection in the mirror and refurbished the line of his jacket in what he might have thought was an unobtrusive manner .   if so  emmanuel rubin promptly disabused him .  with a broad grin which showed the pronounced gap between his upper first incisors  rubin whispered   forget it  mario .  you re straight out of the garbage can in comparison .    gonzalo lifted his eyebrows and stared down at the shorter rubin in haughty displeasure .   what the hell are you talking about .    rubin continued to smile .   you know   he said   and i know  and surely that s enough .    just the same  rubin did manage to run his fingers absently through his straggly beard as though a sudden and impossible desire to have it flow downward in a neat and impressive manner had overtaken him .   geoffrey avalon cleared his throat and stood straighter and more stiffly even than was his wont .  he was two inches taller than soskind  and it was clear that he didn t care if the whole world noticed that little fact .   roger halsted sucked in his stomach and endured the discomfort of that for nearly two minutes .  james drake  the oldest of the black widowers  looked preternaturally indifferent  as though it was only age and nothing more that kept him out of the race   and  what s more  prevented him from winning .   only henry  the competent waiter  on whose shoulders the welfare of the banquets rested  seemed truly unaware of anything out of the ordinary as he brought soskind his straight ginger ale  with a maraschino cherry in it .   soskind regarded the drink somberly and then  with the air of someone who has survived questioning on the matter for years  said  even though no one asked   i order the cherry because that makes it look like an alcoholic drink of some sort and i then don t have to explain why i m not drinking .     why don t you drink .   asked rubin  with immediate perversity .    it s not because i m a member of alcoholics anonymous   said soskind dryly .   i just have a low tolerance for alcohol .  one drink gets me distinctly high and since i get no pleasure out of the sensation  i choose not to drink .  i don t have to be forced or argued into it .     if i were you   said gonzalo  darkly   i d get perrier with a pearl onion in it .  that dye they use in maraschino cherries is carcinogenic  i hear .     so is everything   said soskind   if you choose the proper strain of rats to experiment with  and make the doses large enough .    halsted said  with the usual slight stammer that always seemed to invade his speech as soon as he tried particularly hard to seem a man of the world   too bad you re so adversely affected by alcohol .  overdoing it is bestial  but there is nothing quite as civilized as the ritual of the moderate sharing of drinks .  it reduces the inhibitions standing in the way of the true grace of social intercourse .     believe me   said soskind  nodding   i fully appreciate that particular disadvantage under which i labor .  i usually avoid cocktail panics simply because i can t participate on equal terms .  and that s by no means the worst of it .  it s the business lunches that are the real strain .  i assure you that if i could drink more easily  i would be glad to do so .    and almost at once  as though on cue  henry announced the end of the cocktail hour .   dinner is served  gentlemen .    drake found himself sitting next to the banquet guest and said   are you of russian extraction  mr .  soskind .     not as far as i know   said soskind  his expression lightening a bit at the smoked salmon and onion bits .  he reached for a section of the thin   sliced bread and butter and carefully brushed the capers to one side .   my father s father arrived here from luxembourg  and my mother s parents were both welsh .     i asked   said drake   because of your degree in slavic studies .  your doctorate  by the way .     yes  i have the right to be referred to as dr .  soskind  though i never insist on it .  you are dr .  drake  i presume .     chemistry .  but all of us can refer to each other as doctors by virtue of our membership in the club .  even our good henry  the invaluable waiter of the organization  is dr .  jackson  if we chose to call him that .    but how did you come to slavic studies .     oh  that .  no personal reasons  if you discount ambition .  after all  the united states has been facing the soviet union in open competition for forty years now .  many soviet citizens can speak english and have studied anglo   american history and culture  while very few americans have returned the compliment .  this puts us under a severe disadvantage and by my making a personal effort to help redress the balance  i am making myself a patriot and  in addition  am opening my way to advancement  since my knowledge is useful .     you mean in tom trumbull s department .     i mean   said soskind  carefully   in that organ of government in which we both serve .     i take it then   put in avalon suddenly from the other side of the table   that you speak and read russian quite fluently .     yes  sir   said soskind   quite fluently  and polish as well .  i can make myself understood in czech and serbian .  with time  i hope to learn other languages  too .  arabic and japanese are extremely important in today s world  and i intend to take courses in each as soon as i finish my present damned task .    trumbull leaned forward from his position at the head of the table  which he occupied by virtue of serving as that evening s host of the banquet .    stop it  you idiots .  is this grilling time .  charles  you answer no questions at all until it s time .  right now  you just enjoy your dinner undisturbed .    i don t understand you half   wits .  do the rules of the club have to be explained to you each time .     there are no rules   said rubin  promptly .    yes .   said gonzalo .   i wonder if you ll expound that doctrine the next time i bring in a woman as my guest .     that s a matter of tradition .   howled rubin .   if you can t understand the difference between tradition and rules     and the discussion degenerated into a verbal free   for   all at once .   the bouillabaisse was done  the hot  scented napkins had been put to their proper use  the baked alaska was consumed  and the black widowers were lingering over their coffee  tea for the guest  when trumbull rattled the spoon against the water glass and said   mario  since you did not display the bad taste to grill my guest before he had been adequately fed  won t you now serve as griller   in   chief .    gonzalo jumped slightly .  he had produced the needed caricature of the guest  catching him in a spectacularly byronic profile .  he said   mr .  soskind  it is customary to begin by asking the guest to justify his existence .  let me answer that question for myself .  i judge that you would say in response that you are carrying through the justification by using your russian to help the american government beat the soviet union .    soskind  who was glaring at the caricature  said   the word  beat  has unpleasant connotations .  i would prefer to say that i am doing my bit to secure the interests of the united states  which  i take it  means first and foremost the preservation of world peace and the protection of human rights .    gonzalo said   but wouldn t you be making a hell of a lot more money if you went into show business .    soskind reddened and seemed to be struggling with himself to prevent an explosion .  his control burst  however  and he said   that s an idiotic question to ask  and the proper answer i ought to give you is a punch in the jaw .    for a moment  the gathering froze and then trumbull said  with totally uncharacteristic mildness   that s uncalled for  charles .  i told you the way in which we play our game when i invited you to dinner .  i do not deny that mario is often idiotic  as are we all   always excluding our good henry   but he was in this case within his rights .  he was asking a question  and he may ask any question .  you have been given to understand that you must answer all questions truthfully .  whatever you say will never pass outside this room .    soskind said   of course  tom .  i apologize to you  mr .  gonzalo  and to all the company .   he drew a deep breath and said  not without some signs of continuing anger   i suppose it might look to some people as though i might be successful in hollywood  especially if i really looked like that sketch you have drawn  mr .  gonzalo .  i suppose you meant it to represent me but i earnestly hope i don t resemble it altogether .    good looks  assuming i have them  might get me into the movies  but i doubt they could make me a success unless i had some minimal acting ability as well   something i do not have .  even then  it could not make me happy unless i had the actor s temperament  which i am poles removed from .  i am doing what i want to do   studying the languages of humanity   for the reasons i have mentioned and if it returns an adequate compensation  i am quite ready to dismiss the dreams of avarice .  have i made that clear .     very clear   said gonzalo   but what makes you think you lack the temperament of an actor .  i know a number of actors and they come in all shapes and varieties of temperament .  as for acting ability  it seems to me you have the capacity for   histrionics  if manny will tell me that is indeed the word i want .     that s the word you want   for once   said rubin .   soskind bowed his head for a moment .  when he lifted it  it was as though the clouds had thinned and the sun had broken through .  his smile was all but irresistible .    gentlemen   he said   i find that i am still making things hard for you .  i do not wish to do that .  honestly .  it is just that these last ten days or so i have not been myself .  i assure you that ordinarily i am not given to histrionics  and i will display none henceforth .    several of the black widowers spoke at once and trumbull s voice rose piercingly .   mario has the floor .     thank you  tom   said gonzalo  and at once asked what all had been trying to ask .   why are you not yourself .  and please don t say that it s private or that it s none of my business .  it s my question and i want an answer .     i understand   said soskind  calmly .   i m afraid it s an old  dull story .  a young lady with whom i was   am   oh  hell  always may be in love  if you don t mind my sounding like a romantic jackass  betrayed me and   and   well  what more is there to say .     did she run off with your best friend .   asked gonzalo .   soskind looked revolted .   of course not .  nothing like that .  she s not that kind of woman .     well  then  what happened .   asked gonzalo .   avalon s baritone voice boomed out .   wait .  before you answer  mr .  soskind   and with your permission  mario   please tell me if there is any mystery to this .     mystery  sir .   soskind looked nonplussed .    yes .  anything you don t understand  anything that puzzles you and that can t be explained .    soskind said   not at all .  i wish there were .  it s all very plain and  for me  heartbreaking .  claire broke her word  that s all .  she took an unfair advantage and didn t even have the decency to be ashamed of it .  i couldn t live with that no matter how much i might be in love with her .    but it doesn t make me very happy  not being able to live with it .     no mystery   said avalon  smiling .   you might want to let the matter drop then  mario .  why probe a sore subject just for the sake of probing it .     thank you   said soskind .   gonzalo frowned .   unless tom makes a host s decision against me  jeff  i won t drop the subject .  i m curious .    trumbull hesitated .   i ll poll the company .  how many want the subject dropped .    he and avalon raised their hands  and trumbull said   four to two against dropping the subject .  henry   are you voting .    henry  who was just adding a drop of brandy to drake s glass  said   yes  sir .  my hand was not raised .  i feel that if mr .  soskind still feels an affection for the young lady  he may have a suspicion that he is misjudging her .  it might help if he tells us the details .    rubin said   i was pretty much thinking the same thing   and now there was a murmur of agreement about the table .   soskind looked from face to face and said   all right  i ll tell you  but you ll find there s simply no doubt about the matter .  i have no suspicion that i m misjudging her .     you know   said soskind   it s particularly hard for me to find a young woman i can be interested in .  please don t make mock faces of disbelief .  i do attract instant female attention because  i suppose  of my   my appearance  as i would if i were ostentatiously wealthy  or if i were a rock star  but of what value is instant attention for superficial reasons such as those .    being human  i sometimes take advantage of such attention  particularly if i am lured into thinking it is something more than a matter of superficial appearance that attracts them  or if i  in turn  am attracted by something or other that is really of no importance .  i am  in that case  quickly disillusioned  gentlemen  and so  it may be  are they .    on the other hand  my appearance is often against me and actually repels young women  and you needn t make exaggerated expressions of disbelief at that  mr .  gonzalo .  there are many women who come to an instant misjudgment concerning me through no fault of my own .    unfortunately  the novelists who form our stereotypical beliefs invariably make their heroines incredibly beautiful but only very rarely stress the good looks of the hero .  the male protagonist tends to look craggy and charmingly plain .  the result is that if i am considered not plain  i arouse instant suspicion .    i have heard the comments  indirectly .   who wants a boyfriend prettier than i am .    i ll have to fight for a chance at the mirror .     the reeling is universal that if a man is  quote  good   looking  unquote  as i was accused of being by this assemblage  at least by implication  then he must be vain  self   centered  capricious  and  worst of all  a simpering  brainless fool .    these days  in fact  women are likely to dismiss me  on sight  as having homosexual tendencies   which i do not  by the way   simply because quote  that s the way with all these pretty men  unquote .    as it happens  i am a serious person .  i don t mean by that that i lack a sense of humor  or that i do not laugh  or that i do not occasionally enjoy being silly .  the point lies in the use of the word  occasionally .     for the most part  i am interested in straightforward application of nose to grindstone  of myself to my career and to my intellectual interests .  and i want my women serious  too .    the women most likely to interest me   the intelligent  serious  ambitious ones   they are the very ones most likely to be put off by me  the very ones who will quickly decide that i am an obnoxious nonentity  that i am quote  too pretty  unquote .    until i met claire .    she is in all ways my fellow  if you don t mind the irish bull  .  she is a linguist  too  specializing in the modern romance languages  as i in the slavic .    she is quite good   looking   at least i find her so   and quite indifferent to that fact .  she is serious  intelligent  hard   driving  and a feminist in fact  rather than in conversation  having driven her way forward  and without much fuss  in a man s world .    it was not love at first sight .  what can one possibly know at first sight but superficialities   and very likely deceiving ones  at that .  we met at the library  when we were each engaged in a little research and discovered we had interests in common .  i was at the department  she at columbia .    we met again  and then it became periodic .  the more we learned about each other  the more satisfied we each became .  it turned out we had the same opinions in politics  literature  and art   at least  in general  though there were enough differences in detail to lead to interesting discussions .    the thing i most approved about her was that where there was a disagreement  she expressed her point of view calmly and with cogent arguments  and considered my counterarguments dispassionately and thoughtfully .  there were times when she accepted my point of view  and times when i accepted hers  though on most occasions  i must admit  we continued to disagree .  i could not argue her into voting republican  for instance .    in the end i was in love  by which i do not mean i was overcome by a mooning longing for physical intimacy .  that existed  of course  but is not what i consider  quote  love  unquote .  i was in love because i desperately wanted a continuing and  if possible  lifelong companionship where we could each pursue our aims and interests  together  if possible  but separately  if necessary   though even in the latter case  each with the interest and support of the other .    there was talk of marriage and of children and there were also what we might term romantic interludes   neither of us were entirely creatures of the mind   and then  one day  it turned out that neither of us had really studied latin .     we ought to   said claire   if for no other reason than the mental stimulation .  besides  it would please professor trent .     i must tell you about marcus quintus trent .  he was a latinist of the old school  and so was his father   hence his name  and he had an emeritus status at columbia .  he had been a friend of claire s father and had been instrumental in rousing her interest in languages .  i had met him and found him genial  interesting  and  above all  urbane .  he had the manners of a gentleman  in the non   american meaning of that word  and it made him seem both immensely old   fashioned and immensely civilized .    his latinism led him to believe  it sometimes seemed  that he was living in julius caesar s time .  he was not only latinate in his way of speaking  but i swear in his way of thinking as well .  it seemed an effort for him not to refer to the american president as the imperator .  he would use latin terms without being aware of it and was as likely to date his letters in the month of februarius as not .    i suspect he was a bit woebegone over claire s having studied all the direct descendants of latin   even a bit of catalan and rumanian   without actually dealing with latin itself .  that may have helped her come to the decision to study it .    automatically  i decided to go along with her and thus began what i referred to earlier in the evening as my  quote  present damned task  unquote .    i do not use the adjective to indicate that the task was difficult .  learning latin is not the major task a nonlinguist might assume .  for me  the case structure of russian was excellent training for the actually rather simpler case structure of latin .  for claire  the latin vocabulary was no problem at all since it was first cousin to italian  which she spoke like a native .  and for both of us  there was a native talent for languages  to say nothing of considerable practice in learning them .  no  the task was a damned one for something that had nothing to do with the language itself .    we discussed  with considerable animation  the matter of which of us would have the final advantage  i with my grammatical head start or she with her vocabularial push forward .  unspoken was the question of which of us might be the better linguist in general .    yes  mr .  rubin  i quite realize that setting up a competition between two ambitious  hard   driving people might well endanger the affection that had grown up between them .  neither of us would have liked being beaten  but we both agreed that our love was strong enough to survive the fact that one of us was bound to be beaten by the other .    besides  what was a single defeat .  if one of us was a clear loser at this time  he or she might win out on another day in the case of another challenge .  the keen edge of intellect  sharpened by the competition  might  in fact  serve to further advance each of us in our profession  and this would more than make up for the trivial score of victories and defeats .    at least  we persuaded each other that this was so .    the idea was that we were each  quite independently  to study latin on our own  using texts and authors of our choice .  after six months  trent would give us a passage of latin literature to translate and he would judge it on the basis of both accuracy and eloquence of translation .  in other words  a word   for   word translation was not enough .  trent intended to look for english that would capture the style as well as the meaning .    trent threw himself into the matter with vigor .  he chose cicero as a matter of course since cicero s latin is the most elegant in existence and also the most gracefully convoluted .   trent urged us to read milton s paradise lost if we wanted the nearest equivalent in english to ciceronian style  and to be guided by that .     he chose a passage from one of cicero s lesser essays  one which was likely to be unfamiliar to us  and handed it to each of us in a sealed envelope .  the terms were that each of us was to open the envelope at   a . m .  on the fifteenth of april and hand the translation to him no more than a week later   ample time not only for translation  but for polishing and repolishing in search of that elusive something called style .    in translating we might use a latin dictionary but  of course  we were neither of us to search for any already existing translation of the passage .  we agreed to this readily  and trent was gentleman enough to feel quite certain that we would both adhere to all conditions in all honor .  as for myself  i knew he would not find me wanting and i assumed he would not find claire wanting either .  it did not even occur to me that claire could possibly cheat .  that was inconceivable .    the final condition was that trent would be sole judge of the results and that his decision was to be accepted without argument .    claire and i agreed that we would remain completely apart for the testing period  lest the presence of one prove a distraction to the other .  in fact  i had to go out of town on friday  the tenth of april  and was gone for the weekend .  i didn t see her from the tenth until after our translations were handed in .    i remember trent chuckling over the result .  he said we were twin souls indeed  for our translations were so remarkably similar that he could scarcely believe they were independently done .  he judged claire s the superior for reasons he outlined  but by a margin so small that i could scarcely consider it a defeat .  i swear i held no animosity against claire for winning .  i was proud of her .    i was human enough to regret one thing .  i had opened the sealed passage promptly at   a . m .  on wednesday  april    .  actually  i opened it five minutes after the hour in an exaggerated effort to lean over backward not to break the spirit of the agreement  just in case my watch was a little fast .    but then  i had not taken the full time .  we were allowed seven days  but i took only four .  it was a bit of vainglory on my pan  i think  but by that time  i had  in any case  grown tired of going over and over the passage and worrying endlessly over whether to say  of time s great sway  or  of time s mighty hest  .  so i just handed it in on the evening of sunday  the nineteenth .    later  of course  i thought that if i had spent three additional days improving my translation  it would have added just that extra bit that would have made me first .  after all  claire told me she had handed in her translation on the afternoon of monday  the twentieth  so she had nearly a whole extra day .  but then  the extra time might simply have resulted in damage through overmuch patching and repatching .    so i let it go and treated her to a late   evening champagne victory celebration  and we got along marvellously well .  after all  we had not seen each other for nearly two weeks and we improved the occasion as lovers will .    and then  not too long ago  i met an old friend who asked me how claire was .  i said   fine .  why .  you sound concerned .     he said   i met her in the columbia library last month  sweating over a latin dictionary and she seemed odd .  she snapped at me .      do you remember when it was .      in april .  i know it was a monday        monday  the twentieth   i said at once .   she had a paper due then and was making final corrections .  i imagine she didn t welcome distractions and she considered you one .   i laughed  rather jovially  at the thought .    but he said   no .  it wasn t then .  i remember that the day after my wife complained of a sore throat and we had to cancel a dinner engagement .  then i remember thinking of claire the day before and wondering if something was going around .  that dinner was on tuesday  the fourteenth .  i remember that well .  so i saw claire in the library on monday  the thirteenth .     i snapped   impossible .     he said  coolly   i don t see why it should be impossible .  that was when i saw her .     that ended that  but i clung to the hope that claire had been at work in the library on some other aspect of the latin competition on that day .  i sought her out .     claire .   i said .   did you start translating the passage on the thirteenth .     she looked at me in surprise .   of course .     i couldn t believe it .   not on the fifteenth .      why on the fifteenth .   she countered .   i wanted as early a start as possible .  i love you  darling  but i intended to win .     i turned on my heels and walked away .  that was a week ago and i haven t seen her or communicated with her since .  she called me once  but i simply hung up .    perhaps i could understand her eagerness causing her to break the rules  but what put her over the edge as far as i was concerned was her calm assumption that cheating was permissible   the implication that if i was fool enough to follow the rules  i deserved to lose .  she had no conscience in the matter  and no honor  and that meant she was not the woman i thought she was and i could not continue the relationship .    that s the story and  as i told you  there s no mystery about it .    there was a silence for several moments when soskind had finished  and then halsted said   you didn t put it to her directly  mr .  soskind .  you didn t say  why did you cheat  claire .      i didn t have to .  it was clear enough .    there was another silence .  soskind said  defensively   come on .  are you saying i should have overlooked the matter .  forgive and forget .    rubin said   you might have misheard .  perhaps the professor said       the rules were in writing   said soskind .   no mistake was possible .    avalon said  hesitantly   since the young woman was so suitable in all other respects and since you still seem to be in love with her      soskind shook his head violently .   that lack of honor cancels out everything .  if i am still in love  that s a problem that time will cure .    drake peered through a cloud of cigarette smoke .   if you had won instead of her  would you be making all this fuss .     i certainly hope so .  if i acted otherwise  i would be as bad as she .    drake shrugged .   you re a stiff   necked moralist  mr .  soskind .  the club s own stiff   necked moralist is henry .  what do you say  henry .    henry  who was standing thoughtfully at the sideboard  said   i believe there is a mystery to this .  the young woman seems to have acted out of character .    soskind said   i prefer to think i didn t understand her character until she finally revealed it .     if i may speak freely  mr .  soskind       go ahead   said soskind  with a bitter snort .   say what you want .  it can neither hurt nor help .    henry said   isn t it possible  sir  that miss claire was entirely in the right and that you have behaved hastily and unfairly .    soskind reddened .   that s ridiculous .     but was the fifteenth of april indeed the starting point .     i have already said that that was in writing .     but  mr .  soskind  you also told us that professor trent tended to be latinate in expression .  did he actually write  the fifteenth of april  or  april     .     well  of course  he   oh  i see what you mean .  no  he said  the ides of april   but what s the difference .     an enormous one   said henry .   everyone thinks of the ides of march in connection with the assassination of julius caesar  and everyone knows that is march    on our calendar .  it is only natural to suppose that the ides of every month falls on the fifteenth  but i checked the encyclopedia while you were completing your account and that is true only of march  may  july  and october .  in all the other months  including april  the ides fall on the thirteenth of the month .  since the ides of april falls on april thirteenth  miss claire began on that day  very correctly  and was surprised that you questioned the matter and seemed to expect her to delay two days for no reason .    halsted was at the encyclopedia .   henry s right  by god   he said .   soskind s eyes opened in a fixed glare .   and i started two days late .    henry said  softly   if professor trent had known you did not know when the ides of april was  i suspect you would have lost the competition by a somewhat wider margin .    soskind seemed to collapse inward in his chair .  he said  in a mutter   what do i do now .    henry said   my experience with matters of the heart  sir  is limited  but i believe you had better waste no more time .  leave now and try to see the young lady .  she may give you a chance to explain and what i know of such matters leads me to think you had better grovel .    grovel quite abjectly  sir .    afterword  eleanor sullivan was managing editor of eqmm all through the period during which i wrote the black widowers stories .  since fred dannay always worked from his westchester home  it was to eleanor that i brought my stories  and it was with her that i carried on an assiduous and platonic flirtation .   not that i wanted it to be platonic  you understand  but she insisted .    after fred had passed on  she took over as editor  and following the grand tradition that fred had established she kept eqmm moving onward rock   steady .  that includes  i am thankful to say  the occasional appearance of a black widower story  and of an occasional union club story  too .   this is the first black widower story she accepted in her capacity as editor  and i think that is suitable  for it is a romance .   very few of my black widower stories involve a murder or a violent crime of any kind  that s my personal distaste for violence  although that is not absolute as you will know if you have read my story  the woman in the bar   which appeared earlier in this collection  .  what s more very few  if any  of my stories involve romance  mainly because i started writing when i was very young  and before i had had any personal experience at all with romance  .  still  i would rather have romance than violence in a black widower story  and when i manage to do this i like the result  and so  in this case  did eleanor  who is very sweet and softhearted indeed .  the story appeared in the may      issue of eqmm .   neither brute nor human  the monthly dinner of the black widowers was well under way and emmanuel rubin  his fork uplifted  and waving threateningly in the air  temporarily ignored his rack of lamb and said   edgar allan poe was the first important practitioner of the modern detective story and of the modern science fiction story .  i ll give him that .     nice of you   murmured james drake  the host of the occasion  in a low aside .   rubin ignored him .   he lifted the horror story to new heights  too .  still  he had a morbid and unhealthy preoccupation with death .     not at all   said geoffrey avalon  in his deep voice  his thick eyebrows lowering into a frown .   poe was writing in the first half of the nineteenth century  and there was still virtually no protection against infectious disease at the time .  life was short and death was ever   present .  he wasn t being morbid  he was being realistic .    roger halsted said   absolutely .  read any fiction of the nineteenth century .  read dickens and the death of little nell  or harriet beecher stowe and the death of little eva .  children frequently died in fiction because they frequently died in real life .    rubin s eyes  magnified by his thick glasses  took on a stubborn gleam  and his sparse beard seemed to bristle .   it s not death in itself .  it s how you treat it .  you can deal with it as the doorway to heaven  and treat the dying person as a saint   see the death of beth in little women .  that can be sickeningly sentimental  but it is meant to be uplifting .  poe  on the other hand  dwells with an unholy glee on the elements of degradation and decay .  he makes death worse than it is and   come on  you all know very well what  morbid  is .    he returned to his lamb and attacked it with vigor .   thomas trumbull growled and said   certainly .   morbid  is talking about morbidity over what would otherwise be a pleasant dinner .     i don t see that it makes any difference whether poe was morbid or not   said mario gonzalo  who was neatly dissecting strips of meat off the ribs .   what counts is whether he was a good writer or not  and i suppose no one argues with the fact that he was good .    avalon said  judiciously   even good writers aren t good all the time .  james russell lowell described poe as  three fifths of him genius and two fifths sheer fudge   and i would say that was pretty accurate .    halsted said   my feeling is that a seminal writer has to accept some responsibility for his imitators .  there is something about poe that makes it absolutely necessary for his imitators to be awful .  consider h .  p .  lovecraft       no   said rubin  violently   we are not discussing lovecraft  we are talking about poe     and oddly enough  drake s guest  who  until now  had sat mute through the dinner  said suddenly in a loud  almost metallic voice   why are we talking about poe .    his name was jonathan dandle  short  plump around the middle  a round face that was now quite flushed  a large bald head with a fringe of white hair about the ears  and round gold   rimmed bifocals .  he looked in his early sixties .   he had startled the company into silence  and even henry  the imperturbable waiter who was the pride of the black widowers  allowed an expression of surprise to flit momentarily across his face .   drake cleared his throat and stubbed out his cigarette .   we talk about anything we please  jonathan .  poe is as good a subject as any  especially since manny rubin writes mysteries so that poe might be considered his patron saint .  right  manny .    dandle looked about the table from one to the other and some of the redness drained out of his face and left it a normal hue .  he lifted his hands in a kind of shrug .   my apologies  gentlemen .  it was not my intention to dictate the subject of the conversation .    he looked a trifle unhappy .   rubin nodded at dandle in slightly haughty forgiveness  and said   actually  if we re talking about the patron saint of mysteries  i could make a good argument in favor of conan doyle .  the mystery writers of america may hand out edgars  but the archetypal detective  as all of us know     and  with that  poe was abandoned .   dandle listened intently to the further course of the conversation  but said nothing else until henry had served the coffee  and gonzalo had produced a quick caricature which he showed the guest .   dandle regarded it solemnly  then smiled .   it is fortunate  mr .  gonzalo  that i have no great opinion of my beauty .  you make me look like the old   time actor guy kibbee .  perhaps you don t remember him .    gonzalo said   certainly  i remember him  and now that you point it out there is a resemblance .  a clever artist  with a few strokes of the pen  can bare essentials that are not necessarily obvious .     what a pity  mario   said rubin   that you don t find a clever artist who can teach you to do so .     and yet   said gonzalo easily   you have met any number of clever writers and none has been able to help you .    at which point  drake rattled his water glass with his spoon .   grilling time  gentlemen  so that manny and mario are requested to shut up .  jeff  will you do the honors .    geoffrey avalon stirred the melting ice in his half   consumed second scotch with his middle finger  and said   mr .  dandle  how do you justify your existence .    dandle said  thoughtfully   a good question .  since i had nothing to do with the initiation of my existence in this unfortunate world  i might justifiably deny any need to defend myself .  however  i have accepted my existence for over six decades now   after all  i might have killed myself easily enough   so i will defend .  how would it be if i told you i am making it easier for people to communicate with each other .  would that serve as grounds for justification .     it depends on what they communicate   said gonzalo .   now manny s attempts at      mario .   said avalon  sharply  and turned a frowning look in gonzalo s direction .  then  more gently  he said   i have the floor and i would rather that we not descend into anarchy this time .    in what way  mr .  dandle  do you make it easier for people to communicate .     i work in fiber optics  mr .  avalon  and communication by laser light through glass  rather than by electricity through copper  will make for cheaper and thinner cables that would nevertheless carry more messages .  i admit that not all the high technology in the world will of itself serve to improve the quality of those messages .     and yet  sir  if i may be allowed to interject a personal note  you do not yourself show much tendency to communicate  considering that communication is your business .  you have said hardly anything at all during cocktails or dinner .  is there a reason for that .    dandle looked about him  his face reddening again .  it was quite apparent that he flushed easily  and  like almost all people who do  that he was quite aware of it and seemed the more embarrassed   and to redden more   because of it .  he mumbled something .    i beg your pardon  sir   said avalon .   i didn t hear you .    drake  who sat next to his guest  and who looked rather uncomfortable himself  said   jonathan  saying  i ve nothing to say  is no answer .    dandle said   it s an answer if that s the answer i choose to give  jim .     no   said drake  peering at his guest out of his wrinkle   nested eyes .   that s not among the permitted choices  jonathan .  i explained the deal on this meeting .  you receive a good dinner and good company in exchange for substantive answers .  no secrets .  no evasions .  my own experience is that you ve always had plenty to say .    avalon said   let me continue  jim .    mr .  dandle  i will accept your answer that you have nothing to say  though i wish you would speak up so that others besides your immediate neighbor might hear you .  my next question is this  why is it that you have nothing to say on this occasion considering that  if we are to believe jim  such silence is not typical of you .    dandle spread out his hands and said loudly enough   is a man always accountable for his actions  mr .  avalon .  does he always know the origins of his moods .    avalon said   then let me ask you another question .  you did  on one occasion  interject a question into the general conversation .  you asked why we were talking about poe  and you did so quite forcibly .  i interpreted your remark as indicating that you were offended  perhaps outraged  by the discussion .  is that so .  and if it is so  why .    dandle shook his head .   no  no .  i just asked .    trumbull stood up and passed one hand over his tightly waved white hair .  he said  with exaggerated patience .   jim  as the host  you must make a decision .  we are clearly getting nothing out of our guest  and i think that  under the rules of the club  we might be forced to adjourn the meeting now .  in fact  i move you consider adjournment .    drake waved a hand at him petulantly .   take it easy  tom .    jonathan  you ve got to answer honestly .  nothing that is said here will ever be repeated outside these walls .  our waiter  henry  is a member of the club and he is as closemouthed as we are .  more so .  i know you well enough to know you haven t committed a crime  or are planning to commit one  but even so  we      you re quite wrong   said dandle  in a rather more high pitched voice than before .   i am trying to commit what i consider a crime .  i m certainly trying to be dishonest .    drake said   you .     with what i think is considerable justification  of course .     after that   said trumbull   if mr .  dandle does not care to elaborate  jim  then we can go no further .    there was silence .  trumbull remained standing .  drake looked at dandle and said   well  jonathan .    dandle said   you told me  jim  i would be grilled on the details of my profession .  i did not expect this sort of thing .     it can t be helped .  if you had been yourself  none of this would have come up .  what s wrong .    dandle looked helpless .  he clenched his fist  made as though he was going to bring it down on the table  stopped the motion  and said   it s my sister .     your crackp    began drake  and stopped suddenly .    my crackpot sister   said dandle .   she s dying .  cancer .    there was a sudden silence .    we ve known it for months   said dandle   and she may live for months more  but it does produce problems .    the silence continued .  finally  henry said   brandy  gentlemen .    avalon said  absently   just a small portion  henry .    what kind of problems  mr .  dandle .     her will .     you mean  all this is a matter of money .   said halsted  with rather more than a shade of disapproval in his voice .    not money at all   said dandle  lifting his eyebrows .   please understand  gentlemen  that my wife and i are well off .  we have a son and daughter  but both are grown and both are reasonably well off .  my sister has a house and some money that she inherited from our parents  but this is not something we lust for .  at least  not the money .  that she can dispose of as she wishes .  she can leave it to a farm for homeless cats  if she wishes .  it s the house .    he fell into momentary thought .   it was quite clear that she would never marry by the time my parents died .  it made sense to leave the family house to her  even though it was unnecessarily large for one person .  still  it s belonged to the family since it was built  i was born there  lived there till i married  i have a profound emotional attachment to it .  now my sister  rachel   dandle looked briefly at drake   being  as you say  a crackpot  is planning to leave it to a crackpot organization  and i don t want her to .  i d be willing to have it sold to someone respectable .  i d even be willing to have it torn down in a decent way for a decent purpose .  but i m damned if i m willing to let the   the cosmic order of theognostics infest it .     the what .   said gonzalo .   avalon said   the word comes from the greek and means  knowing god .     dandle said   what they really know are methods for extracting money from fools and nuts .    avalon said   i assume they are extracting money from your sister .     to some extent  yes  but not very much .  she is a shrewd woman  financially  and is quite compos mentis outside her obsession .  still  they re angling to get it all when she dies .  and they may .     what is her obsession  sir .     i believe it started with her reading of poe when she was young .  i think she read everything he had written  memorized it  just about  and absorbed the unhealthy morbidity that mr .  rubin mentioned .  and she read lovecraft  too  and grew inclined to believe in horrors from outer space  in elder intelligences  and so on .  she lectured me often enough on that stuff .  naturally  she became part of the ufo mania .     naturally   muttered rubin  with a look of distaste .    she became convinced that intelligent beings from outer space are actually on earth and have taken over earth s leaders  and much of the general population .  she thinks these aliens are themselves invisible  or can make themselves so  and can live within human beings parasitically .  it s all quire mad .     i suppose   said avalon   that if anyone disagrees with her  or tries to argue against her views  she considers it a sign the arguer has been taken over .     absolutely .  i early recognized the mistake of trying to oppose her .    halsted said   why haven t the aliens taken over everybody .  how does your sister explain that she herself hasn t been taken over .     i gather   said dandle   that the cosmic order of theognostics fights them with prayer and introspection and meditation and incantation and whatever the devil they claim to do  and they have taught her the same .  she has tried to teach me and i ve just kept silent and listened .  there s a lot of candle burning involved  and the recitation of whole pages of material that has no meaning whatever but i suppose she thinks it keeps me safe   so far .    drake said  through the smoke of his cigarette   when i referred to her as a crackpot  jonathan  i was thinking of the ufo stuff .  i didn t know about this alien intelligences bit .     it s not something i like to talk about  obviously   said dandle   and wouldn t be talking about now except under pressure .    avalon said   you said you were thinking of committing a crime .  surely  you re not thinking of mayhem against the theognostics .     nothing like that .  just a crime in my own eyes .  i ve been trying to cheat and deceive my sister  and i m not really proud of that .     would you be willing to explain that  sir .   asked avalon  stiffly .    well  since rachel was found to have cancer  things are at a crisis .  she won t submit to surgery because she is sure that under anesthesia she will be taken over .  she is suspicious of radiotherapy  too  since radiation is a weapon of those beings .  she is relying entirely on theognostic ritual  therefore  and you can imagine how effective that is .    rubin said   the most ridiculous methods can sometimes help if you believe firmly that they will .  the mind is a powerful instrument .     that may be   said dandle   but it isn t helping her .  she s going downhill  and  about a month ago  she began to talk of leaving the house and her money to the theognostics so that they could continue the great fight against the aliens .    so i started a plan of my own .   he reddened and stopped .   after a short pause  avalon said  gently   yes  mr .  dandle .     to put it bluntly   said dandle   i came to her as an enthusiastic convert .  i said she had convinced me and that i was heart and soul with her  that she could leave the money to the theognostics if she wished  but that she should leave the house to me and i would make it the center of the fight against the aliens .  i would allow the theognostics to use it freely but i merely wanted to keep tide to it in honor of our parents .  i was hypocritical and obsequious .     no doubt   said avalon   but did it work .  people who  like your sister  believe in invisible  untestable dangers would be suspicious of everything .     i m afraid so   said dandle .   she s of two minds about me .  she wants to believe  but  as you say  she is suspicious .  she hesitates to tell me what i m sure she believes to be the  higher mysteries   so to speak .  i asked for details about the form and attributes of the mysterious aliens  for instance  and she was closemouthed about it   as though she was not sure i was worthy of initiation .    trumbull said   maybe she doesn t know herself .    rubin said   she can easily invent anything she wishes and then come to believe it .  such things are very common .     last week she said something in a sort of singsong whisper and i thought i was making progress  but then there was nothing more .     what did she say .     well  they re hermaphroditic and are neither women nor men .  and they weren t earthly  of course .  they aren t human beings or animals .  and when they infest us they live on our spiritual nature rather than on our physical bodies  i gather  for she seized my arm  with a surprisingly strong grip  too  and whispered into my ear   they are worse than cannibals  and that is not surprising considering where they come from .      where do they come from .   asked gonzalo .    that s what i asked   said dandle   but she didn t say .  she said that once you achieve a certain enlightenment  you know where they come from  that that is the test of enlightenment .  it comes over you like a wave of revelation and gives you a certain power against them .  she knows  and the theognostics know  but they don t tell anyone because that s their test for the people who are strong against the aliens .  it doesn t really make sense  but if i were to try to say that to her  it would mean the end of my chance to save the house .  so i just said  earnestly  that i would meditate and try to gain the knowledge .   he looked about the table with a grim face .   i m supposed to be fasting .    she called me this morning .     things are coming to a crisis .   asked avalon .    yes .  that s why i ve been preoccupied this evening  and didn t say much .  i was of two minds whether to come here at all  but i didn t want to let jim drake down .     but what was it your sister said to you this morning .     she says she wants to make a decision about her will .  she feels herself weakening and she knows that she must become one with the great divine   which is the theognostic term for god  apparently   and she wants to make sure she continues the fight from beyond the grave .  she can t let me have the house unless she is certain i won t bar the theognostics from it .  and  of course  barring them is exactly what i intend to do so i am trying to flimflam her .    it s not exactly admirable of me .    trumbull said  loudly  we re on your side  mr .  dandle .  you re fighting a group of pernicious and vicious flimflam operators  and if counter   flimflam is required  so be it .     thank you   said dandle   but i don t see that i will win out .  she wants me to visit her tomorrow at noon and tell her where the aliens come from .  if i can t  then she can t rely on me to remain strong against them and the theognostics will get the house .  and  of course  i can t tell her where the aliens come from .  they re from outer space  i m sure .  that would fit in with her ufo madness  for they undoubtedly reached earth by ufo .  but where in outer space .    there was a short silence  then gonzalo said   she never gave you any hints .    dandle shook his head .   only the remark about their being worse than cannibals and that that somehow was appropriate  considering where they come from .  but what does that mean .     nothing else .     not that i can think of .  if she did  it went right past me .    so tomorrow i lose the house .    avalon said   you know  sir  that you can contest the will .     no  not really   said dandle .   you were introduced to me as a lawyer       a patent lawyer   said avalon .   i am not knowledgeable on the intricacies of testamentary litigation .     well  on the one hand  there is a strong tendency to allow a testator to do as he wishes with his own property .  it isn t easy to disallow a religious organization in favor of a relative who is already well off .  i doubt that i can prove undue influence  nor would i care to try to make my sister seem to have been of unsound mind  if only out of family considerations .  then  even if i really thought i could win  it would be a long   drawn   out fight in which the legal fees would come to considerably more than i would care to pay .    so i m going to lose the house .    avalon said   we might all of us think about this a bit .    a flicker of hope seemed to enliven dandle .   are any of you astronomers .     not professionally   said halsted   but we have the usual superficial knowledge of the field that any intelligent and reasonably well   read individuals would have .     exactly   said rubin   and that means i can make a suggestion .  we re looking for something in outer space that has cannibalistic associations .  i ve read articles recently that in clusters of galaxies  there are occasional collisions and that  in such collisions  the larger member gains stars at the expense of the smaller one .  the result is that in some clusters  there is one galaxy that is larger than any of the others  having cannibalized them .    halsted nodded vigorously .   you are right  manny .  i ve read about it  too .  there s one outsize galaxy that has five small bright regions within itself that resemble galactic centers .  the thought is that it swallowed five small galaxies whole .    gonzalo said   just for the record   what are galaxies .    avalon said   large conglomerations of stars  mario .  our own milky way galaxy has a couple of hundred billion stars in it .    gonzalo said   well  then  has that cannibal galaxy   the one that swallowed up its five little sisters   got a name .    the black widowers stared at each other .  finally  halsted said   it may  but if it does  it s probably not an ordinary name .  just a particular catalog number like ngc        or something like that .    gonzalo said   i don t think miss dandle would be impressed by that .    dandle said   i don t think so  either .  i m grateful to you for your attempts to help  but if galactic cannibalization is a common phenomenon  which cannibal would be the correct one .  and i m sure my sister knows nothing about modern sophistications in astronomy  anyway .  nor would the theognostics .  where would they hear of this phenomenon .    avalon said   does your sister read anything at all in the field of astronomy  mr .  dandle .    dandle said  thoughtfully .   she s certainly read everything there is on ufos and some astronomy   not necessarily correct   is bound to creep in there .  she reads up on astrology  of course  which means additional possibly distorted astronomy .  and i have seen astronomy popularizations in the house .  i haven t actually seen her reading them but i wouldn t be surprised if she did .     is she well   read otherwise  sir .     yes .  all of poe as i said  and lovecraft  and some science fiction .  a great deal of general nineteenth   century fiction  i should say  and  of course  she reads the newspapers and a number of magazines thoroughly  if only to find evidence of how far the aliens have taken over the world .  i ve got to explain to you that there s nothing wrong with her intelligence  outside her   her crackpottery .     in that case   said avalon  with a certain somber satisfaction   i am quite sure i have the answer .   he paused and cast a glance in the direction of the waiter  who was standing at the sideboard  listening with polite but silent attention .    henry   said avalon   i think that on this occasion we will not need your help .     yes  mr .  avalon   said henry  quietly .   avalon cleared his throat .   you see  by far the best   known portion of the universe  even to astronomers  and certainly to the general public  are the planets of our own solar system .  this is especially true for people like miss dandle  who are interested in astrology and similar aberrations .    and of the planets  the one which in recent years has received the most attention and which is  in any case  the most spectacular  is the planet saturn  with its rings and satellites .  the voyager probes have taken close   up photographs of the saturnian system and these have made all the newspapers and magazines .  miss dandle cannot have missed them .    dandle said   i m sure she has not .  but what then .     saturn   said avalon   is named for an early roman god of agriculture whom the romans  with scant justice  equated with the greek god kronos .  kronos with his brothers and sisters made up the group of gods called the titans  and they were the children of ouranos and gaea  the god of the sky and the goddess of the earth  respectively .  in a series of most unpleasant myths  the greeks describe kronos as castrating his father  uranus  and taking over the rule of the universe .    since the fates had decreed that kronos would  in turn  be replaced as ruler by his own son  the new lord of the universe took to devouring each child as it was born .  his wife  rhea  managed to save one son by offering kronos a rock wrapped in the baby s swaddling clothes .  the rather stupid kronos swallowed that without noticing the substitution .  the son  still uneaten  was then hidden in crete  and raised to maturity in secret .  eventually  the son  who was named zeus  jupiter  to the romans   warred upon the titans  defeated them  released his siblings  who were still alive within kronos  and took over the universe .  all this miss dandle  in her reading  might very well have come across .    now  then  saturn was clearly a cannibal .  if there are degrees in such things  devouring one s own children is surely worse than fattening on strangers  so he might well be viewed as worse than an ordinary cannibal .  miss dandle s statement that the aliens were worse than cannibals and that that was not surprising in view of where they came from would make sense if they came from saturn .    and avalon smiled at dandle with self   conscious triumph .   dandle said   you think  then  i had better tell my sister the alien beings come from saturn .     i can t say the matter is certain   said avalon .   she may  after all  suppose them to have come from some entirely fictitious planet such as zorkel  the fifth planet of the star xanadu  in the galaxy of yaanek .  if  however  she has a real astronomical body in mind  then i am virtually certain that it is saturn .  it must be .     it sounds good to me   said gonzalo .    it makes sense   admitted rubin  looking distressed at having to say so .   halsted said   it s worth a try .    trumbull said   i can t think of anything better .    drake said   it seems unanimous .  i d take the chance  jonathan .    dandle began   well  since i can t think of anything better  either      gonzalo interrupted .   wait  henry hasn t said anything .  henry  what do you think .    dandle looked up in astonishment at having the waiter referred to .   when henry said   may i ask mr .  dandle if he shared in his sister s enthusiasm for poe .   dandle looked more astonished still .   drake said   please answer  jonathan .  henry is one of us .    jonathan said   no  definitely not .  i know  the raven   no one can avoid knowing that  but i know nothing else .  i stay away from him .     in that case   said henry   i fear that mr .  avalon s suggestion  although most ingenious  is not the correct answer .    avalon looked offended .   indeed  henry .  have you anything better to offer .    henry said   consider  sir  that miss dandle was a great devotee of poe  and that in describing the aliens she said that they were neither female nor male  animal nor human .     well .     well  mr .  avalon  i  unlike mr .  dandle but like his sister  am an admirer of poe  though more so of his poetry than of his prose .  among my favorite poems by poe is  the bells   in the fourth part of which he describes the tolling of the funeral bells .  there you have his morbid preoccupation with death  you see  something that is bound to follow his earlier descriptions of sleigh bells  wedding bells  and fire   alarm bells .     aha   said rubin .    yes  mr .  rubin   said henry   i suspect you already see what i mean .  part of the description of the funeral bells is   if i may quote    and the people   ah  the people   they that dwell up in the steeple  all alone  and who  tolling  tolling  tolling  in that muffled monotone  feel a glory in so rolling on the human heart a stone   they are neither man nor woman   they are neither brute nor human      henry paused  then said   miss dandle was undoubtedly quoting those last two lines  i think .  you stated that she said them in singsong fashion  mr .  dandle  but not being a poe enthusiast  you did not recognize them .    avalon said   but even so   how does that help .   henry said   it is the next line that counts  as poe identifies the people who toll the funeral bells .    and he and rubin quoted simultaneously    they are ghouls .     henry said   ghouls are creatures of middle eastern legend who infest graveyards and feed on dead bodies .  that might well strike miss dandle  or anyone  as worse than ordinary cannibalism  just as vultures are worse than hawks in the general estimation .    avalon said   i grant that  but i still don t see the point .     nor i   said trumbull .   henry said   there is a constellation in the sky named perseus  named for the greek hero who cut off the head of medusa  a creature so dreadful in appearance that anyone looking at it turned to stone .  the constellation is pictured as the hero holding the head of medusa and that head is marked by a second   magnitude star  beta persei .  i looked it up in the columbia encyclopedia during the discussion  to be sure of that fact .    because of its position in the constellation  beta persei is sometimes called the demon star  in consequence .  the arabs  who adopted the greek view of the sky  named it al ghul  meaning  the ghoul   their version of something as horrible as medusa  and our english version of that arabic name is  algol .   that is now the common name of the star .    since miss dandle quoted that poem to define the aliens  she meant that they were ghouls  and therefore worse than cannibals  and she must have meant that it was not surprising that they were since they came from the star known as  the ghoul    a fact she could surely have picked up from some book on popular astronomy  as i did  originally .  i would suggest  then  mr .  dandle  that you say  when you see your sister tomorrow  that the aliens come from algol .    dandle smiled brightly for the first time that evening and broke into applause .   henry  i will .  that should be the answer  and i am sure it is .    henry said  gravely   nothing may be completely sure in this case  sir  but it is worth the gamble .    afterword  eleanor worried about this story a bit because it seemed to her  and to me  too  that it wasn t quite admirable of jonathan dandle to want to deceive his sister  or of the black widowers to help him do so .  still i felt the cause was good enough to warrant the act  and i managed to convince eleanor of it  too .   when it comes to that  dandle himself worried about it  and i had nothing to do with that  either .  my characters always manage to have a life of their own and they generally do things without my consciously willing them to do so .   anyway  i have my own list of dislikes and disapprovals  and high on it are nonrational cults of any kind  whether they cover themselves with a cloak of pseudoreligiosity or not .  mind you  this does not extend to honest and rational religious feeling  as i showed in my story  the one and only east   which appeared in an earlier black widowers collection .   consequently  if i can do one of them in the eye   even if only fictionally   i don t hesitate .   the story appeared in the april      issue of eqmm .   the redhead  mario gonzalo  host of that evening s meeting of the black widowers  had evidently decided to introduce his guest with eclat .  at least he rattled his glass with a spoon and  when all had broken off their preprandial conversations and looked up from their cocktails  mario made his introduction .  he had even waited for thomas trumbull s as   usual late arrival before doing so .    gentlemen   he said   this is my guest  john anderssen   that s an s   s   e   n at the end .  you can discover anything you want about him in this evening s grilling .  one thing  however  i must tell you now because i know that this bunch of asexual loudmouths will never discover it on their own .  john has a wife who is  absolutely  the most gorgeous specimen of femininity the world has ever seen .  and i say this as an artist with an artist s eye .    anderssen reddened and looked uncomfortable .  he was a blond young man  perhaps thirty  with a small mustache and a fair complexion .  he was about five   ten in height and had rather chiseled features that came together to form a handsome face .   geoffrey avalon  looking down from his stiff   backed seventy   four inches  said   i must congratulate you  mr .  anderssen  although you need not take seriously mario s characterization of ourselves as asexual .  i m sure that each of us is quite capable of appreciating a beautiful woman .  i  myself  although i might be considered to be past the first flush of hot   blooded youth  can      trumbull said   spare us  jeff  spare us .  if you are going to give an embarrassing account of your prowess  you are better off being interrupted .  from my point of view  the next best thing to having the young woman in our midst   if our customs allowed it   would be to see her photograph .  i imagine  mr .  anderssen  you carry a photo of your fair wife in your wallet .  would you consent to let us look at it .     no   said anderssen  emphatically .  then  blushing furiously  he said   i don t mean you can t look at it .  i mean i don t have a photograph of her with me .  i m sorry .   but he said it challengingly  and was clearly not sorry .   gonzalo  unabashed  said   well  that s your loss  my friends .  you should see her hair .  it s gloriously red  a live red that just about glows in the dark .  and natural  totally natural   and no freckles .     well   said anderssen in half a mutter   she stays out of the sun .    her hair is her best feature .    emmanuel rubin  who had been standing on the outskirts  looking rather dour  said in a low voice   and temper to match  i suppose .    anderssen turned to him  and said  with an edge of bitterness   she has a temper .   he did not elaborate .   rubin said   i don t suppose there s a more durable myth than the one that redheads are hot   tempered .  the redness of the hair is that of fire  and the principles of sympathetic magic lead people to suppose that the personality should march the hair .    james drake  who shared  with avalon  the dubious privilege of being the oldest of the widowers  sighed reminiscently  and said   i ve known some very hot   blooded redheads .     sure you have   said rubin .   so has everyone .  it s a self   fulfilling assumption .  redheaded children  especially girls  are forgiven for being nasty and ill   behaved .  parents sigh fatuously and mutter that it goes with the hair  and the one with red hair in the family explains how great   uncle joe would mop up the floor with anyone in the barroom who said anything that was less than a grovelling compliment .  boys usually grow up and have the stuffing knocked out of them by non   redheaded peers and that teaches them manners  but girls don t .  and  if they re beautiful besides  they grow up knowing they can indulge their impoliteness to the hilt .  an occasional judicious kick in the fanny would do them worlds of good .    rubin carefully did not look at anderssen in the course of his comment and anderssen said nothing at all .   henry  the indispensable waiter at all the black widower functions  said quietly   gentlemen  you may be seated .    the chef at the milano had clearly decided to be russian for the evening  and an excellent hot borscht was followed by an even more delightful beef stroganoff on a bed of rice .  rubin  who usually endured the food with an expression of stoic disapproval  on principle  allowed a smile to play over his sparsely bearded face on this occasion  and helped himself lavishly to the dark pumpernickel .   as for roger halsted  whose affection for a good meal was legendary  he quietly negotiated a second helping with henry .   the guest  john anderssen  ate heartily  and participated eagerly in the conversation which  through a logical association  perhaps  dealt largely with the shooting down of the korean jetliner by the soviets .  anderssen pointed out that the ship had been widely referred to as  flight       which was the number on the fuselage  during the first couple of weeks .  then someone must have remembered that     was the code number of james bond  so when the soviets insisted the liner had been a spy plane  it became  flight    in the news media  and the      disappeared as though it had never been .   he also maintained vigorously that the jetliner  having gone off course almost immediately after leaving alaska  should not have been left uninformed of the fact .  he was shouting  red   faced  that failure to do so  when the soviet union was known to be on the hair trigger with respect to american reconnaissance planes and to reagan s  evil empire  rhetoric  was indefensible .   he paid no attention  in fact  to his dessert  a honey   drenched baklava  left his coffee half   finished  and totally ignored henry s soft request that he make his wishes known with respect to the brandy .   he was actually pounding the table when gonzalo rattled his spoon against his water glass .  avalon was forced to raise his baritone voice to a commanding   mr .  anderssen  if you please     anderssen subsided  looking vaguely confused  as though he were  with difficulty  remembering where he was .   gonzalo said   it s time for the grilling  and jeff  since you seem to have the commanding presence needed in case john  here  gets excited  suppose you do the honors .    avalon cleared his throat  gazed at anderssen solemnly for a few moments  then said   mr .  anderssen  how do you justify your existence .    anderssen said   what .     you exist  sir .  why .     oh   said anderssen  still collecting himself .   then  in a low harsh voice  he said   to expiate my sins in an earlier existence  i should think .    drake  who was at the moment accepting a refresher from henry  muttered   so are we all .  don t you think so  henry .    and henry s sixtyish unlined face remained expressionless as he said  very softly   a black widowers banquet is surely a reward for virtue rather than an expiation for sins .    drake lifted his glass   a palpable hit  henry .    trumbull growled   let s cut out the private conversations .    avalon raised his hand .   gentlemen .  as you all know  i do not entirely approve of our custom of grilling a guest in the hope of searching out problems that might interest us .  nevertheless  i wish to call your attention to a peculiar phenomenon .  we have here a young man   young  certainly  by the standards of old mustaches such as ourselves   well   proportioned  of excellent appearance  seeming to exude good health and an air of success in life  though we have not yet ascertained what the nature of his work is      he s in good health and is doing well at his work   put in gonzalo .    i am glad to hear it   said avalon  gravely .   in addition  he is married to a young and beautiful woman  so that one can t help but wonder why he should feel life to be such a burden as to lead him to believe that he exists only in order to expiate past sins .  consider  too  that during the meal just concluded  mr .  anderssen was animated and vivacious  not in the least abashed by our older and wiser heads .  i believe he shouted down even manny  who is not one to be shouted down with impunity       anderssen was making a good point   said rubin  indignantly .    i think he was  too   said avalon   but what i wish to stress is that he is voluble  articulate  and not backward at expressing his views .  yet during the cocktail period  when the conversation dealt with his wife  he seemed to speak most reluctantly .  from this  i infer that the source of mr .  anderssen s unhappiness may be mrs .  anderssen .    is that so  mr .  anderssen .    anderssen seemed stricken and remained silent .   gonzalo said   john  i explained the terms .  you must answer .    anderssen said   i m not sure how to answer .    avalon said   let me be indirect .  after all  sir  there is no intention to humiliate you .  and please be aware that nothing said in this room is ever repeated by any of us elsewhere .  that includes our esteemed waiter  henry .  please feel that you can speak freely .  mr .  anderssen  how long have you been married .     two years .  actually  closer to two and a half .     any children  sir .     not yet .  we hope to have some one day .     for that hope to exist  the marriage must not be foundering .  i take it you are not contemplating divorce .     certainly not .     i take it then that you love your wife .     yes .  and before you ask  i am quite satisfied she loves me .     there is  of course  a certain problem in being married to a beautiful woman   said avalon .   men will flock about beauty .  are you plagued by jealousy  sir .     no   said anderssen .   i ve no cause for it .  helen   that s my wife   has no great interest in men      ah   said halsted  as though a great light had dawned .    except for myself   said anderssen  indignantly .   she s not in the least bit asexual .  besides   he went on   mario exaggerates .  she does have this luxuriant head of remarkable red hair  but aside from that she is not really spectacular .  her looks  i would say  are average   though i must rely now on your assurance that all said here is confidential .  i would not want that assessment to be repeated .  her figure is good  and i find her beautiful  but there are no men caught helplessly in her toils  and i am not plagued by jealousy .     what about her temper .   put in drake  suddenly .   that s been mentioned and you ve admitted she had one .  i presume there s lots of fighting and dish throwing .     some fights  sure   said anderssen   but no more than is par for the course .  and no dish throwing .  as mr .  avalon has pointed out  i m articulate  and so is she  and we re both pretty good at shouting  but after we work off our steam  we can be just as good at kissing and hugging .     then am i to take it  sir  that your wife is not the source of your troubles .   said avalon .   anderssen fell silent again .    i must ask you to answer  mr .  anderssen   said avalon .   anderssen said   she is the problem .  just now  anyway .  but it s too silly to talk about .    rubin sat up at that and said   on the contrary .  till now  i felt that jeff was just wasting our time over the kind of domestic irritations that we attend these dinners  in part  to escape .  but if there s something silly involved  then we want to hear it .     if you must know   said anderssen .   helen says she s a witch .     oh .   said rubin .   has she always claimed this  or just recently .     always .  we joke about it .  she would say she put me under enchantment to get me to marry her  and that she would cast spells and get me a promotion or a raise .  sometimes  when she is furious  she ll say   well  don t blame me if you blotch out in pimples just because you re going to be that stupid and mean .   that sort of thing .    rubin said   it sounds harmless to me .  she probably did put you under enchantment .  you fell in love with her and any woman of reasonable intelligence and looks can make a young man fall in love with her if she works hard enough being charming .  you can call that enchantment if you wish .     but i do get the promotions and raises .     surely that could be because you deserve them .  do you get the pimples  too .    anderssen smiled .   well  i managed to trip and sprain an ankle and  of course  she said she had changed the spell because she didn t want to spoil my pretty face .    halsted laughed and said   you don t really act disturbed at this  mr .  anderssen .  after all  this sort of playacting by a young and vivacious woman isn t unusual .  personally  i find it charming .  why don t you .    anderssen said   because she pulled it on me once too often .  she did something that i can t understand .   he threw himself back in his chair and stared somberly at the table in front of him .   trumbull bent to one side as though to look into anderssen s eyes and said   you mean you think she really is a witch .     i don t know what to think .  i just can t explain what she did .    avalon said  forcibly   mr .  anderssen  i must ask you to explain just what it was that mrs .  anderssen did .  would you do that  sir .     well   said anderssen   maybe i should .  if i talk about it  maybe i can forget it .  but i don t think so .    he brooded a bit and the widowers waited patiently .   finally  he said   it was just about a month ago   the sixteenth .  we were going out for dinner  just the two of us .  we do that once in a while  and we like to try new places .  we were trying a new place this time  the door to which was reached by passing through the lobby of a small midtown hotel .  it was an unpretentious restaurant  but we had had good reports of it .  the trouble started in the lobby .    i don t remember exactly what set it off .  in fact  i don t even remember what it was all about  really .  what happened afterward pushed it our of my mind .  what it amounted to was that we had a   a   disagreement .  in less than a minute  we would have been inside the restaurant and studying the menu  and instead  we were standing to one side of the lobby  under a plastic potted plant of some sort .  i can remember the sharply pointed leaves touching my hand disagreeably when i waved it to make a point .  the registration desk was across the way  between the door to the restaurant and the door to the street .  the scene is still painted in my mind .    helen was saying   if that s your attitude  we don t have to have dinner together .     i swear to all of you  i don t remember what my attitude was  but we re both of us highly vocal  and we were both of us furious  i admit .  the whole thing was highly embarrassing .  it was one of those times when you and someone else   usually your wife or girlfriend  i suppose   are shouting at each other in whispers .  the words are being squeezed out between clenched teeth  and every once in a while one of you says   for heaven s sake  people are staring   and the other says   then shut up and listen to reason   and the first one says   you re the one who isn t listening   and it just keeps on and on .    anderssen shook his head at the memory .   it was the most intense argument we had ever had up to that time  or since  and yet i can t remember what it was about .  unbelievable .    then she suddenly said   well  then  i m going home .  good   bye .   i said   don t you dare humiliate me by leaving me in public .   and she said   you can t stop me .   and i said   don t tempt me  or i will stop you .   and she said   just try   and dashed into the restaurant .    that caught me by surprise .  i had thought she would try to get past me to the door to the street   and i was ready to seize her wrist and hang on .  it would have been better to let her go than to make a scene  i suppose  but i was past reason .  in any case  she fooled me  and made a dash for the restaurant .    i was stunned for a moment   two moments   and then i hurried in after her .  i may have been twenty seconds behind her .    let me describe the restaurant .  it was not a large one  and it had the deliberate decor of a living room .  in fact  the restaurant is called the living room .    are any of you acquainted with it .    there was a blank murmur about the table  but henry  who had cleared the dishes with his usual unobtrusive efficiency and was standing by the sideboard  said   yes  sir .  it is  as you say  a small but well   run restaurant .     it had about a dozen tables   anderssen proceeded   the largest of which would hold six .  there were windows with drapes  but not real windows .  they had city views painted on them .  there was a fireplace in the wall opposite the entrance door with artificial logs in it  and a couch facing it .  the couch was real and  i suppose  could be used by people who were waiting for the rest of their parry to arrive .  at least  there was one man sitting on the left end of the couch .  he had his back to me  and was reading a magazine that he held rather high and close to his head as though he were nearsighted .  i judged from its typography that it was time      avalon put in suddenly   you seem to be a good observer and you are going into minutiae .  is this important that you ve just told us .     no   said anderssen   i suppose not  but i am trying to impress on you that i was not hysterical and that i was entirely myself and saw everything there was to see quite clearly .  when i came in  about half the tables were taken  with two to four people at each .  there may have been fifteen to twenty people present .  there were no waitresses on the scene at the moment and the cashier was stationed just outside the restaurant  to one side of the door in a rather unobtrusive recess  so it really did look like a living room .    drake stubbed out his cigarette .   it sounds like an idyllic place .  what was present there that disturbed you .     nothing was present that disturbed me .  that s the point .  it was what was absent there .  helen wasn t there .  look  she had gone in .  i saw her go in .  i am not mistaken .  there was no other door on that side of the lobby .  there was no crowd within which she might have been lost to view for a moment .  my vision was entirely unobstructed and she went in and did not come out .  i followed in her tracks and entered  at the most  twenty seconds after her   maybe less  but not more .  and she was not there .  i could tell that at a glance .    trumbull growled .   you can t tell anything at a glance .  a glance will fool you .     not in this case   said anderssen .   mario mentioned helen s hair .  there s just nothing like it .  at least i ve seen nothing like it .  there may have been  at most  ten women there and not one had red hair .  even if one of them had been a redhead  i doubt she would have been a redhead in quite the fluorescent and lavishly spectacular way that helen was .  take my word for it .  i looked right   left  and there was no helen .  she had disappeared .     gone out to the street by another entrance  i suppose   said halsted .   anderssen shook his head .   there was no entrance to the street .  i checked with the cashier afterward  and with the fellow at the registration desk .  i ve gone back there since to order lunch and managed to look over the place .  there isn t any entrance to the outside .  what s more  the windows are fakes and they re solid something   or   other .  they don t open .  there are ventilation ducts  of course  but they re not big enough for a rabbit to crawl through .    avalon said   even though the windows are fake  you mentioned drapes .  she might have been standing behind one of them .     no   said anderssen   the drapes hug the wall .  there would have been an obvious bump if she were behind one .  what s more  they only came down to the bottom of the window and there are two feet of bare wall beneath them .  she would have been visible to mid   thigh if she were standing behind one .     what about the ladies  room .   inquired rubin .   you know  so strong is the taboo against violating the one   sex nature of these things  we tend to forget the one we don t use is even there .     well  i didn t   said anderssen  with clear exasperation .   i looked around for it  didn t see any indication  and when i asked later  it turned out that both rest rooms were in the lobby .  a waitress did show up while i was looking around and i said to her in  i suppose  a rather distracted voice   did a redheaded woman just come in here .     the waitress looked at me in a rather alarmed way  and mumbled   i didn t see anyone   and hastened to deliver her tray load to one of the tables .    i hesitated because i was conscious of my embarrassing position  but i saw no way out .  i raised my voice and said   has anyone here seen a redheaded woman come in just a moment ago .   there was dead silence .  everyone looked up at me  staring stupidly .  even the man on the couch turned his head to look at me and he shook his head at me in a clear negative .  the others didn t even do that much  but their vacant stares were clear enough indication that they hadn t seen her .    then it occurred to me that the waitress must have emerged from the kitchen .  for a minute  i was sure that helen was hiding there and i felt triumphant .  regardless of the fact that my actions might induce some of the staff to call hotel security  or the police  even  i marched firmly through a pair of swinging doors into the kitchen .  there was the chef there  a couple of assistants  and another waitress .  no helen .  there was one small further door which might have been a private lavatory for the kitchen staff  and i had gone too far to back down .  i walked over and flung the door open .  it was a lavatory  and it was empty .  by then the chef and his assistants were shouting at me  and i said   sorry   and left quickly .  i didn t see any closets there large enough to hold a human being .    i stepped back into the restaurant .  everyone was still looking at me  and i could do nothing but return to the lobby .  it was as though the instant helen had passed through the doorway into the restaurant  she had vanished .    anderssen sat back  spread his hands in blank despair .   just vanished .    drake said   what did you do .    anderssen said   i went out and talked to the cashier .  she had been away from her station for a few moments and she hadn t even seen me go in  let alone helen .  she told me about the rest rooms and that there was no exit to the street .    then i went to talk to the room clerk  which demoralized me further .  he was busy and i had to wait .  i wanted to yell   this is a matter of life and death   but i was beginning to think i would be carried off to an asylum if i didn t behave in a totally proper way .  and when i spoke to him  the room clerk turned out to be a total zero  though what could i really have expected from him .     and then what did you do .   asked drake .    i waited in the lobby for about half an hour .  i thought helen might show up again  that she had been playing some practical joke and that she would return .  well  no helen .  i could only spend my time fantasizing  as i waited  of calling the police  of hiring a private detective  of personally scouring the city  but you know   what do i tell the police .  that my wife has been missing for an hour .  that my wife vanished under my eyes .  and i don t know any private detectives .  for that matter  i don t know how to scour a city .  so  after the most miserable half hour of my whole life  i did the only thing there was to do .  i hailed a taxi and went home .    avalon said  solemnly   i trust  mr .  anderssen  that you are not going to tell us your wife has been missing ever since .    gonzalo said   she can t be  jeff .  i saw her two days ago .    anderssen said   she was waiting for me when i got home .  for a minute  a wave of intense thankfulness swept over me .  it had been a terrible taxi ride .  all i could think of was that she would have to be missing twenty   four hours before i could call the police and how would i live through the twenty   four hours .  and what would the police be able to do .    so i just grabbed her and held on to her .  i was on the point of weeping  i was so glad to see her .  and then  of course  i pushed her away and said   where the hell have you been .     she said  coolly   i told you i was going home .     i said   but you ran into the restaurant .     she said   and then i went home .  you don t suppose i needed a broomstick  do you .  that s quite old   fashioned .  i just   pft .    and i was home .   she made a sweeping motion of her right hand .    i was furious .  i had gotten completely over my relief .  i said   do you know what you ve put me through .  can you imagine how i felt .  i rushed in like a damn fool and tried to find you and then i just stood around .  i almost went to the police .     she grew calmer and icier and said   well  it serves you right for what you did .  besides  i told you i was going home .  there was no need for you to do anything at all but go home  too .  here i am .  just because you refuse to believe i have the power is no reason for you to begin scolding me  when i did exactly what i told you i would do .     i said   come on  now .  you didn t pft here .  where were you in the restaurant .  how did you get here .     i could get no answer from her on that .  nor have i been able to since .  it s ruining my life .  i resent her having put me through an hour of hell .  i resent her making a fool of me .    avalon said   is the marriage breaking up as a result .  surely  you need not allow one incident       no  it s not breaking up .  in fact  she s been sweet as apple pie ever since that evening .  she hasn t pulled a single witch trick  but it bothers the dickens out of me .  i brood about it .  i dream about it .  it s given her a kind of   superiority     rubin said   she s got the upper hand now  you mean .     yes   said anderssen  violently .   she s made a fool of me and gotten away with it .  i know she s not a witch .  i know there are no such things as witches .  but i don t know how she did it  and i ve got this sneaking suspicion she s liable to do it again  and it keeps me   it keeps me   under .    anderssen then shook his head and said  in a more composed way   it s such a silly thing  but it s poisoning my life .    again there was silence about the table  and then avalon said   mr .  anderssen  we of the black widowers are firm disbelievers in the supernatural .  are you telling us the truth about the incident .    anderssen said  fiercely   i assure you i have told you the truth .  if you have a bible here  i ll swear on it .  or  which is better as far as i am concerned  i ll give you my word as an honest man that everything i ve told you is as completely true as my memory and my human fallibility will allow .    avalon nodded .   i accept your word without reservation .    gonzalo said  in an aggrieved way   you might have told me  john .  as i said  i saw helen two days ago  and nothing seemed wrong to me .  i had no idea   maybe it s not too late for us to help .     how .   said anderssen .   how could you help .    gonzalo said   we might discuss the matter .  some of us may have some ideas .    rubin said   i have one  and  i think  a very logical one .  i begin by agreeing with anderssen and everyone else here that there is no witchcraft and that  therefore  mrs .  anderssen is no witch .  i think she went into the restaurant and somehow managed to evade her husband s eyes .  then when he was busy in the kitchen or at the registration desk  she left the restaurant and the hotel quickly  took a taxi  went home  and then waited for him .  now she won t admit what it is she has done in order to stay one   up in this needless marriage combat .  my own feeling is that a marriage is useless if       never mind the homilies   said anderssen  the shortness of his temper fuse showing .   of course that s what happened .  i don t need you to explain it to me .  but you skip over the hard part .  you say she went into the restaurant and  somehow managed to evade her husband s eyes .   would you please tell me just how she managed that trick .     very well   said rubin .   i will .  you came in  looked right and left  and were at once certain she wasn t there .  why .  because you were looking for an unmistakable redhead .    have you ever heard of a wig  mr .  anderssen .     a wig .  you mean she put on a wig .     why not .  if she appeared to have brown hair  your eyes would pass right over her .  in fact  i suspect that her red hair is so much the most important thing you see in her that if she were wearing a brown wig and had taken a seat at one of the tables  you could have been staring right at her face without recognizing it .    anderssen said   i insist i would have recognized her even so  but that point is of no importance .  the important thing is that helen has never owned a wig .  for her to use one is unthinkable .  she is as aware of her red hair as everyone else is  and she is vain about it  and wouldn t dream of hiding it .  such vanity is natural .  i m sure everyone here is vain about his intelligence .    rubin said   i grant you .  intelligence is something to be vain about .  yet  if it served some purpose that seemed important to me  i would pretend to be an idiot for a few minutes  or even considerably longer .  i think your wife would have been willing to slip on a brown wig just long enough to escape your eye .  vanity is never an absolute in anyone who isn t an outright fool .    anderssen said   i know her better than you do  and i say she wouldn t wear a wig .  besides  i told you this was a month ago .  it was the height of summer and it was a hot evening .  all helen was wearing was a summer dress with only summer underwear beneath  and she had a light shawl to put on against the air conditioning .  she was holding a small pocketbook  just large enough to contain some money and her makeup .  there was nowhere she could have hidden a wig .  she had no wig with her .  why should she have brought one with her  anyway .  i can t and won t believe that she was deliberately planning to have a fight  and to trick me in this way in order to achieve a long   term upper hand .  she s a creature of impulse  i tell you  and is incapable of making plans of that kind .  i know her .    trumbull said   conceding her vanity and impulsiveness  what about her dignity .  would she have been willing to duck under one of the tables and let the tablecloth hide her .     the tablecloths did not come down to the ground .  i would have seen her .  i tell you i ve gone back to the restaurant and studied it in cold blood .  there is nowhere she could have hidden .  i was even desperate enough to wonder if she could have worked her way up the chimney  but the fireplace isn t real and isn t attached to one .    drake said   anyone have any other ideas .  i don t .    there was silence .   drake turned half about in his chair .   do you have anything to volunteer  henry .    henry said  with a small smile   well  dr .  drake  i have a certain reluctance to spoil mrs .  anderssen s fun .     spoil her fun .   said anderssen in astonishment .   are you telling me  waiter  that you know what happened .    henry said   i know what might easily have happened  sir  that would account for the disappearance without the need for any sort of witchcraft and i assume  therefore  that that was  indeed  what happened .     what was it  then .     let me be certain i understand one point .  when you asked the people in the restaurant if they had seen a redheaded woman enter  the man on the couch turned around and shook his head in the negative .  is that right .     yes  he did .  i remember it well .  he was the only one who really responded .     but you said the fireplace was at the wall opposite the door into the restaurant and that the couch faced it  so that the man had his back to you .  he had to turn around to look at you .  that means his back was also to the door  and he was reading a magazine .  of all the people there  he was least likely to see someone enter the door  yet he was the one person to take the trouble to indicate he had seen no one .  why should he have .     what has all that got to do with it  waiter .   said anderssen .    call him henry   muttered gonzalo .   henry said   i would suggest that mrs .  anderssen hurried in and took her seat on the couch  an ordinary and perfectly natural action that would have attracted no attention from a group of people engaged in dining and in conversation  even despite her red hair .     but i would have seen her as soon as i came in   said anderssen .   the back of the couch only reaches a person s shoulders and helen is a tall woman .  her hair would have blazed out at me .     on a chair   said henry   it is difficult to do anything but sit .  on a couch  however  one can lie down .    anderssen said   there was a man already sitting on the couch .     even so   said henry .   your wife  acting on impulse  as you say she is apt to do  reclined .  suppose you were on a couch  and an attractive redhead  with a fine figure  dressed in a skimpy summer costume  suddenly stretched out and placed her head in your lap  and that  as she did so  she raised her finger imploringly to her mouth  pleading for silence .  it seems to me there would be very few men who wouldn t oblige a lady under those circumstances .    anderssen s lips tightened   well      you said the man was holding his magazine high  as though he were nearsighted  but might that not be because he was holding it high enough to avoid the woman s head in his lap .  and then  in his eagerness to oblige a lady  would he not turn his head and unnecessarily emphasize that he hadn t seen her .    anderssen rose .   right .  i ll go home right now and have it out with her .     if i may suggest  sir   said henry   i would not do that .     i sure will .  why not .     in the interest of family harmony  it might be well if you would let her have her victory .  i imagine she rather regrets it and is not likely to repeat it .  you said she has been very well behaved this last month .  isn t it enough that you know in your heart how it was done so that you needn t feel defeated yourself .  it would be her victory without your defeat and you would have the best of both worlds .    slowly  anderssen sat down and  amid a light patter of applause from the black widowers  said   you may be right  henry .     i think i am   said henry .   afterword  actually  i dreamed this one .   i don t often remember my dreams since  actually  i attach no importance to them whatever .   in this  i differ from my dear wife  janet  who is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst  and considers them to be important guides to what makes a person tick .  she may be right  of course .    anyway  even when i do remember my dreams  they seem remarkably uninteresting since they almost never contain any element of fantasy or imagination .  it s as though i use up the entire supply in my writing business  leaving nothing over for dreams .   in one dream  however  i followed someone into a dining room and found he had unaccountably disappeared .  i was quite astonished  for  as i said  even in my dreams i don t usually defy the laws of nature .  a search through the room finally located the person i was looking for in the place where the heroine of the preceding story had hidden .   i stared at him and said  so help me    what a terrific idea for a black widowers story .    fortunately i woke at that moment and  for once  the dream was fresh in my mind .  thereupon i stored the notion in my waking memory and on the next available occasion  i wrote the story and it appeared in the october      issue of eqmm .   i can t help but think that if i could dream all my gimmicks  life would be a lot easier .   the wrong house  the guest at the monthly banquet of the black widowers frowned at the routine question asked him by that best of all waiters  henry .    no   he said  vehemently .   nothing .  nothing .    no  not even ginger ale .  i ll just have a glass of water  if you don t mind .    he turned away  disturbed .  he had been introduced as christopher levan .  he was a bit below average height  slim  and well   dressed .  his skull was mostly bald but was so well   shaped that the condition seemed attractive rather than otherwise .   he was talking to mario gonzalo and returned to the thread of his conversation with an apparent effort  saying   the an of cartooning seems simple .  i have seen books that show you how to draw familiar shapes and forms  starting with an oval  let us say  then modifying it in successive stages till it becomes popeye or snoopy or dick tracy .  and yet how does one decide what oval to make and what modifications to add in the first place .  besides  it is not easy to copy .  no matter how simple the steps seem to be  when i try to follow them  the end result is distorted and amateurish .    gonzalo looked  with a certain complacency  at the cartoon he had just drawn of the guest  and said   you have to allow for a kind of inborn talent and for years of experience  mr .  levan .     i suppose so  and yet you didn t draw any oval with modifications .  you simply drew that head freehand as quickly as you could and without any effort as far as i could tell .    except that somehow my head looks shiny .  is it .     not particularly .  that s just cartoonist s license .     except that   said emmanuel rubin  drawing near with a drink in his hand   if licenses were required for cartooning  mario would never qualify .  some may have talent  but mario gets by with effrontery .    gonzalo grinned .   he means chutzpah .  manny knows about that .  he writes stories which he actually submits to editors .     and sells   said rubin .    an indication of occasional editorial desperation .    levan smiled .   when i hear two people spar like that  i am certain that there is actually a profound affection between them .     oh  god   said rubin  visibly revolted .  his sparse beard bristled and his eyes  magnified through the thick lenses of his glasses  glared .    you ve hit it  mr .  levan   said gonzalo .   manny would give me the shirt off his back if no one were looking .  the only thing he wouldn t give me is a kind word .    geoffrey avalon  the host of this banquet  called out   are you getting tangled up in some nonsense between manny and mario  chris .     voluntarily  jeff   said levan .   i like these bouts with pillows and padded bats .     it gets wearisome   said avalon  staring down from his seventy   four   inch height   past the fifty   seven thousandth time .    but come and sit down  chris .  we are having nothing less good than lobster tonight .    it is not to be denied that an elaborate lobster dinner tends to inhibit conversation a bit .  the cracking of shells takes considerable concentration and the dipping into drawn butter is not a matter to be carried through casually .  the period between the portuguese fish chowder and the coupe aux marrons was largely silent  therefore  as far as the human voice was concerned  though the nutcracking play kept the table at a low growl .    i despise lobster salad   said roger halsted over the coffee .   it s like eating seedless watermelon cut into cubes .  the worth of the prize is directly proportional to the pains taken to win it .    levan said   i suppose  then  you would be very much against interest   free loans   and he chuckled with a sated air .    well   said james drake  in his hoarsely muted voice   i imagine even roger would consider that as carrying a principle too far .    thomas trumbull fixed levan with a glowering eye .   that s a banker s joke .  are you a banker .     one moment  tom   said avalon .   you re beginning to grill and the grilling session has not yet been opened .     well  then  open it  jeff .  we re on our coffee  and henry is going to come around with the brandy in a millisecond .   trumbull looked at his watch .   and the lobster has delayed us  so let s go .     i was about to begin   said avalon  with dignity .  he tapped his glass three or four times .   tom  since you are so anxious  won t you begin the grilling .     certainly   said trumbull .   mr .  levan  are you a banker .     that is not the traditional opener   said gonzalo .   trumbull said   who asked you .  what you re thinking of is traditional  it s not mandatory .    mr .  levan  are you a banker .     yes  i am .  at least  i m the vice president of a bank .     hah   said trumbull .   now i ll ask you the traditional opener .  mr .  levan  how do you justify your existence .    levan s smile became a beam .   easiest thing in the world .  the human body is completely dependent on blood circulation  which is driven by the heart .  the world economy is completely dependent on money circulation  which is driven by the banks .  i do my bit .     are the banks motivated in this by a desire for the good of the world or for the profits of their owners .    levan said   socialist claptrap  if you don t mind my saying so .  you imply that the two motives are mutually exclusive  and that is not so .  the heart drives the blood into the aorta and the first arteries to branch off are the coronaries  which feed what .  the heart .  in short  the heart s first care is for the heart  and that is as it should be  for without the heart all else fails .  let the coronaries get choked up and you ll find yourself agreeing with the heart  and wishing it were anything else that was on short rations .     not the brain   said drake .   sooner the heart .  better die of a heart attack than live on in senility .    levan thought a bit .   that s hard to disagree with  but we may treat and reverse senility a lot sooner than we are likely to be able to treat and reverse death .    gonzalo  frowning  said   come on  what s this subject we ve latched on to .  and on a full stomach  too .  hey  tom  may i ask a question .    trumbull said   all right .  subject changed .  ask a question  mario  but don t make it a dumb one .    gonzalo said   mr .  levan  are you a member of alcoholics anonymous .    there was a sudden silence about the table and then trumbull  face twisted in anger  growled   i said  don t make it       it s a legitimate question   insisted gonzalo  raising his voice   and the rules of the game are that the guest must answer .    levan  not smiling  and looking grim rather than embarrassed  said   i ll answer the question .  i am not a member of alcoholics anonymous  and i am not an alcoholic .     are you a teetotaler  then .    for some reason  levan seemed to find more difficulty answering that .   well  no .  i drink on occasion   a bit .  not much .    gonzalo leaned back in his chair and frowned .   avalon said   may we change the subject once again and try to find something more civilized to discuss .     no  wait a while   said gonzalo .   there s something funny here and i m not through .  mr .  levan  you refused a drink .  i was talking to you at the time .  i watched you .     yes  i did   said levan .   what s wrong with that .     nothing   said gonzalo   but you refused it angrily .  henry .     yes  mr .  gonzalo   said henry at once  momentarily suspending his brandy   pouring operation .    wasn t there something funny about mr .  levan s refusal .     mr .  levan was a bit forceful  i believe .  i would not undertake to say that it was  funny .      why was it forceful  do you think .     there could be      drake interrupted .   this is the damndest grilling session i can remember .  bad taste all around .  whom are we grilling  anyway .  mr .  levan or henry .     i agree   said rubin  nodding his head vigorously .   come on  jeff  you re the host .  make a ruling and get us on track .    avalon stared at his water glass  then said   gentlemen  christopher levan is a vice president of the largest bank in merion .  in fact  he is my personal banker  and i know him socially .  i have seen him drink in moderation but i have never seen him drunk .  i did not hear him refuse a drink  but somehow i m curious .  chris  did you refuse a drink forcefully .  if so  why .    levan frowned  and said   i m on the edge of resenting this .     please don t  chris   said avalon .   i explained the rules when you accepted my invitation  and i gave you a chance to back out .  nothing said here goes beyond the walls .  even if you were to tell us you were absconding with bank funds  we would be unable to tell anyone that   though i m sure we would all urge you quite forcibly to abandon your intention .     i am not an absconder  and i resent being forced to make that statement .  i don t take this kindly of you  jeff .     this has gone far enough   said halsted .   let s end the session .     wait   said gonzalo  stubbornly   i want an answer to my question .     i told you   said levan .   i merely refused       not my question to you  mr .  levan .  my question to henry .  henry  why did mr .  levan refuse the drink so vehemently .  if you don t answer  this session might end prematurely  and that would be the first time it did so  at least during my membership in the club .    henry said   i can only guess  sir  from what little knowledge of human nature i have .  it may be that mr .  levan  although ordinarily a moderate drinker  refused a drink this time  because in the near past he had suffered keen embarrassment or humiliation through drink  and  for a time at least  would rather not drink again .    levan had whitened distinctly .   how did you know that  waiter .    gonzalo grinned with proprietary pride .   his name is henry  mr .  levan .  he s an artist  too .  the rest of us draw the ovals  and he adds the modifications and produces the final picture .    the mood of the table had changed subtly .  even trumbull seemed to soften  and there was an almost wheedling quality to his voice .   mr .  levan  if something has happened that has left a lasting effect  it might help you to talk about it .    levan looked about the table .  every eye was fixed on him .  he said in half a mutter   the waiter   henry   is quite right .  i made a total fool of myself and  right now  i firmly intend never to drink again .  jeff told you he s never seen me drunk .  well  he never has  but he s not always around .  once in a long while i do manage to get high .  nothing in particular ever came of it until two weeks ago  and then   it hardly bears thinking of .    he frowned in thought  and said   it might help if i did tell you .  you might be able to suggest something i can do .  so far  the only one i ve told is my wife .     i imagine she s furious   said halsted .    no  she s not .  my first wife would have been .  she was a teetotaler  but she s dead now  rest her soul .  my children would have been sardonically amused  i think  but they re in college  both of them .  my present wife  my second  is a worldly woman  though  who is not easily shaken by such things .  she has a career of her own  in real estate  i believe .  she has grown children  too .  we married for companionship   and out of affection   but not in order to impose on each other .  the world doesn t crash about her ears if i get drunk .  she just gives me good practical advice and that ends it .     but what happened .   asked avalon .    well   i live on a rather exclusive street   four houses .  they re very nice houses  not extraordinarily large  but well   designed and comfortable  three bedrooms  a television room  three baths  finished cellar  finished attic  all   electric  which is expensive   backyards stretching to the creek  ample space between the houses  too .  all four were put up by one contractor at one time about a dozen years ago .  they re all identical in appearance and plan  and they were sold on ironclad condition that they be kept identical .  we can t paint our house another color  or put on aluminum siding  or add a sun porch unless all four house owners agree to do the same .  well  you can t get agreement ever  as you can well imagine  so there have been no changes .     is that legal .   asked halsted .    i don t know   said levan   but we all agreed .     can you make changes inside .   asked gonzalo .    of course .  we don t have standardized furniture or wallpaper or anything like that .  the agreement concerns only the appearance from the outside .  the houses are called the four sisters .  right  jeff .    avalon nodded .   levan went on .   anyway  i was out for the evening .  i had warned emma   my wife   that i might not be back till three in the morning .  i didn t seriously intend to stay out that late  but i felt i might  because   well  it was one of those college reunions and at fifty   five  there s this wild urge for one evening to be twenty   two again .  it never really works  i suppose .    i even thought i could carry my liquor  but by midnight i was pretty well smashed .  i didn t think i was  but i must have been  because i can t carry my liquor well  and because several of the others tried to persuade me to go home .  i didn t want to and i seem to remember offering to knock one of them down .   he rubbed his eyes fiercely  as though trying to wipe out the mental image .   drake said  dryly   not the thing for a bank vice president .     we re human  too   said levan  wearily   but it doesn t help the image .  anyway  in the end  two or three of them helped me out to a car and drove me out to merion .  when they found the street in question  i insisted they let me out on the corner .  you see i didn t want to wake the neighbors .  it was a noisy car  or i thought it was .    they did let me out on the corner  they were glad to get rid of me  i imagine .  i realized i wasn t going to get anywhere much trying to fumble my key into the lock .  besides i knew a better trick .  there s a side door that i was pretty sure would be open .  there s no crime in our section to speak of   no burglaries   and the side door is never closed during the day .  half the time  it s not closed at night  either .    so i made my way to it .  i felt my way along the side of the house and found the door .  it was open  as i thought it would be .  i tiptoed in as quietly as i could  considering my condition  and closed it behind me just as quietly .  i was in a small anteroom mostly used for hanging up clothes  keeping umbrellas and rubbers  and so on .  i just made my way around the umbrella stand and sank into a chair .    by that time  i was reeling rather dizzy and very tired .  the dark was soothing  and i liked the feel of the soft old padding under me .  i think i would have gone to sleep right then  and might not have been found by emma until morning  except that i became woozily aware of a dim light under the door that led to the kitchen .    was emma awake .  was she having a midnight snack .  i was too far gone to try to reason anything out  but it seemed to me that my only chance of not embarrassing her  and myself  was to walk in casually and pretend i was sober .  i was drunk enough to think i could do that .    i got up very carefully  made my way to the door with some difficulty  flung it open  and said  in a loud  cheery voice   i m home  dear  i m home .     i must have filled the air with an alcoholic fragrance that explained my condition exactly  even if my behavior had been perfectly sober  which i m sure it wasn t .    however  it was all for nothing  because emma wasn t there .  there were two men there .  somehow i knew at once they weren t burglars .  they belonged there .  drunk as i was  i could tell that .  and i knew   my god  i knew that i was in the wrong house .  i had been too drunk to get to the right one .    and there on the table was a large suitcase  open  and stuffed with hundred   dollar bills .  some of the stacks were on the table  and i stared at them with a vague astonishment .    i don t know how i could tell  gentlemen .  modern techniques can produce some damned good imitations  but i ve been a banker for thirty years .  i don t have to look at bills to know they re counterfeit .  i can smell counterfeit  feel it  just know it by the radiations .  i might be too drunk to tell my house from another house  but as long as i am conscious at all  i am not too drunk to tell a real hundred   dollar bill from a fake one .    i had interrupted two crooks  that s what it amounted to .  they had neglected to lock the side door or just didn t know it was open  and i knew that i was in a dangerous situation .    levan shook his head  then went on .   they might have killed me  if i had been sober  even though they would then have had all the trouble of having to get rid of the body and of perhaps rousing police activity in an undesirable way .  but i was drunk  and clearly on the point of collapse .  i even think i heard someone say in a kind of hoarse whisper   he s dead drunk .  just put him outside .   it might even have been a woman s voice  but i was too far gone to tell .  in fact  i don t remember anything else for a while .  i did collapse .    the next thing i knew i was feeling a lamppost and trying to get up .  then i realized i wasn t trying to get up .  someone was trying to lift me .  then i realized it was emma  in a bathrobe .  she had found me .    she got me into the house somehow .  fortunately  there was no one else about .  there was no indication before or since that anyone had seen me lying in the gutter  or seen emma having to drag me home .    remember your promise of confidentiality  gentlemen .  and i hope that includes the waiter .    avalon said  emphatically   it does  chris .     she managed to get me undressed   said levan   and washed  and put me to bed without asking me any questions  at least as far as i can remember .  she s a terrific woman .  i woke in the morning with  as you might suspect  a king   sized headache  and a sense of relief that it was sunday morning and that i was not expected to be at work .    after breakfast  which was just a soft   boiled egg for me  and several quarts of orange juice  it seemed  emma finally asked me what had happened .   nothing much   i said .   i must have had a little too much to drink  and they brought me home and left me at the corner and i didn t quite make it to the house .   i smiled weakly  hoping she would find the understatement amusing  and let it go at that .    but emma just looked at me thoughtfully   she s a very practical woman  you know  and wasn t going to act tragic over my being drunk for the first and only time in her acquaintanceship with me   and said   a funny thing happened .      what .   i asked .     someone called me   she said .   it was after midnight .  someone called and said   your husband is outside drunk or hurt .  you d better go and get him .   i thought it was some practical joke  or a ruse to get me to open the door .  still i thought if it was true and you were in trouble  i would have to risk it .  i took your banker   of   the   year award with me  just in case i had to use it to hit somebody  went out in the street  and found you .    now who could have called me .  they didn t say who they were .     she stared at me  frowning  puzzled  and my memory stirred .  my face must have given me away at once  because emma   who s a penetrating woman   said at once   what happened last night .  what are you remembering .     so i told her and when i had finished she looked at me with a troubled expression  and said   that s impossible .  there can t be any counterfeiting in this block .      yes   i said   i m sure there is .  or at least someone in one of the other three houses is involved in it  even if the counterfeiting isn t actually taking place on the premises .      well  which house were you in .   she wanted to know .  but how could i tell .  i didn t know .     which house did you find me outside .   i asked .     our house   she said .     well  then  they just took me outside and put me in front of our house .  that means they knew which house i belonged to .  it s one of our neighbors .      it can t be   she kept repeating .    but that s the way it is  just the same .  i haven t the faintest idea which wrong house i d gotten into  and i don t know who is involved in counterfeiting .  and i can t report it .     why not .   asked gonzalo .    because i would have to explain that i was falling   down drunk .  how else could i account for the fuzziness of the information .   said levan .   i don t want to do that .  i don t want to look like a fool or a drunken idiot and  frankly  i don t want to lose my job .  the story would be bound to get out and it wouldn t look good at the bank .    besides  what would the police do .  search all three houses .  they would find nothing  and three householders  two of whom would be completely innocent  would be outraged .  we would have to sell our house and leave .  life would become unbearable  otherwise .    emma pointed all this out carefully .  in fact  she said  there would be a strong presumption that i had fantasised it all  that i was having d . t .  s .  i d be ruined .  emma s a bright woman  and persuasive .    yet it eats at me .  counterfeiting .  that s the banker s nightmare  it s the crime .  i had stumbled onto something that might be big and i could do nothing about it .    i haven t touched a drink since  and i don t intend ever to  and that s why i was a bit vehement when henry asked me  for the second time  if i would have one .    there was a silence about the table for a time  and then avalon  drumming his fingers lightly on the tablecloth  said   i know where you live  chris  but i don t know your neighbors .  who are they .  what do they do .    levan shrugged .   all well on in years .  all in their fifties and beyond .  not a small child on the street .  and all beyond suspicion  damn them .    let s see  if you re facing the front of the four houses  the one on the left holds the nash couple .  he s an insurance agent  and she s arthritic  a nice lady  but a terrible bore .  she s the kind you say hello to when you pass her  but keep on walking .  the merest hesitation would be fatal .    the second house holds the johnstones .  he s in his seventies and she s perhaps two or three years younger .  he s retired and they re supposed to be quite wealthy  but they don t bank in our bank and i have no personal knowledge of the matter .  they sort of shuttle between maine in the summer and florida in the winter  but they have a bachelor son  about forty  who stays in the house year   round and is not employed .    the third house is ours  and the fourth belongs to two sisters  one a mrs .  widner and the other a mrs .  chambers .  both are widows and they seem to cling to each other for warmth .  they re in their fifties and very wide awake .  i m astonished they weren t aware of my being picked up at the lamppost .  they re light sleepers and have a sixth sense for local catastrophe .    across the street  there are no houses but only a large lawn and a stand of trees belonging to the presbyterian church which is a distance off .    that s it .    he looked about helplessly  and rubin cleared his throat .   if we go by probabilities  the obvious choice is the bachelor son .  he has the house to himself for a couple of months at a time and has nothing to do but work at his counterfeiting  with or without the knowledge of his parents .  if the johnstones are mysteriously wealthy  that may be why .  i m astonished you overlook this .     you wouldn t be if you knew the boy   said levan .   even though he s middle   aged  it s hard to think of him as a man .  he s boyish in appearance and attitude  and without being actually retarded in any way  is clearly unequipped to make his way in the world .     he s capable enough   said rubin   to take care of the house for a couple of months at a time .     he s not retarded   repeated levan  impatiently .   he s emotionally immature  that s all .  naive .  and good   hearted in the extreme .  it s impossible to think of him being involved in crime .    rubin said   it might be that he s acting .  perhaps he s clever enough to appear incredibly naive so as to hide the fact that  actually  he is a criminal .    levan pondered .   i just can t believe that .  no one could be that good an actor .     if he were innocent and childlike   said rubin   it might make it all the easier for him to be used by criminals .  he might be an unwitting pawn .     that doesn t make sense to me .  they couldn t trust him  he d give it away .     well   said rubin   however much you doubt it  that seems to me to be the most reasonable possibility  and if you want to do a little investigating on your own  you had better take a closer look at young johnstone .   he sat back and folded his arms .   halsted said   what about the two men with the suitcase .  had you ever seen them before .    levan said   i wasn t at my best  of course  but at the time it seemed to me they were strangers .  they were certainly not members of any of the households .    halsted said   if they were outside associates of the counterfeiting ring  we might be reasonably sure that the two widows weren t involved .  they d be reluctant to have men in the house  it seems to me .     i m not sure about that   said levan .   they re feisty ladies and they re not old maids .  men are no new experience to them .  still  i agree  i don t see them as gun molls  so to speak .     and yet   said drake  thoughtfully   there may have been at least one woman present .  didn t you say  mr .  levan  that someone said   he s dead drunk .  just put him outside   and that it was a woman .   levan said   it was a whisper  and i couldn t tell for sure .  it might have been a woman  but it might have been a man  too .  and even if it were a woman  it might have been another outsider .    drake said   i should think someone who belonged there would have to be on the spot .  the house wouldn t be abandoned to outsiders  and there s at least one woman in each house .     not really   said halsted .   not in the johnstone house  since the old folks should be away in maine now .  if we eliminate the widows  then that leaves the house on the left corner  the nash house .  then  if mr .  levan were let off on the corner  and was so under the weather he had difficulty walking  it would be likely that he would go into the first house he came to and that would be the nashes   wouldn t it .   levan nodded .   yes  it would  but i can t remember that that s what i did .  so what s the use .  however much we argue and reason  i have nothing with which to go to the police .  it s just guess   work .    trumbull said   surely these people don t live in their houses by themselves .  don t they have servants .    levan said   the widows have a live   in woman   of   all   work .     ah   said trumbull .    but that doesn t strike me as significant .  it just means three women in the house instead of two  a third widow  as a matter of fact  and quite downtrodden by the sisters .  she has no more brains than is necessary to do the housework  from what little i know of her .  she s impossible as a criminal conspirator .     i think you re entirely too ready to dismiss people as impossible   said trumbull .   any other servants .    levan said   the nashes have a cook  who comes in for the day .  the johnstones have a handyman who works mainly in the yards  and helps the rest of us when he has time .  emma and i don t have any servants in the house .  emma is strong and efficient and she dragoons me into helping her   which is only right  i suppose .  she doesn t believe in servants .  she says they destroy privacy and never do things right anyway  and i agree with her .  still  i do wish we could have someone to do the vacuuming besides myself .    trumbull said  with a trace of impatience   well  the vacuuming is not an issue .  what about the nash cook and the johnstone handyman .     the cook has five children at home  with the oldest in charge  according to the nashes  and if she has spare time for criminality i think she should get a medal .  the handyman is so deeply religious that it is ludicrous to think of him as breaking the commandment against theft .     sanctimoniousness can easily be assumed as a cloak   said trumbull .    i see no signs of it in this case .     you don t suspect him .    levan shook his head .    do you suspect anyone .    levan shook his head .   gonzalo said  suddenly   what about whoever it was who called your wife to tell her you were outside in the gutter .  did she recognize the voice .    levan shook his head emphatically .   she couldn t have .  it was just a whisper .     is that just your judgment  or does she say so .     she would have told me at once if she had recognized it .     was it the same whisper you heard in the house .    levan said  impatiently   she heard one and i heard the other .  how can we compare .     was the voice your wife heard that of a woman .     emma never said .  i doubt that she could tell .  she said she thought it might be a way of getting her to open the door  so maybe it seemed to her to be a man .  i don t know .    gonzalo seemed annoyed  and said rather sharply   maybe there s no one to suspect .  you may think you can sense counterfeit money  but how do you know you can do so when you re totally sozzled .  it could be you saw real money and there s no counterfeiting going on at all .     no   said levan  emphatically   and even if that were so  what would two strangers be doing with a suitcase of hundred   dollar bills .  new ones .  i could smell the ink .  even if it weren t counterfeiting  there would have to be some sort of crime .   gonzalo said   maybe the whole thing      he let it trail off  and levan said  flushing a little      is a pink elephant .  you think i imagined it all .     isn t that possible .  if there s no one to suspect  if no one could be involved  maybe nothing really happened .     no   said levan .   i know what i saw .     well  what did you see .   said drake suddenly  peering at levan through the smoke of his cigarette .   you were in the kitchen .  you saw the wallpaper  if any  the color scheme  the fixtures .  the kitchen details aren t identical  are they .  you can walk into each house and then identify which kitchen you were in  can t you .    levan flushed   i wish i could .  the truth is  i saw nothing .  there were just the two men  the suitcase on the table  and the money .  it occupied all my attention  and i can t even really describe the suitcase .   he added  defensively   i was not myself .  i was   was   and besides  after fifteen or thirty seconds  i had passed out .  i just don t know where i was .    avalon  looking troubled  said   what are you doing about it  chris .  are you doing any investigating on your own .  that might be dangerous  you know .     i know   said levan   and i m not an investigator .  emma  who has more common sense in her left thumb than i have in my whole body  said that if i tried to do any questioning or poking about for clues  i would not only make a fool of myself  but i might get into trouble with the police .  she said i had better just alert the bank to be on the lookout for bogus hundred   dollar bills and investigate those  when they came in  by the usual methods .  of course  no hundred   dollar bills are coming in .  i don t suppose the counterfeiters will pass them in this area .    gonzalo said  discontentedly   then we haven t gotten anywhere and that s frustrating .    henry  can you add anything to all this .    henry  who was standing at the sideboard  said   there is a question i might ask  if permitted .     go ahead   said levan at once .    mr .  levan  you said  earlier  that your wife has a career of her own in real estate  but you said  i believe .   aren t you sure .    levan looked startled  then laughed .    well  we married five years ago  when we had each been single for quite a while  and were each used to independence .  we try to interfere with each other as little as possible .  actually  i m sure she is engaged in real estate  but i don t ask questions and she doesn t .  it s one of these modern marriages  worlds different from my first .    henry nodded and was silent .    well   said gonzalo  impatiently .   what do you have in mind  henry .  don t hang back .    henry looked disturbed .   mr .  levan   he said  softly   when you entered the house by the side door and closed it   behind you  you were then in the dark  i believe .     i certainly was  henry .     you circled an umbrella stand .  how did you know it was an umbrella stand .     after i sat down  i happened to feel it .  if it wasn t an umbrella stand  it was something just like it .    henry nodded .   but you circled it before you felt it  and you dropped into a chair in the dark with relief  and enjoyed feeling the soft padding  you said .     yes .     mr .  levan   said henry .   the houses were alike in every particular on the outside  but were free to vary on the inside  you said  and presumably they all did so vary .  yet in your not   quite   sober state  you managed to dodge the umbrella stand and drop into a chair .  you did not bump into one or miss the other .  you did not have the slightest idea you were in the wrong house at the time  did you .     no  i didn t   said levan  looking alarmed .   it was only when i opened the kitchen door and saw the men       exactly  sir .  you expected to find the arrangement of objects as it was in your own house  and you found that to be so .  when you sat in the chair  which you must have thought was your own  you felt nothing to disabuse yourself of the notion .     oh  my god   said levan .    mr .  levan   said henry   i think you must have been in your own house after all .  drunk as you were  you found your way home .     oh  my god   said levan  again .    you were not expected till much later  so you caught your wife by surprise .  in your modern marriage  you clearly didn t know enough about her .  yet she did show affection for you .  she did not allow you to be harmed .  she had you carried out  and then came to get you with an invented story about a phone call .  by then the men and the suitcase had gone and since then she has worked very hard to keep you from telling the story to the police or doing anything about it .    i m afraid that s the only explanation that fits what you have told us .    for a moment  there was an absolute silence over the horrified group .   levan said  in a small voice   but what do i do .   and henry said  sorrowfully   i don t know  mr .  levan .    but i wish you had not refused that drink .    afterword  by the time i had sold the preceding story  i found that i had ten stories toward a new black widowers collection  and of those ten  only one   the driver   had failed to sell .   as it happened  in my first black widowers collection  tales of the black widowers  i had nine stories that had appeared in print and three stories that had not .  those stories that had not previously been published were involuntarily in that condition .  i would gladly have stuck fred with them if i had been able to .   once the book appeared  however  it seemed to me that it had worked out properly .  many of those who bought the book might well have been eqmm subscribers and would have read each of the black widowers when it appeared in the magazine .  even allowing that their tolerance and kind hearts would allow them to read each again with pleasure  it did seem the decent thing to give them three stories they couldn t possibly have read before .   in the collections that followed the first  my record was better  and in each case  including this one  i reached the number   ten mark with only one failure to sell .  in each case  therefore  i wrote two more stories that i did not submit anywhere  but saved for the collection .  and so it is now .  the story you have just read   the wrong house   and the one that follows   the intrusion   were each written specifically for this collection  and have not appeared elsewhere .   the intrusion  from the expression on the face of mario gonzalo  it might seem that there was something singularly unsatisfactory about this particular banquet of the black widowers .   there was nothing apparent to account for that .  the dinner  which revolved about a main course of roast duck  smothered in dark cherries and underpinned by wild rice  with the skin delightfully crisp and the meat tender and moist  was perfection .  the sausage in pasta that had preceded and the generous chocolate parfait that had succeeded represented the calories   be   damned attitude of roger halsted  who was hosting the evening .  now the black widowers sat  . over their brandy  grilling their guest  with all in a state of satisfactory repletion .   the weather outside was delightful  and the guest was an intelligent and articulate person whose personality fit the general aura of the society .  even the terrible   tempered thomas trumbull was agreeable and the argumentative emmanuel rubin disputed nothing in any voice that was a decibel louder than that of ordinary conversation .   the guest s name was haskell pritchard and he was a civil servant .  it had already been established that he was in charge of solid waste disposal and some traces of merriment at the start over his perhaps having to drive a garbage truck vanished under the undoubted seriousness of the problem .    the fact is   pritchard had said   that we are running out of places to put the waste and we re going to need some innovative ideas on the matter .    rubin said  a bit sardonically   the waste  sir  was once raw material  and that raw material came from somewhere  certainly not from within this city .  wherever it came from it left a hole  whether you call that hole a mine or a quarry or whatever .  why not put the waste back in the hole it came from .     actually   said pritchard   this has been thought of .  there are indeed abandoned mines  quarries and other such things in the countryside and there have been attempts to negotiate their use as dumps .  however  it can t be done .  people are willing to sell raw materials but are not willing to accept the residue after the consumer is done with it   even if we pay both times  once for taking and once for returning .    geoffrey avalon said   it s a common sociological phenomenon .  everyone is in favor of cracking down on crime and sending criminals to jail  but nobody wants to spend money on building more jails to hold those criminals and  even more so  nobody wants any new jail built in his neighborhood .    halsted said   i don t see the relevance of that  jeff .     don t you .   avalon s eyebrows rose .   i should think it was obvious .  i am speaking of the general ability of the public to recognize a problem and to want to solve it  but to balk at any personal inconvenience involved in a solution .  might i also say that it is delightful  after a good dinner  to be discussing  in a more or less detached manner  problems that affect the public weal  with no personal puzzle involved .  i take it  mr .  pritchard  that your work  or your life  for that matter  does not at the moment involve some conundrum that is robbing you of sleep and peace of mind .    pritchard looked surprised .   i can t think of anything  mr .  avalon ought i to have come here with something of the sort  roger .     not at all  haskell   said halsted .   it s just that sometimes we are faced with a riddle  but i find it relaxing not to have one .     i don t   said gonzalo  with energy  revealing his reason for dissatisfaction   and i hope i never do .  i think all of you are getting too old  and i also think that if mr .  pritchard thinks hard he can come up with something interesting .    halsted bridled at once  and said  with the soft stutter that invaded his voice whenever he was indignant or excited   if you re trying to say  mario  that my guest is dull      james drake interposed .   come on  roger .  mario just wants a puzzle .    but think a moment  mario  shouldn t henry have a rest at a banquet now and then .     sure   said mario   and just serve the dishes and take away the empty plates and get us water and drinks and anything else we ask for .  he s having a great rest .    henry  that perfection of a waiter  without whom the black widowers were unthinkable  stood by the sideboard and  at gonzalo s words  a small smile played briefly over his unlined  sixtyish face .   avalon said   suppose we have a vote on the matter  with the host s permission .  i move we be permitted  now and then  to have a banquet in which there is nothing more than civilized conversation .    halsted said   all in favor of jeff s motion     and it was even as the hands began to go up  minus gonzalo s  that there came about something that marked an utterly unprecedented event in the history of the banquets of the black widowers .  there was a violent intrusion of an uninvited person into their midst .   there was  to begin with  the sound of a scuffle on the stairs  some vague shouting  a muffled cry of  please  mister  please      the black widowers froze   astonished   and then a young man broke into the room .   he was slightly disheveled  and he was breathing hard .  he looked from face to face and behind him a waiter said   i couldn t stop him  gentlemen .  shall i call the police .     no   said halsted  who  as host  automatically took the initiative .   we ll handle it .  what do you want  young man .    the intruder said   are you guys the black widowers .    halsted said   this is a private party .  please leave .    the intruder raised a hand  placatingly .   i ll leave in a minute .  i ain t here to eat nothing .  but is this the place where the black widowers meet and are you the guys .    avalon  his voice as baritone as he could make it  said   we are the black widowers  sir .  what is it you want .     well  you help guys  don t you .     no  we do not .  as you have been told  this is a private meeting and we have no other purpose but to meet .    the intruder looked baffled .   they told me you guys figure out things .  i have a problem .   suddenly  he did not look in the least formidable .  he was of medium height  with thick dark hair  dark eyes  and dark eyebrows  and he was rather handsome .  he seemed to be in his mid   twenties and  beneath a rather theatrical affectation of toughness  there was a touch of loss and confusion .  he said   they told me you could help me   with my problem .    his shirt collar was open and his adam s apple  quite visible  moved up and down .  he said   i could pay   something .    gonzalo said  joyously   what s your problem .    trumbull snarled   mario .   he turned to the intruder   what s your name .     frank russo   said the intruder  defiantly  as though expecting someone to object to the designation .    and where did you hear we solve problems .    russo said   i just heard .  it don t matter where  does it .  other guys who eat with you talk  maybe  and it goes from one to another .  so i asked and found out you eat here at the milano  a good paesano restaurant   if you got the dough for it   and you were gonna be there tonight  and i thought  what the hell  if you help other people  maybe you can help me .    rubin  looking combative  said   yes  but just who told you where and when we would be meeting .    russo said   if you don t like people should talk about you  then i m telling you i won t .  the way you re gonna know i won t is i ain t gonna talk about the guy who told me about you .    drake muttered   that sounds fair enough to me .     now if you don t want to help me   said russo   i ll leave .  after that  though  if i hear people say you help out  i ll deny it .    there was silence at that  and then russo said  with an authentic note of pleading in his voice   can i at least tell you what s bugging me .    halsted said   what s the consensus .  anyone in favor of listening to russo raise his hand .   he raised his  and gonzalo s hand shot up vigorously .   drake said   well  listening can t hurt   and raised his .   halsted waited  but the hands of avalon  trumbull  and rubin remained resolutely down .  halsted said   three to three .  i m sorry  haskell  i can see that you re itching to raise your hand  but you re not a widower .  henry  would you break the tie .    henry said   well  mr .  halsted  if you insist  then my own feeling is that when the widowers are evenly balanced on some point  the preference should be given to the merciful .  it is hard to turn away someone in trouble .   and he raised his hand .   halsted said   good .  could you bring a chair  henry  and put it near the door for the young man .  sit down  russo .    russo sat down  put his hands on his knees  and looked about anxiously .  now that he had made his point  he seemed to be uneasy at the surroundings he found himself in .   halsted said   haskell  we re going to have to interrupt your grilling to take care of mr .  russo  if we can .  i hope you don t mind .     on the contrary   said pritchard .   i wanted to vote in favor of the young man  as you suspected  and i m glad the waiter tipped the vote in his favor  though i thought only members could vote .     henry is a member .    and now  jim  would you do the honors .    drake stubbed out his cigarette .   young man   he said   ordinarily  i d begin by asking you to justify your existence  but you are not a guest of ours and that question therefore doesn t apply .  you can just tell us what your problem is  but i must warn you  that any of us can interrupt at any time to ask a question  and that henry  our waiter  can do so  too .  in return  you must answer all questions truthfully and fully  and you must understand that we cannot guarantee that we ll be able to help you .     okay  that suits me .  i m gonna tell you the story  but you gotta promise it don t go outside this room .    drake said   i assure you that nothing that goes on in this room is ever spoken of by the black widowers outside  although it does seem that at least one of our guests did not adhere to this rule .     okay  then .   russo closed his eyes a moment as though deciding where to begin .  then he said  firmly   i got a sister who just turned eighteen .     what s her name .   said gonzalo .    i m gonna tell you   said russo   even if you didn t ask because that s part of the problem .  her name is susan .  all her life i called her suzy  but she s got it in her mind she wants to be called susan and that s what i call her now .    she s my kid sister .  i m twenty   four and i been taking care of her for six years now   ever since our ma died .     have you got a job .   asked avalon .    course i got a job   said russo  indignantly .   what kind of a question is that .  how could i be taking care of her without a job .  i been driving a truck for a brewery since i was fifteen and two years ago i got a supervising job .  i ain t rich  but i make decent money and i can pay you guys   some .    avalon looked uncomfortable .   there is no question of payment  sir .  just go on with your story .  is your father also dead .    russo said   i don t know where my father is .  i don t care  either .  he s gone .   his arm made a final  dismissive gesture .   i take care of susan .    the thing is susan ain t   bright .    drake said   do you mean she s retarded .     she s not mental .  don t think that .  she s just not bright .  people could take advantage of her and there ain t much she could do in the way of a job .     with special educational care     began avalon .   russo s face twisted .   what s the use of saying that .  i ain t got money for that .    avalon reddened and muttered   there s the sociological problem again .  people recognize the need and say they want a solution  but if it s a question of public funds  the taxpayer buttons his pocket .    russo said   she cooks .  she takes care of the place .  she can go shopping  and the guys around the neighborhood know about her and they make sure nothing happens to her .  any of them step out of line  he ll be taken care of .    his fist clenched and a steely look came into his eyes .   they re all careful  you bet  but it s something i ve been getting more and more worried about .  she s the best   natured kid in the world  always willing to help  always smiling .  she takes care of herself real good  and the thing is  she s getting to be very nice   looking .  it s something to worry about  you know what i mean .    drake said   we know what you mean .  does she like men .     sure she does .  she likes everybody  but she don t know about that sort of thing .  she don t read and nobody talks dirty to her  you can bet on that .  but these days  you gotta be careful about what movies she sees  it s getting so  you even gotta be careful about television  you know what i mean .  besides  any guy wants something  she d go along  she s so good   natured  you know what i mean .    drake said   do you have a girlfriend of your own .    russo said  quickly   what s that supposed to mean .  you think i m queer .     i m asking if you have a girlfriend of your own .     course i do .     does she know about susan .     course she does .  and when we get hitched  she knows we gotta continue taking care of susan .  and she s willing .  she sits with her evenings when i gotta be away .  like now .    avalon cleared his throat and said  as delicately as he could   have you ever thought that  with an operation  she might be      russo clearly had thought of that  for he did not allow the sentence to be finished .   we ain t gonna cut her up .    gonzalo said   have you talked to your priest .    russo said   nah .  i know what he ll say .  he ll just say to keep on doing what we re doing and to trust in god .    gonzalo said   she might make a good nun .     no  she don t have the call .  and i m not gonna be making her a nun just to get rid of her .  i don t wanna get rid of her  see .    rubin said   do you expect she ll get married some day .    russo said  defiantly   could be .  she d make a good wife  a lot better wife than most i see around .  she s good   natured  hardworking  clean .   he hesitated .   course  whoever marries her s gotta understand she s not   smart  and he d have to take care of her because anyone could take advantage of her  if you know what i mean .  and he d have to take that into account if anyone does  and not take it out on her .     what if she has children .     what if she does .  she d take good care of them .  and they wouldn t have to be like her .  i m not .  my ma wasn t .    trumbull suddenly clanged his spoon against his water glass .  there was silence and trumbull said   gentlemen  this is all very well  but mr .  russo is wasting our time .  what is his problem .  there s nothing we can do about his sister  if that s his problem .  if he s come to ask us for advice about what to do with her now that she s eighteen  it seems to me that what i would say would be the same as the priest might say  to keep on doing what he s doing and trust in god .    i move we end this matter now .     hey  hold on   said russo  anxiously .   i ain t told you my problem yet .  all this stuff so far is just to explain .    halsted said   well  then  mr .  russo  i think we understand about your sister .  would you tell us your problem now .    russo cleared his throat and there was a moment of silence as he seemed once again to be choosing among alternate beginnings .   he said   two weeks ago  on the tenth  my sister was picked up .     by the police .   asked gonzalo .    no  by some guy .  no one from the neighborhood .  i don t know who the guy was .  i was at work  of course  and susan  she went out to do some shopping .  she got strict instructions never to talk to anybody she don t know .  never .  but i guess she musta this time .  i did a lot of asking around in the neighborhood these last two weeks .  everybody knows susan and they were all upset  and from what one guy says and what another guy says  what it looks like is that she was talking to some tall  skinny guy  good   looking kind of  but no one can swear to exactly what he looked like  except maybe he had blond hair .  i said how come they let something like that go on   her talking to a strange guy .  they all said they thought it was some friend because they figured susan wouldn t talk to a stranger .    he took her off in an automobile and when i got home from work  she was still gone  and i can tell you i went crazy .  i ran all around the neighborhood and i had all the guys going all over .   he shook his head .   i don t know what i would of done  if she hadn t come home .    trumbull said   then she did come home .     just about when it was getting dark .  whoever it was  he had put her on a commuter train and she got off at the right station  thank goodness  and she knew enough to take a taxi .  she had money .  she still had her train   ticket stub and i think she came from larchmont in westchester .     was she all right .   asked gonzalo .   russo nodded his head .   she wasn t hurt .  i sort of managed not to say anything at the time  but the next day i stayed home from work  making out i was sick  and i got her to tell me everything that happened .  i had to know .    well  she met this guy and he talked to her  and he got around her  you know .  she said he was very handsome and talked nice and bought her an ice   cream soda  and asked if she wanted a drive in his car and it was a very pretty car .  well  she couldn t resist  she s always agreeable to everything anyway .  i figure he s one of these guys from somewhere fancy who comes into a poor neighborhood to pick up something easy for cheap .  this time he picked up something easy for nothing   except an ice   cream soda .    avalon began   did he      russo cut him off at once .   yeah .  he did .     how do you know .     because susan told me .  she didn t know what it was all about  and she told me .  the dirty     he checked himself  then said  furiously   he had to know she didn t know what it was all about .  he had to know she wasn t   smart .  it was like taking advantage of a little kid .    avalon began .   if she had had the proper instruction    caught russo s furious eye  halted  and looked the other way .   rubin said   how did your sister feel about it .     she thought it was great .  that s the worst part .  she ll want to do it again .  she ll suggest it to guys .     no   said rubin   that s not the worst part .  is she pregnant .     watch your language   said russo  tightly .   rubin raised his eyebrows .   let me rephrase that .  is she in the family way .     no  thank god .  she isn t .  she had her   time   since then .  she s all right that way .    trumbull said   well  then  mr .  russo  what s your problem .    russo said   i want to find the guy .    avalon said   why .     i want to teach him a lesson .    avalon shook his head .   if you re thinking of killing him  we can t be a party to that .  as it happens  your sister is over eighteen  and she was not taken over a state line .  she was not hurt  or impreg   or put in a family way .  she went along willingly and had a good time  and he can always claim he had no idea she was retar   not responsible .  i don t think he can be charged with kidnapping .  she was returned promptly and there were no ransom demands .  in fact  i don t think he can easily be charged with any crime at all .    russo said   that s why i m not going to the police .  i couldn t anyway  even if i could nail him with a crime .  i can t let people know what happened to susan .  it would be a disgrace to her and to me .  and if the guys know she s not a   not a   you know what i mean  they won t have no respect for her .  they might figure  well  as long as it s gone  what s one more .    so i gotta find him .  i ain t gonna kill him  but i just want to explain to him that it wasn t nice what he did  and since i probably ain t got his education and i can t explain it in fancy words  i d like to use a different kind of language .  listen  he s liable to do this to other people s sisters or daughters and maybe  just maybe  if i rearrange his face a little so it ain t so pretty  it won t be so easy for him next time .    avalon said   i sympathize with your point of view .  i think the man is a cad and it might do him a little good to pay for his intrusion on your life and your sister s   but i fail to see how we can help you find him .    russo said   actually  susan remembered some things .     as  for instance .     she said the guy kept saying   don t worry .  don t worry .   course he would  the dirty bastard .  there was nothing for him to worry about .  he could see she was a nice clean girl and wouldn t give him anything  though with his kind of life  he could have given something to her  and i don t mean a baby .    avalon said   yes  we understand  but what was it susan remembered .     well  he said   don t worry .  don t worry   and then he said   see  this is my house  and see what it s called .      what the house is called .   asked gonzalo .    yeah .  one of those fancy places they have in the suburbs with a name  i guess .  you know  a hunk of wood on the lawn with a name on it .  that s the kind of guy he is  fancy job  fancy house  fancy family  and when the fancy wife and kids go off to some fancy resort or something  he stays home and goes tomcatting around .    trumbull said  with visibly mounting impatience .   what was the name of the house .     susan said the house was named for her .  she said this guy even thought she was a saint .     what .     she said the house was called  saint susan .     halsted said   are you sure .  could susan read that .     she can read some  but actually  she said he read it to her .  that makes me think maybe it was in fancy writing because one word susan can make out easy in print is her own name .  she says he read the name and it made her a saint .  she knows what saints are  so she loved it .  she thought he named the house just for her .   russo shook his head sadly .   it s the sort of thing she would think .    halsted said   i never heard of a saint susan .  is there one .     i wouldn t swear there wasn t   said rubin   but i never heard of one  either .  did you  jeff .    avalon shook his head .   gonzalo said   why shouldn t a house be called saint susan  even if there aren t any on the list .  maybe it was a reference to his wife or his mother .     you don t go around calling your wife or mother a saint on a board on the lawn   said rubin .    it takes all kinds   said gonzalo .    there s one more point   said russo .   he told susan that the reason he named his house  saint susan  was because of his own name .  it wasn t his wife or mother  you see  but his own name .  of course  that tickled susan  too .  it meant the house was named for him and for her .    from susan s reactions to all this and from everything else she must have said  that bum must have known she wasn t a   a   whole person .  he had to know he was doing something terrible .  there s just no excuse for him .    halsted said   i agree  but is there anything else .  is it just that the house is  saint susan  and that it s from his name .  what is his name .    russo shook his head .   i don t know .  susan can t remember .  susan never remembers names .  she knows i m frank  but she calls everyone else  johnny .   she don t remember the guy s name .  maybe he never told her for all i know .     that s it  then .  nothing else .    russo shook his head again .   that s it .  so what do i do .  how do i find this guy .    gonzalo said   i m afraid your sister must have it all wrong .   saint susan  seems silly  and it can t have a connection with the guy .  he s not named susan  i m sure .  unless there s a man s name that sounds like susan .    drake said   sampson .  simpson .    gonzalo said   saint sampson .  saint simpson .  those are worse than saint susan .    pritchard raised his hand .   gentlemen .  pardon me .     yes  haskell   said halsted .    i know i m not a member of the black widowers and can t vote .  but can i participate in this discussion .     oh  sure .  there was no intention of excluding you .    pritchard said   might susan not be this fellow s last name .  if he lives in larchmont  you could look up people with that last name in the phone book .    russo looked disappointed .   i thought of that myself  and i looked up the larchmont phone book .  no last   name susans there .  course  i could try other towns .  he coulda driven susan to the larchmont station from some other town .     well  let s see now   said rubin .   can there be a little more subtlety to it .  susan is a very common name .  in fact  i have seen statements that at the present time it is the most common of all feminine names  commoner even than mary .  it dates back to the popular apocryphal book susanna and the elders  which was eventually stuck on to the book of daniel .    he smirked a bit through his sparse beard and said   i m sorry if i sound a bit pedantic .  generally  i leave that sort of thing to you  jeff  but  susanna and the elders  is generally considered to be the first detective story in western literature and so it interests me professionally .    trumbull said   and does this have any point besides the fact that it interests you .     yes  it does  because susanna is the english form of the hebrew name shoshannah  which happens to mean  lily .     gonzalo said   and you claim this guy s name is lily .     his last name   said rubin coldly   might be lily  or lilly with two l s .  why not .    avalon said   it might be  and if mr .  russo is fully determined to follow every lead  i suppose he might follow that one .  however  i cannot imagine anyone but the most devoted pedant   such as the one you all insist on labelling me as   would  if he wanted to name the house for himself  do so by way of the hebrew version of the name  just in order to end up with  saint susan .   surely he might as well name it  saint lily  and have done with it .     well   said halsted   has anyone else got any ideas .    there was silence around the table  and halsted said   i am sorry  mr .  russo  but the information you have given us simply isn t enough .  perhaps you had better take the attitude that your sister has not really been harmed and decide that though the incident was deplorable  there is nothing to do now but forget it .     no   said russo  stubbornly .   i can t forget it .  i ll have to keep looking .  if it takes all my life   he added melodramatically .   he rose   i m sorry you can t help me .  i m sorry i busted into your dinner .     wait a while   said gonzalo .   what is this .  no one has asked henry yet .    halsted said   i asked if anyone else had any ideas .  that includes henry  doesn t it .  henry  do i have to ask you specifically .    henry looked apologetic .   it is difficult for me  mr .  halsted  to think of myself as a black widower .     that s very irritating  henry   said halsted .   there s not a banquet that passes that we don t tell you that you re a black widower .     and the best one of all   muttered trumbull .    so do you have a suggestion to make .   asked halsted .   henry said   not exactly just yet  but i have a question to ask .     then go ahead and ask it .    and russo said   well  go ahead  waiter .  if you re one of the bunch  go and ask .     mr .  russo   said henry   you said that your sister doesn t remember names .  if you were to suggest a specific name to her  do you suppose she would remember whether that name was that of the man who had carried her off .    russo hesitated .   i don t know .  you say any name to her  and she might say   yeah  that s the name   just to be agreeable  you know .     but suppose i give you three names and you try all three and she picks out one of them and says that s the one and not the other two .  would that be reliable .     it might be   said russo  doubtfully .   i never tried anything like that .     can you reach your sister by telephone  mr .  russo .     yeah .  sure .  she s at home right now  with my girlfriend .     then call her and ask her if the man s name was bill .  then ask her if the man s name was joe .  and then ask her if the man s name was fred .    russo looked toward the others .  halsted said   there s a phone over there by the cloakroom .   he held up a dime .   russo said   i got a dime  thank you .   he put it into the slot and dialled .   hello  josephine  it s frank .  listen  is susan sleeping .    can you get her to the telephone .    well  i know  but it s important .  tell her she ll make me happy if she comes to the telephone and it ll only take a minute and then she can go back to the program .  okay .   he waited  and said   she s watching television .    hello  susan  you okay .  yeah  this is frank .  i got to ask you a question .  do you remember the guy who took you for a ride in his car .  yes  yes  that guy  but don t tell me what he did .  i know .  i know .  okay  listen  susan doll  this guy  was his name bill .    he put his hand over the mouthpiece and said in a hoarse whisper to the black widowers generally   she says maybe .  you can t tell from that .     try joe   said henry in a low voice .    susan   said russo into the phone .   maybe it was joe .  do you think it was joe  honey .    again his hand went over the mouthpiece and he shook his head .   she says maybe .  she ll say that to anything i try .    henry said   now try fred .     susan   said russo .   what about fred .  could it have been fred .    there was a pause and then he stared wildly over his shoulder at the black widowers .   she s screaming   it s freddie .  it s freddie .  that s his name .    he held the telephone receiver in their direction and the sound of girlish squealing was clear .    thanks  susan   russo said into the mouthpiece .   you re a good girl .  now go and watch television .    yes  i ll be home soon .    he hung up the phone and said   it s fred all right .  that was no  maybe  just to be nice .  that was jumping up and down .  how did you know .    henry smiled faintly .   it was just a guess .  you see  there was an eighteenth   century prussian monarch  named frederick the great     at this  avalon started suddenly and said   good god  henry  why do these things occur to you  when i miss them completely .     i am sure  mr .  avalon  that given another few minutes of thought  it would have occurred to you  too .     hold on   said russo  frowning   what is all this .  what s this frederick the great got to do with anything .     well   said henry   frederick was a hardworking monarch who built a small castle in a rural setting to which he could retire once in a while and be relatively free of the cares of the state .  it was rather like an american president taking off for camp david for the weekend .  at this castle  frederick would get together with scholars and writers and indulge in intellectual conversations .  he called this castle  without care  or  without worry .   i thought of that when you described how that man told your sister not to worry and then pointed out the name of his house as though there were a connection .    russo said  a look of honest bewilderment on his face   he called his house  don t worry  .     not quite .  frederick the great  although he ruled a german kingdom  spoke french  and he called his castle by the french phrase meaning  without care .   he called it sans souci .  i imagine that this man who carried off your sister is named frederick and that he has had enough of an education to have heard of sans souci and had the affectation to copy the great frederick in this respect .  i am sure  mr .  russo  that if you go to larchmont or the neighboring towns and check the city or town directories for a house by that name owned by someone whose first name is frederick  you will find it .    russo said   is this real .  san soosee .  i never heard of it .  but sure  susan would think it was saint suzie .  and even if she wants to be called susan  all her life she s been called suzie and she would get the two mixed up  and say it was saint susan .   he looked up grimly  and rubbed his right fist into the palm of his left hand .   i think i m gonna find this guy .     you may indeed do so   said henry   but if you do  may i make a suggestion .    sure .     we of the black widowers can t encourage violence .  if it should be that this frederick is a married man with a respectable position in the community    would merely discuss the matter with his wife .  you will avoid what might be a serious brush with the law  and i think the results would then be far more unpleasant to the man than a bruised face would be .    russo thought awhile .   maybe .   and he left .   avalon said   that was a cruel suggestion  henry .     the man had performed a cruel deed   said henry .   afterword  here is another case in which  as in  the good samaritan   i have managed to bend the usual formula without doing irrevocable harm to it .  after all  by now the black widowers have solved no fewer than forty   seven problems and it is not in the least implausible that the word might have gotten out  and that  therefore  something would happen as it did in this story   an intrusion .   and so i say farewell once again  and very reluctantly .  there are few stories i write that i enjoy as much as i enjoy my black widowers  and having written forty   eight of them altogether has not in the least diminished my pleasure or worn out their welcome to my typing fingers .  i can t guarantee that this is true of my readers as well  but i certainly hope it is .
