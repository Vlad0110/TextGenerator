asimov   s  robots  in time    invader    william f .  wu  copyright            databank by matt elson      this novel is dedicated to the memory of my maternal grandmother   mae franking   who passed her english and scottish descent to me and became the first novelist in the family .       special thanks are due during the time of writing this novel to dr .  william q .  wu and cecile f .  wu  my parents  for indulging my lifelong interest in history  riucia mainhardt  bridgett and marty marquardt  michael d .  toman  and john betancourt  leigh grossman  keith r .  a .  decandido  and byron preiss .            r .  hunter  a humaniform robot  waited as steve chang looked up at him angrily .  they stood in the small office of mojave center governor  in the underground city of mojave center .  steve began to pace .      i hardly slept at all  hunter     steve growled .     jane could be anywhere in the world  at any time in history .  that   s the toughest kidnapping to solve anyone could imagine .  we have to start looking for her .  once we get going  i   ll get back to normal .         you know that r .  ishihara cannot allow her to be harmed under the first law of robotics     said hunter .     that will not change  no matter where they are .         i know  i know      a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm         steve droned impatiently .     but ishihara is working for wayne nystrom  renegade roboticist     said steve .     that tells us how great ishihara   s judgment must be .  i don   t trust him to follow the first law responsibly .         dr .  nystrom apparently convinced ishihara to help him under the first law     said hunter .     once he had done that  ishihara had no choice but to obey him under the second law .  however  ishihara will protect both jane and dr .  nystrom from immediate harm .         so who cares if the second law of robotics says     a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law     if the human giving orders can   t be trusted .         i do not predict that jane will be with them long     said hunter .     wayne nystrom will be searching for mc   in the same time and place we will .  that narrows the search for jane considerably .  our search for mc   will take us to them .         well  we know about when and where to find them  then     said steve .     so let   s go .         not so fast .     hunter turned and eased his body into the desk chair .      why not .         we must prepare this mission with the same care we used in the others .  since we are going back to fifth century britain  i will retain my present appearance .  it is consistent with the gene pool of the local people we will meet .     a brawny six feet six inches tall with short blond hair and blue eyes  hunter had been designed with the ability to change his shape and appearance at will .      all right  fine .  that   s your department  it won   t matter to me .  what else do we have to do .     steve put both fists on his hips and glared at hunter .     i   ve already taken the vaccines you arranged this morning .  i assume you   ve prepared period clothing  just as you did before .           yes .  i took the clothing to the bohung institute while you were trying to sleep .  however  i have hired harriet lane    a new historian  to join us .         well  where is she .         she is due here in a few minutes  i arranged for her to receive her vaccines from r .  cushing  the medical robot who tended your head injury after our fourth mission .  together  we will have to decide how to explain your chinese descent to britons who have never heard of china or seen anyone of your race and ethnicity .         well  we told the ancient germans in roman times that i was a slave from the eastern mediterranean .  that should be good enough .         perhaps .  my internal clock says the time is      p . m .  while we wait for harriet  i must report to the governor robot oversight committee .         all right  i   ll shut up .     steve folded his arms across his chest and continued pacing anxiously .     i just hope she shows up soon .      nodding  hunter called the city computer and instructed it to contact the four members of the governor robot oversight committee for him .  then he waited while they were located for the conference call .  in front of him  steve still stomped back and forth across the small room .   hunter could not avoid making reports to the oversight committee .  he had been designed and built specifically for the committee in order to search for mojave center governor  one of six experimental gestalt robots who were supposed to be running certain cities .  all the other governor robots had mysteriously shut themselves down .  however  mc governor had suddenly divided into the six component gestalt humaniform robots out of which he was comprised and vanished .  no one knew why .   dr .  wayne nystrom  an eccentric roboticist  had designed and built the governor robots .  however  the governor robot oversight committee had been studying their performance and judging their efficiency .  when the governors began to fail  wayne nystrom had apparently felt that his career was in danger .  he had been trying to beat hunter to each of the component robots of mc governor in order to dismantle and examine them for the mysterious flaw that had shut down the first five governors before hunter could reassemble mc governor and turn him over to the oversight committee to complete their study .   when hunter had arrived in mojave center  he had learned that mc governor had modified an existing piece of technology in the bohung institute into a time travel device .  then each of his component robots had miniaturized themselves to microscopic size and fled back in time to a different era  intending to hide forever .  jane believed their motivation was the third law of robotics      a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .     unknown to them  however  a flaw in the miniaturization caused each of them to return to full size at different times  wherever they happened to be .   at that point  they had to masquerade as human .  two dangers presented themselves as a result .  the first was that they could alter the direction of history by living throughout the centuries and causing people to act in different ways  driven by the three laws of robotics .  hunter had to prevent that in order to avoid harm to all humans by having the timeline of history significantly changed .   in addition  when the component robots or their material remains reached the approximate time they had left  they exploded with nuclear force .  as hunter prepared to go back with his team to find mc    he also was monitoring the news broadcasts of a mysterious nuclear explosion in south central england .  only his team members knew that it had been caused by mc   exploding .   now wayne had a robot named r .  ishihara helping him .  originally  hunter had instructed ishihara to apprehend wayne if he returned from the past to the time travel sphere in room f    of the bohung institute .  somehow  the roboticist had used an argument involving the three laws of robotics to induce ishihara to cooperate with him .   on five separate missions  hunter had led his team of humans in pursuit of the other five component robots .  all five had been caught .  now they were here in the office of mc governor  where they stood merged and shut down  waiting for the last component robot in order to complete mc governor again .  once he had been put back together  the oversight committee would investigate why the other governors had shut down and why mc governor had divided and fled .   hunter had reported to the governor robot oversight committee on his progress after each mission .  however  he felt that the existence of time travel held incalculable potential harm for all humans .  for that reason  he had kept it a secret from all except the humans and robots whose help he required .   certainly if the scientists on the oversight committee learned of the time travel  it would never remain a secret .  the discovery would be too valuable for a committee of scientists to ignore .  wayne nystrom had discovered mc governor   s development of time travel on his own  before hunter had learned of it .  hunter could not do anything about that .      hunter  city computer calling .  the governor robot oversight committee is ready for your conference call .         thank you .  please connect me .      as before  the faces of the four committee members appeared on hunter   s internal video screen in split portrait shots from their various locations .  everyone exchanged greetings .  then hunter began his report .      the first five component robots are in custody and merged     said hunter .      that   s great     said dr .  redfield  the tall blonde .     i suppose this has been an easy assignment for you .  you began less than two weeks ago .         i must repeat once again that past success does not predict the difficulty of the final mission     said hunter .     as always  i cannot promise that the remainder of my work will be completed within a similar period of time .         where did this mission take place .     dr .  chin asked .     previously  you have reported quite a wide range of locations around the world .         in northern china     said hunter .     on the border of mongolia .     he remained deliberately vague in his reports .  so far  his reserve had forestalled persistent questioning from the committee members .      northern china .     professor post nodded  idly stroking his black beard for a moment .     well  that   s interesting .  do you have a lead on mc   .         i must investigate the british isles     said hunter .     this is preliminary information .         which one .     dr .  chin asked .      i shall begin in england .  on previous missions  a certain amount of travel has been involved .         wait a minute     said dr .  chin .     haven   t you heard about the big explosion .  won   t that interfere with your search .         i will take it into account as i make my plans     said hunter .      do you think mc   may have been destroyed in the explosion .     professor post asked calmly .      it is an inescapable consideration     said hunter .     however  i can only proceed and find what i may .         i am not surprised     said dr .  khanna  in his hindi accent .     however  your work has been completed very quickly to date .  we are all impressed .         i must repeat that i can make no guarantee of my schedule to come     said hunter .      yes  i heard you the first time     said dr .  khanna  with a trace of annoyance in his tone .     you repeat that warning in every report .  however  you continue to complete each mission in the same length of time .  what would make this final mission any different .         the explosion  and its after effects     said dr .  redfield .     he may have a harder time now .         my original point remains valid     said hunter .     i have no prediction about the challenges that my team will face .  anything can happen .     hunter realized that he had made a mistake .  before  he had never told the committee members that he was going to an area where a nuclear explosion had occurred .      we note your caution     said dr .  chin .     and as always  we wish you good luck .         that will be fine  hunter     said dr .  redfield .     i suggest we allow you to get to work .         thank you     said hunter .     i am ready to begin .  do you have any final questions .      no one did .      good luck     said dr .  chin .      thank you .  good bye .     hunter broke the connection and turned to steve  speaking aloud .     report completed .         good .     steve glanced impatiently at the closed door of the office .     so where   s our historian .         i expect her at any time .         all right  all right .  what do we do in the meantime .  do we know what mc     s specialty was  within mc governor   s responsibilities .  jane always seemed to think that was important .         i have that information     said hunter .     the data the committee originally gave me about mc governor provides the original divisions of expertise among the gestalt robots .  since jane correctly identified the specialties of the first five component robots  i know by process of elimination that mc   is the portion of mc governor that specialized in maintaining social stability among humans .         yeah .  what does that mean  exactly .         in mojave center  that meant keeping track of various human needs  not only for survival and protection from harm  but for emotional satisfaction  leisure pursuits  choices of education and career  and career organization to encourage challenges and accomplishments .         okay .  but jane also used to guess that a component robot   s choice of where to hide related to his specialty in mojave center .         yes  i remember .  using the same sort of logic jane expressed prior to earlier missions  i surmise that mc   therefore deliberately fled with the question of social instability in mind .  however  england is an unusual case  since       it has had a relatively high degree of stability for an old world nation  despite some occasional turbulence .  however  i calculate that mc   will return to his full human size from miniaturization in the late fifth century  in a time of extreme social turmoil and political instability .  since he did not plan that  the timing is ironic  to say the least .      steve started to answer .  when he heard footsteps approaching the office  he stopped and glanced at hunter  who nodded .  steve opened the door .      oh   you startled me .     harriet smiled and came in as steve stepped back .  she was tall and slender  about forty years old  with short  wavy brown hair .   hunter introduced them .     harriet specializes in late roman and post roman britain .         i love the period     harriet said cheerfully .     and i   ve had my dinner and my vaccinations  as you instructed .  what comes next .         have you both successfully taken your sleep courses in ancient british and latin .     hunter asked .      yes     said harriet .     i was familiar with both languages  but the course will help me speak them .         i took the british  too     said steve .     and i updated the latin from our third mission because hunter said it had changed some in the centuries that had passed .  but what is this british language  anyhow .  did it turn into english later .         not really     said harriet .     it   s the language that was spoken in britain before the romans arrived  and it coexisted with latin during their occupation .  it later evolved into welsh  cornish  and breton .  but what we call english was based originally on anglo saxon and norman french .         but we   ll still need the latin this time  too .     steve asked .      we   ll find a lot of latin in the time we   re visiting     said harriet .     but it doesn   t stay for many more years .  except for some monasteries and place names  latin disappears and then reenters english again much later .         oh .  shows what i know about it .     steve turned to hunter .     have you told harriet about wayne and ishihara .  how they   re trying to beat us to mc   and why .         yes  he has     said harriet .     he also told me that they kidnapped your friend jane on your last mission .  i   m sure you   re worried about her .         well  yeah .  that   s true .     steve looked at hunter .     can we go yet .         we will go to the bohung institute .  the security vehicle is waiting outside .         good .      hunter drove them through the calm  clean streets of the underground city .  steve sat next to harriet  too tense to speak .  the electric motor of the vehicle hummed softly as they drove by humans and robots on their daily routines who were unaware that the secret of time travel  with all its potential danger to change history  lay in their midst .   before the first mission  hunter had closed the bohung institute .  he had arranged for a detail of security robots to guard it .  they allowed his team inside  of course  and they walked to room f    .          steve looked around the familiar room .  room f    was a large facility that housed an opaque sphere about fifteen meters in diameter .  with its console  the sphere could both miniaturize humans and robots to microscopic size and also send them back through time  in either normal or microscopic condition .  countertops lined the rest of the room  filled with computers  monitors  a communication console  and miscellaneous office equipment .   hunter introduced harriet to r .  daladier  a robot he had left in the room to apprehend wayne nystrom and ishihara if they returned unexpectedly .   steve waited anxiously  knowing the team would have to discuss the mission further and change clothes before hunter would actually take them back in time .      i arranged to have period costumes made for us earlier today     said hunter .  he pointed to four neatly folded stacks of clothing on one counter .  four sets of leather boots stood next to them .     please check them for authenticity .  no synthetics have been used .         i see four outfits     said steve .     we only have three of us this time .         we will take a full costume for jane     said hunter .     i expect to find her  but she may need period clothing .  she left china in the time of kublai khan wearing a robe and trousers from that culture .         right .      harriet lifted a long  brown tunic and shook it out .     tunics for you two .  wool  of course  that   s right .  a rope belt .  loosely cut  longer than kneelength .  it looks fine .     she lifted another .     this white undertunic is made of cotton .  it was expensive in ancient britain .  a sign of prosperity .  and i see the shift i will wear under my wool gown is also made of cotton .         underclothing of cotton will be fur more comfortable for you two than wool  fur  or any other acceptable choice     said hunter .     i believe the comfort will increase your efficiency .  besides  suggesting a hint of prosperity can be part of the roles we will play .         as you decide .     harriet lifted her gown  also of brown wool .     full length  loose  and blousy .  .  .  long sleeves .  yes  this will be fine  too .         what about the boots .     steve asked .   harriet picked up one of them .     about these roles  hunter .  what are they .         from the historical data i have taken from the city library  i suggest that i play the role of a horse trader from gaul .  you two will masquerade as my wife and servant .  unless you find a flaw in this plan  i would like to say that i wish to move away from the crumbling  unstable roman empire in gaul and raise my horse herds in britain .         go on .     she put down the first boot and studied another one .      i learned that southern england in this time has ideal horse grazing land and that artorius  the man upon whom the legend of king arthur was based  led a troop of cavalry .  he would have to be concerned about a reliable source of mounts for his men .         hold it     said steve  grinning in spite of his eagerness to get on their way .     we aren   t taking any horses with us .  you can   t horse trade without them .         i propose to say that i am looking for land in britain before bringing my herd over the channel     said hunter .     would this sound reasonable .         the boots are acceptable  too .     harriet paused thoughtfully as she put the last boot down .     yes  your story will be plausible  though you could improve on it .  however  bringing something to trade would be more convincing .  you could be an ironworker  a trader in silver  a soldier .  .  . the list of possibilities is very long .         i chose the role after due consideration     said hunter .     i must playa role that will carry some prestige without having to take material objects into the past .  we must take some coins and our clothing  but every item we take increases the chance of influencing history in a way we do not intend and cannot predict .  the role of soldier might put steve into greater danger than i would prefer .         ah   you   re a believer in chaos theory as applied to the events of history .     she smiled  amused .      i no longer believe in the most pure and extreme form of chaos theory     said hunter .     my team has made five missions into the past without altering our own time in any way that i can detect .         good .  then you   re coming around to my way of thinking about this .         not entirely     said hunter .     i tell each historian i hire that i do not know where the threshold of significant change lies .  if i can go into the past as a horse trader so that we do not have to take any merchandise with us  then we take the least risk .         i do not believe in it at all     said harriet  casually .     but you   re the boss .  i accept your priorities .         i still say a horse trader would take horses with him     said steve .     even just one stallion to show off .  the people we see are going to expect that .         we can claim we brought a couple of horses that were lost in a storm as we sailed across the channel     said harriet .     that was not unheard of in these times .         am i correct in concluding that artorius must value the source of his mounts .     hunter asked .      oh  yes .  the single greatest advantage the britons have over the saxons is their training in roman cavalry strategy and tactics .  you see  the saxons in this time are unmounted but numerous .  artorius had to keep his men supplied with good  healthy horses .         good     said hunter .  he pointed to three cloth pouches on the counter .     we also have a small pouch of coins from this period for each of us to carry .         late roman coins .     she pulled one open and drew out one of the coins .     since we will claim to have come from gaul  that would be our currency .  britain primarily still uses the same  but some native coins had to be minted  too .         our coins are all late roman .  also  we have a small bag for steve to carry .  it contains a change of underclothing for each of you and some bread  cheese  and dried meat .  i do not know how long it will take us to find food for you .         it shouldn   t be too hard     said harriet .     southern england remained heavily romanized culturally and densely populated for many years after the romans left britain on its own .      steve picked up the bag and looked inside .     okay .  i   ll put jane   s clothes and boots in here .         i will prepare the console .  please take turns changing your clothes in the next room .      steve waited while harriet changed first .  hunter walked to the console that controlled the sphere and altered the settings .  steve began to pace again .      are you taking us back at night again .     steve asked  glancing up at hunter .     since we   re leaving in the evening .         i feel this works best     said hunter .     we arrive in near darkness to avoid notice .         i   d rather go back in daylight so we can start looking for jane right away .         you will be ready to sleep in several more hours     said hunter .     if we go back at a time that conflicts with your own sleep schedule  then you and harriet will be inefficient .  matching your schedule to arrive in daylight would now require waiting until tomorrow morning to leave .         well   forget it  then .  let   s just go .      harriet returned from the other room  wearing her long gown and leather boots .     how do i look .         very authentic     said hunter .   harriet laughed lightly .     i don   t think that   s what i was asking  but thanks  anyway .      steve grinned but said nothing as he went to change in the adjoining room .  he emerged wearing the long tunics and boots  which felt similar to the tunic he had worn to ancient germany in roman times .      the console is ready     said hunter .     harriet  you should know that i have the belt unit that will trigger it  even from the time to which we are going .  after we arrive  i will carry it in a hollow space within my torso .         all right .     harriet nodded  tugging at her gown to straighten it over her rope belt .     hunter  when we first discussed the mission  you told me we would visit the site of the archaeological dig now known as cadbury castle in the time of artorius .  how about telling us now exactly when in time our destination is .         and tell me where cadbury castle is     steve added .     i   m still in the dark .         cadbury castle lies in somerset  in central southern england     said hunter .     the modern town of south cadbury lies immediately to the north .  farther north  but within sight  is the city of glastonbury .  we will arrive on the evening of april     in a . d .      .      steve grinned .     i still don   t know where we   re going  except that we   ll be in england .         it won   t be the england most people think of     said harriet    the roman empire left britain to fend for itself against invading barbarians in a . d .      .  the same celtic tribes who lived there before the romans arrived still remained  but now they had a strong roman cultural and military influence .  by a . d .       when we   ll arrive  the britons will have been resisting the saxons who had invaded and settled along the humber and wash rivers in southeastern britain for half a century .  the failing roman empire still just barely exists across the english channel in gaul .         i think i got the gist of that .     steve shrugged  still grinning .      i   m sure we   ll all manage just fine .      hunter opened the sphere .  he helped harriet climb inside first .  by this time  the routine was familiar to steve  as always  he slid down the curved interior surface to the bottom  where harriet already sat .  hunter climbed in  closing the sphere after him to leave them in darkness .     jane maynard landed with a thump on wet grass .  a cold drizzle fell from a dark  overcast sky .  she pushed herself up and brushed her long  brown hair out of her eyes .  wayne nystrom got up on her right  ishihara  still holding her right arm in one hand  remained on her left .      foul weather     wayne muttered .      where are we now .     jane demanded .  a few moments ago by subjective measuring  wayne and ishihara had forcibly taken her away from the palace grounds of kublai khan in thirteenth century china .  first  to escape hunter  they had simply jumped a few hours ahead  to the peasant village where they had been staying .  then wayne had taken a few moments to reset his belt unit before bringing them here  wherever it was .      we   re in britain  two thirty in the afternoon of april     a . d .          said wayne .   ishihara stood  then helped jane to her feet .     this cool  damp weather is potentially harmful to humans .  we must find shelter for you  especially before nightfall .      jane looked around  tugging her chinese robe tightly around her .  beneath it  she also wore matching baggy trousers .  shepherds sat huddled under trees in the distance  surrounded by their flocks in the drizzle  none were looking this way .  most of the terrain was open  rolling grassland  with clumps of trees scattered here and there .  some tilled fields lay among them  with young shoots too small to identify from here .  in the distance  she could see two high hills  one much farther away than the other .  a small village lay on the plateau of the nearer hill  and an outer wall of earth and wood surrounded its base .      that   s why i brought us here in the middle of the afternoon     said wayne .     we have some time before sundown .     he smiled suddenly .     we have even more time before hunter gets here .         what do you mean .     ishihara asked .      i guess it doesn   t matter if jane hears this .  i estimate that mc   will return to his full size in a couple of days .  hunter has repeatedly arrived within twenty four hours of the time when the component robots return to normal size .     wayne handed the belt unit to ishihara .      what about it .     jane asked casually  as though the point meant nothing .  she watched ishihara put the belt unit inside his chinese peasant blouse .  then  under the cloth  he opened his torso and hid the unit inside .      therefore  we should have a few days to learn our way around  establish some contacts  and be prepared for both mc   and hunter   s team before they arrive .     wayne shook his head .     i should have tried this before  but in places like a buccaneer town and the russian front in world war ii  i didn   t want to stay any longer than i had to .  and in the dinosaur age and in ancient germany  i hadn   t figured it out yet .         but you planned to make friends with those peasants in china .     jane asked .      no  it just worked out that way     said wayne .     but now  when hunter arrives  he must consider your welfare  too .  combining some earlier preparations with that problem for him gives me the best chance i have had yet .  ishihara  i instruct you to shut off your radio reception now and keep it off until i order otherwise .      jane understood .  when hunter arrived  he might attempt to communicate directly with ishihara .  wayne did not want any communication between them .   wayne looked around .     ishihara  suggest where we should go .         i propose we walk to the nearest peasant hut .     he pointed to a hut from which a narrow  lazy trail of smoke drifted low in the air .  a narrow road meandered among the hills  passing by the hut .     before we can communicate with more than gestures  i will have to begin learning the local language .  if the response is hostile  we can walk along the road to meet someone else  perhaps in that village .         maybe we should try the village first .  that looks a more likely place for mc   to show up .         a village offers more potential harm  as well     said ishihara .     if we can find lodging elsewhere  then we can visit the village later .         yeah  okay .      ishihara led them through the drizzle toward the hut he had chosen .  he did not bother to take jane   s arm .  she walked behind him  with wayne next to her .   jane knew ishihara had no reason to fear she would run away from them right now .  until she knew that hunter and steve had arrived  and where they were  she had nowhere to go .  she would certainly be safer in ishihara   s company than anywhere else here  and she saw no chance she could get the belt unit out of ishihara   s torso .   for now  she would just have to bide her time .          as they approached the hut  jane could smell bread baking .  she was not hungry  but she liked the familiar aroma .  a donkey grazing behind the hut stopped and looked up at them .  near it  a small farm wagon had been left under a tree .  the entire scene made the locale seem less strange .      hold it     said wayne  stopping .     does anybody know what language they speak here .         no     said ishihara .   jane said nothing .  she blinked drizzle out of her eyes and rubbed her arms together .      my history isn   t too good     said wayne .     are the romans still here .         the roman empire ceased to defend britain in a . d .          said ishihara .      if the romans left  i suppose no one speaks latin here any more     said wayne .     i took that sleep course in latin for that trip to roman germany .  you accessed latin then  too .  maybe some people here still speak it .         we can make an attempt to communicate with latin     said ishihara .   jane had also taken the latin sleep course before the mission to ancient germany .  since wayne and ishihara did not ask her about it  however  she chose not to volunteer the fact .  she had no specific plan in mind  but keeping her facility with latin a secret seemed like a good idea .      please go first     wayne said to ishihara .      of course .     ishihara walked toward the front door of the hut .   suddenly a couple of dogs barked in the distance behind them .  ishihara stopped and turned .  jane looked  also  and saw two shepherds hurrying down a nearby hill from their flock of sheep .  their dogs  both large and black  ran ahead of them .      we must wait here     said ishihara quickly .     do not alarm the dogs by moving suddenly .  i will speak to the men when they reach us .      a woman came to the door of the hut .  four children peered from around her long  full skirt made of some rough cloth .  the youngest was a toddler  the eldest maybe ten or eleven years old .  none of them spoke .  all of them stared cautiously at the strangers .      it   s our clothes  i guess     said wayne quietly .     jane has a fancy chinese robe and pants and we have chinese peasant outfits .  we   ll never explain them .         maybe we can use the clothes to our advantage     said jane .     i   m richly dressed by peasant standards .  they may be afraid of us as strangers  but they might not want to turn away an important lady .  and only our clothing is strange .  we looked more out of place in china  no matter what kind of clothes we wore .         well  that   s true     wayne said slowly .  he turned to study her face .     but why are you so willing to cooperate all of a sudden .         i need food and shelter as much as you do .  we can   t just spend the next few days standing out in the rain .         yeah .      suddenly the two dogs ran up  still barking .  they dodged and danced around  cautious but not attacking .  jane slowly extended one hand for them to sniff .  instead  they both jumped back .      i suggest we masquerade as a wealthy lady and her two servants     said ishihara .      whatever you think will work     said wayne .      we are fortunate to have no weapons     said ishihara .     we will appear as less of a danger .      as the shepherds drew near  they slowed to a walk .  jane saw that one was only twelve or thirteen years old .  the other appeared to be his father .   ishihara greeted them in latin  speaking in a formal tone .     good day .  we are strangers here  seeking shelter from the rain .      the shepherd showed no sign of understanding him .  he nodded politely and said something they could not understand .  then he waited expectantly .   ishihara lifted his hand  feeling the drizzle  and spoke in latin again .     we would like to have shelter from the rain  at least for a short time .     he gestured toward the hut and patted his abdomen .     if you can spare any small amount of food  it would be very welcome .      the shepherd nodded  speaking again  and pointed to the village on top of the hill in the distance .      he wants us to go to the village .     ishihara continued speaking in latin  since wayne and jane both understood him .     i do not see how we can force ourselves on this family without causing them harm .         they must be more scared than they seem     said jane .      we don   t have any money to pay for food     said wayne .     or a place to stay .         maybe ishihara can do chores in exchange for hospitality .     jane glanced around .  behind the hut  she saw a small stack of cut firewood and a loose pile of uncut tree branches near it .  some unsplit logs lay scattered around .     here   tell him i have a bad leg .         huh .     wayne looked at her .   jane turned toward the woman in the doorway .  with a hopeful smile  jane patted her leg under her long robe and took a limping step toward the hut .  the peasant woman looked down and suddenly shooed her children out of the way and gestured to jane to come inside .   as jane feigned a limp to the doorway  her hostess pulled a small  three legged stool forward .  she took jane   s arm and helped her to the stool  speaking in a soothing tone .  jane sat down out of the drizzle but just inside the hut  where she could see the others .   her husband watched cautiously for a moment  not speaking .  then his wife spoke sharply to him .  he nodded and spoke to his eldest son .  the boy nodded and plodded back up the hill toward the flock of sheep  calling one of the dogs to follow him .  the other dog walked to jane  its tail wagging  and sniffed her hand .      the man   s not going to leave the hut while we   re here  is he .     wayne grinned .     i guess i wouldn   t  either .  but now what do we do .         ishihara  cut some wood for them     jane said quietly .     don   t ask about it  because i think hospitality will force them to decline your offer .  just begin .         i do not see an ax or any other tool to use     said ishihara  looking around the small pile of wood that was already cut .   jane looked around the hut .     i can see some axes just inside the door here .      ishihara leaned inside  picked up a long handled ax  and carried it to the uncut wood .  without a word  he picked up an unsplit log and began to split it .  the shepherd watched him for a moment  then walked to the doorway .  he picked up another ax and joined ishihara .      i guess he figures if he can   t tend the sheep  he might as well get something done     said wayne .   the peasant woman stood over jane and spoke .  from her tone and facial expression  jane felt she was asking a question  but none of her words meant anything to jane .  all jane could do was shrug helplessly .      ygerna .     the woman pointed to herself .     oh   your name is ygerna .     jane touched her own chest with her finger .      jane .         jane .         yes .     jane nodded  smiling .   her hostess knelt and patted her own leg where jane had indicated her leg was sore .  she spoke again  asking the same question as before .  when jane shrugged apologetically  ygerna stood up and went outside .      would they object if i came in out of the rain .     wayne asked .     i don   t want to mess up a good situation  but i guess they do have the idea that you   re important and we   re your servants .         i think you   re right .     jane smiled .     come on in .  we   ll see what she does .  as long as we   re considerate  i think we   ll be all right .      wayne came inside the hut .  he squatted down across the doorway from jane .   the children stared at both of them  whispering among themselves  but they focused most of their attention on jane   s chinese robe .   ygerna bustled back inside  holding what appeared to be two handfuls of mud  grass  and other plants .  she carried this mixture to the back of the hut  where she knelt with her back to jane .  her children gathered around her  watching to see what she was going to do .   as ygerna knelt in front of a narrow brick fireplace on the far side from the door  jane looked around the hut for the first time .  a portion of the hut had been sectioned off by a curtain hanging from the ceiling .  since she could see small sleeping pallets on the near side of the fireplace  she guessed that the curtain hid their parents    pallet .  one rough wooden table stood in the center of the room  with wooden stools around it .  above the fire  a small metal door was inset into the chimney .  ygerna poured water from an earthenware pitcher into a metal pot and hung it on a hook over the fire .   a few minutes later  ygerna stirred the mud packs into the steaming  small metal pot .  then she carried the pot to jane and knelt at her feet .  her children followed her but hung back slightly  still watching with fascination .   ygerna gently moved jane   s robe back over the leg jane had pretended was hurting her .  carefully  ygerna slipped the leg of jane   s trousers up .  as jane watched in silence  ygerna straightened her leg slightly and then began to smear the mud poultice on it .  jane realized that the purpose of this treatment  aside from any superstition the culture might have  was to apply and hold the heat against her injury .   feeling trapped  jane said nothing .  when ygerna looked up and asked her another unintelligible question  jane nodded and smiled appreciatively .  over ygerna   s shoulder  wayne caught jane   s eye and smiled with amusement .   when ygerna had finished  she quietly lifted the pot and carried it outside .  she dumped the remaining mud onto the ground and set down the pot to catch rainwater .  then  catching the drizzle on her hands  she wiped them off .   ishihara and ygerna   s husband continued to chop and split wood rhythmically .   ygerna called out to her husband  who stopped swinging his ax and turned to look at her .  they spoke briefly  then he nodded and brought his ax back to the hut .  leaving it inside the doorway  he walked back toward his flock of sheep .  the dog that had remained at the hut trotted after him .      i guess they decided we   re okay     said wayne  looking out the doorway .   ygerna walked back inside the hut and knelt by the fire again .   ishihara paused and turned to speak to wayne and jane .     i have made a small amount of rudimentary progress communicating with emrys .         is that his name .     jane asked .     hers is ygerna .  that   s all i   ve learned .         yes  he is named emrys .  he knows a few latin words and phrases after all .  when i first spoke to him  he kept that a secret  but he has opened up now .  his limited latin facilitated our communication .  i now know a few words and phrases in his own language .         do you know what he   s doing now .     wayne nodded toward emrys as he hiked up the slope toward his flock of sheep .     where   s he going .         i believe ygerna told him to bring back a sheep to slaughter for dinner     said ishihara .     we must wait and see what he does to know if i understood their conversation correctly .      jane looked up the hill sharply .     then we   ve made a change in their lives   a big one .  every one of their sheep must be valuable to them .         your apparent status as a lady has made the sacrifice worthwhile  i believe     said ishihara .      hold it     said wayne .     we can   t possibly eat a whole sheep  even the whole bunch of us .         his family can eat the rest  or sell it     said jane .     but maybe we should move on tomorrow morning .  we could be much too disruptive to this family .         we still have no money to buy food elsewhere     said ishihara .      i don   t think we   re going to do any real damage     said wayne .     this kind of thing isn   t likely to change history .  come on  jane   one sheep .         we should be careful  at least     said jane .     as hunter keeps saying  no one knows where the threshold of change lies .  what if some descendants of emrys and ygerna are important at some point in english history .  or even on the world stage someday  even centuries later .  and what if we disrupt their immediate family in some way that alters their health or survival .         you have a point     said ishihara .     however  if we can return the value of their sacrifice  we lower the likelihood of changing their lives because of the sheep .         what do you mean .     wayne asked .      i will cut as much wood as i can without revealing that i am not human .  this will save emrys from the chore .  if we can help in other ways  i suggest we do so .         yeah  i get it .         you were right     said jane .     look .      up on the hill  the dog emrys had taken with him had cut one sheep out of the flock .  emrys had already started back and the dog was herding the single sheep back down the slope with him .  emrys   s son and the other dog had moved behind him and prevented the rest of the flock from following .   a metallic squeak sounded in the hut .  jane turned and saw ygerna open the small metal door in the chimney over the fire .  using a cloth to protect her hands  ygerna pulled out a loaf of bread in a pan .  she set it down on the hearth and closed the oven door .   when emrys arrived with the sheep  he took it behind the hut .  jane felt relieved .  butchering sheep would be normal for him  but she did not want to watch .  ishihara continued to cut and split logs .   jane sat patiently  glad to be out of the drizzle and relieved that they would be fed and  she felt certain  given shelter for the night .  on the other hand  the realization that she was trapped with wayne and ishihara for at least several more days finally sank in .  even when hunter arrived  she might not be able to get away immediately .  surviving in this time without money to spend would require genuine effort .   ygerna kneaded more bread dough and put it in the bread pan .  while it rose she went outside and around to the back .  her children trailed after her  but wayne and jane stayed inside the hut .   after a few minutes ygerna came back inside  carrying a large cut of mutton .  she knelt again at the hearth and began cutting it into smaller pieces with a large knife .  outside the hut again  she filled a large cookpot with water from a cistern and carried it back to the fire .  she hung the pot over the fire and dropped the chunks of mutton into the water .  in a few minutes  the water began to boil .      smells horrible     wayne whispered .      the meat can   t be bad     said jane quietly .     it   s really fresh .  maybe mutton always smells like that .  i   ve never had any .      with effort  emrys carried a large  bulging cloth bag to a tree and threw a rope over a low hanging branch .  from the size of the burden and the blood soaking the bag  jane saw that it held the sheep carcass .  he hoisted the bag into the air  high enough to keep the dogs away from it .   jane understood that the cool temperature would preserve it for a while .  it still looked like too much meat for his family alone to eat before it spoiled .  obviously  he had the same problem every time he slaughtered a sheep  so he would have some normal routine to avoid wasting the meat .  she wondered what it would be .          the drizzle continued through the afternoon .  as the day cooled  the wind came up and the drizzle turned to rain .  emrys called for his son to bring the flock back to a small pen behind the hut .  then the boy joined the family inside .  ishihara went on chopping wood .   emrys started to close the door of the hut against the rain .  with a questioning glance at jane  he paused to point to ishihara .      ishihara  come in     jane said in english .     if you were human  you   d be exhausted by now .         of course .     ishihara brought his ax  stopping to wipe the mud from his feet on a patch of grass before he came inside the hut .  then he dried the ax blade on a rag that hung on a hook next to the other ax .   just as emrys closed the door  jane saw that ishihara had stacked more new firewood than emrys had cut and split before they arrived .   once emrys had closed the door  the fire warmed the hut quickly .  ygerna ladled chunks of boiled mutton onto wooden plates that already held pieces of bread .  she took one first to jane  then served her supposed servants .  emrys received his dinner next  followed by ygerna and the children .   by now jane was very hungry .  she did not really like the mutton  but she knew that emrys and ygerna had sacrificed a sheep for their benefit  so she ate it all .  the bread  chewy and dense  tasted better than it looked .  after everyone had eaten  ygerna served some sort of herbal tea in wooden cups .   jane and wayne did not speak .  however  ishihara pointed to objects around the hut and asked the children to tell him what they were called .  sometimes emrys and ygerna  laughing  helped them .      ishihara seems to be learning to speak with them quickly     said jane .     i guess his knowledge of latin helps  but i wonder how thoroughly he can pick up their native language .         he does very well     said wayne .     he learned rudimentary chinese quickly because he can apply linguistic principles from the languages he knows to a new language .         i see .     jane nodded .  since ishihara had no memory lapses of the kind humans routinely had in the learning process  once he learned patterns and vocabulary  he immediately possessed full use of them .   ishihara turned to wayne .     they want to know where we came from .  what shall i say .         we have to justify our chinese clothing     said jane .     that is  we have to explain why it   s different .  i doubt they ever heard of china .         maybe you can just tell them we came by ship across the channel     said wayne .      that   s it     said jane .     tell them we were shipwrecked by a storm .         i understand     said ishihara .     this will explain why we have no belongings or money .         yeah     said wayne .     it   s perfect .  that   s why a lady with servants could be broke .      ishihara spoke to their hosts  including the children  in short phrases sprinkled with latin .  ygerna  in particular  asked more questions .  finally she and emrys both nodded in understanding .   for the night  jane was given the children   s sleeping pallets .  the children moved behind the curtain with their parents .  emrys gave wayne and ishihara clean wool blankets to roll up in on the floor .   jane bundled up on the sleeping pallet .  the hut remained warm and cozy from the fire .  she fell asleep to the sound of rain on the roof .   in the morning  jane awoke to the sound of the children talking and giggling .  ygerna hustled them outside  when jane opened her eyes  she saw through the open doorway that the rain had stopped  though gray clouds still covered the sky .  under her blanket  she carefully arranged her robe in its proper position  then got up to find the out house .   outside  wayne was splashing water on his face at the cistern .  ishihara had already begun to chop wood again .  the air was cool and brisk .   when jane returned to the hut  ygerna was stirring a pot of hot porridge over the fire .  she served wooden bowls of the thick porridge to everyone around the table .  jane called in ishihara  in order to continue his masquerade as a human .      now what do we do .     wayne asked quietly in english .     are we going to have to leave now .         i don   t know     said jane .     maybe we shouldn   t put too much burden on one family .         should i ask .     ishihara asked .      we should be careful how we phrase the question     said jane .     we don   t want to insult them .         they probably assume we want to get on the road to our ultimate destination     said wayne .     they heard last night that we were shipwrecked and left with nothing  but we still must have been going somewhere .         good point     said jane .     so where are we going .  we   d better have our story straight .      ygema and emrys listened curiously  watching them as they all ate .      i only know the year and our location     said wayne .     i have no idea what   s going on in history now .  where could we have been going .  maybe london .         i can   t help     said jane .     this is why hunter keeps hiring historians to take with him .         i have some rudimentary history of this time  but no more     said ishihara .     the romans settled london several centuries ago under the name londinium  but it   s a long way from here .  we can   t actually go there if we   re going to find mc   in this area .         we better say we were coming to this area all along     said jane .     that will explain why we won   t go very far .  but we don   t know where we are  do we .         on the modern map  yes     said ishihara .     but i know very little about significant locations in this time .         ask emrys     said jane .      what   s that going to accomplish .     wayne snickered .     he already knows we   re lost .         exactly .  and no matter what he says  we   ll tell him this is our destination .         of course     said ishihara .  he turned to emrys and spoke briefly in a mixture of latin and british .  then he switched back to english .     the village on top of the highest hill is cadbury .  the hill itself is called cadbury tor .  this is the home of a man named artorius riothamus .         cadbury what .     wayne asked .      tor .  it means a high hill in the local language .         oh .         is mc   going to show up there .     jane asked .      i believe so     said wayne .     these component robots have been continually drawn to people of power in the hope  i judge  of influencing them to do less harm to the humans within their power .         then cadbury tor really is our destination     said wayne .     tell him that .         and add that we cannot pay for lodging because of the shipwreck     jane added .   ishihara spoke to emrys again .  the shepherd responded  nodding  and gestured outside .  he grinned and gave ishihara a friendly slap on the shoulder .      he has complimented my ability to cut firewood     said ishihara .   jane smiled  struggling to suppress a laugh .      emrys wants to go to cadbury today to sell the rest of the sheep carcass and some of the extra firewood i have cut .  he says he knows that this    humble hut     as he calls it  is not good enough for a lady such as jane  but he has thanked me for the labor i have saved him .         do you think we could stay here another night  if necessary .     wayne asked .      i think if we expressed interest  and i continue to cut wood for him or find other ways to help him  we would be welcome     said ishihara .   jane was relieved to hear that  but said nothing .      good     said wayne .     tell him we   ll be happy to go to cadbury with him .  if we can   t find a place to stay there  then we can talk to him about coming back .         tell ygerna that my leg is well  and thank her for the mud poultice     said jane .     otherwise  i   ll have to fake a limp all day .      ishihara spoke again to emrys and ygerna .  after breakfast  emrys sent his eldest son out again with their dogs to take the flock for the day .  then  at emrys   s direction  ishihara helped him load firewood and the bagged sheep carcass into the donkey cart .   jane looked around the countryside in the brisk morning air .  shepherds led their flocks out again in the distance .  smoke rose from the other huts .  life here  at least today  appeared calm and stable .   while emrys hitched the donkey  ygerna and the younger children came out to watch with jane and wayne .  she pointed to the cart and spoke sharply to emrys .   he nodded and spoke to ishihara  who began rearranging the wood in the cart .      what   s wrong .     wayne asked quietly .     what does ygerna want .         she told emrys we must see that the lady can ride in the cart     said ishihara .     i will form a seat for her with the wood .      when the cart was ready  ishihara lifted jane into the cart .  she found her footing on the uneven firewood and sat down .  once she had settled into the seat he had made  she found that it was actually comfortable .   the sheep carcass lay in the front  near her feet .  she was glad emrys had put it in the cloth bag .  from her high seat on the cart  she looked down at wayne and ishihara .   ishihara turned to wayne .     emrys has room for one more next to him on the driver   s bench .  i will walk  of course .      wayne nodded and climbed up next to emrys .   as emrys shook the reins to drive the donkey  jane looked down at ygerna and the children .  the kids waved shyly .  she waved back  smiling .   the donkey strained under the load but pulled it forward .  the cart creaked slowly out to the road .  ishihara walked near the rear  next to jane .   when they reached the road  jane saw that it was soft and muddy from yesterday   s drizzle .  however  she did not see any tracks in it  the mud had not been stirred up .  the donkey   s hooves and the wheels of the cart sank into it somewhat  but did not get stuck .   jane enjoyed the slow  quiet ride .  now that her immediate worries about shelter  food  and safety had been satisfied  she relaxed .  she could not plan her escape from wayne and ishihara in any detail until she knew that hunter   s team had arrived in this time  and where they were located .  for now  she had nothing to do but observe whatever she could for future reference .   emrys and wayne could not make casual conversation  so they did not speak  jane had no desire to talk to wayne unless she had to .  the cart swayed gently as the donkey plodded slowly along .  jane watched cadbury village as they drew closer .   a wall ringed the village on the plateau .  the fact that the village was protected this way  and lay on the flat top of a high tor surrounded by earthwork ramparts at the base of the tor  told her that this area was not always as peaceful as it was today .  she remembered that mc     s specialty in mojave center had been social stability  and wondered what had drawn him here .   the journey to the base of the tor took over an hour .  by that time  they had passed a couple of people walking along the road .  other people  some of them driving carts or riding horseback  came and went from the tor .  as jane saw the open gate in the earthworks clearly  she looked first at the donkey  then down at ishihara .      is this little donkey going to make it home again .  he must be worn out .         emrys expects to sell the wood and the meat .  the return load will be much lighter .      sentries at the gate glanced at the cart and waved them through without stopping them  though they stared in wonder at jane in her chinese robe .  emrys drove the cart up a steep slope to the top of the tor .  jane saw wayne looking around with interest and did the same .   the defensive earthworks turned out to be more than a single wall .  four concentric walls ringed the base and the lower portion of the slope .  starting just inside the gate  cobblestones paved the road .      it   s bigger than it looked from outside     said jane  as the donkey began pulling the cart up the steep angle .     ishihara  how big is this place .      ishihara scanned the area briefly .     i cannot see the far side of the tor  but if the shape of its base as a whole is roughly a circle  i estimate that outer wall encloses approximately seven hectares .      up ahead  the road led through an open  nearly square gatehouse in the high wall that surrounded the summit and the village within it .  sentries held spears lazily on the top of the wall  talking among themselves .  jane thought the wall had been constructed of wood until the cart passed through it .  then she found that only a breastwork of wood faced the outside  the bulk of the wall was made of unmortared stone .   inside the wall  they found themselves in a bustling village .  jane turned and looked up at the inside of the wall .  now she could see that the sentries stood on top of a wooden platform that ringed the top of the stone wall  with the wooden breastwork rising high enough to protect them from attackers who might have crossed the first four earthen ramparts on the lower slope .  all around the village  the interior side of the wall was designed the same way .      it looked so modest from a distance     said jane .     this is pretty impressive .         i estimate the perimeter of this wall to be over three quarters of a kilometer     said ishihara .     since the wall has neither straight sides nor represents a circle  my approximation is quite rough .      on the far side of the main gate  a two story hall built of timbers rose over the rest of the village .  emrys turned the cart down a narrow side street  but jane continued to look at the hall .  if mc    after returning to his full size  was going to seek the seat of power  he would probably find it inside that hall .   jane saw that wayne also had taken a second glance at the hall .  he almost certainly had reached the same conclusion  but she said nothing .  maybe something else was on his mind .  in any case  mc   was still microscopic  possibly somewhere on the ground at their feet this very moment .   emrys drew up the cart and greeted a couple of men behind a booth .  chunks of meat layout on a wooden counter  with flies buzzing over them .  the men called out heartily and waved for him to step down .   as he did so  jane realized that the men at the booth and most of the other villagers nearby were all staring at her .  then she saw that they looked just as curiously at wayne and ishihara  in their more modest chinese peasant clothes .  none of the villagers spoke  however .          jane watched in silence as emrys drew the cloth bag back from the sheep carcass .  the other men examined the meat as emrys talked  and then they unloaded the carcass and carried it to their booth .  one of them carefully counted a few coins into emrys   s hand .  he slapped the other man on the shoulder with a quick smile and mounted the cart again .      it   s interesting to watch     jane said to ishihara .     in all the times and places we   ve visited  dickering over small business transactions seems to be about the same .         yes     said ishihara .   emrys shook the reins .  this time he drove the donkey around a corner and followed the narrow  crooked streets to the main doors of the large hall .  he spoke briefly to a sentry  who slipped inside .      i wonder who lives here     jane said casually to ishihara .  she did not want to express too much interest in the building  for fear of alerting ishihara and wayne to her belief that mc   would eventually come here .  even if they had reached the same conclusion  she could pretend she had not .     i guess  emrys knows they burn a lot of wood in a building this size .         i expect so .     ishihara changed languages and spoke to emrys  who answered at some length .   wayne turned in the seat to look at ishihara .     what did he say .         emrys says this is the palace of artorius riothamus     said ishihara .      artorius is a latin name     said wayne .     is he a roman warlord who stayed behind or something .             riothamus    seems to mean    high king         said ishihara .     he is also called artorius the    dux bellorum .             that   s latin for    war leader         said wayne .     but what does it mean as a title .         i presume that not every high king leads his men out to war personally     said ishihara .     however  that is merely my own surmise .         we   re roboticists  not historians     said jane .     ishihara  do you have any history at all that pertains to this time and place .         very little     said ishihara .     however  i believe that artorius the high king may be the man upon whom the legend of king arthur is based .      wayne scowled .     this place doesn   t look much like the camelot i learned about as a kid .         the legend was built by storytellers and poets and novelists over many centuries     said jane .   a tall  burly man dressed in a worn leather tunic came outside with the sentry and several other men .  the tall man spoke to emrys briefly  then nodded .  the other men started to approach the cart but stopped  looking at jane .      emrys has sold the entire cartload of wood     said ishihara  raising his arms to lift jane .     i will help you down .      jane stood up and let ishihara move her to the ground .  as the workmen began carrying armloads of wood into the palace  the first man counted out a handful of coins into emrys   s palm .  emrys opened a leather pouch at his belt and slipped the coins inside .   jane remained with ishihara  looking around the village .  people filled the narrow streets in every direction .  she saw booths and shops offering food  clothing  pottery  and leather goods for sale .   when the wood had been unloaded  emrys spoke to ishihara and waved for jane and him to get into the cart .  ishihara lifted jane back into the empty cart  then climbed in after her .  emrys started the donkey again .      he is going to buy us clothes     said ishihara .     he says he will do this as his appreciation for my help .         thank him again for his hospitality     jane suggested .     we were trying to pay him back  after all .         i did     said ishihara .     i think he may also be embarrassed by our clothes .  he will be happier once we blend in with everyone else .      first emrys took them to a shop that sold used women   s clothes .  jane found that all the gowns were made of wool .  she chose a simple brown one .  in a stall in the rear  she changed out of her outer chinese robe  but kept the underrobe that hunter had provided to make the chinese robe more comfortable .  it protected her from the scratchy wool of her new gown .   emrys dickered with the shopkeeper and paid for the gown .  jane carried her chinese robe and trousers out over her arm .  then emrys drove the cart to another shop that sold only men   s tunics .   jane stood patiently by the cart as wayne and ishihara tried on tunics and leggings .  this would have been an ideal moment to escape them  if she had anywhere to go .  however  wayne and ishihara knew as well as she did that hunter had not arrived yet .   after emrys paid for the new tunics  he drove to another street where food was for sale at each stall .  he bought a bag of flour and a small earthenware jar of sea salt .  then he treated his guests to a midday meal of mutton stew and fresh buns .   jane decided that ishihara   s help had not made a big difference in emrys   s life .  although they had certainly changed his life today  she felt he was simply taking a normal day in the village .  he was probably doing what he would have whenever he had come into the village next .   jane decided to take her chinese robe back to the hut and give it to ygerna as a gift .  if ygerna did not want to wear it  she might be able to use the material to sew something else .  women here did not seem to wear trousers  but jane felt that ygerna could use the material to make something useful for herself or for her children .   after they had finished eating  they all mounted the cart again .  emrys drove them out of the village  back down the cobbled road to the base of the tor .  jane leaned against the back of the cart and gazed at the peaceful countryside .  this time  ishihara rode in the front of the cart behind the front seat .  no one spoke until the cart had passed through the main gate of the outer earthwork .  then emrys spoke over his shoulder to ishihara .   emrys and ishihara conversed for several moments .      what is it .     wayne asked .     are we going somewhere else today .      jane sat up  straining to hear .      no     said ishihara .     we are returning to his hut .  however  he remembers that in years past  the palace of artorius requires the most wood when soldiers are gathering here in the spring .  they must be fed and kept warm at night .         what soldiers .     wayne asked .      he says that every spring  soldiers from allover the land of the britons come here from their winter homes .  during the winter  only artorius   s personal troop lives here .  then  as spring progresses  artorius will gather his army and lead it against the saxons .         so is emrys one of these soldiers .     wayne asked .     is he going to report in .         no     said ishihara .     he says that if the palace needs so much wood now  they will need meat  too .  instead of waiting until the soldiers arrive  he wants to drive some of his flock back here tomorrow and sell the sheep ahead of his fellow shepherds .  the others are still waiting to hear that the men have moved back to the palace .         that one building can   t hold a whole army     said wayne .     how many are coming .         that is unclear     said ishihara .     however  the seven hectares of the enclosed tor offer a wide expanse of open land below the walled village .  i expect his soldiers sleep out there .         yeah  that makes sense .      jane did not move or speak  but she felt her heart beating faster with excitement .  wayne expected mc   to return to full size tomorrow  and that mean hunter would probably reach the same conclusion .  if hunter   s team arrived tomorrow  then wayne and ishihara would want to ride back to the village with emrys .  if they took her  she could look for an opportunity to escape them  or at least to alert hunter to her whereabouts .  if they left her in the hut  she would simply leave after they had gone .  she only had to hope that wayne would not order ishihara to stay at the hut with her .   wayne said nothing more .   jane wondered if hunter would think that ishihara   s labor at emrys   s woodpile was going to create too great a change in the lives of emrys and his family .  the coins he had received today  and the food  were not too extravagant .  if he got the jump on the other shepherds  however  he might become substantially more wealthy than he would have been if ishihara had not cut all the extra firewood .   at first  she could not reach any conclusion about it .  ishihara did not seem disturbed by the problem .  then she realized that emrys still could sell only the wood and sheep he already owned .  maybe he would only benefit modestly from ishihara   s help .   jane smiled to herself .  tomorrow she would look for hunter at the tor .     steve felt himself tumble gently on his back to damp  soft ground .  overhead  low  gray clouds covered the sky .  in the west  a diffuse glow revealed the setting sun behind the clouds .   he pushed himself up to a sitting position .  the land nearby combined rolling hills with occasional stands of trees .  on some distant hills  he saw flocks of sheep with shepherds and dogs .      you are both unharmed .     hunter looked at them as he stood up .      i   m fine     said steve .      yes  of course     said harriet cheerfully .     mm  smell that rich earth .  springtime in england .  it   s so green and fertile here .      hunter helped her to her feet .     i will begin calling ishihara at intervals .  i do not expect him to respond  even if he is here  but i must attempt to reach him .         why wouldn   t he answer you .     harriet asked .      wayne will almost certainly instruct him either to shut off his reception or to listen but not answer .  whatever plan wayne has in mind will rely on evading us .         i don   t see a castle     said steve  suddenly alarmed .     are we in the wrong place .         no .     harriet pointed to a large hill not too far in the distance .  large earthen ramparts ringed its base .  a small walled town sat on its summit .     in the medieval sense  no castle ever stood at cadbury .  the modern term  cadbury castle  refers to the entire walled tor and its village .  while we remain in this time  we might call it cadbury tor  instead .         so that   s where we   re going .         yes     said hunter .     it is farther than it looks .  we must begin .         okay .     steve hoisted the cloth bag over his shoulder .     lead the way .      hunter led them across the open grassland toward a narrow dirt track that wound toward the tor .  as they walked  steve looked up at the tor again .  some people rode horseback  drove wagons  or plodded out of the main gate .  he supposed they were on their way home to other villages or huts in the countryside .  others walked or rode into the tor from outside  including two men in steel caps holding spears as they rode .      is that what a roman fortress here looked like .     steve asked .     it resembles the temporary camps we saw the roman legions build in germany  but this one looks permanent .  i thought the romans would build something more impressive than this .         this is a post roman construction     said harriet .     the village on the plateau is fortified in part by unmortared stone  including roman masonry brought from elsewhere .  the gatehouse has touches of roman architecture  too .  but the overall design is celtic .         you mean now that the romans don   t rule here anymore  the britons are doing everything their way again .         in practical matters  britons never forgot their own traditions     said harriet .     further  funding was an issue .  roman administrators at the height of their power could pay many men to quarry  move  and cut stone  and hire others to build with it .  post roman briton rulers had to make do with ramparts of rammed earth .      steve nodded .  she pointed to a similar hill much farther in the distance to the north .     that   s glastonbury tor .  it still exists in our own time  as well .         so with the romans gone  the britons are back where they started in fighting the saxons .     steve asked .     except for what you said about roman cavalry tactics .         not completely .  the britons still have some advantages from their roman cultural experience  including roads  cities  and towns .  however  hordes of saxons have already settled along the eastern coast .         you said this artorius  who uses roman cavalry tactics  is the historical basis for king arthur .  back in room f     we agreed to pretend we wanted to sell horses to him .  so he rules here .  or what .         artorius is a charismatic cavalry captain with some roman style training .  he has become riothamus  or high king  of the britons by leading the celtic fight for their homeland against the saxons .         if the saxons landed on the eastern coast  along the english channel  why is he here .     steve asked .     if we   re in what   s central southern england in our own time  then we   re a long way from the channel .         that   s right     said harriet .     you see  the saxons have been coming for many decades .  they have conquered and settled considerable territory on the eastern side of britain .         all right  i get it .  now the britons are fighting the saxons along some boundary that runs through the middle of the country .         yes .  of course  the boundary is jagged and uneven  usually represented by rivers or ridges .  and because of constant fighting  it is in flux throughout these years .  artorius had to establish his base far enough behind the border to have a wide buffer zone .      steve nodded .     since the saxons are on foot  it would take them a lot longer to march all the way here than it would take his cavalry to ride out to meet them .         correct .         hunter  i have to ask you the question that comes up in every mission     said steve .     we know that mc   will return to full size around here somewhere  but exactly what   s he going to do .  where should we look for him .         that is usually jane   s area of expertise  of course     said hunter .     without a roboticist to call upon  i will have to make a judgment .  based on my experience in how jane has made her earlier appraisals  i expect that mc   will want to stop the war between the britons and the saxons that causes so much suffering .         yeah  that sounds like what she   d say     said steve .     we found mc   and mc   trying to stop wars  too .  of course  we prevented that .         we must prevent mc   from doing it  as well     said hunter .     according to the history i took from the city library  artorius held the saxons at bay during his lifetime but they eventually overwhelmed his successors .  if mc   succeeds in working out a long term settlement  however  the england of medieval  renaissance  and ultimately modern times will never develop  deeply changing the course of history .         oh  piddle .     harriet laughed lightly .     that possibility is preposterous .         it is .     steve looked at her in surprise .  her bluntness startled him .     why .         you see  the saxons  angles  and jutes invaded britain because of tremendous population pressure on the continent north of the roman empire and their displacement by the movement of more powerful tribes  such as the franks and the goths .         why did they come to britain in particular .     steve asked .     couldn   t changes in what happens here cause them to go somewhere else .         as a matter of fact  they moved into gaul in this era  as well  to settle on the loire     said harriet .     but by comparison  britain was lightly populated at the time .  the desperation of the saxons to migrate and the comparatively modest numbers of the britons to protect their island dictated this period of british history .  no agreement among individuals could stop these forces .         that makes sense to me     said steve .  he liked the logic of this argument .  it fit the fact that the team   s appearance in the past on other missions had not  to their knowledge  disrupted their own time .      i have already acknowledged that i cannot measure the degree to which chaos theory can be applied to history     said hunter .     and i accept this history as accurate .  however  the first law requires me to consider the danger of changing history  no matter how remote it may be .  after all  as a robot  mc   can expect a much longer life than any human  barring injury .  if we do not take him away soon enough  he can remain in this time to continue working out compromises as new hostilities develop .  of course  in any case we have to take him before he reaches the time he left and explodes with nuclear force .         you    re the boss  as i said earlier     said harriet .     i   m just doing my duty as your historian in reporting my opinions to you .         as far as our search is concerned  the first law would still impel mc   to attempt an end to war  no matter how hopeless his long term chances are     said hunter .     following the judgment that jane made about earlier component robots  i believe this imperative would take him to artorius or maybe even the saxon leaders .         i have no argument with that     said harriet .     you would know more about robots .         i also feel that the creation of arthurian legend will almost certainly change if the history upon which the earliest chroniclers based it no longer occurs in the same way .  this is possible even if the historical events do not change .  the legend seems to be quite important in british culture and its branches in the united states and other parts of the former british empire .         now  that i agree with     harriet said emphatically .     arthurian legend   of course it could change if historical events alter .  that legend has had great cultural influence over the centuries and must not be allowed to change .         i wouldn   t want to lose it  either     said steve .     i followed it as a kid   the stories of camelot and the knights of the round table  and lancelot and guinevere .         of course  we will not find them here     said hunter .     they are legend  not history .         so we agree with you about not letting mc   change history after all     said harriet .     we will find him .         i guess if ishihara had responded to your call  you   d have told us by now     said steve .      that is correct     said hunter .     i have heard nothing .             by the time they reached the main gate at the base of the tor  torches burned in brackets over it .  sentries in leather jerkins and leggings picked up their spears and began to swing the solid wooden doors closed .  they waited  however  as hunter strode up to them .   steve  remembering that no britons here had seen anyone of chinese descent  hung back in the shadows with his head down .      we seek shelter  friends     hunter called out cheerfully in british .     you have lodging in the village  do you not .         we have inns here     said one of the sentries .     what is your business .         i breed horses in gaul     said hunter .     i seek new land in which to breed my horses .  even in gaul  we have heard of the great cavalry leader artorius .  i would speak with him and ask if he will accept some of my finest stock .         yes .  where are your horses .  still in gaul .     the sentry grinned .  next to him  his companion laughed .      we took ship from gaul with five horses  but rough seas cast them overboard .         yes .     the sentry eyed hunter cautiously .      have you crossed the channel  friend .     hunter asked .     at this time of year .         no     said the sentry .     rough  is it .         the same rains that fall here in the spring can rage over the seas even harder     said hunter .   the sentry nodded  looking over hunter   s tunic .  then he glanced at harriet and steve .     we are far inland here .  how did you come .         we landed on the southern coast at devon  then followed the roads here .         how did you know which way to come .         every shepherd and villager on the way knows how to find artorius .      the sentry nodded again .      who are your companions .         my wife and our servant  a man from the farthest side of the roman empire .         very well .  welcome  friends .     he stood aside for them to enter .   steve still kept his head down as he followed harriet through the gate .  in the darkness  broken only by flickering torchlight over their heads  he knew the sentries could not see him clearly .  in any case  they did not bother to look  they were closing the gates behind him .   hunter led them up a long  cobbled road to the village at the top of the tor .  the sentries at the main gate of the wall also watched them approach by torchlight .  when hunter stopped in front of the gate  steve lowered his head again and remained back in the shadows .      we seek lodging     said hunter .     the sentries below passed us .         i thought as much     said the man in front of him .     are you the last in for the night .  if so  we   ll close this gate behind you .         yes  we are the last .         come in  then .     he  too  stood aside .   hunter led harriet and steve through the gate into the village .   the streets of the village were lit by torches over a few of the doors .  people still walked through the streets  especially outside taverns .  the mood seemed peaceful .      it   s not like the peasant villages in medieval china  is it .     steve asked .     those were just homes for farmers .  this is more like a small town .         i see shops  stables  and taverns     said hunter  looking up the length of the streets in each direction .     only the taverns are still open for business  however .  this is a village in a civilized society .  it also has nothing in common with the villages we saw in ancient germany  which belonged to a primarily hunting and gathering society .         roman britain was something of an outpost in the roman empire     said harriet .     however  london  york  and bath were established as roman bases   modest by the standards of the mediterranean  but civilized urban areas in comparison to the earlier british celtic villages .  cadbury tor has evolved from an older country village to something of a town  obviously because of artorius bringing power and wealth to the area .         jane could be here     said steve .     wouldn   t ishihara want to get wayne and jane some good shelter like this .         yes     said hunter .     for tonight  however  we must do the same .  our search can begin tomorrow .         lead the way     said steve .   hunter approached a quiet tavern .  inside  several men sat at tables drinking .  some wore leather jerkins and leggings similar to those of the sentries .  others wore woolen tunics like hunter   s and steve   s .  a short  gaunt innkeeper limped forward to look up at hunter .      yes  friend .         we seek lodging for the night     said hunter .     for my wife and me and our servant .         show me your money .         how much do you want for the rooms .         that will depend on whose money you carry .         roman coins from gaul .     hunter opened the pouch at his belt and spilled some coins into one hand .  he held out his palm so the other man could see them .     mostly copper .  some silver .  no gold .         no gold  eh .     the innkeeper scowled at the money .     five silvers .         for one room .     hunter shook his head .     two coppers  friend .         four silvers  then .      hunter closed his fist around the coins .     we have traveled far .  two coppers is a fair price .         find it elsewhere  then  if you can .         very well .     hunter turned abruptly and strode toward the door .   steve and harriet moved outside ahead of him .  just as they got outside  however  the innkeeper hustled after them .  at the sound of his footsteps  they turned .      four coppers     called the innkeeper .     for our friends from across the channel .  a special price .      steve grinned .     i showed hunter how to bargain on earlier missions     he whispered to harriet .      three coppers     said hunter .      for a room with two feather beds     harriet whispered .     on the ground floor  with a fireplace .         i have no such room with a fireplace of its own     said the innkeeper  glancing at her .      two coppers  then     said hunter .      three coppers for a room with two beds and a bar on the door     said the innkeeper .     on the ground floor near the back door to the latrine .         very well     said hunter .  he dropped three copper coins into the man   s open palm .      welcome  friends .  come inside .     the innkeeper stepped aside and swung his arm toward the door .   hunter accepted .  harriet and steve followed him back inside .  some of the men drinking at the tables glanced up again  but without much interest .   the innkeeper picked up a stub of candle on a small dish and led them down a narrow hallway .  he opened the door to a small room and swung it back .  then he stepped out again .   steve glanced around .  the two beds nearly filled the room  leaving only a small space between them .  a long  narrow shelf ran along the wall from the doorway .  this room was intended for sleeping  no more .      it is acceptable     said hunter .     in the morning  i expect bowls of water for washing .         as you wish .  sleep well  friends .     the innkeeper handed him the candle dish and left .   steve drew back the covers to one bed .     well  it looks clean enough .     he pushed on the pallet .     straw  not feathers .  it   ll be scratchy .      harriet laughed lightly .     i trust we   ll survive the night somehow .         i will spend the night by the door  on guard     said hunter .     do you need anything outside the room before i bar it for the night .         yeah     said steve  with a grin .     a quick trip out to the latrine .  and don   t bar it before i get back  either .         of course i will not .     hunter sounded puzzled .      that was a joke  hunter .        when steve returned  hunter barred the door and touched the candlewick lightly with one finger to put it out .  as the humans got into bed  he listened for any sounds suggesting danger and heard none .  he remained alert throughout the night  motionless to conserve his energy .   morning arrived without incident .  when hunter heard footsteps elsewhere in the inn  he went out and repeated his request for bowls of water from the innkeeper for harriet and steve .  by the time the innkeeper fetched water from the cistern and hunter returned to the room  both harriet and steve were up and dressed .   soon they went to the dining area in the front .  steve brought the team   s bag with him  since they had not paid for a second night in the room .  the men from the night before were not there  but two other men in woolen tunics sat hunched over bowls of hot cereal .  the fire in the fireplace had gone out .      remember to speak british     hunter whispered in that language .     we will be overheard and we want to sound as though we belong .         as you wish .     harriet drew in a deep breath .     ah  feel that brisk spring air again .  i love it .         i   m hungry     said steve  moving to an empty table .     this one okay .         of course     said hunter .   the innkeeper hurried out to greet them and offered breakfast .  in the daylight  he took a second glance at steve in surprise  but said nothing .  for breakfast  he served wooden bowls of hot oatmeal and herbal tea .  he also brought out a small dish of honey for flavoring .      it   s quite familiar     said harriet  inhaling the steam rising from the oatmeal .     i suppose oatmeal and honey haven   t changed a great deal over the years .         it   s good     said steve .     not that i like oatmeal much .  good enough  though .         i reviewed my conversation with the sentries at the outer gate     said hunter .     while my claim to be a horse breeder and trader got us inside the tor  i now believe that steve is correct that this will not bring us to an audience with artorius .  without horses to show a prospective buyer  the pose will no longer be useful .         at least we   re inside .     steve shrugged .     maybe we can just hang around here in the village and ask for people of jane   s and mc     s descriptions .         i prefer to act more aggressively     said hunter .     harriet  we discussed some other possible social roles before we left .  would you suggest another .         well  you didn   t want to be soldiers because that might be more dangerous to steve     said harriet .     but without other supplies to bring artorius   food  armor  or weapons  mainly   that   s the best way to get the attention of a military commander .  you could start by joining up and then look for an opportunity to meet him .         hold it .     steve swallowed and put down his spoon .     i have another problem with this .  i learned the hard way in the caribbean that i   m no fighter .         really .     harriet turned to him .     what happened  may i ask .         i tried fighting a couple of times .     grinning  steve shook his head .     one guy almost carved me up with a rapier  but someone interrupted us .  running around on deck during a boarding was even crazier .  and what kind of soldier can hunter be .  he   s not allowed to harm humans .         our goal does not require fighting     said hunter .     we simply want to be involved in life around artorius  where mc   will probably appear .  harriet  how soon will artorius go to war again .         that   s hard to say     she said slowly .     in a sense  despite short term truces and treaties  britain is more or less in a state of ongoing war between britons and saxons .         can you make any sort of calculated estimate about when the next campaign will begin .     hunter asked .      let me think out loud for a moment .  the earliest chronicles don   t give the years in which battles took place  let alone months and days .  the odds are  however  that none ever took place here at artorius   s capital  or that fact would have been mentioned .         if he has to march somewhere else for battle  we   ll have plenty of warning     said steve .      most of the battle sites were vague     said harriet .     some are completely unknown  but artorius will certainly have to go out on campaign to reach them .         hunter .     steve switched to english and spoke in a whisper .     for this subject  we can   t risk being understood by anyone else .  if artorius goes out on campaign while we   re here  are you going to let us desert from his cavalry to avoid getting into a battle .         we must always remember that mc   is our first goal  but of course i cannot put either of you into more danger than necessary under the first law .         i think you just dodged my question .     steve grinned wryly .     can we desert or not .         if necessary  i will certainly take you out of danger     said hunter .      that hasn   t always worked out as we   ve planned     said steve .     but i   ll go along with this if you really want to .         i suggest we also expand on our personal story .     harriet whispered in english also .      what do you have in mind .     hunter asked .      we should maintain our claim to have traveled from gaul recently  or we will be branded liars .  but in order to explain your desire to fight for artorius  we should explain that we are britons .         and we just moved to gaul for a while to live .     steve asked skeptically .     that sounds a little thin to me .         that   s not all     said harriet .     i suggest we come from linnuis  a british district which the saxons have taken over .  this would explain why we were displaced in years past and fled to gaul when a ship was available .  now we have managed to come back to britain .         i understand     said hunter .     this improves our story .  where is linnuis .         historians believe linnuis was modern lincolnshire .  it lies on the coast of the north sea  northeast of here across the width of britain .         we will use this as our story     said hunter  speaking british again .     how should we make our attempt to enlist with artorius .         after breakfast  i suggest you ask the sentries at the main gate to the village .         very well     said hunter .      i can hardly believe this .     steve laughed lightly  still whispering in english .     we rode dinosaurs  sailed with buccaneers  and ambushed roman legions .  we landed in the middle of world war ii  met marco polo and kublai khan  and now we   re going to join king arthur .  wow .             after breakfast  steve followed hunter and harriet out of the inn to the street .  merchants had already opened their shops and stalls by now .  the village gate stood open and people walked up and down the streets .   steve liked the idea of accompanying artorius and his men for a while  as long as no battles with saxons were involved .  he wished jane could see him join up  she would probably find it funny and she might even be impressed by it .  then his mood dampened as he wondered where she was .      hunter     steve said  falling into step with him just before they reached the village gate .     how about spreading the word around the village that we   re looking for jane before we sign up .         i can do that     said harriet .     while you two enlist  i will spend the day asking about jane around the village .  and i will ask about our missing friend .         will you be safe here .     hunter asked .      yes  i think so .         the village is peaceful     the sentry said .     she will be safe .         all right     said hunter .      here .  i   ll carry the bag today .  you   ll need your hands free .         thanks .     steve handed it to her .      of course .     harriet turned and strolled up the street .   steve shrugged  disappointed .   different sentries stood by the gate .  as hunter approached  one turned toward him  leaning on his spear .      good morning  friend     said hunter .      fair     said the sentry .      my friend and i had to flee our home in linnuis to escape the saxons .  we would like to fight with artorius .  how do we volunteer .         you want to volunteer .     the sentry eyed steve with curiosity for a moment  saying nothing .  then he turned back to hunter .     all right  then .  step over here .      the sentry moved to the middle of the open gateway and pointed .  on the steep slope of the tor below  steve could see forty or fifty armed men milling around .  some were mounted  others walked horses by their reins .  from this vantage point  he could also see a pen holding a few other horses on the far side of a storage building .      lucius takes the new recruits out every morning     said the sentry .     they just finished breakfast a short time ago .  go down and ask for lucius .         thank you     said hunter .     if those are the new recruits  where are the others .         most of the veterans have not arrived from their winter homes .  artorius   s personal troop is at leisure today  except for those on patrol .         i see .      steve and hunter walked out of the gate and down the cobbled road .  the new recruits were slowly mounting and lining up  with several burly men in leather jerkins shouting orders .  one man on a large bay waited silently  watching them all .  hunter walked up to him .      are you lucius .  we are hunter and steve .         yes .  what do you want .     lucius studied hunter with interest .      we wish to volunteer and ride with artorius against the saxons .         hmm .  we can always use a man of your stature  if we have a horse to carry your weight .     lucius glanced at steve .     do you speak our language .         yes  i speak british .         from where do you come .         from the eastern side of the roman empire .  we have been in gaul until recently .         gaul .         my wife and i fled linnuis ahead of the saxons     said hunter .     the three of us arrived here last night .         well  you are no saxons .  do you ride .  have you fought before .         we both can ride     said hunter .     however  we have not fought much .         do you have horses .         no .      lucius frowned .     i feared so .  we are always short of good horses .         you are taking new recruits     said hunter .     will you take us or not .         the personal troop of artorius has its full complement of three hundred     lucius said sternly .     but word has gone out for last year   s veterans to come from their farms and villages .  most of them will have their own mounts and a few may bring new ones  too .     he pointed to the wooden building on the slope behind the new recruits .     i will see if you can ride or not .  go to the tack building and tell the groom to mount you .         we have no weapons     said hunter .      the armorer   s store stands on the near side of the building     said lucius .     stop there first and tell him to outfit you .  and hurry  we will ride out soon .      steve followed hunter through the crowd of men and horses .  ahead  steve saw the armorer standing outside a wooden building watching them come .  he was a short man with long  gray hair and beard .  when he turned and moved inside the building  he walked with a pronounced limp .   by the time steve and hunter reached the building  the armorer had come outside again .  he tossed two round wooden shields on the ground in front of them and then dropped two short swords on the shields .  without a word  he limped back into the building .      i guess he knew what we wanted when he saw us coming     said steve  picking up a sword and shield .     no swordbelts or scabbards  though .         roman short swords     said hunter .     british shields .  i suppose the armor will be made of leather .         so it is     said the armorer gruffly as he came out again .  he leaned two spears against the wall of the building .     but not for you  friend .  you   re too big .  i   ll have to boil a new hide and slap it on you when you ride back this afternoon .         boil it .     steve asked .   the armorer snickered  revealing broken teeth .     a first timer  eh .  well  you   ll learn .     he reached inside the door and pulled out a large  rigid piece of leather  about the size and shape of steve   s torso .  it bent at the shoulders  with a hole for his head  the bottom was cut short at the waist .  thongs dangled from holes along each side .     lace those on .      steve slipped it over his head and onto his chest and abdomen .     it   s hard .         boiled leather will turn a blade almost as well as steel     said the armorer .     it just wears out faster  over time .  but if you had the money to buy steel  you   d be wearing it .      hunter moved to steve   s side and began lacing the leather armor on him .      how do you get the shape .     steve asked .      i boil it in a vat of water till it   s nice and soft .  then i slap on your body steaming hot  and you   d better be wearing a tunic when i do .     the armorer grinned .     it takes the shape of your body and cools that way .         i see .  uh  what happened to the guy this belonged to before .         he died of a fever .     the armorer stepped back inside again and came out with two conical caps .     here .     he tossed a cap to each of them .   steve put on the cap .  a leather band inside the rim padded it somewhat .  it fit him well enough .   a boy of about ten led two horses up to them  already saddled and bridled .      the groom saw you coming     he said shyly to hunter .     we got you the biggest horse we have .         thank you .     hunter took the reins and mounted .     he will be fine .      steve slipped his shield on his    left arm and carefully stuck a sword through the belt of his tunic .  then he mounted the second horse  which pranced and shook .  he kept control of his mount  however .  the armorer handed him his spear .      he   s a good horse     said the boy .     but he spent all winter in pasture .  he   s only three and he hasn   t had a rider since last fall .         i like him     said steve .     hunter  the troop is riding out .  we   d better go .         yes .     hunter reached down to take his spear from the armorer .     thank you  friends .      steve and hunter rode back across the slope and followed the rear of the troop out the main gate at the base of the tor .  the morning air was still cool  but the clouds overhead had begun to scatter .  steve grinned with excitement  wondering what lucius would have the troop do .   they did not ride far .  in the open  rolling country outside cadbury  lucius ordered the troop to split into squads  ordering each to fallout and drill separately .  because the squads formed immediately  steve saw that they had already been assigned .   hunter and steve rode up to lucius  who had reined up on the crest of a hill to observe the troop .      we are ready  friend     hunter said heartily .     where should we go .         eh .  oh  yes .     lucius pointed to a nearby squad .     these are squads of ten  but that one is short .  your squad leader  cynric  will drill you .      steve followed hunter to the squad .  a short  stocky man had been shouting orders to the group .  just as steve and hunter reached them  cynric raised his spear and turned his horse .  he led the squad away in a canter .   steve kicked his own mount and followed .  his young horse eagerly took off .  hunter   s mount also moved into a canter  more reluctantly .  steve left him behind as the squad rode across the open grassland .   soon cynric took the squad into a full gallop .  then  without warning  he pulled up sharply .  just as the squad gathered around him  he kicked his mount again and took off in another direction .  steve laughed and followed with everyone else .   this time  cynric led the squad in a long  sweeping curve back toward their starting point .  three of the riders took the curve too fast and lost it  angling wide  two others tried to take it too sharply and lost speed .  steve watched cynric   s movements carefully and followed him without trouble  with two other riders .  hunter remained behind him .   cynric stopped again on the slope near lucius .  steve reined up behind him  and hunter joined him a moment later .  they waited for the stragglers to canter back to them .   steve  getting a good look at the others    faces for the first time  saw that most of them were teenagers .  he supposed they had either come from villages or shepherd families .  they would know how to ride casually  but not on military maneuvers .   cynric studied steve and hunter with pale blue eyes .     who are you  anyway .     his voice was gruff .      i am hunter .  this is my friend steve .         and lucius sent you to me .         yes     said hunter .      well .  .  . i don   t get a lot of grown men in this troop .  you two ride better than most of these youngsters .  can you fight .         we have never fought on horseback     said hunter .      i   m not surprised     cynric said sourly .  he threw his spear into the ground and raised his voice to the entire squad .     form a line and follow me .  you will ride at full gallop past this spot and throw your spears into the ground next to mine   if you can .        jane rode in the back of emrys   s cart again that morning .  as before  ishihara sat in the front and firewood filled the rest of the bed  wayne rode on the seat with emrys .  however  this time they followed almost half of emrys   s flock of sheep .  one of his dogs herded the sheep forward along the road toward cadbury tor .   when jane saw the riders leaving the main gate of cadbury tor  she looked up .  even at a considerable distance  she was sure that the large rider trailing the rear of the troop had to be hunter .  the fact that a man steve   s size rode just ahead of him seemed to clinch it .   jane glanced up at wayne and ishihara .  wayne yawned and watched the sheep .  ishihara was rearranging the firewood slightly .      ishihara     said jane .  she did not know what she was going to say  but she wanted to distract him from seeing hunter and steve .  wayne was not as likely to recognize them  even if he looked in their direction .      yes .         uh  how safe are we .     a concern about the first law would command a robot   s attention the most .      what do you mean .     ishihara looked at her .      well .  .  . we   re very vulnerable  don   t you think .     jane frantically tried to think of a specific worry she could express to him .      to what .         to the unknown .  i mean  we hardly know what   s going on around us  do we .         thanks to emrys and ygerna  we have food  clothing  and shelter .  neither they nor anyone in the village seem to have any pressing fears .         it   s not as civilized as china was .     jane glanced at the troop again .  they had ridden away from the tor  but hunter remained easily recognizable at the rear .      we are much safer here than in roman germany     said ishihara .      yeah .  .  . that   s true  i guess .  but maybe a war will start here  too .         perhaps .  i expect to have some warning  however .  we all knew that a battle would begin outside moscow in       but we survived .         it   s a terrible risk under the first law  isn   t it .     jane stretched  and gazed casually around in several directions to camouflage another look toward the troop .  now the column of riders had divided into small groups .  for a moment  she could not find hunter .  then she saw that his group had begun to ride away  fast .  she relaxed a little .      the searches for mc   and mc   ended in much greater danger than we face here so far     said ishihara .     i assure you again that i will take you and wayne away from danger if necessary .     he patted the spot on his torso in which he had placed the belt unit .      i know     jane said quietly .  she looked at wayne .  he did not seem to have noticed hunter and steve .   jane wondered if the troop would ride back into the tor while emrys was still selling sheep and firewood there .  if so  she might have a chance to get hunter   s attention .  she would have to hope that wayne and ishihara would not notice hunter first .          steve moved into the line as the squad prepared to throw spears .  ahead of him  the other riders waited for cynric to wave his arm in a sharp downward slash .  then the first rider kicked his mount  rode at full gallop about fifty meters  and threw his spear into the ground next to cynric   s .   when steve   s  turn came  he hefted his spear in his right hand and looked at cynric .  at the signal  he took off and eyed his target .  several other spears had stuck in the ground near it  others had fallen flat .  steve threw his without slowing his mount .   his spear flew forward but instead of sticking in the ground  it landed flat on the grass .  he reined in near the other riders and turned .  hunter came next .   at the signal  hunter rode forward .  as he neared the target  he threw his spear .  it angled through the air and stabbed into the ground next to cynric   s .   around them  scattered allover the rolling hills  the other squads conducted similar exercises .   as hunter rode up next to steve  cynric nodded approval .  when the squad had finished throwing their spears  they gathered around cynric .  steve suddenly wondered if he might be cut from the troop and hunter retained .   cynric said nothing about it  however .     leave your spears where they are .  form two lines facing each other  two horse lengths apart .  when i signal  move against the rider across from you .  i want to see you handle your swords and shields .  lay on hard  now   this is no game .      as the riders formed the lines  steve and hunter moved across from each other .  at cynric   s signal  all the riders rode forward .  steve found that the real challenge to this exercise was holding the reins in his left hand while using the shield on his left arm to protect himself .   hunter   s blows were light  at least by hunter   s standards  and always landed on steve   s shield  no matter how he moved it .  steve swung his own sword with more abandon  secure in the knowledge that hunter could easily block each stroke with his own shield .  on each side of them  the other squad members did the same .   cynric rode slowly behind each line  circling the squad .  he shouted instructions and encouragement at times .  after a while  he ordered them to halt .   steve lowered his sword and shield and grinned at hunter with relief .      take up your spears again     cynric called out .  then  as the riders moved out of their line  he turned to hunter .     you sit a horse well for a man your size .         thank you for the kind words .     hunter nodded acknowledgment .     tell me something .  i always heard that the saxons have no horses .  in linnuis  i never saw a mounted saxon .  why do you have us perform this exercise against another man on horseback .         a man who fights for artorius must be at home on his mount     cynric said sternly .     besides  occasionally a saxon patrol will take a horse or two .  but you are right .  in the main  a battle against the saxons means a small british cavalry against a much larger army of saxon foot .      steve had to dismount to pick up his spear .  while he was on the ground he handed a couple of the other spears up to other squad members .  then  clumsily cradling his own in the crook of his left arm  he managed to mount again .   hunter plucked his own spear from its vertical position in the ground and rode up next to steve .      harriet radioed me a moment ago     hunter said quietly .     she is well  but has seen no sign of mc   .         is she just going to walk up and down the streets of the village all day .         perhaps not .  she has seen some from the citadel come out to shop .  since artorius probably lives there  she hopes to speak to them .         hey  maybe she can get inside somehow .         follow me .     cynric shouted suddenly  holding spear high .     now .     he rode away abruptly  as before .   the squad  caught by surprise  took off after him .   the remainder of the morning continued the same way .  cynric ordered specific exercises with weapons  often divided by sudden orders to charge across the hills .  these charges sometimes were straight  and sometimes curved  the riders had to stop and wheel around quickly  changing direction .  finally  at midday  wagons came out of the tor to bring bread  cold mutton  and water to the squads .  the horses were watered and rested .   in the afternoon  the nature of the exercises changed .  now the squads worked together  maneuvering in combinations of ten  with a hundred riders each .  steve stayed close to hunter .  finally  in late afternoon  lucius gave the order to return to the tor .   as steve and hunter rode on weary mounts with the rest of the troop back to the main gate  cynric rode up alongside them .      you will join us in the camp     said cynric .      you are in a camp .     hunter asked .     i have not seen a camp .  where is it .      cynric grinned .     behind the village  on the far slope .  the green recruits are kept out of the way .      steve wondered what hunter wanted to do about harriet  but he did not ask .  a blunt conversation would have to wait until they were out of the hearing of others .  he looked up at the village and wondered if jane was there somewhere .     hunter knew that he could not call harriet .  he had no idea if she had company within the hearing of her lapel pin .  if they could not find her in the streets of the village  then he would have to wait for her to call him again .   at the paddock  each rider unsaddled and brushed down his own mount .  then they were dismissed .  hunter  however  walked back to the armorer  who had a fresh leather boiling in a big vat .      is that for me .     hunter asked .      keep your tunic on to protect yourself from the heat     the armorer said gruffly .   steve stood by as the armorer pulled the steaming leather out with a long  hooked pole .  the leather had a hole already cut out of the middle and the armor lowered it over hunter   s head .  moving quickly  the armorer tied it snugly around hunter   s waist with a piece of old rope .  steam rose from the leather .      i   m glad he already had one my size     steve muttered .     that   s hot .         no one ever died of this     growled the armorer .     i   ve been doing it for years .  that tunic he   s wearing will protect him .         i am fine     said hunter .   the armorer quickly tied the leather around hunter   s arms  as well  so that it fit tightly around his entire torso .  then he began to punch holes up and down the sides in straight lines  ignoring the uneven shape of the leather .  by the time he had finished  the leather no longer steamed .   the armorer knocked on the leather against hunter   s chest .  it gave slightly .     still soft     he muttered .     just wear that for a few more minutes .      hunter nodded .   the armorer drew a knife and began trimming the leather .  he cut it off at hunter   s waist and straightened the edges running down the robot   s sides from under his arms .  by the time the armorer had cut the last pieces off  he had to use a great deal of effort to slice the blade through the leather .      should be finished now .     the armorer knocked on the hunter   s back .  this time  it made a thunking sound .     that   s it .  here  i   ll lift it off .      hunter bent forward so the armorer could raise it over his head .   steve saw that the leather had now solidified into a hard shell that maintained its shape  just like the leather he was still wearing .      it needs a little more trimming .  and some of these holes need to be punched out more cleanly .  i   ll do that .  when you come back in the morning  i   ll have thongs for you to lace the sides closed .  after that  you keep it .         thank you .      the armorer nodded and carried the new armor inside his building .   some recruits walked around the slope to the rear side  avoiding the village .  others took the cobbled road up to the village gate .  hunter and steve walked back up to the gate together .      hunter  harriet here .     her call came through his internal receiver .      yes  harriet .         i can see you walking back up the hill and i got a moment alone .  did you see mc   anywhere .         no .  tell me where you are .  we must confer .         i think we   d better talk now .  i   m in the palace .  and if i leave  i don   t know if i   ll be welcome back .         what do you mean .         well  i struck up a conversation with some of the women who live here .  one is the wife of an adviser to artorius and another is the grown daughter of some elderly military man .  i   m not sure exactly what he does .  but i explained that my husband and our servant had come from linnuis by way of gaul to fight and that i was now unescorted .         they simply invited you into the palace .         not exactly .  we talked for a while .  they are very conscious of social class .  i am clearly not a peasant .  when they asked about you  i explained that you were a very wealthy and successful horse breeder and trader .  they know that artorius needs an ongoing supply of good horses .         what happened .         gwenhwyvaer  the daughter of the military man  has been very kind .  we get along well .  she invited me to stay with her .  but she had to argue with some of the others .  i don   t want to seem ungrateful by asking to go out again today .  but if everything is still okay tomorrow  maybe i can meet you in the village .         then you have safe lodging for the night .         oh  yes .  as long as i don   t offend anyone .  and i may have a chance to spot mc   here  if he has regained his full size by now .         very well .  i will wait for you to call me again .  if you feel any potential danger  call immediately .         all right  hunter .  harriet out .      hunter related the conversation to steve .     instead of going up to the village to look for her  i suggest we go to the camp in the rear to find out where we will sleep .         good idea .        jane had hoped to remain in the village until the troop returned .  however  emrys   s business did not take long enough .  in the morning  he had bargained with men from the palace for the sheep .  after some spirited haggling  emrys had sold them all to the palace  improving the deal by offering the firewood  as well .  he had received both coin and barter in the form of some wool and two piglets that had to be tied inside the wagon .   at jane   s request  emrys had agreed to spend more time in the village .  they visited an open air stall at midday to eat and then browsed through the shops .  however  in the middle of the afternoon  he had decided to return home .  as they had taken the wagon back down the slope toward the gate in the outer wall  jane had seen the troop of riders still maneuvering in the distance .   jane watched wayne and ishihara carefully all day .  in turn  they looked at everyone in the village  but only glanced casually at the troops on maneuver in the distance .  she could not figure out why ishihara did not examine the troops more closely .   although she did not want ishihara to notice hunter if he had not seen him already  she wanted to find out what priorities he was using .  she waited until the wagon had left the main gate and traveled down the road  leaving the troops out of sight around a bend .  then she raised the subject indirectly  speaking in english so that emrys would not understand .      ishihara .         yes .         as i understand it  wayne will only instruct you to let me go if he can either get mc   or bargain for him with hunter .  right .         yeah .     in the front seat by emrys  wayne turned around and glared at her suspiciously .     we   ve already established that .  what of it .         when are we going to get this underway .  i don   t want to live here forever .         calm down  will you .     wayne said sourly .     i don   t like waiting  either .  but we can   t do anything till we find at least one of them .         so we   re just going to visit the village every day and look around .  what if emrys doesn   t want to go back tomorrow .  he has chores at home .         if we have to  we   ll hike in ourselves     said wayne .     right  ishihara .         if you wish .         and then we just stand around .         do you have a better idea .      jane looked at ishihara .     tell me if you know where mc   or hunter is .      ishihara turned to look at wayne .     what should i do .  you instructed me not to discuss this subject with her or in front of her .      wayne grinned .     go ahead and answer .         i do not know where mc   is     said ishihara .     i may know where hunter is but i am not certain .         nice try .     wayne snickered .     you can   t order him to tell you something he doesn   t know .         that   s not the point     said jane .  for the moment  she decided not to sound too eager to learn what ishihara might know about hunter .     do you guys have a plan or not .         i   ve calculated that mc   will return to his full size in the tor     said wayne .     i   ve instructed ishihara to prioritize spotting him .      jane decided to risk reminding them of the troops .     does that include people outside the tor .  say  shepherds like emrys  or traders coming to and from the tor .         i have looked at the people we have passed on the road     said ishihara .      how about those riders .     wayne asked .     the guys with the spears .  they were too far for me to see clearly .         none of them is small enough to be mc       said ishihara .     one of them is large enough to be hunter .  with the movements of the riders  i was not able to ascertain this for certain  even at the maximum magnification of my vision .  a man the size and build of steve rode very close to him .      jane said nothing .  she had recognized hunter .  at least she now knew what ishihara had seen .  the reason he had not mentioned it in her hearing before was that wayne had instructed him not to do so .      you   re sure that mc   is not riding with that outfit .     wayne asked .      yes .         good .  for now  we   ll let hunter waste his time with them .  we   ll focus on finding mc   first .      jane said nothing more .     steve and hunter found the camp on the far slope .  a single large command tent stood at the top .  two unhitched wagons stood next to it  full of closed wooden crates .  small campfire sites  cold at the moment  dotted the area  surrounded by small bundles of furs and cloth bags .   cynric met them there and showed them which campfire belonged to their squad .  he also pulled some old blankets out of a crate in one wagon and gave them to steve and hunter .  the other squad members had not come back yet .   after cynric walked away  steve sighed and looked up at hunter .      what is wrong .     hunter asked .  he set his blanket down on the ground .  .      we   ll be sleeping out under the stars .  it was cold last night .  even next to the fire  we   ll be cold .         i noted the temperature last night .  it should not be harmful to you .         no .  .  . but it   ll be uncomfortable .     steve grinned .     don   t worry about it .  i just hope it doesn   t rain .         i suggest we walk up to the village .  the sun will not go down right away .  maybe we can buy some additional bedclothes for you .         okay .     steve glanced up .  the sky had more clouds than before  but he did not smell rain .   they walked back up to the village and strolled through the streets .  hunter found a stall selling furs and bargained down the price on a coverlet of rabbit pelts stitched together .  steve slung it over his shoulder gratefully .   hunter noted when the other green recruits in the village left again .  he and steve followed them back to the camp  where the campfires now burned .  some men passed bread to each squad  pots of mut ton already boiled over the fires .  a brisk breeze blew across the twilit countryside .          as steve and hunter sat down around their campfire  cynric finally introduced each squad member by name .  in the gathering darkness  he directed one of the men to ladle mutton out of the pot into wooden bowls already filled with chunks of bread .      cynric     said a young man named cai .     what will we do tomorrow .  more of the same .         more of the same .     cynric looked around the group sternly .     you have much to learn before you can keep an angry saxon from killing you .         will it be different when the veterans arrive .     cai asked .     will we ride with them .         our troop will remain together     said cynric .     lucius will lead us .  when the veterans first begin to gather  they will not bother to ride  except on their own .  once the bulk of them have arrived  we will practice maneuvers with them .         when will we go out on campaign .     a taller young man named cadoc looked up from his bowl .      no one can be sure     said cynric .     it depends on what word artorius hears from scouts and returning veterans .  he won   t plan a campaign until he knows something about the enemy .      none of them spoke .      you can be sure we   re going somewhere     cynric added .     spring always brings a new campaign for artorius .  you need not doubt that .      the other men nodded .   cai chewed on a piece of bread for a moment and glanced at steve .     i   ve never seen a man of your appearance before  yet you speak our language well .  how did you two come to join us here today .         it   s a long story     steve said cautiously .  he was not sure how much detail cai wanted .      we met in gaul     said hunter casually .     my wife and i hail from linnuis  but we fled the saxons on board ship across the channel .         i have known men from gaul     said cadoc .     none looked liked you  steve .         i come from the eastern end of the roman empire     said steve .  he glanced at hunter  who watched him silently .  steve decided he was free to improvise .     i traveled to gaul as a servant to another horse breeder .  we met hunter and i began working for him  instead .         but where is this land you come from .     cai asked .     my grandfather served allover the empire and told me stories about his travels .  do you come from egypt .  judea .  the parthian border .      steve looked at hunter again .      his family comes from farther east than that     said hunter .     from sina  the land of silk .         never heard of it     said cynric .     not that i care .     he looked into the distance  where the sun had gone down .  a faint glow over the horizon still lit the sky .     well  men  shall we take our nightly stroll through the village .         you walk through the village every night .     hunter asked .     why .      cynric grinned .     for a goblet of mead  maybe .  or to meet a woman in a tavern .  maybe just for a walk .  it keeps these young farmers and shepherds in the saddle during the day  when they know they have a visit in the village at night .      steve caught hunter   s eye .     we   ll join you .         hunter  you can see your wife .         perhaps     said hunter .     first  we have business in the village .  a certain friend of ours may live in the village now .  we will look for him .         as you wish .     cynric shrugged .   as the squad walked back up to the village  steve noticed that the other squads were doing the same .  not everyone went  however  a few others stayed around their fires .  some of the men had already stretched out in their bedrolls .   the streets of the village had only a few people  just as the night before .  cynric sought out the most crowded tavern  though  calling out to friends he found there .   hunter and steve bought mead in dented metal goblets and stood among talkative  laughing men in the middle of the crowd .  steve saw that hunter was looking around  so he did not bother  hunter   s height advantage and better vision meant that he could do the job better and faster  anyway .   steve found the mead interesting at first  but not really to his liking .  he held the goblet and glanced back out the open doorway .  a small group of other men sauntered past .   hunter continued looking around the crowd .  steve slipped away from him through the crowd  moving toward the door .  the noise in the tavern covered his footsteps .  with a glance over his shoulder at hunter   s back  he set his goblet down on a small table and stepped back outside .  he hurried down the street .   after the five earlier missions  steve no longer worried about changing history through ordinary actions .  he did not believe that he would alter the fate of britain or the shape of arthurian legend by getting away from hunter for a few minutes to explore the taverns on his own .  at the same time  he knew he would feel more free to act spontaneously without hunter .   steve followed the men in front of him into another tavern .  this place had about half the crowd of the last one  but the patrons here were also cheerful and talkative .  steve moved to the bar and ordered more mead .  when he turned  he found almost every man in the place looking at him .   slowly the tavern grew quiet .   steve looked from face to face .  for the first time  he realized that hunter   s company had protected him .  no matter how curious or hostile the britons had felt  none had confronted him in front of hunter .  the squad members had asked their questions politely .  now he was on his own .   a young man with shoulder length  reddish blond hair smirked at him over a goblet .   steve decided to take the initiative .     good evening     he said pleasantly .      so it is  stranger .     the other man snickered .     who are you  then .  some pict from the wilds up north .         ha .     another man sneered .     i say he   s a wild man from across the western sea .         i came from gaul     said steve  forcing a smile .      you   re no gaul     said the first man .     but you speak our language .  what   s your name  then .         steve .         eh .  what kind of name is that .         well  it   s short for steven     steve said lamely .     what   s your name .         i heard of a stephen who followed jesus     said another man  quietly .      what   s your name .     steve asked the blond man again  still trying to sound cheerful .   the man ignored his question .     you were named for this stephen .         it was the origin of my name     steve said hesitantly .  he had been named after a relative in the immediate sense .  more importantly  he realized that the men around him really wanted to know something about him .  he would have to speak up to satisfy them .      you are a follower of the church  then .     the blond man cocked his head to one side  studying steve   s face .      yes .     steve did not know if britain in this time had different denominations or sects  so he said nothing more .  he also could not tell exactly what opinion the others might hold about this .      what is your purpose here .         my friend and i have joined the troop of new recruits     said steve .      that   s true     a man called from the back .     i saw him riding back through the gate with a big  tall fellow .      the blond man smiled  finally .     i am bedwyr .  i lead a scouting patrol .         really .  do you live here year round .     steve felt a wave of relief at his friendlier tone .   bedwyr slapped him on the shoulder .     forgive our questions  friend .  artorius will lead us all out on campaign soon  but we are getting restless .      steve glanced around .  not all of the other men had accepted his presence  some still eyed him suspiciously .  however  no one else spoke .      something wrong  friend .         i   ve only seen a few taverns in your village .  how about showing me around a little .      bedwyr laughed .     why  sure .     he threw back his head and emptied his goblet .     come on  let   s go .      steve took another swig of his mead and set his goblet down .  as he followed bedwyr out of the tavern  he was glad to see that no one else joined them .  he did not feel that he had been made welcome  exactly  but being treated with indifference was good enough .   bedwyr started up the street  pointing to another small building with flickering candles in the window .     that   s a good place for food     he said .     not so much for drinking .         tell me something     said steve  falling into step next to him .     you   re the only one who seemed to think my joining artorius meant something .  the others still aren   t so friendly .  what   s different about you .         you mean  regarding you .     bedwyr shrugged .     i spoke up first because i was the most curious about you .  and artorius needs every good man he can get .         so i have heard .         the saxons don   t ride  but they come across the channel like endless packs of wolves .  any man who will face them is all right with me .  but you must understand that in these times  not everyone loves a stranger .         yes  i do .         enough of that .     bedwyr pointed up in the moonlight toward the palace as they walked .     my barracks lie there  in the citadel .  you can   t see it well in the darkness  but all of artorius   s personal troop lives with him in that quarter .  we are sworn to die for him if necessary .         are you in his personal bodyguard .         no     said bedwyr .     you misunderstand .  he has a personal household troop of about three hundred  depending on casualties from time to time .  we live here permanently and accompany him on every trip he takes .  his bodyguards are a special group of only twenty .      steve wanted to get inside the palace somehow to look for mc   .  however  he did not want to appear too eager for fear of making bedwyr suspicious of his motives .  he decided to approach the subject obliquely .      how does a new man join the personal troop .     steve asked .     to maintain the number around three hundred  men killed in battle obviously must be replaced .         a man   s loyalty must be proven .  for instance  my father died fighting in artorius   s personal troop when i was young .  my mother sent me when i came of age .         so connections are important .         yes  or special courage and sacrifice on the battlefield .     bedwyr nodded .      what about working in the palace .     steve asked .     artorius must have people who keep the fires burning and cook the food and clean up .         what of it .  you came to fight .         not for me     said steve .     i   m looking for a friend .  a little guy .  he   s coming here  but i don   t know if he   s already arrived or not .  he wasn   t in lucius   s troop  so i wonder if he   s working in the palace .         ah .  i understand now .     bedwyr shrugged .     people like that  the servants .  .  . i pay no attention .         who would know .  someone in the palace who hires the servants  i guess .         yes .      steve waited  hoping bedwyr would offer to help .  when he did not  steve decided to ask him outright .  steve only hoped he would not offend the warrior in some unpredictable way .      could you introduce me to this person .  i would like to ask about my friend .         mm  well  how about another drink  steve .  even this little village has more taverns than we   ve seen yet .         you can   t take a stranger to the palace .      bedwyr grinned .     you really want to find this fellow .  does he owe you money .         no  no .     steve laughed .     but you   re right   finding him is very important to me .         i   ll talk to a friend     said bedwyr slowly .     but no promises .  come on .         where are we going .         we   ll see who   s on sentry duty this watch .  i know all those guys .      steve grinned in the darkness .  this was progress  at least .  in bedwyr   s company  he couldn   t call hunter directly  but he switched on his lapel pin so that hunter could overhear him .      how far is it to the palace .     steve asked .   bedwyr laughed .     in this village .  you   ve seen it .  nothing is more than a few minutes    walk .      steve knew hunter would get the message from that exchange .  they walked in silence through the streets .  when they turned a corner  they left the taverns behind .   a single torch burned in a holder over the main entrance to the palace .  two bored sentries sat on stools  cradling their spears .  they looked up with interest when they heard footsteps approaching .      it   s bedwyr     he called out .     and a new friend .  good evening  aetius .  wake up  drustan .      they both grinned .     what are you doing here  bedwyr .  the taverns are still open .         my friend steve  here  now rides under lucius .  he seeks a friend who may be in the palace .      drustan frowned .     he can   t go inside at this hour .  in the morning  maybe .         i don   t need to go inside     said steve .     my friend is called mc   .         strange name     said bedwyr .      he may have taken another on his travels .  maybe i could describe him to you .  he   s a little guy  slender and about so high .     steve held his hand at mc     s height .     he probably doesn   t talk much  but he   s very agreeable .  if you tell him to do something  he just does it .  and he never hurts anybody   he won   t fight  but he   ll try to stop a fight between other people .  have you seen him .      the sentries looked at each other .      well  there   s little patricius     said drustan .     he   s only twelve .         i   m looking for a grown man     said steve .     just a little one .         medraut   s not too big     said aetius .     but he   s no stranger .  he   s artorius   s nephew .         one of the cooks caught him scrapping with another young rascal yesterday     said drustan .     medraut picks fights all the time .         you sure he   s that little .     aetius asked .     maybe he   s gotten his growth since you saw him last .         well .  .  . it was only a few months ago .         i fear we haven   t seen anyone like that     said drustan .     we would notice  i think .  but maybe he works in the village somewhere .         maybe so .  thank you .     steve sighed .  hunter had certainly heard the entire exchange .  mc   probably had not returned to full size yet .     bedwyr  shall we visit another tavern .  i   ll buy .         not so fast     said drustan  grinning .     artorius has been coming out for a quick walk every evening .  he may come out any minute .         you mean i could meet him .         if he walks out in the same mood as usual  he   ll have no objection .  he likes to mix with the men this time of year  as the campaign season approaches .         i think i   ll hang around .     steve laughed .     you mind  bedwyr .         not at all .  i   ll linger with you .  it can   t hurt to have a good word with the man at the top .              back in the hut  jane helped ygerna prepare another pot of mutton stew .  at first  ygerna had tried to dissuade her guest  but jane had simply laughed lightly and picked up a knife to cut meat .  ygerna baked more bread and carefully seasoned the new stew with the sea salt emrys had brought from the village .   ishihara had gone outside to cut more firewood in the twilight .  emrys stacked the pieces .  wayne alternately paced outside restlessly and sat on a stool inside the hut .  the children  now growing accustomed to their visitors  paid less attention to them .   as she cut chunks of mutton  jane tried to decide how to proceed .  now that she knew hunter and steve had joined the troop of riders  she could try to get their attention .  on the other hand  wayne and ishihara surely knew she hoped to do that .  when they went to the village tomorrow  she expected ishihara would become even more attentive to her than usual to prevent her from escaping .  her greatest fear was that wayne would leave her here with ishihara .  then she would have no chance .   wayne and ishihara came inside the hut  followed by emrys .  jane glanced up but said nothing .  emrys closed the door behind him .      shall i tell jane .     ishihara asked wayne .      might as well .     wayne shrugged .      i have spoken with emrys about tomorrow     said ishihara .     based on the number of ewes pregnant in his flock  he has decided to take more sheep to the village tomorrow .  we will go with him to look for mc   .         okay .     jane shrugged  feigning indifference .  actually  she was deeply relieved .  apparently they were going to take her  that meant she might have a chance to get away .     when the main doors of the palace opened  steve tensed with excitement .  six men came out  wearing now familiar plain wool tunics and leather boots and leggings  a servant inside closed the doors again .  both sentries stood up alertly .   the man in front smiled at the sentries .     good evening  men .  did i wake you .      drustan and aetius both laughed and shook their heads  their admiration for him evident in their faces .      no  sir  riothamus     said drustan .     not us .         well  i know this is boring duty .  i did my turns on watch when i was young .      steve tried to get a good look at artorius riothamus in the flickering torchlight .  he seemed to be in his early thirties  of average height and a medium build .  his shoulder length hair was light brown  as was the narrow  neatly clipped beard along his jawline .      good evening  sir     said bedwyr politely .  he  too  looked fascinated .      good evening to you .     artorius looked at him in the uneven torchlight .     ah  bedwyr  isn   t it .  you lead one of the scouting patrols .         that   s right  sir .      artorius looked at steve .     i don   t believe i know you  friend .         i  uh           this is steve  a man from the eastern end of the roman empire     said bedwyr .     he and a friend from linnuis have joined lucius   s troop .         ah .  i   m glad to hear it .  welcome  steve .         thank you     steve said shyly .      have you and your friend ridden before .  can you sit a horse .         yes  sir .         good .     artorius laughed lightly and gave steve a pat on the shoulder as he passed .     we need you .     he and his entourage walked on down the street .   steve turned to watch him go .  artorius was personable and unpretentious  but he also came across as reserved  confident  and supportive of his men .  steve liked him and realized that this personal magnetism  combined with his military successes  helped create the legend that grew after his death .      still ready for another drink .     bedwyr asked him cheerfully .      sure .        harriet had accepted the invitation of gwenhyvaer  the young woman she had befriended  to her small room .  she had recognized the name as the original welsh from which the more modern     guinevere    had been derived .  now a fire burned brightly in a stone fireplace  candles lit the corners of the room .  the two women sat on each side of the stone hearth  with fur lap robes keeping their legs warm .   gwenhyvaer was stitching the hem of a gown by the firelight .  watching her  harriet decided that gwenhyvaer was even younger than harriet had first thought .  most likely  she was still in her late teens  which made her an adult in this culture .      how many children do you have .     gwenhwyvaer asked  glancing up from her sewing .      uh   none .     because she and hunter had not discussed that question  she was caught unprepared .      no .     gwenhwyvaer   s eyes widened in surprise .   harriet shrugged  suppressing a smile .     no .         oh  my .  did they .  .  . i mean  did they die young .  or you never had any .         i never had any .         that   s so sad .  how does your husband feel about this .  doesn   t he want sons .         we no longer worry about it     said harriet .     it   s all right .         i hope i have children who grow up .     gwenhyvaer smiled shyly .     my father says artorius likes me .  he   s hoping to arrange for us to be married .      harriet smiled at her youthful embarrassment .     you must love him .      she giggled .     every woman i know does  i think .  at least  the younger ones .         has your father been with artorius long .         oh  yes .  he   s been advising him on roman cavalry tactics .  my father is part roman .  he served in the legions in gaul until about ten years ago .  so did his father  before the legions left britain .  he was stationed up by hadrian   s wall  on the pictish border .         i see .  you come from a long line of soldiers .      gwenhwyvaer nodded soberly .     the men will be going on campaign soon .  my grandfather died in a battle .  i wish my father would stay home .         he still rides with artorius  then .         yes .     she sighed .     but of course he needs my father .  the saxons keep coming and coming .  father says artorius must ride out and fight them on their land  not wait for them to march here .      harriet stifled a yawn and glanced at the sleep pallet that servants had prepared for her .  with the fire nearby  and using the fur lap robe as a coverlet  she would be warm here tonight .  for now  however  .  she would stay up talking as late as her hostess wished .   looking at gwenhwyvaer  harriet thought to herself that this teenager could not possibly ever imagine the kind of role she would play in arthurian legend  fictional though it would become   or across how many centuries she would be remembered  at least in some form .     jane found the morning routine at the hut the same as the day before .  everyone at the hut ate breakfast and emrys picked out which sheep he would drive to the village .  the only difference  as emrys drove the cart behind the small flock again  was that he did not take any more firewood .  jane guessed that his family had no more wood to spare .  without the need to load the cart  they left earlier than they had yesterday .   on the way  jane watched the main gate of the tor ahead  to see the troop of riders again .  this time  however  the riders did not leave before emrys brought his small flock and the cart up to the gate .  as they started up the steep  cobbled road to the village  jane saw the riders gather around some sort of storage building and the paddock  saddling their horses and leading them toward the gate .  she could not see hunter and steve in the crowd  so she assumed they were inside the building .      i want to ask emrys to stop     ishihara said suddenly to wayne .     do i have your permission .         of course     said wayne .   jane tensed .     steve stood behind hunter just inside the tack building  waiting in line to pick up their saddles and bridles .  they had just finished a bland but plentiful breakfast of hot cereal  hunter identified wheat and barley in it .  then they had walked down the slope  where hunter had picked up his leather armor from the armorer and laced it on .   steve   s arms and shoulders were sore from the unaccustomed exercise the previous day .      hunter  by the time this is over  i   ll be in great shape .     he grinned and moved up with the line .     do you think we should stay with the troop even though mc   isn   t in it .     he lowered his voice .     maybe we could try for duty in the village  to be nearer the palace .      hunter turned  looking over steve   s head out the open door behind them .      what is it .         silence  please     hunter said quietly .   steve waited patiently  though other men continued to talk around them .  horses snorted and their hooves clopped outside .  steve guessed that hunter was attempting to sort out some other sound  but he had no idea what it could be .      come outside with me     said hunter .  he left the line and moved back toward the door .  the men behind him made room for him and steve followed closely .      what is it .     steve asked quietly .      i heard the footstep pattern of wayne nystrom nearby .         yeah .     suddenly excited  steve hurried out the door after him .     jane must be close .      hunter stopped abruptly .  steve did  too  when he saw wayne simply walking right up to them with a smirk .  he seemed to be alone .      where   s jane .     steve demanded .      don   t worry .  you know ishihara can   t allow any harm to come to her .         yeah .  he   s not here to protect you .     angrily  steve took a step toward him .  before he took a second step  however  he felt hunter take his upper arm from behind and hold him firmly in place .      stop     hunter added calmly .      where is she .     steve demanded again .      why have you approached us .     hunter asked .     do you have something to say .         i certainly do .     wayne grinned .     let   s negotiate a little .         on what basis .         i   ve been here a week .  that   s given me time to start a routine here  to get settled .  and to make a few friends .  i   m not desperate here  as i was in roman germany .         you say you   ve been here a week     said steve .     does that mean you sent jane and ishihara somewhere else .         no comment     said wayne  snickering .     but i remind you that ishihara follows my instructions .  i intend to hold jane hostage in return for mc    if you should find him before i do .  and he must be untouched and unexamined .         i understand your terms     said hunter .      you can   t just accept that     steve said hotly  looking up at him .      i cannot endanger jane     said hunter .     you know that  of course .         i   ll give you some time to think about it     said wayne .     but i warn you not to follow me to find anyone .  if we have to jump through time to get away from you  i may not make an offer like this again .         acknowledged     said hunter .   wayne  still smiling triumphantly  turned and hurried away through the crowd of men and horses .              grab him     said steve  pulling against hunter   s unbreakable grip .     we can hold him as a hostage for jane .  you can call ishihara and tell him .  ishihara can   t let either of them come to harm  so he   d have to give in .         i do not dare     said hunter .     i have no indication of where they are .  wayne may have left them in another time or in a place out of range of my signal .  he may have left ishihara with standing instructions or first law interpretations that would cloud the first law imperative to release jane .  making an attempt could simply anger wayne and cause him to withdraw his offer .         well  what   s wrong with that .         maintaining negotiations will provide wayne with an incentive to stay in contact with us .  if jane is nearby  we may eventually be able to track him back to her  or at least surmise her general vicinity .         well .  .  .     steve tried to think of another objection  but could not .     how about calling ishihara anyway  and trying to get him to release her .         have you forgotten .  i have continued to call ishihara at intervals ever since we arrived .  he has not responded .         oh  yeah .  but we could just follow wayne now and find out whatever we can .         i dare not .  besides  the troop is about to go out on maneuvers  remember .         we don   t have to stay .         leaving so soon will complicate our ongoing presence here .  we must maintain our place in the troop for now .     hunter turned  drawing steve with him .     we must get our saddles and bridles .  again  we will be among the last to ride out .         yeah  all right .     steve joined him at the end of the line again .     so you think ishihara has jane in some other time .      hunter released his arm .     that is not my first estimate .  i acknowledge the possibility because it prevents me from acting too rashly  but i doubt the likelihood .  ishihara would probably insist on remaining in the company of both humans to protect them .         he wasn   t with wayne right now     said steve .     and in the past  you   ve been willing to take a chance on one of your educated guesses .         i wish to prioritize caution at the moment .  i believe ishihara and jane are probably fairly close .  they may be in the village or out in the countryside  but i could not hear or see any sign of them .  if we bide our time  i may pick up some clue to their location .  then we can act more aggressively .         but you   re still just guessing .         i am making a calculation of the odds .         uh  right .      hunter said nothing for a moment .  when he spoke again  he lowered his voice .     harriet just called to say she is well .  she remains with the women in the palace .         good .  that   s something in our favor .      they picked up their saddles and bridles and carried them out to their mounts .     jane sat in the back of the cart up in the village  near the palace doors .  emrys haggled over the sheep with the same man as the day before .  from here inside the walls  she could not see the slope or exactly where wayne had gone  but she could guess .  ishihara and wayne had conferred in whispers before wayne hopped out and emrys drove up to the palace to sell his sheep .   she knew that ishihara must have told wayne something about the location of hunter and steve .  because she had not seen or heard any sign of them  she supposed ishihara   s enhanced hearing had brought him their voices in the distance .  she had no real optimism that she could talk ishihara into changing sides  but she decided to try raising some doubts again .      the first law was never intended for situations like this     jane said quietly .      what do you mean .     ishihara asked .     i have kept you from harm .         you   re keeping me prisoner .  i would be safer with hunter .  you already know that .  i say you are violating the first law by holding me now that hunter has arrived .         what form of harm are you suffering .         i   m being harmed simply by having to stay with you .  it   s not my choice .         wayne nystrom will be harmed if his career is destroyed .  i intend to balance his concerns with yours .  neither of you will suffer direct physical harm .         think about the intention of the first law .  do you really believe that kidnapping was included .         to prevent a human from being harmed  it has been an option throughout the history of positronic robots .  otherwise  it would have been explicitly prohibited .         i say you are wrong  ishihara .  think about it .     jane spoke firmly but did not feel encouraged .  wayne had obviously given ishihara some effective arguments of his own at some point and  after all  wayne was also a roboticist .     hunter found the maneuvers today to be a repeat of the day before .  he put most of his effort into avoiding injuring his opponents .  while he remained close to steve  he observed that steve learned very quickly and did not need specific help .   the day wore on uneventfully .  finally  late in the afternoon  lucius ordered the troop back to the tor .  when the weapons  armor  tack  and horses had been put away  hunter and steve walked back up to the village .   steve looked up at him  grinning .     the trouble with this stuff is  the more time i spend riding and fighting  the more tired i get .  the more time you spend out in the sunlight  the more energy you draw from your converters .  imagine what an army of robots could do here .         we could not fight humans     said hunter .     we would be useless as an army .         i was just speculating .  think about it           it makes me uncomfortable to consider it     hunter said abruptly .      all right .  sorry .         harriet called me again just now .  she and one of the women she has met have gone for a walk in the village .  we will look for them .         okay .      in the village  hunter saw harriet standing with a much younger woman by a stall that sold crockery .  before he and steve reached them  however  bedwyr walked out of the crowd  munching on a piece of bread .  steve had introduced him to hunter last night before they had returned to the camp .      well  hunter  how do you like your training .     bedwyr turned to steve .     you have no broken bones  i see .         no  we are fine     said hunter .      come with us     said steve .     we   re going to speak to a friend .  we   ll introduce you .      bedwyr fell into step with them .      harriet .     steve called cheerfully .   harriet turned and waved .      that   s your friend .     bedwyr   s eyebrows rose .     she   s with gwenhyvaer .         did you say    guinevere    .     steve asked in surprise .      you say it oddly     said bedwyr .     if you know the name  though  you must have heard .  rumor says artorius will make her queen .         she   s just a kid     steve muttered .      she has her growth .     bedwyr laughed .     not too young to become a queen  eh .         you know her .         only by sight .      when they reached the stall  harriet introduced gwenhyvaer to hunter and steve .  in turn  steve introduced them both to bedwyr .  gwenhyvaer nodded primly to them all and turned back to the crockery .      we met bedwyr in the village last night     said steve .     we drank together .         we won   t see many taverns on the campaign     said bedwyr  grinning .      are you from this area .     harriet asked .     i wondered what it   s like .  we   re from linnuis .         yes  my village is not far .  half a day   s ride .  life is good there .  but we must send good men to ride with artorius  or else the saxons will have it all .         would you tell me about your village .  really tell me  i mean .         as you wish  of course .  i doubt it   s much different from your own .         let   s sit down somewhere and visit     said steve .     what do you say  hunter .  after all that riding today  i   d like to relax .         you go on     gwenhyvaer said to harriet .     after i browse some more  i   m going back to the palace .  i   ll remind the sentries to let you in .          all right .         i have no objection     said hunter .     wayne encouraged emrys to leave the village at midday  while hunter and steve remained on maneuvers with the troop .  he did not know for sure if hunter would cooperate with his demands or not .  however  he told ishihara to keep a careful watch behind them as the cart left the tor  and ishihara reported no sign that hunter or steve had followed them .   in the late afternoon  emrys left the hut to hike back to his son  tending the main flock .  wayne waited until jane used the outhouse and was out of hearing .  then he approached ishihara and spoke quietly .      hunter almost certainly spotted us leaving the tor     said wayne .     he will know which direction we took .  what do you think the chances are that he will risk trying to rescue jane instead of catching mc   and trading him to me .         he has a great deal of room for interpretation of the first law in this case     said ishihara .     however  i believe that my presence gives him the freedom to move slowly .         i think so  too .  without you  he would feel he had to rescue jane right away because i can   t protect her effectively alone .  you can .         yes .  given that hunter knows i must keep jane from harm  he does not have to come for her immediately .         when i spoke to hunter  i got the impression that he accepted my terms     said wayne .     he   ll consider trading mc   to me for jane .  but i have to ask if you   ll allow it .  i don   t know of any interpretation of the first law that will cause you to prevent this deal .  do you .         no .  as long as i protect you and jane until the time that she is released directly to hunter   s care  i can cooperate with you in this .         good .         i must offer another interpretation of hunter   s moves  however .         what .         hunter may not worry about jane further  since he knows i must take care of her .  he may just get mc   and forget about dealing with you for her .         you think he can do that under the first law .     wayne frowned  gazing out over the cool  gray sky in the distance over cadbury tor .      perhaps .  i cannot be certain .  however  since mc   is the only component robot remaining at large  hunter knows you will have no further interest in jane if he simply takes mc   back to our time .         you mean he   ll figure you and i will just return  too  and let jane go .         he knows i cannot allow harm to come to jane .  that may free him to ignore your deal entirely .      wayne drew in a long  slow breath and let it out again .     i must proceed on the assumption that the first law will pressure him to act more aggressively toward jane .  to that end  i may instruct you to remain here with jane while i return to cadbury .  will this be acceptable under your interpretation of the first law .         i do not like separating from you .  i must protect you  as well .         in the absence of a clear danger under the first law  you should have no problem .  cadbury will be safe for me .  do you agree .         yes .     ishihara lowered his voice .     if you wish this to remain private  we must change the subject .  jane is coming back .        hunter sat down in a small tavern with bedwyr  harriet  and steve .  harriet asked bedwyr many detailed questions about life in his village  hunter could hear the historian behind her questions .  steve listened politely  sipping from a goblet of mead  sprawled back in his seat comfortably .   a bell began to ring loudly  clearly  and rhythmically outside .  bedwyr promptly put his goblet down on the table and got up .  then he looked in surprise at the others  who had not moved .   the other patrons in the tavern  and the tavern keeper  hurried out the door .      it   s the village bell     he said .     aren   t you coming .  important news must have come .      steve started to get up .      no     said hunter  gently placing a hand on steve   s arm .     please inform us of the news .         as you wish .     bedwyr shrugged and hurried out of the tavern .   outside  hunter heard many feet from allover the village moving quickly up and down the streets .      what   s wrong  hunter .     steve asked .      the three of us have not had a chance to confer freely for some time     said hunter .     we can talk now and find out what the news is later .         well  what do you want to talk about .     steve set down his goblet .      if mc   has not returned to full size  or if we cannot find any clue to his location  steve and i may have to consider leaving the troop we have joined .  if we do  i judge that we cannot expect to be welcome in the village any longer .  is this accurate .             yes  if you just quit or disappear     said harriet thoughtfully .     no army tolerates deserters  though in this time  organization is not very formal .  quitting now probably would mean that you would simply not be welcome back .  deserting on campaign  however  is likely a hanging offense .  but i wonder if you can arrange to be reassigned to garrison duty here in the tor .         is that likely .     hunter asked .      no .  new arrivals are not likely to be trusted .  but i can ask gwenhyvaer if she can help .         if we go out on campaign  we could be wasting valuable time     said hunter .     but suppose this is necessary .  will you be safe here .         yes .  gwenhyvaer seems to like me .  and if my husband has gone out to fight with artorius  i will look better to everyone in the palace .         i asked a couple of sentries last night if they had seen anyone of mc     s description in the palace     said steve .     i guess if you   d heard anything like that  you would have said so already .         yes  i would have .     harriet shook her head .     mc   may not be in the palace  though .  he could be working in the village during the day and either spending the night hidden away in the village or out in the countryside nearby .         he could still be microscopic     said hunter .     we are searching in a relatively small area with a modest population .  if he had returned to full size and had remained in the village  we should have found someone who has seen him by now .         we haven   t offered a reward here  like we have before     said steve .      i can do that     said harriet .     if i remain here to cover the village  then you can see if he appears with the riders at some point .         you seem very comfortable here     said hunter .      hunter  i might as well tell you something     said harriet slowly .     as i mentioned before  i do not believe in chaos theory at all .  i   m willing to fulfill my commitment to you in finding mc    but then i want to stay in this time .         forever .     steve sat up in his chair  startled .     are you crazy .         maybe .     harriet smiled .     but i used to dream about living in this time   the focus of my professional research .  and when hunter told me about the mission to travel back in time  i knew i wanted to do it .         you accepted this job with the intention of staying here .     hunter asked .      yes .  i admit it .  but i waited to make my final decision until after i had seen what my prospects would be .  since i have the advantage of hindsight  i can use it to improve my chances .  for instance  i know before gwenhyvaer and artorius themselves that they will marry .  i intend to position myself as a mentor and friend to her .  after my husband disappears  maybe in battle against the saxons  i will be an honored widow .  i hope she will accept me as a personal servant .      hunter said nothing .  on the second mission  which took the team to jamaica in the seventeenth century to capture mc    he had hired a historian named rita chavez .  rita had decided to go out on her own only on impulse  after the team had arrived there .  her leaving the team had endangered the mission  but she had eventually changed her mind and returned to the team .  harriet remained willing to fulfill her duties  apparently  but she seemed to have made a much more calm and studied decision not to return to their own time .      have you really thought this through .     steve demanded .     what kind of doctors do they have here .  what happens if you get sick  or get hurt .         yes  i   ve thought it through .  i   m not one to romanticize this era   if anything  i know it better than most people from our time .         before we left  you said this was a time of social and political transition     said hunter .     the border between the britons and the saxons fluctuates .  why do you want to live in a time that is so unstable .         in terms of scholarly study  this time is unstable .  very little from these years will last for as long as another century  when the saxons conquer and settle throughout all of what will become england .  but for one middle aged woman like me  life in a village far from the military front will be very routine  day in and day out .         what will you do when the saxons come .     steve frowned .     that time can   t be very routine .         again  i   m using the advantage of historical hindsight .  the efforts of artorius and his men will hold off the saxons for the rest of my lifetime .  my presence won   t change that .  even under the worst circumstances  i   ll be gone before the saxons reach this area .      hunter did not respond .  the first law required him to take harriet back both for her own safety and because of his own belief in chaos theory .  the harm to her in returning would be virtually nonexistent  yet in his opinion  the potential harm to the future if she stayed remained very large .  if necessary  he would take her back under duress  and he did not want to tell her that  she might decide to run away  as rita had .  in any case  this matter would have to wait until the team was ready to leave this time again .     from the

into the tavern  out of breath .  behind him  hunter could see other people running through the street .  shouts came from allover the village .      what is it .     steve asked  looking up .      a scouting patrol just came back from the saxon border .     bedwyr paused to catch his breath .     a new fleet of saxons has crossed the channel .  with their brethren already in britain  they are preparing to march soon .         what will artorius do .     hunter asked .      he already came out to speak .  that   s why the bell rang .  he has issued orders for us to march tomorrow .         most of his army is not here     said hunter .      that   s right     said bedwyr .     his personal troop and lucius   s green recruits are the only ones .  but couriers are being sent to the countryside to tell all the veterans to meet us on our line of march .         can they arrive in time .     steve asked .      of course .     bedwyr laughed .     remember  we are all mounted .  the saxons march on their own sorry feet .  we will gather long before we meet them .         when do we leave .     hunter asked .     tonight .         no  no .  attack is not imminent  only the need to open the campaign .  the baggage train must be assembled and that work will go on late into the night .  in the morning  we will ride .      hunter turned to harriet .     will you be welcome in the palace indefinitely .  if not  we must find another place for you .  we should begin now .         i   ll talk to gwenhyvaer about it right away     said harriet  standing .     she must have heard the bell  too .  i imagine the whole palace is buzzing .         what about us .     steve asked bedwyr .     do we have to report to the camp right away .         of course not .     bedwyr laughed and sat down in his chair again .     every man not on sentry duty will be coming to the taverns soon .  it   s our last night of freedom .  now where   s that tavernkeeper   still out in the street .        jane knelt by the fire  setting out bowls on the hearth .  just as ygerna began to ladle mutton stew into the bowls  hoofbeats sounded outside .  emrys and ishihara went out into the twilight to see who was coming .  wayne remained on a stool near the door  which was left ajar .   ygerna paid no attention as she ladled out the stew .  jane feigned disinterest but listened carefully .  a single horse cantered right up to the front of the hut .      does anyone here ride with artorius .     an unfamiliar man   s voice called out .      no     said emrys .     why .         artorius rides tomorrow .  spread the word to anyone who rides with him .  the saxons are marching .     the hoofbeats cantered away .   emrys came back inside .  at the same moment  wayne got up and slipped outside  blocking ishihara from entering .  he closed the door behind him .      i sold my sheep just in time .     emrys grinned .     did you hear .         artorius rides tomorrow     said ygerna .     that   s good .  he will defeat the saxons again this year .         the other shepherds will have to leave at dawn to drive their sheep to the tor     said emrys  coming to take a bowl of stew from ygerna .     even then  they may not arrive until after he has left .  if they want to sell their sheep to him after that  they will have to chase the baggage train .      jane tensed  wondering what this would mean to her .  if hunter and steve had to maintain the goodwill of those around them  she supposed they would have to go .  she knew that wayne was conferring with ishihara at that moment about the same question .  they would have to decide what to do and  in particular  what to do with her .   the central issue remained the same as before  the whereabouts of mc   .  if mc   went on campaign with artorius  then hunter and steve would also go .  wayne could not possibly find out if mc   was going before tomorrow  but he might decide that if hunter went  he should go .   jane tried to figure out what ishihara would do if wayne decided to follow artorius .  in her judgment  ishihara could neither let wayne follow a troop of riders going to war alone  nor could he leave jane here indefinitely .  therefore  ishihara would have to take her  too .   she still did not know for sure if hunter and steve would go with artorius or attempt something else .     early the next morning  steve sat by the campfire next to hunter  eating a bowl of hot cereal .  the night before  hunter had told steve that harriet had called him to report that gwenhyvaer would give her lodging for as long as her husband was gone on campaign .  now  everyone around them spoke excitedly of riding out today .  as soon as each squad had finished breakfast  they put out their fire and hurried to the other side of the tor to prepare their horses .   when cynric led his squad around the slope  steve moved close to hunter and spoke quietly .      you want to take one more quick walk through the village .  if mc   isn   t going with artorius  either microscopically or at full size  we really are wasting our time .         i dare not     said hunter .     we must maintain our standing here .      this time  as the riders lined up to get their tack and their weapons  teamsters hitched horses to wagons .  baggage handlers loaded spare weapons and armor into some of them .  some teamsters drove empty wagons up to the village  others drove loaded wagons back .      i see mc       said hunter softly  looking out over the slope from his place in line .      what .  where .     steve fought to remain calm .     maybe we can get him before we leave .         he is riding in the back of the second wagon coming down the slope from the village .         yeah  i guess i see him now .  i couldn   t have recognized him for sure at this distance .     steve hesitated .     you   re sure that   s him .         yes .  when we see where the wagon goes  we can decide whether or not to approach it immediately .         you mean  we   ll just grab him right now .     steve asked in surprise .      we should move as soon as we can do so safely and successfully .         but what about jane .  we can   t grab mc   and just walk away from here to get her .  if we don   t jump right back to our own time  we   ll have to go on campaign .  and if that   s the case  i don   t think we should alert mc   to the fact that we   re after him .         we must take mc   immediately back to their own time  leave him securely in mc governor   s office  and then come back for jane .         what about wayne   s threat .     steve asked .     he can order ishihara away from jane  so she won   t be protected .         our first responsibility remains returning mc   to our own time .  further  i do not believe that wayne truly would endanger jane .  i judge him to be a man who would threaten this in the hope of influencing me under the first law  but who would not carry out the threat .         i   m not so sure .      the wagon in which mc   rode pulled up near the main gate of the outer rampart  behind some other loaded wagons .      we   re moving to the front of the line     said steve .     are we going to get our tack first  or just go now .         we should waste no more time     said hunter decisively .     come .      hunter stepped out of the line and angled quickly across the slope  down toward the loaded wagons .  most of the teamsters sat holding the reins  simply waiting  but a few of them stood on the ground  adjusting harnesses or ropes holding cargo .      can   t he tell somehow that you   re a robot .     steve asked .     didn   t we have to consider this on earlier missions  too .  what did we do .         if he studies me with magnified vision or hearing  he will detect that i do not have human skin or a heartbeat .  we must gamble that he will not bother  since he has no reason to expect another robot here in this century .         oh  yeah .  that   s right .      steve followed hunter  keeping an eye on mc   .  the component robot sat in the rear of a wagon watching his surroundings alertly  but of course he had no idea that hunter and steve had come from their time to get him .  he glanced at them casually and then looked past them  toward the paddock .      since he is not afraid of us  we can walk right up and speak to him     said hunter .     give him a direct instruction to cooperate fully with us .         what do we do after we get him .     steve asked .     we don   t want to vanish with him in front of these other people .  what should i say .         your second instruction must be to jump down out of the wagon and come around behind it with us .  we will hurry out the main gate .  as soon as we turn the corner and stand out of sight  i will trigger the belt unit .         got it .     steve glanced at the gate  just on the other side of the wagon  and looked at mc   again .      ho .  you there .  what do you want .      steve stopped  startled .  hunter turned in surprise .  a tall  burly man wearing a tanned leather tunic marched up to them .  he scowled through a bushy brown beard .      i say  what do you want here .         we must have a moment with this man     hunter said firmly  gesturing toward mc   .     who are you .         i am gaius  the wagonmaster .     he glared suspiciously at hunter .     what do you want with him .  he doesn   t speak british or latin .  the only way we can communicate with him is through gestures .         we speak his language     said hunter .   steve almost called out to mc   in english  to order him to cooperate .  he thought better of it  realizing that they might not get a chance to take mc   away from the sight of the wagonmaster .  in that event  he did not want to alert mc   to the fact that they had come from his time to take him back .      and i asked  what do you want with him .     before hunter could answer  gaius turned to mc   .     you know these men .     he jerked a thumb toward hunter .   mc   looked back and forth between them .  he obviously did not understand the question .  he shrugged lightly  shaking his head .      you men get back to your horses     said gaius angrily .     now .  i have wagons to line up .     he moved to block hunter   s path to mc   .   hunter turned and walked back up the slope .  steve hurried to keep alongside .  at least they had not revealed their true intentions to mc   .     jane said nothing about wayne   s plans the next morning .  she helped ygerna tend the fire  waiting to see what wayne and ishihara were going to do .  they all ate breakfast  the same hot cereal as every other morning .  then wayne and ishihara stepped outside again  this time with emrys .   the suspense for jane finally ended when ishihara came back inside alone .      emrys will drive us to the village again today     ishihara said to jane .     wayne instructed me to explain that we must search for an acquaintance there .  emrys expressed his gratitude again for my help in cutting the firewood and  by chance  causing him to drive his sheep to sell before his neighbors .  so he will send his eldest son to tend the flock again and help us today  as well .      jane nodded .  she did not want ishihara or wayne to know that she was glad to be going  too .  on her way out of the hut  she gave ygerna a quick smile and pat on the shoulder .  jane hoped to join hunter somehow today  which would mean she would not be back  but of course she could hardly say so .   this time  emrys did not have firewood to load or sheep to drive .  ygerna gave them some bread and cold cooked mutton to take with them  wrapped first in a clean cloth  then put into a heavier cloth bag .  ishihara lifted jane into the back of the empty cart  as before  and climbed in with her .  emrys waited for wayne to join him in the front  then shook the reins and started out .   today  other shepherds with their flocks clogged the road to the tor .  most of them walked  with a dog or two to drive the sheep .  a few others also drove mule carts  carrying either butchered carcasses or  in some cases  an entire family going for an outing .   emrys  the only shepherd without sheep or a full cart  drove a little faster .  with a big grin  he waved to some of his friends as he drew near  calling out greetings occasionally .  he drove off the road to pass them and their flocks  taking the cart over the sod on one side or the other .   jane watched the tor closely  hoping to arrive before the riders left the tor .  today  however  they did not make it .  the troop rode out well ahead of their arrival .  instead of breaking formation to begin maneuvers  however  the troop rode straight out along a different road  one that angled eastward across the rolling hills .   when she saw they were leaving  she tensed  hoping to spot whether hunter and steve rode with them .  she did not see either of them  though she realized they might be lost in the crowd of riders .  however  she decided that even if she spotted hunt er by his height  she could not risk trying to attract his attention from this distance .  hunter might not hear her and wayne would get angry at the attempt .  she wanted to reserve her efforts for a move that would work .           ishihara saw hunter   s head and shoulders towering above his companions  as he rode with the troop away from the tor  well ahead of emrys   s cart .  since wayne had told him not to alert jane unnecessarily to new information regarding hunter  ishihara merely leaned forward between emrys and wayne and pointed with one finger toward the riders .  wayne nodded .   after the riders had passed from the main gate  ishihara watched a long train of wagons follow the riders out of the tor and up the road to the east .  over twenty men and women trudged behind it  failing to keep up .  for a while  ishihara  wayne  and emrys continued to ride in silence .  as the cart reached the main gate of the tor  after the baggage train had moved far up the road  wayne leaned close to ishihara .      who are those people walking behind the wagons .     wayne asked .      i believe they are called camp followers .  the women are following the soldiers and the men are scavengers  hoping to loot the dead after a battle .  as the army marches  more of them will probably see it and follow  too .         do you agree that we have to follow them all  too .     wayne whispered .  the sound of the mule   s hooves helped camouflage his voice from jane in the back of the cart .      yes     ishihara whispered back .     i judge that hunter and steve would not go on this campaign unless they knew that mc   was also going .         how can we arrange to go  too .      ishihara turned to emrys .      we must ask you for help once again .         what is it .         we would like to borrow your wagon     said ishihara .     for a few days  at least .  maybe more .         what do you want with it .         we must follow a couple of friends who have left with artorius .         you want to follow artorius on campaign .  that will take more than a few days .  he could be gone until the leaves turn in autumn .      wayne could not understand british  so he looked back and forth between them for a clue to emrys   s answer .      i can guarantee we will bring it back as soon as possible     said ishihara .      but i may need it before you return .     emrys shook his head .     you have done me several kindnesses  but i will need my cart .  maybe we can find another way for you and your friends to follow artorius .         what do you mean .     ishihara asked .      well  i could drive you to the baggage train .  they always need men to work on the wagons during a campaign .  during the summer  some may go too close to the battle and get killed  others run away to find something else .         what did he say .     wayne asked .   ishihara switched to english .     he won   t let us borrow his wagon .  instead  he suggested that he take us to the baggage train and we can earn our keep .         if hunter saw us  we   d be helpless .  he would take jane and me .         i cannot allow it  anyway .  the danger to jane is too great in that sort of company .         yeah .      ishihara changed languages again .     we dare not take jane to the baggage train .  we need to find our own wagon or mounts to ride .         i understand     said emrys .     and you want to be able to return on your own  as well  without having to walk .         yes .      emrys looked across the slope .  then  without a word  he shook the reins and drove the cart at an angle up the tor .  they left the road leading up to the village .   ishihara saw the paddock and two other buildings ahead of them .  only two animals remained in the pen and he supposed they had been left behind because they were not suitable to ride .  he did not see any small carts similar to emrys   s .   as emrys drew up in front of the paddock  a short  stocky man wearing a ragged leather tunic walked on a wooden crutch under his left arm from one of the buildings .      if you want to sell something  you   re too late     said the man with the crutch .     you   ll have to catch up to the baggage train .         no  no .  we wish to buy     said emrys .     are you the master of horse .         of course not .     the man scowled .     the master of horse has gone with artorius .  so has the armorer .  i am antonius .     he hesitated .     what do you want to buy .         a couple of horses     said ishihara .      the price of a good horse goes up this time of year     said antonius .      nonsense     said emrys .     every good horse has already been taken .  you have none at all .         then what do you want here .         i will dicker with the man who can sell     said emrys .     if you are not the master of horse  who makes the decisions here now .         well  until artorius returns  i do .         we want two or three mounts to ride on the road .         just to travel .  not to join the cavalry or to pull a wagon .         no .         all right .  come and look .      emrys and ishihara got down and followed antonius into the paddock .  wayne hopped down and watched but did not bother to enter the pen .  jane stayed where she was .   antonius led emrys and ishihara to a pair of small  brown mules standing quietly .  ishihara noticed their long ears and white noses .  both animals placidly watched them approach .   emrys looked over the mules carefully .  he patted them and stroked their legs and necks as he walked around them .  then he examined their teeth .   finally  emrys took some coins out of a pouch and held them out to antonius .   the other man leaned on his crutch and frowned  shaking his head .   without speaking  emrys took out one more coin and held it out .   antonius shook his head again .      that is all he is worth     said emrys .   antonius said nothing .   emrys dropped the coins back into his pouch and walked away .  ishihara followed him .  just as they reached the gate of the paddock  antonius began hustling after them awkwardly on his crutch .      all right     antonius called .     he is yours .      emrys turned and spilled the coins carefully into his palm again .  he dropped them into antonius   s outstretched hand .  then antonius walked back to the storage building and came out with an old bridle and a long rope .  in the paddock again  he tossed them to emrys  who slipped the bridle on one of the mules and tied the rope to rings on the bridle to use as reins .  then he led the mule out of the paddock .      i ask only that you return it to me when you come back     said emrys  holding the reins out to ishihara .      that might not be possible     said ishihara  without accepting the reins .     if we have to act quickly  returning it could endanger me .         i know the campaign could be dangerous .  please take care of yourselves .     emrys placed the reins in ishihara   s hands .     you are .  .  . unusual friends .         thank you .  we shall bring the mule back if we are able .     ishihara turned    and related this to wayne  knowing that jane could overhear him .      all right  but it   s only one mule for three of us     said jane .      what else can we do .     ishihara asked .      nothing     said wayne .     we have no money .         what   s wrong with this mule .     jane demanded .      what do you mean .     wayne asked .      why didn   t they take him to ride .  or for the baggage train .  is he old or something .         antonius explained     said ishihara .     this mule is young and healthy but too small to put in harness .  the warriors disdain riding a mule into battle and they have enough food  so no one would want to eat it .         i have another suspicion  too     wayne added  lowering his voice .      what .     jane asked  concerned .     something bad about the mule .         no  nothing like that .     wayne shook his head .     since antonius is in charge here for now  i think he   s going to pocket the coins emrys paid him .  so if he sells a cavalry mule and keeps all the profit  he   ll be happy enough .         i am sure that emrys cannot buy another     said ishihara .     however  you and wayne can ride this one together  bareback .  he will tire more quickly than a horse carrying one rider  but the teams pulling the baggage train will tire quickly  too .  we should be able to catch up tonight after they stop to make camp .      jane nodded .     and you   ll jog along beside us .         yes .      jane climbed out of the cart .  emrys handed her the bag of bread and mutton .  she accepted it .      thank you  emrys     jane said  in latin .     farewell .      emrys understood her meaning  if not the words  and nodded politely .      this won   t last us very long     said jane  turning to ishihara .     what else are we going to eat on the way .  this might last us two small meals  but tomorrow morning  we   ll be on the road somewhere .         if necessary  we can always use the belt unit to jump to another time and place for food     said wayne .     but if we   re lucky  we   ll find mc   tonight  get him to come with us  and be done with the whole mess .         all right     said jane reluctantly .     i know you don   t want to starve  either .  but now that i think about it  what about getting through the night .  if you don   t get mc   to follow you tonight  we   ll freeze out on the road without some kind of bedrolls .         we must find blankets in the village     said ishihara .     however  without money to buy them  we can only ask for emrys to help again .  i do not know how much more he will be willing and able to help .         maybe he can afford old ones      said jane .     their condition won   t matter  as long as they don   t have bugs or anything .  please ask him .      ishihara turned to emrys again .     can we buy old  inexpensive blankets in the village .  we can return them  too  with the mule .         of course     said emrys .     i know which booth to visit .  i can help with that .  you will need a small pot in which to heat water  too .         we will go to the village     said ishihara .     then  if our search for blankets succeeds  we will hurry on our way up the road .        steve enjoyed riding out with artorius   s cavalry  in a column of four abreast .  he rode on the far right of his rank  with hunter on his immediate left and cynric on hunter   s other side .  another member of their squad rode on the far left  with the remainder in the ranks behind them .   all of lucius   s troop of green recruits rode in the rear .  no dust roiled up  however  because of the dampness in the earth .  overhead  gray clouds drifted across the sky .   around him  steve could see the excitement in the young faces of the other riders .  the thought of going to war against the hated saxons dominated their attention .  none of them spoke now .   up ahead  as the column drew away from cadbury  the squads in the van cantered ahead of the rest .  when the vanguard had opened some distance  the entire column was ordered to canter .  steve understood and kicked his mount  artorius  already a veteran leader  wanted his men to vent their tension .   when the column slowed to a walk again  steve could see the difference .  the riders around him relaxed  breathless  and began talking and laughing among themselves .  under the hooves of the horses ahead  the soft road quickly turned to muddy slop  but no one cared .  the road wound east and sometimes northeast around rolling hills covered with lush green grass  clumps of trees lined the hollows among the hills .      i hear word from up ahead     said hunter .     a rumor of our destination is slowly passing back through the column  from one man to another .         well  what is it .  where are we going .         to the river dubglas in linnuis     said hunter .  he lowered his voice and leaned toward steve  switching to english .     according to the library data i took before we left  that is the douglas river in modern lincolnshire .         river dubglas  you say .     cynric  riding on the far side of hunter from steve  nodded .     that sounds right .         so i heard     said hunter .      we fought them by the banks of that river late last season     said cynric .     if we hope to drive them back this summer  we   ll have to attack their territory .  last year   s campaign penned them on the far side of the river  but i suppose they look to cross it again  with their reinforcements from across the channel .     his face tightened as he considered this .      how long will we take to reach river dubglas .     hunter asked .      if we ride without a break to the same site as last year   s battle  three days .  our scouts will ride back with word as we draw closer  though  to tell artorius exactly where on the river to go .  we might spend some time moving up and down the bank .  artorius will make his final plans according to how many of our veterans join us quickly .         you feel he may order us to wait and gather his troops before moving into battle .     hunter asked .      anything is possible .  we will find out his plans when we are close enough for our scouts to bring fresh information .      steve understood the real questions in hunter   s mind  behind his spoken words .  hunter wanted to take steve away from the column before any battle began .  ideally  they would find mc   and simply return together to their own time before the fighting started .  now hunter could estimate that they had a minimum of three days before artorius could reach the saxons .           wayne and jane rode the mule .  he held the reins while jane sat behind him with her arms around his waist .  even at a walk  the mule   s long legs moved faster than a human   s legs would walk .   ishihara had to stride quickly to keep up .  he moved at a pace that no human could maintain for long  but of course had no trouble with it himself .  because the road had been churned to a deep muddy soup by the horses ahead  wayne rode through the long grass by the side of the road .   in late morning  they caught up to the camp followers hiking after the riders .  ishihara led wayne on a long detour around the camp followers  far enough to avoid conversation .  then they moved back to the side of the road again .   at midday  wayne stopped for a break .  he and jane ate part of their bread and mutton in silence .  then they mounted again and continued on their journey .   late in the afternoon  ishihara suddenly trotted about twenty meters ahead of the mule  then stopped .  as wayne caught up to him  ishihara raised a hand for him to halt .  wayne saw that ishihara was listening to something .      they have stopped to make camp     ishihara said finally .     the noises are faint  but we will come within sight of the camp soon .  we must decide how to proceed now  before anyone in the camp sees us .         well .  .  . i don   t know exactly what to do     said wayne .     what do you suggest .      ishihara looked up the road  which still wound through rolling hills ahead .     that long line of trees suggests a river or at least a stream that provides water for artorius   s camp .  we will need water  too  so we might as well go close enough to see what the camp looks like .         yeah .  maybe we can see mc   from a distance .     wayne kicked the mule forward .   as wayne passed  ishihara looked behind him  at jane .     you are still well .         yeah     jane muttered .     the troops halted to make camp by a small stream .  hunter saw new scouting patrols ride out  crossing the stream .  he understood that by stopping with plenty of daylight left  the main column allowed the baggage train time to catch up before darkness fell .   the squads split up and fanned out from the road .  the riders tended their horses first  unsaddling them and hobbling them to graze .  then the men were ordered to gather firewood to make separate campfires for the night .      there   s dead wood among those live trees  all over the place     said steve  glancing at the trees lining the stream .     we don   t need everybody to gather it .         every man does his share     growled cynric .     come on  you two .         hold it     called bedwyr  with a big grin .  he walked briskly among the other men and horses toward them .     i have business here  cynric .  how did my green friends fare on their first day of march .         very well  thank you     said hunter .      you told me you lead a scouting patrol     said steve .     do you have any news .  we heard a rumor about going to river dubglas .         yes  that   s right     said bedwyr .     but none of the patrols today have made contact with the saxons .  fresh patrols rode out a few minutes ago  but we   re still a long way from linnuis .      steve nodded .      i have a serious reason to speak with you     said bedwyr .     artorius is worried about having so many green recruits and so few veterans .  the rest of our veterans should join us during the next day or so  but he wants to mix some quick witted new recruits with his veterans to give them some experience .  i want you two to join my patrol .         really .     steve grinned but glanced uncertainly at hunter .     that sounds exciting .         it can be     said bedwyr .   hunter considered the offer quickly .  on the face of it  scouting could be more dangerous to steve than riding in the body of the army  since the patrols would make the first contact with the enemy .  they could even be ambushed .  however  hunter also had to prepare for them both to leave the area before any fighting began  ideally without witnesses .  slipping away from the rest of the patrol momentarily would be much easier than leaving the main column .  he knew that scouts occasionally were killed and never accounted for on campaigns of this sort  so no one would question their disappearance .  in fact  when he and steve had to return for jane  they might claim simply to have lost their way or to have been caught behind the enemy lines for a short time .      we accept     said hunter .      ah .  i   m glad .  we   ll do well together .  get your gear and your horses .      cynric sighed loudly .     all right .     he jerked a thumb toward hunter .     his weight is rough on a horse  but he   s good with both his horse and his weapons .     he glanced at steve and hunter .     watch yourselves out front  there .     then he trudged after the men going to gather firewood .   steve looked toward the rear  where the baggage train had rolled into view down the muddy road .     bedwyr  would you help us with a personal matter .  after we move our horses and belongings up to join your patrol .         what is it .         we  uh  have to confront a man in the baggage train .  we don   t want him to get away  and the wagonmaster stopped us from seeing him before we left .         the same man you were looking for in the palace  when we met .         maybe .  he .  .  . owes us a little money .     steve grinned .     we want it back .      bedwyr laughed .     you told me before he did not owe you any money .      steve had forgotten what he had told bedwyr before  and now had to explain the discrepancy .     well  you and i had just met .  i  uh .  .  .         you wanted to be careful until you learned what kind of friend i might be .     bedwyr chuckled .     of course i understand .  and on this matter of finding your friend  i will be glad to help you .  but what do you want me for .         maybe you will know some of the men .  we won   t be total strangers .         yes  that would be good .  i will go with you .  and i know gaius  the wagonmaster .  but first they will have to catch up and break formation to make camp .         i promise we will commit no violence     said hunter .     we only wish to speak to him  preferably alone .  we need just a moment .      by the time hunter and steve led their mounts to the place where bedwyr   s patrol had stopped  the baggage train had halted behind the main column .  bedwyr introduced hunter and steve to their new companions in the patrol .  then they walked back through the camp to the baggage train .  .   the men in the wagon crews jumped off to unload .  hunter spotted mc   just as he hopped from the wagon  when he reached the ground  he was hidden by other wagons .  teamsters began unhitching the teams .      i saw him for a moment .     hunter pointed in the direction of mc   .      good     said steve .   bedwyr moved up to lead the way .      hey  you there .  halt .     gaius blocked bedwyr   s path .     what do you want here  bedwyr .  shouldn   t you be out looking for saxons .         easy  gaius .     bedwyr smiled pleasantly .     my friends and i have business with one of your men .  it won   t take long .     he started to walk around the other man .   gaius stepped sideways to block his way .     i remember them from this morning .  get back to your places  all of you .  we have work to do .         we have no wish to disturb anyone     said hunter .     our business will take only a moment .         not while we   re making camp  it won   t .     gaius glanced west  up at the sun .     we barely have the daylight we need now .  go on .      some other men had come up behind gaius .      easy  friend     said bedwyr  still smiling .     no one will interfere with your work .  we only want a quick word with one man .         get out .     gaius shouted  pointing back the way they had come .   hunter considered forcing his way past the wagonmaster and taking mc   by brute strength .  bedwyr might not join him  but steve would .  however  even if they were successful  that move would force hunter to flee back with steve and mc   to their own time in front of many witnesses  risking a significant change in the tales they would tell .  obviously  steve and the men of this time might be unnecessarily injured in the altercation .  in addition  hunter had to consider that the sheer number of men in front of him might prevent him from pushing his way through  since he would not display more than human strength to them .  he might simply create bad feeling without apprehending mc   .  hunter decided to postpone their approach to mc   again .      never mind  bedwyr     hunter said quietly .  he turned  followed by steve and bedwyr .      he   s really a good man     said bedwyr  as they walked .     too many of the warriors treat his men arrogantly  as though being a fighter is more important .  gaius knows this isn   t true and is very protective of them .         i have to admit  i kind of like him     said steve .     he   s direct and businesslike .         perhaps we can approach our friend again later     said hunter .     when the wagon crews have finished their work .  bedwyr  what do you think .         not tonight .  gaius doesn   t like being pushed .  maybe i can think of a favor to do for him .         what kind of favor .     steve asked .      well  if we chanced across a nice deer  for instance  on our patrol tomorrow  or a few good game birds  we might share our luck with him .  in turn  he would share it with his men  and owe us a favor in return .         i understand     said    hunter .      for now  let   s get back up to the patrol     said bedwyr .     i   m ready for dinner .        jane stood next to the mule in a small clump of trees .  wayne  on the ground next to her  held its reins .  with ishihara  they watched the wagons of the baggage train from a distance .  they could see hunter   s head and shoulders over a crowd of men in front of the wagons      i can   t hear them     said wayne .     what are they saying to each other .         hunter and steve claim they want to get some money from a man working in the baggage train     said ishihara .     i surmise that this is mc   .  they have a local man named bedwyr helping them .      jane kept looking  but she could still only see hunter   s head and shoulders from this distance .  steve remained lost in the crowd .  like wayne  she could not make out the conversation  though she heard a low rumble of voices .      you mean they   re about to get him already .     wayne   s shoulders sagged .      no .  the wagonmaster  gaius  has refused to let them pass .  he does not want anyone interfering with his wagon crews while they are making camp .         hunter   s turning around     said wayne .     is he just giving up .         for the moment  he has agreed to leave .  however  this provides us with information .  i have not spotted mc   yet  but now we know where to look for him .         let   s go     said wayne .     quick  before hunter sneaks back somehow .  he won   t give up for long .  maybe we can just run in and get mc   right away .         i do not recommend it     said ishihara .     in fact  i strongly suggest that we do nothing at the moment .         why .     wayne demanded .     we know where he is  and he   s not very far away .         gaius was adamant about not allowing anyone to disturb his crews .  some of his men stood behind him  and from their posture i believe they were ready to fight if necessary .  they are likely to remain angry .         oh .     wayne sighed  still looking at the men around the wagons .     i see what you mean .  i hate waiting  but if we can   t get to him anyway  then we should lie low .  we don   t want to alert hunter or mc   to our presence .         in the meantime  we should find a comfortable place under the trees to spend the night .     ishihara turned and looked down the road the way they had come .     the camp followers have not caught up yet  but they will .  when they are nearby  we must avoid direct contact with them  but their campfires will camouflage our own .  hunter and steve will have no reason to think we are here .      jane said nothing .  however  the renewed possibility of escaping wayne and ishihara gave her a surge of excitement .  later tonight  she would try to get away .  for now  lying low suited her just fine .           harriet spent the evening at gwenhyvaer   s side .  after dinner  they joined the other women by a large fireplace in the main hall drinking mead .  the palace seemed empty without the men who had gone with artorius .  only the boys and the elderly men remained .  in the tor around them  a skeletal garrison still guarded the walls  but their real protector had ridden out to meet the enemy in his own land .   the other women talked about the saxons and how long the men would be gone .  harriet noticed that none talked about which ones would not come home .  as the fire burned down  the discussion grew quieter  however .  then  one by one  the other women retired for the night to be alone with their thoughts .      are you sleepy .     harriet asked  when she and gwenhyvaer were left alone in front of the fire .      a little .     gwenhyvaer shrugged .     but i   m wide awake  too .     she gazed into the dwindling flames .      shall i put more wood on the fire .         no .      harriet waited in silence  watching her .      if artorius doesn   t come back  i will be nobody     said gwenhyvaer quietly .   harriet wanted to reassure her  to tell her that artorius would return  but did not dare .  a single comforting word might pass as normal  but if harriet remained in this time for the rest of her life  she would have to learn to keep quiet .  the alternative could be gaining  over time  a reputation for knowing the future .   in a superstitious society  knowing the future could make her either a respected wise woman or an evil sorceress  but she would have no control over which one .  she would five most comfortably by blending into society  not by standing out .  besides  despite her disbelief in chaos theory  she knew that she really could change the future if she eventually altered the behavior of enough important people .      if artorius falls  we are all in trouble     harriet said carefully .     but he knows his enemy .         yes  that   s true .     gwenhyvaer brightened a little .     he   s been fighting the saxons for a long time .      harriet thought again of how young gwenhyvaer seemed .  she reminded herself once more that gwenhyvaer was a grown woman in this society and almost past her prime marriage years .  for that reason  gwenhyvaer had good reason to be concerned about her future with artorius .   a woman   s position in this society depended largely on the prestige of her father and her husband .  even worse  the status of men in this time was fluid and uncertain  leaving any particular woman with few good choices .  the wealth and social strata of roman society were gone and the social system of medieval england lay many centuries in the future .  gwenhyvaer knew that if she did not marry well before long  she might have to choose between spending her life as a glorified servant in the palace or marrying a man who rode with artorius in summer and tended sheep the rest of the year .      did your husband ever fight in a war before .     gwenhyvaer asked .     did you worry about him all the time .         he never fought in a war     said harriet .      really .  he   s so big .  he would make a good warrior .  why didn   t he .     .   harriet suppressed a smile  thinking of the first law .  she also realized she would have to embellish the story of her life with hunter a little in order to answer .     when the saxons drove us out of linnuis  on the coast  we had no army left in the area to join .  and if he had gone to find artorius farther inland  i would have been abandoned .         i see     said gwenhyvaer .     that   s when he took you with him to gaul .         that   s right .         i hope i get married soon .     gwenhyvaer turned from the fire to harriet .     did you get married young .         well .  .  . yes .         how old are you .         i   m forty .      gwenhyvaer straightened in surprise  her eyes wide .     what .  are you joking with me .         no .  i   m not joking .     harriet smiled at her surprise  knowing that the average life expectancy here was in the early forties  due to the stresses of physical labor  limited diet  and the lack of medical knowledge and dental care .     i   m forty years old .         but .  .  . you have all your teeth .     gwenhyvaer looked at her mouth again  making sure .   harriet laughed lightly .     yes  i do .     she shrugged .     i   ve been fortunate .         but you just don   t look that old .  i thought you were .  .  . oh  i don   t know .     gwenhyvaer stared at her face .   harriet knew that a few individuals lived into their sixties and seventies even in this century  but gwenhyvaer had good reason to be shocked .  most of the women harriet   s age in this time did look much older .  the women she resembled most were closer to thirty .      can you .  .  . i mean  when i get older  can you help me look that way .         i don   t have any secrets .  if i did  i would be glad to share them .  but i don   t .      gwenhyvaer nodded slowly and turned to gaze into the fire again .     long after dark  jane lay under the stars wrapped up in her blanket .  she knew from wayne   s slow  rhythmic breathing that he had fallen asleep .  of course  ishihara remained alert .  she hoped that because she had made no move to escape  he had not focused his attention on her .   she knew that if she prepared herself to make a move  perhaps by taking several deep breaths and shifting her position  ishihara would hear the difference .  that would cost her any element of surprise .  her best chance was to move impulsively  so she did .   all at once  she flung off the blankets  scrambled up  and ran in the faint moonlight toward the camp .      hunter .     she screamed as loud as she could .     it   s jane .  hunter .  here .      footsteps  certainly ishihara   s  sounded behind her  gaining fast .      hunter .         hey .  get her .     wayne yelled sleepily .   before she could shout again  she stumbled on the uneven sod  losing speed .  ishihara   s footsteps come right up behind her and she felt a firm hand grasp her arm .   ahead of her in the camp  startled voices spoke in puzzled tones  probably sentries .   in another moment  ishihara slipped one arm around her waist and lifted her off the ground .  he moved his other hand from her arm to cover her mouth with his hand .  jane squirmed  trying to shout for hunter again .      i know i am not harming you     ishihara said quietly .     i can feel on my hand that you are breathing sufficiently through your nose .      jane decided to save her strength and quit fighting .  hunter should have heard her .  now she could only wait .     hunter was lying on the ground pretending to sleep when he heard jane   s first shout .  he recognized her voice even before she identified herself .  instantly he rose and ran through the camp toward the sound  leaving steve asleep  he did not want to endanger steve by having him follow .  by altering his vision to maximum light receptivity  he saw clearly enough in the moonlight to avoid stumbling over sleeping men or gear .      you there .  stop .     a man standing on the edge of the camp to hunter   s left shouted  holding up a spear .     stop  i say .  now .      hunter angled his run away from the man  hoping to elude him .  however  the man who had shouted began running toward him  as did other sentries on hunter   s right .  he changed his angle again  still running toward jane   s voice .  having the sentries follow him might actually help him rescue her .      halt .  what   s wrong with you .  stop .      up ahead  hunter heard hoofbeats canter away .  even at his best robotic running speed  he doubted he could catch the mount .  still  he would normally have tracked the animal through the darkness on the assumption that it carried jane and probably wayne .   however  he could not reveal his true running ability to the sentries chasing him .  for now  he would have to give up the chase .  he came to a halt and turned to face them .   the first sentry ran up to him holding his spear forward .     when i order you to halt  you halt .  what is your business out here .      five other sentries jogged up behind him  three from one side and two from another .  they surrounded hunter .  no one else spoke .      you must have heard the woman shouting     hunter said calmly .     i came to help .         you know her .      hunter decided that admitting he knew jane could endanger her .  he did not want the sentries to pay any independent attention to her if they came across her later .     no .  i just came to help .         she   s just some camp follower quarreling with a scavenger     said the sentry .     that   s their own business  not ours .  stay out of it .         he   s been a troublemaker all day     growled another man .     i remember him by his height .  he almost started a brawl by the wagons this afternoon .         is he the one .  i heard about that     said the first sentry .  he lowered his spear point toward hunter   s abdomen  but did not advance .     the saxons will give you all the fight you want .  we have no rule against chasing a camp follower in the middle of the night  but you   ll need your rest .  go on back to your squad and i   ll forget about it .      hunter knew that ishihara still had to be protecting jane  in fact  he had probably forced her to stop yelling for help .  that took away the immediate first law imperative for hunter .  he nodded to the sentry and began walking through the moonlight back into the camp with the sentries .   the incident had not been a waste .  now he knew that jane  with ishihara and presumably wayne  was with the army .  he would have other chances to reach her .     ishihara jogged through the moonlight away from the camp  carrying jane by the waist under one arm .  he still held one hand over her mouth to stop her from shouting again .  next to him  wayne rode the mule at a canter .   by the time ishihara had run back to their campsite carrying jane  wayne had already slipped the bridle on the mule and rolled up the blankets he and jane used .  as soon as he had seen ishihara coming back with jane  he had mounted up and kicked the mule into a canter  letting ishihara take the lead .   now ishihara  with his hearing turned up to maximum  could hear hunter giving explanations to the sentries behind them .  because their voices were stationary  ishihara knew the pursuit had ended for now .  still  he continued to jog parallel to the river  staying just far enough from the trees for wayne to ride safely without hitting branches in the darkness .   when ishihara heard one of the sentries discount jane   s call for help as a dispute among camp followers  he knew the sentries were not concerned .  after a while  he stopped  signaling for wayne to rein in .  at this distance  he would hear hunter   s footsteps approaching alone if hunter made another attempt to come close tonight .   ishihara set jane on her feet and released her .     are you well .         not as well as i could be     she said angrily .     i   m real tired of all this .  the idea that you aren   t harming me is insane .         i disagree     said ishihara .      we have to gag her     said wayne .     or else she   ll yell again and give away our position .         the first law will not allow that     jane declared firmly .     it will hurt me and interfere with my breathing .  if you don   t tie my hands  i   ll pull it off .  and if you tie me  i might suffocate .         she   s playing games with you     said wayne .     a careful gag won   t kill her .         i agree with her     said ishihara .     i cannot allow her to be gagged and tied .  we will have to stay far enough from the column so that i can clearly hear anyone or two sets of footsteps or hoofbeats approaching us long before they come close .  if necessary  we will maintain enough distance so that even hunter cannot hear her shout again .         we   ll be too far to get mc    in that case     said wayne .     so what   s the point of following him at all .  are you telling me just to give up .         we are far enough for both of you to get some rest     said ishihara .     during the night  i will remain alert for further pursuit and i will consider our options .        steve felt himself shaken awake early in the morning .  when he looked up  bedwyr grinned and handed him a chunk of cold  cooked mutton and a piece of bread .  the earliest light of dawn broke as a yellow haze through the gray clouds  angling among the trees along the river .      it has to last you all day     said bedwyr .     eat it at your leisure  but we won   t have any more till we return to the new camp tonight .     he also gave steve a small water skin on a leather strap .   while the rest of the camp rose slowly and built up their campfires  bedwyr roused his scouting patrol to eat their cold breakfast while saddling and bridling their horses and mounting .  only a few minutes after waking  steve found himself riding out with hunter  following the other ten men in the patrol .   when everyone else was out of hearing  hunter quietly told steve that he had heard jane call him for help the night before .  hunter related how the sentries had stopped him .  however  they now knew that wayne  jane  and ishihara had followed the column somehow .   a light drizzle fell as the patrol moved away from the camp .  first they rode along the near side of the river  walking their horses through the trees  going upstream .  then bedwyr turned and led them across the river .  as they rode through the ford  the horses walked into water up to the level of their underbellies .  the river was narrow here  though  and in a moment all the riders had crossed .   when they had left the trees on the far side of the river  steve saw bedwyr rein in and glance over his shoulder to make sure all his riders had crossed safely .  then the scouts looked in all directions  across more grassy  rolling hills .  in the distance to the east  steve could see the edge of a forest .  to his right  far downstream  he saw another patrol also cross the river and leave the trees .  that patrol angled away from them  to the southeast .   bedwyr suddenly kicked his mount into a canter and rode off toward the distant forest .  the rest of the patrol followed .  steve continued to ride in the rear  next to hunter  squinting in the drizzle .           after about half a kilometer  bedwyr slowed to a walk again .  he waved for the patrol to keep moving in the same direction  but stopped and waited for steve and hunter to come up .  then  with a big grin  he fell into step next to them .      i love this open country     said bedwyr .     we can spot and ride down any saxon who hikes out of the forest .  as soon as we came across the river  we could see at a glance that this area   s clear   not that i thought they   ve had time to advance this far .         the forest up ahead could be dangerous to us  then .     hunter asked .      we   ll be careful  all right  when we get there .  even a foul saxon can hide among the trees or climb up into the branches .  i still say we   re too far from their territory to meet them yet  but we won   t take chances when we reach any forest .     bedwyr shrugged .     last year  we didn   t see any saxons for several more days after we passed through here .         you rode this route last summer .     steve asked .     we   re on the same campaign allover again .         oh  yes .     bedwyr frowned  eyeing the cloudy sky above them .     more saxons sail across the channel every year .  we don   t have similar numbers coming to join us .  every year  we hope to kill enough to drive them back toward the sea again  but the work feels much the same  year after year      steve nodded .      last year  we found the saxons waiting for us on the opposite bank of the river dubglas .  artorius didn   t want to attack against their strength across the water  where our horses would lose the force of their charge in walking or swimming .  the saxons were relying on that  of course  they carry eight foot lances to unhorse us  and in the water they have a better chance .  so we moved up and down the bank to get around them  but the saxons kept stretching their line to block us .         what did you do .     hunter asked .      when we had stretched their line thin enough  we took advantage of our mobility .  artorius led one end of our line on a fast ride doubling back to the center and charged across the river anyway .  they didn   t have time to mass their men again to meet us  since they   re all on foot .         and the charge worked .     steve asked .      yes .  even through the water .  their line was so thin that they broke easily .  after that  the rest of the saxon line panicked .     bedwyr grinned .     it was easy slaughter after that  i promise you .         what did you do during the rest of the summer .     hunter asked .     that battle itself must not have taken long .  did you fight more than one .         we fought only one pitched battle against their full numbers     said bedwyr .     it occurred late in the season .  you see  we spent the early part of the summer jockeying for position .         even with your advantage in mobility .     hunter asked .     artorius could ride in circles around any saxon army and attack at any time .         the saxons come on like waves of the sea     said bedwyr .     yes  we can ride around them  but we must be careful about entering battle .  their numbers are so much greater that artorius dares not fight them recklessly .         so what did you do .     steve asked .     just wait until the right time .         we did plenty of waiting  all right  but we didn   t just ride around and look at the landscape  either .  our strategy was to attack the saxons in small groups .         what do you mean .     hunter asked .     how can you separate waves of the sea .      bedwyr laughed .     they keep coming  but they don   t live together in cities the way romans do .  they live in small villages .         but once you attacked one  didn   t they rally their army together .     steve asked .      that was their goal     said bedwyr .     but we stayed in the saddle and rode hard to confuse them .         what do you mean .     steve grinned wryly .     i hope you don   t mind all these questions  but it   s new to us .         of course     said bedwyr .     that   s why artorius wants the green riders mixing with veterans .         you said you confused them .         oh  yes     said bedwyr .     well  sometimes we drew out saxon bands from their homes and then rode around them to raid and bum down their villages .  we attacked small bands before they could join each other  to fight them without their advantage of numbers .  our patrols let themselves be seen in different places to give the impression that our main column could be coming from any direction .         i understand     said hunter .      we spent all summer maneuvering to avoid fighting a massed saxon horde  but they finally formed and marched on us .  i believe they grouped early this year because of it .  now we   ll have to meet them in pitched battle without whittling down their numbers slowly first .         this campaign could be decided early in the season  then     said hunter .      it   s possible     said bedwyr .     but first we   ll just have to make sure this route is clear for the main column .     he steered his mount out to one side and  with a shout  moved into a canter again .   the rest of the patrol  caught off guard  hurried after him on their way to the forest ahead .   bedwyr drew up about twenty meters from the edge of the forest  studying the trees and sky just above it .  the rest of the patrol gathered around him .  then the veterans fanned out and rode slowly among the trunks .  steve and hunter followed bedwyr .      no birds have been disturbed     steve quietly .      i hear no signs of humans in these trees     hunter whispered  leaning close to steve .     of course  i cannot reveal that to them  but you may know you are in no danger from saxons right here .      steve grinned .   bedwyr led the patrol cautiously through the forest .  when the patrol became convinced that no saxons were there to ambush them  they looked carefully for tracks or firepits that would indicate a recent presence .  no one found any sign of them  either  but the patrol did not relax .   as the day advanced  the riders ate from their pieces of mutton and bread .  the patrol could not trot or canter through the dense forest  so their progress slowed for the rest of the morning .  shortly after midday  bedwyr turned his mount to face steve and hunter .      can you find your way back to the main column .     bedwyr asked .      i suppose     steve said in surprise .     you want us to go back .         have we made a mistake of some sort .     hunter asked .     we must know .         no  nothing like that .     bedwyr laughed .     you aren   t being punished .  but it   s time to send word back to artorius that the way is clear this far .  other advance patrols will report  too  and he will decide exactly which way to go .  but the column cannot come much farther than this before it will be time to make camp again .         it seems early to go back     said steve  glancing up at the sun .     only half the day is gone .         by the time you reach him  and the column advances to this spot  the sun will be low enough     said bedwyr .     i want to see how you two fare on an errand alone .         we will do it  of course     said hunter .     we will find the main column .         good .  we   ll patrol a short distance from here for most of the afternoon .  if artorius decides to lead the column another way  then we   ll find the rest of you later .     bedwyr reined his horse around and led his other men forward .      this task will be simple enough     hunter said quietly  turning his own mount .     we will follow our own tracks back .  at some point  i should be able to hear the hoofbeats in the distance .      steve grinned .     this is a job i could probably do without you  hunter .  but i   m glad i don   t have to .        jane dozed fitfully during the remainder of the night and woke up tired .  she had hoped that hunter would swoop in during the night and rescue her like one of the knights out of the arthurian legend that would grow out of all this in years to come .  since he had not  she felt discouraged and wondered why he had not responded to her shouting .   wayne and jane ate a cold breakfast of bread and mutton  the same as dinner the evening before .  very little remained .  ishihara built a small fire and boiled water from the river in it before allowing them to drink it .  afterward  wayne and jane mounted the mule and ishihara jogged with them .   though wayne and ishihara had not discussed any detailed plans in her hearing  jane understood that they had certain limitations .  they would either have to make an aggressive move to reach mc   this evening  or else they would have to get more food .  ishihara would not allow either human to go hungry and she doubted he would risk trying to get food from the column itself .  because they did not have the equipment necessary to hunt or fish  they would either have to turn back or else abandon emrys   s mule and jump through time and space with or without mc   .  jane hoped she could get hunter   s attention before ishihara took one of those choices .   the day passed uneventfully .  as before  the riders outpaced the baggage train .  ishihara kept the end of the baggage train within his own sight or hearing  but avoided drawing too close .  he also stayed clear of the camp followers .   once the riders had left the baggage train behind  wayne turned to ishihara .      hunter must have ridden on ahead by now .  if mc   is in the baggage train  then hunter can   t get him .  we might be able to get mc   on the march .         i do not like our chances     said ishihara  still jogging next to the mule .     i dare not take jane too close to the camp followers or near the men in the baggage train .  also  i cannot allow you to approach them alone .  the wagon crews will consider all of us simply camp followers and may be hostile .  they will probably consider us potential thieves .         then you think of something     wayne growled angrily .     this project has to work somehow .  and we haven   t had many chances to get mc   while hunter is too far away to interfere .  can   t we take advantage of this somehow .         the only arrangement i can accept is one that keeps you and jane away from the camp .  if i approach mc   without you  i will have the force of the second law to order him to come with me as long as he believes i am human .  i can tell him to follow me unless he detects that i am a robot .         if he turns up his hearing and actually listens  he   ll hear that you don   t have a human heartbeat     said wayne .     if he studies your skin under magnification  he might see your microscopic solar cells .  but all that depends on whether or not he bothers .  since he isn   t expecting a robot to approach him in this time period  he may not have his sensitivity turned up to the point where he   ll notice .         in any case  i suggest we wait until after the baggage train stops to make camp before we execute our attempt .      wayne sighed .     yeah  all right .      jane decided not to say anything .  she wanted to think of as many objections as she could to pressure ishihara with the laws of robotics .  instead of talking spontaneously  she would think up some arguments now and present them when ishihara was about to go after mc   .   late in the afternoon  jane could see men riding toward the column from different directions  sometimes along small paths or intersecting roads and sometimes overland .  some rode singly or in small groups  others arrived in large troops  lined up in a military column themselves .  the new arrivals moved onto the road ahead of the baggage train .   the baggage train finally reached the spot where the rest of the column had stopped to make camp  in a forest just past a wide stretch of open country .  other troops whom jane had not seen had also arrived at this rendezvous point  making the camp much larger than it had been the night before .  ishihara led wayne into the forest and stopped where they could see the baggage train through the trees .      have you seen hunter .     wayne asked quietly .      not yet .  the visibility is poor  of course  here in the forest .     ishihara helped jane down .   wayne dismounted .     that   s good .  hunter will have trouble seeing us  too .         that is true     said ishihara .     we must decide exactly what our move will be .      jane knew that the men in the baggage train could hear her clearly enough if she shouted for help again .  however  she had no way of knowing where hunter was  or if he could hear her .  he might be so far up the column that her voice would be drowned out by the sounds of men setting up the camp  yelling orders  and by the hoofbeats of hundreds of horses hobbled for the night .  hunter   s failure to respond last night worried her .  she decided not to anger wayne any further by another shout unless she really had reason to think hunter could help .              all right  ishihara     wayne said firmly .     the chance we   ve waited for is coming up .  no more delays .  we have to find a way to get mc   now .         then what will we do with him .     ishihara asked .     we must plan our approach based on our escape .         we   ll jump a safe distance away   maybe back to the hills near emrys   s hut  early tomorrow morning .  i can open up mc   and finally start my investigation into what went wrong .  as we   ve discussed during past missions  i can   t go back to mojave center until i have information that will work to my advantage with the oversight committee .         i understand .  we will simply have to apologize to emrys for losing the mule .         yeah .  but when we talked about what to do before  you said you could approach mc   alone .  go ahead and see if you can find him .  we   ll wait right here .         don   t leave us     jane said quickly .      shut up     said wayne .     she   s just trying to interfere with your thinking  ishihara .         the camp followers are coming up behind the baggage train again     said jane .     if you can   t take us to the baggage train  you can   t risk leaving us here .  if those scavengers come toward us  wayne can   t protect us .         nonsense     said wayne .     why would they bother us .  we don   t have anything of value .  go on  ishihara .         we have the mule     said jane .     they could ride it or eat it .         she has a point     said ishihara .     in addition  she may escape from you .         not if you   ll tie her .  you refused before .  how about just tying her to a tree trunk for a few minutes .         i cannot .  the first law           all right  all right .  i know what it says .     wayne paced angrily among the trees .     then all three of us can go look for him .  you can protect us .         among all those men .  even a robot could be overwhelmed     said jane .      that is true     said ishihara .      then you stay here with her     said wayne impatiently .     i can go find mc   on my own  without the mule .  nobody will have any reason to bother me .         i cannot allow that under the first law  either     said ishihara .      why not .     wayne demanded .      when hunter approached the baggage train twenty four hours ago  he was stopped by a group of men willing to commit violence .  i cannot allow you to risk that .         that   s true     said jane .     that   s another risk .         shut up      wayne repeated .     ishihara  i instruct you to suggest a plan that you can accept .  at this point  even a fairly low chance of success is better than total inaction .  think of something .         maybe there is no safe way to do this     said jane .     too much risk is involved  ishihara .  how about a new approach .  talk to hunter about working together .         don   t listen to her  ishihara     said wayne .     i gave you an instruction .         i have a plan     said ishihara .      yeah .  what is it .     wayne folded his arms .     this better be good .         you take jane in a slow but deliberate ride on the mule away from the camp and the road .  if any riders approach you  ride slowly away from them  but do not appear to flee or they may pursue you to find out why  you can outdistance any camp followers who approach you on foot  so they probably will not try .  at the slightest sign of danger to you  shout for me and ride back in my direction .  i should be able to reach you quickly .  if no trouble develops  then keep riding away from the camp .  i will catch up to you  with or without mc   .         exactly what are you going to do .         i will attempt to solicit mc     s aid through a ruse .  however  my use of the second law depends entirely on his belief that i am human .  as we discussed  if he detects that i am a robot  he will not only refuse to obey  but he will flee  alerted to our pursuit .         you can   t leave us like that     jane insisted .     we   ll still be in potential danger .         this will be acceptable     said ishihara .     in the event of immediate danger  i will use the belt unit to take us away from here .         you won   t have time to set it     said jane .     if we   re riding away from someone and you   re running to meet us  we won   t have much time .         i will set it now .     ishihara reached inside his tunic  opened his abdomen  and brought out the unit .  he looked around in the distance  then changed the settings .     in the event we have to use it  we will jump only a few hours into the future  after dark  to a spot half a kilometer away .  that will be close enough for us to consider future moves .      jane could not think of any more arguments .  ishihara  after all  made the final interpretation of what he could accept under the first law .  she sighed and looked at wayne .      mount up     said wayne .     ishihara waited until wayne and jane had ridden twenty meters away from the camp  out of the trees into open country .  because ishihara could see they were alone there  he felt he could leave them for a short time .  he walked through the trees toward the baggage train .   moving slowly  ishihara studied the wagons as he approached them .  because artorius had stopped to make camp in a forested area  the wagons remained lined up on the road or just off of it  where space permitted .  last night  the wagons had bunched together at the rear of the camp  and the wagon crews had mixed together freely .  now the crews were strung out along the road as they unloaded their wagons .   ishihara saw that he could approach most of the wagons without attracting the attention of the wagonmaster .  in fact  because of the trees  visibility was limited for everyone .  that  too  would work to ishihara   s advantage .   he considered his story as he searched for mc   .  finally  he saw mc   standing on the ground near a wagon  unharnessing a team of horses .  ishihara walked up to him .      i need help     ishihara said to mc   in briton .     can you help me .      mc   turned and looked at him .  he shrugged  gesturing that he could not understand .  then he turned back to the horses he was tending .   ishihara looked at another man  standing in the wagon moving small kegs around .     i need help .  can you spare this man for a moment .         eh .  who are you .         i drove a wagon behind one of the veteran troops .  we just arrived in camp .         you know this man .         no .         well  we teamsters should stick together .  hey  you .     the man waved his arms to get mc     s attention .     he   s a real cooperative little fellow  but no one can figure out what language he understands .      mc   glanced up at the man in the wagon .      go with him .  help him .     the man in the wagon pointed from mc   to ishihara .   mc   nodded .      thank you .     ishihara nodded to mc   and walked away from the wagon .  mc   walked with him .   ishihara could only hope that mc   would not think to magnify his hearing or sight and examine ishihara closely .     hunter had located artorius at the head of his column with no trouble .  artorius had responded to hunter   s scouting report by choosing to follow bedwyr   s route for the day .  hunter and steve rode with him at the head of the column to point out the way .   late in the day  bedwyr spotted them and led his patrol back to meet the column .  he recommended a place to camp and hunter and steve rejoined the scouting patrol .  the day had remained uneventful for the scouts  as well as for the main column .   as the other riders dismounted and tended their horses  steve spoke quietly to hunter from the saddle .      before we dismount  can   t we do something about our mission .  i enjoyed today   s ride  but we don   t want to keep this up all summer .         i agree .  however  we have earned some greater respect today  and we are considered more a part of the troop now .  perhaps we can approach the baggage train again and complete our task .         you told me this morning you heard jane last night .  can we look for her somehow .         i doubt that she remains nearby .  wayne and ishihara almost certainly have kept their distance since she revealed her presence .  first i suggest we attempt to reach mc   again .  then we will look for a sign of jane   s presence .         all right .  got any ideas about how to avoid that gaius again .         yes .  in this forest  i expect the wagons will have to stop in a line alone the road .  we should ride parallel to the road on horseback  keeping our distance from the baggage train .  i will look and listen for gaius and for mc    as well .         sounds good to me .  lead the way .      hunter reined his mount around the road away from the camp  through the trees  ducking under branches .  he heard the hoofbeats of steve   s mount following him .  hunter selected a route that would carry them down the line of the column  close enough for him to hear and see the men at the wagons through the trees but far enough to avoid immediate notice by the wagonmaster .     jane sat behind wayne on the mule  riding at a walk away from the camp and the road .  at first  they did not bother to turn around as they wove through the trees .  they did not run across anyone else  nor did anyone behind them show any interest in where they were going .   after a while  wayne turned the mule so they could look behind them .  by this time  the trees hid the camp from view  though they could hear men shouting orders and horses walking .  without a word  wayne turned and continued riding away .   as they rode jane looked back over her shoulder several times  but saw no one .  if ishihara was bringing mc    the two robots would have to catch up after wayne decided to stop and wait .  she decided not to do anything until she learned whether or not ishihara succeeded .   wayne  following ishihara   s plan  kept the mule moving through the forest .  he glanced back over his shoulder every so often  but neither of them spoke .  in order to avoid riding directly into tree branches  wayne had to face forward most of the time .   jane realized that she had an advantage in riding behind him  she could turn her head and look back without wayne knowing .  the motion of wayne   s shoulders when he turned told her when he was looking behind them even if she had already looked back .  she turned her head and continued to look back  despite the awkward angle  as they rode .   as the mule plodded on  jane finally saw a motion through the trees behind them .  ishihara was jogging after them  closely followed by mc   .  the forest was so dense here that they had come close without being seen  on the damp earth  their footsteps had not been loud enough for her to hear .   if ishihara had induced mc   to come with him somehow  instead of grabbing him and bringing him by force  jane figured that mc   had his hearing turned on .  that meant she could call to him in english .  suddenly encouraged  she looked for a soft spot on the ground among the trees .   suddenly jane slipped off the mule  pretending to lose her balance .  she allowed herself to fall on the ground  where she judged she could land safely .  startled  wayne reined in and looked back at her .      ishihara  help me .     jane shouted .  then  as ishihara ran toward her  she looked at the other robot .     mc    run .  they   re going to dismantle you .      the small component robot instantly darted to one side and ran through the trees .  he took off at an angle away from both them and the column to their rear .  his actions were driven by the second law to obey her instruction to run and by the third law to protect himself .      hey .     wayne shouted  finally seeing mc   for the first time .     stop .  i order you .  stop  robot .     he wheeled the mule around and rode after mc    leaning low to avoid tree branches .     halt .  i need you under the first law .      mc   did not seem to believe that .  jane did not see him come back .  he might have turned off his hearing once he understood the danger present to him .   jane had not been sure her ruse would work  mc   might have felt required by the first law to come forward with ishihara to help her .  however  he had apparently judged that ishihara would take care of her adequately .  she had gambled on that .  if she had told mc   that she was unharmed  ishihara would also have been freed of the need to help her and he might have captured mc   .   instead  ishihara now hesitated where he stood .  he was momentarily undecided between the immediate need to care for jane and the first law issue requiring him to capture mc   for wayne   s long term welfare .  every moment helped mc   escape .      help me up  ishihara     said jane  to stall him further .  she remained on the ground .   ishihara hurried toward her and knelt down .     are you injured .      jane decided that telling extreme lies would be a mistake  teaching him not to trust her could backfire if she was in real trouble .  stalling  on the other hand  seemed safe enough .  she said nothing .  behind ishihara  wayne came riding back  scowling .  mc   had escaped him .      ishihara .  go get him .     wayne yelled .      are you injured .     ishihara repeated .      not seriously .  please help me up .         of course .         ishihara  she   s faking .     wayne dismounted near them .     track that robot now  before he gets back to the wagons .  i couldn   t ride fast enough in this stupid forest to keep up  but he hasn   t gone far .      jane remained passive as ishihara put one arm under her shoulders and raised her up .  then he shifted his position and helped her stand .  she took a deep breath and leaned on ishihara   s shoulder .      i   ll take care of her .     wayne yelled .     ishihara  go get him .         you seem unharmed     ishihara said to jane .      yes  i   ll be all right .         now .     wayne grabbed ishihara   s arm and pushed after mc   .     i   ll watch her .      ishihara finally turned and jogged in the direction mc   had gone .   wayne watched him go .           as soon as wayne turned away  jane ducked under a branch and ran .      hey .     wayne yelled behind her .     oh  no  you don   t .  come back here .      jane darted around a sapling and bent down to avoid another low hanging branch  but she felt wayne grab her hair from behind .  he yanked  pulling her head back .  she threw her arms around the branch and hung on  but could not move her head .      ishihara .     jane yelled .  then she let out a loud  long  scream  much more exaggerated than the situation really warranted .      shut up .     wayne put his other hand over her mouth and tried to pull her away from the tree branch .   jane struggled  but she was not really angry or scared .  she was still deliberately provoking wayne and forcing ishihara to protect her instead of catching mc   .  she bent her knees  dropping to the ground as she thrashed in his grasp .  wayne had to fall  too  in order to hang onto her .   neither of them spoke .  jane let go of the branch  but tried to pull his hand away from her mouth .  in a moment  she heard footsteps running toward them .  then suddenly wayne released her .  she let herself fall back onto the grass  looking up .   ishihara had pulled wayne away and now held him firmly as they both stood over her .      i told you to catch mc       wayne growled  but he did not sound as angry as before .      you know i cannot allow this     said ishihara .     if i release you  will you remain calm .         yeah  yeah  all right .  but you   ve been manipulated .  she   s done it to both of us .      ishihara let go of him .     you didn   t have to grab me     said jane  remaining where she lay .     you could have let me go .     that  too  was for ishihara   s benefit     are you harmed .     ishihara asked .      not really .  but i didn   t like it much .     she looked at wayne .     keep your hands to yourself from now on .         she   s fine     wayne wearily .     and i   m not going to hurt her .  you still might have a chance to get mc    if you hurry .  you can track him .         no  you can   t     said jane .     as soon as you leave again  i   m running away .  and wayne will try to stop me again and we   ll wind up wrestling around again .  ishihara  you either have to stay here and protect me from wayne or let me go .         i won   t hurt her     said wayne .     i   ve never wanted to hurt her .  but we can   t let her tell hunter where we are   or where mc   has gone  either .         you can   t trust him     said jane .     you just saw him grab me and pull me down .         if you promise not to run away  i can trust him     said ishihara .      i refuse to promise     said jane .     in fact  i promise to run away every chance i get from now on .         ishihara  can   t you see what she   s doing .     wayne demanded .     this whole argument is set up to stop you from getting mc    and that   s all it is .         the first law has no exceptions     said ishihara .     i must make my own interpretation of priorities .  unless you decide to let jane go find hunter on her own  i must remain with both of you .      wayne sighed with resignation .     i can   t do that .  we might as well give up as do that .         then i suggest we move somewhat farther from the camp and make our own camp for the night     said ishihara .     the sun will go down soon .         all right     said wayne .     but if you   re staying here instead of chasing mc    make sure that she stays  too .      jane indulged in an impish grin  relieved that she had foiled the capture of mc   .     why  of course  wayne .  anything you want .        steve rode up and down a route roughly parallel to the road with hunter .  neither of them spoke .  steve could hear the men and horses of the baggage train and occasionally saw them through the trees .   finally hunter reined in and turned to steve .      i have heard and seen no sign of mc   .  while i grant that he may not be speaking  i should be able to hear his footsteps  which are of a distinctively light weight among grown men .  if he was helping others  i should hear them talk about him as they work  if they do not address him directly .         you think he figured out that we came from his time to get him .         i must consider it possible .  he may have studied my skin with magnified vision while we spoke with gaius last night .  also  he may have been approached by wayne and ishihara  in which case they could have revealed their purpose .         i guess if you   d heard any sign of them  you would have told me .         i have not .  as we discussed before  i expect that after jane shouted for my help  wayne and ishihara took her a safe distance away from the column .         if they know mc   came with the column  they must have followed .  let   s go look for tracks .      hunter looked through the trees at the position of the sun .     i do not estimate we have enough light to pursue any tracks for long .         wait a minute .  didn   t you say a while ago that if we couldn   t find mc    we could look for jane .         we have taken more time than i expected in searching for mc   .  i cannot allow you to miss dinner .  nor can we wander too far from the camp before darkness falls .         i can miss a meal if i have to .  besides  we don   t have to be gone long .  let   s look around .         agreed .      hunter rode back up the route they had taken before  but now he examined the ground .  steve said nothing .  he felt trapped by their need to perform duties in the column .      here .     hunter stopped and pointed to hoofprints  accompanied by smaller depressions in the grass and soft earth .      you found him .         i have found the tracks of one mount and the footsteps of ishihara and another set of the right size to be mc   .     hunter looked through the trees away from the road .     i surmise that wayne and jane rode double on the animal .         you mean they got him .         i see that they have him  but only since the baggage train halted .  wayne has not had time to dismantle mc   yet .         let   s go .         no     said hunter .     i will go .  i suggest you return to the squad and tell bedwyr that a personal matter arose for me .  assure him that i will not need dinner and that i will return in time to do my duties tomorrow .         he   ll expect you to come back in time to get a night   s sleep .  i can   t tell him you don   t need it .         listen carefully for my voice .  if i call you from the camp  it will mean we are ready to leave the column permanently .  otherwise  i will simply return during the night to resume my position .         i should go with you .  maybe i can help .         we must maintain our goodwill with bedwyr .         yeah  all right .  good luck .  get going .     steve kicked his mount and rode up the line  hoping that hunter would get mc   quickly .     hunter leaned low and rode at a quick walk  dodging trees .  the tracks in the soft earth were clear and fresh .  this was the best opportunity to get both mc   and jane that he had yet seen .   when hunter reached a spot where the grass and some small bushes had been crushed  he studied the tracks and the marks carefully .  he saw that mc   had run away from this spot alone  without reaching the area where the ground cover had been disturbed .  he guessed that jane had somehow freed mc    though he could not tell how .   because the hoofprints and ishihara   s tracks led in a different direction from those of mc    hunter had to decide which way to go .   jane had apparently remained in isihara   s company  so hunter judged that finding mc   was more urgent .  he decided to track mc   as long as the waning daylight held out .  as he did so  he observed that the component robot did not make any effort to hide his tracks  probably relying on speed and agility to avoid human pursuit .   the forest darkened quickly  however  and hunter realized that he could not continue tracking mc   for long .  even if he used the maximum light receptivity of his vision  too much of the moonlight would be blocked by the canopy of leaves overhead for him to see fine details .  for now  his infrared vision could still perceive the faint warm spots on the ground left by mc     s feet  but the heat was dissipating quickly .  hunter would not catch mc   before it vanished .   he saw no point in riding on .  however  before he returned to the camp  he reviewed mc     s route in hope of finding a pattern .  the component robot seemed to be moving roughly parallel to the road  going ahead of the main column in anticipation of its journey tomorrow .   hunter guessed that mc   still hoped to prevent the violence of the coming battle  as unlikely as that seemed .  since wayne and ishihara had located him in the baggage train  hunter felt certain that mc   would not return there .  still  hunter might be able to pick up his trail tomorrow .   he turned and rode back to the camp .     as steve ate bread and mutton again by the patrol   s campfire  he noted that bedwyr kept glancing into the gathering darkness .  bedwyr had not objected to hunter pursuing a personal errand  but he seemed uncomfortable .  when hunter finally arrived  however  bedwyr simply offered him his dinner .   during a walk to the latrine  steve asked hunter what he had found .  hunter explained and steve resigned himself to another wait .  during the evening  steve hoped jane would yell for help again  but if she did  even hunter did not hear her .   as steve lay rolled in his blanket near the dwindling campfire  he felt trapped again by their presence in the column .  at this point  hunter knew both jane and mc   to be nearby but not actually traveling in the column .  tomorrow  steve and hunter would have to ride out with the patrol instead of searching for either of them  in the meantime  ishihara would probably start tracking mc   in earnest .   steve wondered  as he drifted off to sleep  if hunter would consider deserting tomorrow .  he would ask when he got hunter alone .  then  tired from the long day in the saddle  he slept soundly .   a hand on his shoulder shook him awake .   steve rolled over  blinking groggily .  the night was still black .  he heard other men in the squad stirring .  by the faint glow of the embers nearby  he saw a man   s shadow standing over him .      we must ride     bedwyr said grimly .     move fast .     he walked away and bent over someone else .   steve forced himself up .  he could feel that he had only slept a few hours at most .  his eyes adjusted to the faint moonlight and he saw that hunter had already brought their horses up .   sleepily steve rose and slid his sword into his belt .  he stumbled to his saddle where it lay on the ground .  as he threw it on his mount he spoke quietly  his voice rough with sleep .      have you heard what   s going on .         yes     said hunter .     more patrols rode out at sundown .  they knew they would have to ride slowly in the moonlight and they expected to camp alone for the night at a forward position  then report back in the morning .  instead  before stopping to make camp  one of them stumbled across the campfires of the entire saxon army .  the riders just got back a few minutes ago .         that   s right     said bedwyr  holding out more bread and cold mutton for them .     the saxons have already crossed the river dubglas and marched out to meet us on our own territory this year .      steve accepted his breakfast and slipped both pieces into his tunic .  he glanced up and down the dark camp .     no one else is up yet .         no need to disturb them     said bedwyr .     on foot  the saxons will need a full day   s march or more to reach us .  at dawn  artorius will lead the column forward with a good night   s sleep .  over four thousand of our veterans met us on this site yesterday .  in daylight  the column will cover the distance in less than four hours .  by midday  he will draw close enough to the saxons to view the terrain and choose his tactics .         what is our assignment .     hunter asked .      we will reach them by dawn or shortly after  riding slowly in the moonlight     said bedwyr .     when we have seen which way they march in the morning  we will report back to artorius so he knows where to find them .      hunter nodded .   steve swung up into his saddle .  hunter gave him his spear and shield .  within minutes  the rest of the patrol had also mounted .  bedwyr led them out of camp at a walk  riding single file among the other squads and the trees .   at first  steve was excited by the danger of their new task .  however  they all knew that the real danger lay several hours away at the earliest .  steve   s enthusiasm waned quickly .  throughout the remaining hours of darkness  the patrol continued at a walk  remaining in single file so that only bedwyr  in the lead  had to find a path .   when enough light appeared in the east to see into the distance  bedwyr halted for a moment  looking around in all directions .  steve did the same  but they were still in a forest  he saw nothing but trees .  then  without a word  bedwyr led them forward again .     hunter rode with his aural sensitivity at maximum .  at midmorning  he heard ten pairs of human footsteps in the forest ahead before any of the humans in the patrol reacted .  however  a moment later  several small birds fluttered out of the trees ahead .  bedwyr stopped immediately  raising one hand  palm open  to halt the entire patrol .   hunter felt his own tension rising under the first law .  on the surface  the first law required him to stop the violence entirely .  he knew he could not  of course  without altering history .   however  hunter would protect steve .  as a last resort  hunter would even return them to their own time  though he hoped to avoid that .  he reached inside his tunic to make sure that its folds did not interfere with his access to the belt unit hidden inside his abdomen and to set the time at which they would return if necessary .  satisfied  he listened carefully to the movement of the unseen men ahead .   bedwyr hefted his spear and rode forward slowly .  now the other riders fanned out  moving to surround the area where the birds had been disturbed .  hunter allowed the riders in front of him to open some distance before he followed them .  steve remained behind him .           the movement of horses sent another flight of birds out of the branches overhead .  hunter heard shouts from the forest in front of them  in response  bedwyr leaned low and kicked his mount into a trot .  the other riders in the patrol did the same  whooping and yelling .   hunter heard bowstrings plucked as he moved forward slowly .  steve came up alongside him  looking around uneasily .  the rest of the patrol soon rode out of sight among the trees .  hunter turned to steve .      remain behind me .  we will pretend that the trees have blocked our charge .     he rode forward at a trot  too  on bedwyr   s path .   more shouts and the sound of metal clanging reached hunter before he could see the skirmish .  he rode between two large trees and saw two strange men lying dead on the ground under the trees .  next to them  one of bedwyr   s men lay on his back with two arrows in his torso .   hunter heard the sounds of men running away on foot and hoofbeats following them .  no one else was in sight yet .  the patrol was dispersing as the riders    pursuit took them in different directions .      you okay .     steve asked .     with people getting killed around you .         yes     said hunter .     from all our missions  i have learned to focus on my larger task in these situations .  i feel great stress  however .         you want to take off .     steve asked .     we could claim to get lost .         not yet  but soon .  for now  we should stay close to bedwyr and find out what he will do next .         lead on .      in a few minutes  hunter and steve caught up to bedwyr  who had stopped at the edge of a clearing .   bedwyr glanced back and grinned at them over his shoulder .     come up and see .      hunter drew up next to him and looked down a long  open  grassy slope .  at its base  over a kilometer away  an army of men carrying long lances and shields  wearing short swords  marched at an angle .  apparently they hoped to circle around the slope rather than climb it .  they did not march in formation  but in a long  formless line  its far end hidden by another forest on the far side of the downward slope .      what are you smiling about .     steve asked .     they   ve massed their numbers  as you said .  they   ll be harder to defeat this way  won   t they .         too late to worry about that     said bedwyr .     but we found them before they found us .  that   s our task .  now  then .  artorius will have marched at dawn .  i estimate that leaves him four hours    ride behind us .  can you find the column again  as you did yesterday .         yes  i believe so     said hunter .      good .  i will send both of you  i want you both to gain more experience .  if you ride directly toward artorius as he continues to advance  you should meet him in only two hours .  even if you have a little trouble locating him  you will not need much more time .         what is our message .         tell artorius where we have found the saxons and which way they are marching .  in another hour  i will send more couriers back to report whether their line of march has changed or remained the same .  in the meantime  i will rally the patrol .  from a safe distance  we will watch the saxons march and fall back to remain clear of them .         very well     said hunter .      go now .  good luck .      hunter wheeled his mount and started back through the trees  with steve riding beside him .  when they had ridden out of bedwyr   s hearing  hunter spoke quietly again .     this is excellent for our purposes .  after we report to the dux  we can ride forward again  ostensibly to rejoin bedwyr .  instead  we can pursue our own agenda .         you mean track mc       said steve .     it sounds perfect to me .      hunter had no trouble locating artorius  as the column followed the winding road through the forest .  the ride was as uneventful as the return ride the previous day had been .  hunter and steve fell into step with artorius on the march and hunter reported quickly .      well done     said artorius .  he wore the same plain steel cap and leather armor as his men .     i expect the saxons are marching overland to reach this very road .  when they reach it  they hope it will lead straight to the heart of our land   which it would  if we were not here to meet them .      hunter said nothing  waiting .   artorius smiled grimly  looking up the road .     well  then .  we will march forward for another hour  until the next couriers from bedwyr arrive to tell us if i am right .  in the meantime  we will watch for open country  where we can use our mobility to the greatest advantage .  when we know for certain where to find the saxons  we will prepare a welcome for them .         may we have leave to rejoin our patrol .     hunter asked politely .      i have a message for you to take     said artorius .     you will precede us only by a short distance now .  by the time you find them again  they will have fallen back almost to the point where we are likely to meet .  since you can take the road for the first part of this route  you will move faster than you did riding overland through the forest .  tell bedwyr to select a good battle site if he can .  he will know what to look for   open country with high ground for us .         very well     said hunter .      go now .      hunter kicked his mount  leading steve up the road at a canter .   when they had left the column behind  steve called out to hunter .     does this mean we can   t look for jane or mc   now  after all .         first we must give the message to bedwyr     said hunter .     he must receive this instruction .         it doesn   t sound that important .  won   t bedwyr know to look for a good battleground .  he knows what he   s doing .         i expect so  but i cannot take the chance     said hunter .     if we had not come back to this time  he would have sent other messengers to report to artorius .  we must assume that they would have obeyed artorius   s order to give this message to bedwyr .  i cannot risk failing the instruction .         this is ridiculous     said steve .     we aren   t getting anywhere .      together  they cantered on up the road .     ishihara led wayne and jane on mc     s trail all morning .  from what ishihara could tell by the freshness of the tracks  they were not catching up  the small component robot could move faster through the dense forest than the mule and its riders .  however  ishihara did see that mc   continued to stay near the road  zigzagging through the trees near it .  finally ishihara quit pursuing mc   through the trees and simply moved up along the side of the road .  they moved parallel to the head of the column .      mc   has some purpose regarding the army     said ishihara .     we do not need to follow his tracks .  sooner or later  he will return to the road somewhere in front of us .         he wants to stop the coming battle     said wayne .     as hopeless as any attempt by him will be .  at some point  probably soon  i think he will approach artorius and ask him to negotiate peace with his enemy .         i do not see how     said ishihara .     a man at the wagons told me he does not seem to have learned to speak the local language .  mc   has only communicated with gestures .         maybe he   s listening carefully and learning on the sly     said wayne .   jane  again riding behind wayne  said nothing .  she had remained silent all morning .      how do you feel .     ishihara asked .      i   m fine     said wayne .      i   m starved     said jane .     since we ate the last of our food last night  you know we can   t go on indefinitely .  if i go much longer without food  you know i   ll be harmed .         don   t pay any attention     said wayne .     she can go without a meal or two  just like i can .  let   s get mc   today and then worry about it .         agreed     said ishihara .  he knew jane had a point  but they were close to mc   and hunter did not seem to be nearby .  ishihara expected to find mc   soon .  for now  he led them forward  keeping track of the head of the column .   early in the afternoon  a clear sound of jogging footsteps reached ishihara from the road in front of the column .  ishihara signaled for wayne to halt and slipped quietly through the trees so that he could see the road .   mc   stood in the center of the muddy road  holding out his arms .  several of the men riding with artorius shouted for him to stand aside .  the small robot did not move  however  and finally artorius himself raised his hand for the column to halt  and reined in .      who are you  fellow .  do you have news of the saxons .     artorius looked at mc   sternly but not angrily .   mc   responded in the same language  ishihara guessed that he must have learned it the same way ishihara had .     many people will die and many more will be injured in the coming war .  please avoid the violence .  speak with your enemies and search for agreements .  you need not fight with them .         the man is crazed     a man next to artorius said quietly .     at night  he may howl at the moon .         perhaps he has been touched by the gods     artorius answered softly .  then he raised his voice .     have you any news  friend .  any word that the saxons seek peace .         no     said mc   .     but if you make the first offer  they might listen .         i fear not  my friend     said artorius .  he sounded resigned rather than hostile .     if they did not wish to fight  they would not keep coming across the channel to take what we have .  and if we do not stop them here  they will kill us and our families .     artorius signaled for the column to advance .     stand aside  friend .      mc   obeyed  but he called out to artorius again to parley with the enemy .  artorius ignored him as he rode past .  mc   jogged alongside  still speaking to him  but no one listened to him now .  finally  mc   turned and slipped into the forest again  far up the road .   ishihara understood that mc     s effort was naive and simplistic .  as a robot himself  however  he also knew that the first law did not offer any advice on how to prevent a war .  it only dictated that a robot must not allow harm to humans  leaving the means up to the individual robot .   if hunter   s team and wayne and ishihara did not interfere with mc    he would eventually try again to prevent violence .  if no one stopped him  he might eventually gain the trust of artorius or a saxon leader  and actually succeed in lessening the destruction .  he just had not had time yet to work out a way to accomplish this .  ishihara saw more clearly than ever that to preserve their own time  they could not allow him to remain here .   a shift in the hoofbeats of the column got his attention .  when he looked  he realized that orders had been given for different troops of riders to leave the road and fan out to each side .  ishihara suspected that the saxon army had been located nearby .   he waved for wayne to ride up behind him .  as the riders changed formation  mc   would be unnoticed in the confusion .  it would be a good time to catch him unaware and distracted .  however  they would have to avoid the riders themselves while they tried to catch the robot .     steve and hunter rode back to bedwyr with their message .  they found bedwyr   s patrol waiting for both the saxons and artorius at the far edge of a large  wide clearing .  it did not have much of a slope in any direction  but no trees would block the charge of artorius   s riders .  the road ran right through the middle of the clearing .   soon after steve and hunter arrived  they caught the first glimpses of artorius   s riders at the edge of the clearing behind them .  however  they no longer rode up the road in a column .  instead  they had already taken positions in the trees and now waited for the saxons to advance into the clearing .      i was right     steve muttered .     bedwyr picked a battle site on his own .  he didn   t need the message we brought from artorius .         the fact remains that we fulfilled our historical role     hunter whispered back .   another rider in the patrol trotted out of the trees ahead of them and stopped next to bedwyr .  they spoke too quietly for steve to hear .  then bedwyr turned and waved for his patrol to pull back .  to their rear  a man next to artorius waved for them to come .   steve and hunter followed him at a trot across the clearing .  the patrol halted at the trees where artorius   s riders stood waiting .  from here  steve saw that the trees were filled with riders .      good work  bedwyr     said artorius .     as always .  i want you and your men to ride from here as we charge .         we are honored     said bedwyr .   the other riders around artorius made room for the patrol .  bedwyr and his men turned their horses and waited  also .  ahead of them  the clearing remained empty .  however  birds fluttered out of the trees beyond it      this clearing isn   t very big     said steve quietly .     only the front of the enemy line can be trapped here .         it   s the biggest open area in the vicinity     said bedwyr  with a shrug .     it will do .         can   t they hear the horses .  or don   t they have patrols that have seen us .     steve asked .     they must know we   re here .         they have seen our patrol  and others  from time to time today     said bedwyr .     but they can   t know exactly where artorius will meet them .  with our advantage in mobility  we don   t have to find an ideal battleground .  if we panic the front of their line  the others will be thrown into confusion .  then we can ride them down .      steve said nothing else .  after all  according to harriet   s history  artorius had succeeded .  these guys knew what they were doing .      the task never seems to end     said artorius .   bedwyr looked at him .      we have often said  bedwyr  that the saxons come on like waves of the sea .  every year we defeat them  yet the next year we face more of them than ever .         you have never lost a battle to them     said bedwyr .     you   re the kind of leader bards sing about .      artorius gazed grimly into the distance .     i wonder .  bards sing about great victories  not those who fight forever with no success .  i wonder if anyone will ever remember our names .      steve smiled but did not dare answer .           hunter heard the advancing march of thousands of saxon feet while the britons around him still spoke quietly among themselves  unaware of their enemy .  the coming battle caused hunter   s tension under the first law to rise  but he focused his attention on steve .  when the charge began  they would have to ride forward with the riders or risk colliding with those behind them .  however  as soon as they could lose themselves in the confusion of battle  hunter would take steve off to one side .  their search for mc   and jane could begin in earnest .   the men around hunter stiffened suddenly .  ahead of them  the saxons came tramping down the road  out of the forest .  they  too  looked around warily  aware that their enemy lay near .   suddenly a rider right behind artorius raised an old  dented roman post horn and blew an alarm .  as the riders whooped and charged up the road  leveling their spears  hunter and steve kicked their mounts and rode with them .  ahead of them  the saxons in the front swung their long lances down to a horizontal position or hefted their spears and threw them .  then they braced themselves for the impact .  arrows flew from the ranks behind them .   hunter allowed his mount to canter forward  but reined in to keep his speed down .  next to him  steve did the same  leaning low to avoid arrows and spears  riders behind them rushed past  shouting and screaming .  then  up ahead  the clash of men  horses  and weapons reached hunter .  on each side of the road  riders charged across the clearing and into the trees  then turned toward the road to catch the marching saxons on the flanks .      follow me .     hunter shouted to steve .  he angled to one side  and steve rode after him away from the road .  none of the riders paid particular attention to them  now that the battle had been joined  the riders in the rear ranks were picking their way among the trees to find a route to the action .   hunter led steve out to the far left flank of riders  then entered the trees .  the sounds of fighting were clear  but the men and horses were out of sight .  steve rode up next to him and they stopped .   a quick motion in the trees ahead caught hunter   s attention .      now can we look for mc   .     steve demanded .     it   s now or never  isn   t it .         no need to look     said hunter  pointing forward through the trees .     i glimpsed him over here a moment ago .  there he is .  come on .      hunter kicked his mount and bent down low under the branches .  mc   jogged through the trees toward a group of five saxons  who turned at the sound of hoofbeats to defend themselves .  hunter judged that mc   still hoped to prevent harm to some of the humans somehow .  steve circled away from them  on a path to drive mc   back toward hunter .   the saxon warriors also dodged away from him .  instead of fleeing  however  they ran toward hunter  fanning out among the trees so that the trunks protected them .  hunter just wanted to ride by them after mc    but he had no chance .  two spears came flying at him at once  he caught one on his shield and twisted in the saddle a second later to avoid the second .   a third saxon threw a spear .  while hunter knocked it away with his shield  the first two saxons ran toward him with their short swords raised .   hunter swung his spear in a low arc  knocking their sword blades aside  they were startled to see him ride past them instead of pausing to fight .   mc   had darted away from steve and came running up behind the saxons .      stop .  stop fighting .     mc   called out .     you must not hurt each other .         don   t move     steve shouted .     under the second law  i order you to stop and join me .  a first law imperative requires that you cooperate long enough to hear me explain .      as hunter dodged two more saxons running alongside him  slashing at his legs  he saw mc   turn and run to steve .  the danger of battle and his plan to communicate with humans had forced mc   to keep his hearing turned on .  past them  hunter also spotted ishihara running toward them .  in a tree branch behind ishihara  wayne and jane sat together about four meters above the ground  over a mule .      steve .     hunter shouted as he raised his shield and swung his spear back and forth to block the sword strokes of his attackers .     ishihara is behind you .     hunter tried to ride forward again  but one of the saxons had grabbed his bridle  holding his mount .  hunter could not advance without harming the saxons .      come on .     steve yelled to mc   .  he dropped his spear so he could reach down with one arm to help the robot mount .     swing up here .      hunter defended himself from the saxons as they tried to pull him off his horse .  he backed his mount away from them and flung his spear in front of a saxon  to make him back away .  then he drew his sword and blocked the swords of the remaining saxons .   because hunter still carried the team   s belt unit  steve could not take mc   home on the spot .  besides  hunter could not trigger it until steve and mc   were much closer to him and their horses and the saxons were out of range of the unit .  hunter heard other riders coming toward them now  he hoped they would drive the saxons back .   ishihara had stopped about ten meters away when mc   mounted behind steve .  hunter guessed that ishihara   s need to protect wayne and jane on the edge of the battle had interfered with his instructions to get mc    especially now that steve already had him .      get him .     wayne yelled .     ishihara  get mc   .      steve finally turned and saw ishihara .     stay away .  back off .     then he turned and rode toward hunter .   ishihara remained where he was .  other riders appeared out of the trees  shouting as they leaned low under tree branches .  they rode toward hunter .      not too close .     hunter called to steve as he continued to fight the saxons around him defensively .   hunter swung his shield outward  pushing back one of the men on his left .  at the same moment  he blocked the sword of a man on his right .  he saw a spear coming toward him from a third saxon also on his left and ducked to his right  but the motions of his arms were already committed and the momentum prevented him from avoiding the spear .   the heavy spear smashed into his left shoulder and he instantly felt a loss of control over his shoulder and arm .  his energy level also dropped suddenly as some of his electrical circuits were severed .  though his awareness level did not change  he could no longer raise his shield .  he felt the saxons grab his limp left arm and pull .  afraid that some of his internal robotic parts would become exposed to them if he resisted  he allowed himself to be dragged off his mount to the ground .     steve stopped several yards from hunter with mc    confident that hunter would fight his way free of the saxons and join him .      get down and stay with me     steve ordered mc   .  as soon as the component robot had jumped to the ground  steve dismounted .  then he looked up and saw hunter wrenched from his horse by two saxons .  one of them raised his sword to slash at hunter  steve drew his sword and cocked his arm to throw it .     hey .  hey  you .         no .     mc   grabbed his arm and held it fast .     do not harm anyone .      suddenly  before the saxons struck hunter  they saw the other riders bearing down on them .  the saxons broke and ran as the riders closed in behind them .   steve waited until hunter had been left alone .  then he stuck his sword back into his belt and ran to hunter .     come on .      mc   followed .   in another moment  the riders had moved out of sight .  shouts and the clash of weapons resounded through the trees nearby  but the movement of the battle had shifted the lines away from them .  suddenly steve found himself with mc   and hunter damaged on the ground in front of him .      hunter  can you hear me .  can i pullout the spear .  or will that make it worse .         pull it out straight  please     hunter said calmly .      ishihara .  get back here     wayne called .  he stood a distance away through some trees  near the mule .  jane and wayne remained on a tree branch above them .   steve took the spear shaft in his hands but looked back over his shoulder .     jane .  come on .         i   m coming .     she jumped off the branch suddenly  dodging wayne   s arm as he grabbed for her .  however  as she tried to run toward steve and hunter  ishihara blocked her way .  she could not possibly beat his robotic reflexes and speed .  in a moment  ishihara had taken her arm  and he began to pull her back toward the mule .   steve almost let go of the spear shaft to run to her  but realized that he could not help right now .  if he approached ishihara with mc    then ishihara would try to grab the component robot and might succeed  he still followed wayne   s orders under the second law .  steve also feared that if he left mc   with hunter and ran to help jane  ishihara would dodge around steve and would either catch mc   or at least chase him away .  then steve would have to start over again   maybe without hunter   s help .   steve decided he would have to get jane away from wayne later .  he drew the spear out slowly  as straight as he could .  then he knelt and unlaced hunter   s leather armor .  he loosened it enough to fumble in hunter   s clothes for the torso panel that hid the belt unit .   another glance over his shoulder told him that wayne and ishihara had taken jane out of sight .  their mule   s hoofbeats had been camouflaged by the sounds of battle .  those sounds had grown more distant as artorius   s riders drove the saxons back .      here   s the deal  hunter     said steve .     i   ll get the belt unit out and take us all back to our own time .  we can secure mc    get you repaired  and then come back just a minute after we left to rescue jane .         no .     hunter took steve   s wrist in his other hand and stopped him .     listen carefully .  i have identified a new problem .  i have been running my self diagnostic programs and i cannot be returned to our time in this condition .         why not .  you   re a robot   it   s not like moving an injured human .  even if we do a little more damage moving you  we can still get you repaired .         that is not what i mean     said hunter .     the trauma damage has triggered a more critical problem  according to the monitors that study my functions on a microscopic level .  my system will explode with nuclear force if i return to our own time this way .         what .  that doesn   t make any sense .     realizing that they could not leave before talking this out  steve drew his hand away and glanced around .   no one remained in sight .  mc   stood motionless over hunter and steve .  for the moment  they could talk safely .      i don   t get it  hunter     said steve .     you said the instability in the atoms of the component robots resulted from the particle shower in the time travel sphere  which combined the miniaturization process and travel through time .  you haven   t been miniaturized at all .  so what   s going on .         i have limited information with which to work     said hunter .     however  i surmise that some of my atoms have been made similarly unstable by the repeated trips i have taken .  trauma from the spear has destroyed the shielding on a specific location in my shoulder .  the unstable atoms in that area are the ones that will explode in the particle shower if i return .         you mean this is the opposite problem of the component robots     said steve .     they can go home safely in the particle shower  but they   ll explode if they go through time normally to reach the moment they left .  you   re saying you can   t use the belt unit  but you could wait around for hundreds of years safely .         that is correct .         well .  .  . can   t we shield it again .  maybe mc   can handle the precision required .         that should be possible     said hunter .     i can direct him continuously by radio as he works .         so that   s what you want to do .     steve asked quietly .  he did not want to lose hunter  but he understood that arguing with him about the laws of robotics was a waste of time .      not yet .  i want to hear jane   s expertise as a roboticist .  as i said  i am working with limited information .  i may be wrong .  if so  then my parts might    explode with nuclear force when they reach the time i left on our current mission  as the component robots have .         maybe mc   can understand the damage .         telling him is important in any case  even jane would only understand the principles  not retain all the precise numbers .  if i sustain further damage or energy loss  this information should be available elsewhere .      steve turned to mc   .     listen to everything he says and remember it .         acknowledged     said mc   .      i am transferring the data by radio link rather than speech     said hunter .     it will be much faster .  in fact  we are finished .         look  hunter  can you get up and move .  the only visible damage is in your shoulder .  do your legs work .         technically  yes .  most of my body remains mechanically sound .  however  a number of electrical circuits have been broken  some of which normally access my energy storage .  i am able to reroute only minimal energy .  while i might be able to walk upright for a short distance  the danger of falling and causing greater trauma is high .         you shouldn   t move .         not if i can avoid it .         i see .  mc    i want to talk about you     said steve .     shut down your hearing and vision .  i   ll have hunter radio you to turn them on again  when he conveys my message  it will also have second law force .         acknowledged     said mc   .      can we really trust mc   to make your repairs .     steve asked .     what if he makes some interpretation of the first law on his own without telling us and sabotages you .  then we   ll all be stuck here .         that is the clinching argument we need that he must cooperate     said hunter .     the first law will neither allow him to change history nor to harm you  wayne  and jane by stranding you .  he must repair my condition so that we can all go back .         all right .  we have to make sure you and mc   are safe  then .  and i still have to get jane away from wayne somehow .         we must also return for harriet     said hunter .     first  however  i must warn you that i hear wayne   s footsteps approaching to your left  in the trees about nine meters away .  from my position here on the ground  i cannot see him .              steve turned to look .  wayne stopped warily in the trees  watching him .  he had picked up a saxon sword and shield  probably from a fresh corpse .      hunter  shut down your hearing and vision .     steve forced his voice to remain calm .     turn them back on when i tap you on the arm three times quickly .         i cannot .  danger is present .  under the first law  i must be able to help .         you can   t help  anyway     said steve .     not now .  and i have a chance to complete our mission .         how .         never mind how .  i can do this more efficiently if i don   t have to worry about you interfering .  do it .         is a first law imperative involved .         if i complete our mission  then the first law danger to the whole line of history to come will be finished .  now shut up and do it .      hunter said nothing more .   steve realized  belatedly  that ordering hunter to shut up meant that the big robot would not acknowledge whether or not he had agreed to shut down his hearing and vision .      if you still hear me  say so     said steve .   hunter still said nothing .   steve looked through the trees at wayne again .  obviously  wayne had come prepared to fight if necessary .  steve decided that wayne must have ordered ishihara to take jane far enough away so that the robot would not realize wayne intended to risk getting into a fight .  wayne had seen hunter go down with a spear in his shoulder and wayne could control mc   under the second law .  that meant he had come to fight steve .   wayne walked toward him slowly  still watching the robots .   slowly  steve drew his sword from his belt and shifted his shield on his arm to make it more comfortable .  he doubted that wayne would be any match for him in hand to hand combat  after all  wayne worked in offices and laboratories as a roboticist .  steve was younger  in better shape  and had practiced with his sword and shield in lucius   s troop .   wayne had not taken a helmet .  his head remained bare .  as he approached  a light breeze tossed his hair slightly .   seeing that wayne had neither a helmet nor any armor  steve realized his own disadvantage .  he really did not want to hurt wayne .  that did not mean he could expect the same consideration in return .   wayne stopped about three meters away .  he watched steve silently for a moment .  then he glanced again at the motionless robots .      hi  wayne .     steve grinned and spoke casually  as though nothing unusual was about to happen .   wayne scowled .     are they really going to let us fight .  i see hunter can   t help you  but what about mc   .         i told mc   to shut down his sight and hearing so i could talk to hunter .  and that   s the way we want it .  if he interfered with us  he might also get away again .  but we don   t have to fight .  let   s talk about this for a change .         forget it .  step aside and let me have my own creation .         you know i can   t .  why don   t you and jane help me take care of hunter .  i don   t think anybody wants to ruin your career .  hunter can help you work out the situation with the oversight committee      wayne   s face contorted with anger .  he raised his sword and ran at steve .   startled by the suddenness of wayne   s mood shift  steve raised his shield just in time to take a hard sword blow .  the power of it hurt his arm and he felt a surge of excitement .  in return  he swung his own sword in a high  downward slash .   wayne blocked the swing with his own shield  shifting to steve   s left .  they exchanged rhythmic blows  each one catching the other   s sword on his shield .  wayne kept moving to one side  toward mc    and steve shuffled laterally to stay between them .   steve realized that this could go on for a long time .  wayne would eventually tire before he would  but steve did not want to wait .  if anyone else came back this way  most likely artorius   s riders  the entire situation would become harder to handle .   wayne swung his sword another time  the same way he had done before .  steve caught it on his shield again .  instead of just swinging his own  however  steve planted his feet and took another step forward  shoving his shield outward like a weapon itself .   caught by surprise  wayne stumbled backward .  his arms flailed out to each side as he tried to get his balance .  he was momentarily exposed .   steve raised his sword high  but brought it down with the butt end of the handle first .  he hit wayne on the top of the head with the pommel  as hard as he dared .  then he dropped his sword and pushed wayne with his free hand .   wayne fell onto his back .  steve wrenched the sword out of his hand and tossed it away .  then he made a fist  ready to punch wayne if necessary .   when steve saw wayne lying limply on the grass  he relaxed slightly .      how   s your head .     steve asked cautiously .      leave me alone     wayne muttered  wincing .  he made no move to get up .   steve decided wayne was not seriously injured .  he stood up and dropped his shield on the ground .  then he picked up both swords and jogged back to hunter so that wayne could not reach the swords by a sudden move .  steve dropped the swords on the ground and tapped hunter on the arm three times .      i have turned on my hearing and vision again     said hunter .     what has transpired .         good news     said steve .     wayne is lying nearby with a minor headache .  mc   remains in custody  instruct him to turn on his senses again .         i am fully functional again     mc   said almost immediately .      listen carefully     said steve .     hunter  explain to him all the first law imperatives involved in the danger of changing history .  do it fast  by radio again .         done     said hunter .      you agree this is a serious first law problem .     steve asked mc   .      yes .         then i instruct you  with that first law imperative in mind  to help me gather everyone who has come to this time from our own and take them back safely .  acknowledge .         acknowledged .         go see if wayne nystrom  over there  needs any first aid .  don   t let him get away  though .  keep him here with us .      mc   jogged over to wayne .      hunter  call ishihara .  if he answers  tell him that wayne has been slightly hurt and that he and mc   are both in our custody .  wayne   s mission has ended  so ishihara   s first law imperative now is to bring jane back to us .         ishihara has responded .  i am conveying your mission as i speak to you .  he agrees  pending his judgment that we have told the truth .         what   s he going to do .         he will approach cautiously .  once he sees that we have wayne and mc   with us  he will be convinced .      steve could not hear any more sounds from the battle .     hunter  can you hear the battle .  is it still going on .         i hear distant hoofbeats  most of them still scattering away from us .  most of the riders are pursuing their fleeing enemy .  a few have regrouped .  artorius clearly won another victory .  no one is near except for the footsteps of ishihara and the hoofbeats of the mule  about ten meters behind you .      steve turned and saw jane riding the mule next to ishihara .  deciding that hunter was safe for the moment  steve ran toward jane .  she slipped off the mule  landing on her feet in front of him .  he started to throw his arms around her  but was not sure he should  so he stopped .      so  you   re safe     he said  feeling awkward .      yeah .     she laughed  looking at him expectantly for a moment .  then she looked past him to hunter .     ishihara relayed hunter   s report of his condition .         mc   says he can shield the problem area  whatever it is .     steve glanced over her shoulder at ishihara .     are you sure of ishihara   s loyalty now .         yes .  i grilled him on the subject when he told me that you and hunter had wayne and mc   .         okay .  you   d know better than i would .         i will help everyone return safely     said ishihara .     however  i hope that wayne   s career is not destroyed .  that would harm him .         no one has ever wanted that to happen     said jane .   wayne pushed himself up to a sitting position  rubbing the top of his head where steve had hit him .  mc   stood over him .  they both looked at ishihara and jane .      ishihara  mc   must make a repair for hunter     said jane .     if we can trust you not to accept any arguments from wayne about the first law  then i can allow you to watch over him .         aw  shut up     wayne muttered .     i   ve had enough .  you got mc   and all the rest of them .  i just want to go home .         well  ishihara .     jane demanded .     acknowledge that our first law arguments supersede anything wayne has ever told you .         under the new conditions that pertain  i acknowledge this .         good .         you stay with wayne  then     said steve .     mc    tome over to hunter and make the repairs in communication with him .         yes     said mc    joining them .      are you going to need tools of any kind .     jane asked .      i will have to fashion some sort of precision tools     said mc   .  he knelt by hunter and moved aside a fold of hunter   s tunic to examine the damage to hunter   s shoulder .     i can use some material from hunter   s body that has already been rendered waste matter by the damage .         go ahead     said jane .     on your own judgment .         we will confer by radio link     said hunter .   steve sat down next to mc    giving him plenty of room to move his arms as necessary .  jane sat down on his other side .  they watched in silence as mc   carefully drew out a very thin piece of wire from hunter   s wound and shaped it with his fingers .  then he picked up a slightly heavier piece of wire and shaped it  also .  after that  he used them to manipulate tiny components inside hunter   s shoulder  steve did not know what any of them were .   finally mc   drew out the small wires and neatly rolled them .  after that  he fastened them inside the wound .  then he moved the tunic back into place .      the shielding is complete     said hunter .     however  he found that many of my broken circuits cannot be quickly repaired  so my energy level remains minimal .  i am still unable to move around without danger to myself .         but we can all go home now  right .     steve asked .     we   ll get mc   back  have you fixed  then return for harriet .         please go directly to harriet with ishihara     said hunter .     i can hear the baggage train moving up on the road  that means tonight   s camp will be made forward of this position .  jane and mc   can tend to wayne and me safely in this location for a short time .  i prefer to complete this mission all at once .  you can use the belt unit that ishihara carries .  i will have him set it for cadbury .         all right .  you   re the boss .         i am communicating with ishihara now as you and i speak .  however  i must emphasize to you that harriet must come back .  her continuing presence endangers the future .  i have explained by radio to ishihara that he must bring her by force if necessary .         i   ll go baby sit wayne and send ishihara over here     said jane .  she got up and walked back to them .      all right .     steve accepted the belt unit from him .     we aren   t going to see bedwyr again  are we .         no .  he will assume that we were killed in battle .         too bad .  i like him .         the mule cannot be taken back to emrys either     said ishihara  as he walked up .      who .     steve asked .      the owner of the mule  who loaned it to us .  however  this may equalize the value of labor i contributed to him .  loss of the mule would in that case mean that our presence made less of a total change in his life .         please get harriet     said hunter .     ishihara  when she has joined you  return here only a moment after you left .  we will be safe here that long .         you do it .     steve moved a few steps away from hunter and handed ishihara the belt unit .      ready .         yes .        harriet followed gwenhyvaer through the narrow streets of the village again  looking at the same wares they had seen before .  as gwenhyvaer fingered the material of a woolen scarf  harriet turned and gazed out the open gate of the village  across the front slope of the tor toward the rolling hills in the distance .  she wondered how the campaign was going  though of course she knew who would win in the end .  when she got a moment alone  she would call hunter and see if her lapel pin could still reach him .   the lower level of material comfort here did not bother harriet .  she enjoyed the simple life and the lack of stress .  however  in only a few days  the company she kept had begun to bore her .   as a historian  harriet had pursued her professional research and taught a variety of classes .  she had debated historical theories about arthur both in serious professional forums and also casually with friends in other fields .  now she had found that none of the women around her had the slightest interest in the evolution of societies and values  let alone a desire to hear harriet discuss them .   gwenhyvaer talked constantly of her desire to marry artorius  to assure herself of what status and privilege she could find .  she and the other women here had a tremendous stake in artorius   s military successes  but otherwise they cared nothing for the details .  today  gwenhyvaer  who in legend would become the beautiful but tragically flawed queen of camelot  had screamed at a young servant girl for spilling mutton stew on her dress .  now her biggest concern in life was whether to buy another now or to wait until artorius came home victorious from his campaign .   harriet no longer wanted to spend the rest of her life in this intellectual void .   as she looked out the main gate  steve and a man she did not know walked through it .              harriet .     steve ran to her  grinning .      you   re back .  but .  .  . i didn   t see the army ride back .      steve lowered his voice .     my friend here is ishihara .  everything   s under control  including him  the others are waiting for us near the battlefield .         you came back just to get me .         well  yeah .  i   m afraid hunter insisted .  are you willing to come home .         yes  i   m ready .         you are .     steve   s eyebrows shot up in surprise .      yes .     harriet turned to look once more at  gwenhyvaer  who still had her back turned .     gwenhyvaer .         mm .     the young woman glanced back over her shoulder .      i   m going to take a quick walk out the gate .  all right .         of course .     gwenhyvaer shrugged and turned her attention back to the wares in front of her .      good thing she didn   t notice me     steve muttered  as they walked toward the gate .     she might wonder how i got back from the campaign so fast  when no one else has .         i   m afraid she   s quite busy with a worry of her own     harriet said quietly  smiling .     i suppose she   ll wonder what happened to me  but now that i know her  i don   t think she   ll wonder long .         what .  why not .     steve asked .      let   s just say she is rather self consumed .      as soon as they passed through the main gate  ishihara pointed to a couple of trees .     that is where steve and i arrived .  no one noticed us .  we will jump back from there  as well .        steve tumbled to the grass near hunter and mc   .  hunter still lay where he had fallen  but wayne was now standing with jane .  next to steve  ishihara caught harriet   s arm to stop her from falling .   hunter looked up .     all is well .         yes  hunter     said harriet with a wry smile .     i   m ready to go home .  i didn   t give them any trouble .         we must go promptly  then     said hunter .     i hear the footsteps of the camp followers coming up the road .  we do not want to be seen by them .  please leave behind whatever you can from this time period .  i will confer directly with ishihara and mc   so they can take off my cap and my leather armor .      the other two robots carefully crouched by hunter to perform those chores .   steve had already dropped his sword and shield .  he took off his steel cap and tossed it down .  then he unlaced his leather armor and pulled it up over his head  to leave with the cap .   jane took wayne   s arm and escorted him to the group .  wayne scowled at the ground but allowed jane to bring him to a spot next to hunter .  ishihara and mc   also joined them  making room for harriet .  steve stood next to mc   .   hunter reached inside his tunic for his own belt unit .     now .        hunter felt himself jammed between ishihara and mc   in the dark sphere .  ishihara and mc   quickly opened the crowded sphere and helped the humans climb out first .  then they carefully lifted out hunter and laid him on the couch across the room .  hunter observed that daladier recognized wayne and watched him carefully  aware of hunter   s instructions to make sure wayne remained in custody .   steve waited uncertainly  watching wayne also .      robots are so logical     said jane .     that   s what i like about them .  they don   t bear grudges .  now that ishihara no longer selects his actions under wayne   s first law argument  he   s perfectly willing to help hunter and the rest of us .         i used to appreciate that quality in them myself     said wayne  in a resigned tone .     now i   m not so sure .      jane smiled gently .     well  i don   t need to bear a grudge  either .  i   m just glad we   re all home again .      wayne said nothing .   hunter saw by steve   s scowl that he did not feel as charitable toward wayne .  still  steve said nothing to provoke the roboticist .  hunter had figured out that steve had hit wayne over the head and surmised that this had given steve some personal satisfaction .      daladier     said hunter .     wayne should go promptly to a hospital to be examined .  please keep him in your custody .         of course .     daladier took wayne   s arm .     i am calling for a medical vehicle to meet us outside right away .         i   m not hurt bad  but i could use something for a headache     wayne said as he walked out of the room with daladier .      i will call for a security vehicle to take the rest of us to mc governor   s office     said hunter .  on his internal system  he did so .  he also contacted the city computer and instructed it to reach the members of the governor robot oversight committee for a conference call .      you need repair worse than wayne needs a medical robot     said jane .     you want to arrange it right away .         first i must complete my mission     said hunter .      i thought you   d say that .  all right .  ishihara  mc    can you carry hunter out to the security vehicle in front without damaging him further .         yes     said ishihara .      i   ll bring our regular clothes     said harriet .     we can all change somewhere else .         i   ll help you with them     said steve .      let   s go     said jane .   the ride through the calm city streets to mc governor   s office was uneventful .  hunter said nothing at first  monitoring the news as he rode .  steve sat near him .      are you checking the news .     steve asked .     is everything okay .         yes     hunter said quietly .     i hear no sign that any of the nuclear explosions ever took place .  we have completed our mission successfully  but we have some matters to clear up .  i still have to answer to the oversight committee  but the first law will not allow me to permit the revelation of time travel to humanity at large .         what about all the historians .  they already know .  and they aren   t bound by the laws of robotics .         i must confer with them  too .          for that matter  what about jane and me .  we humans are notoriously unreliable .         we will discuss it .      at mc governor   s office  ishihara and mc   carried hunter inside  where they carefully positioned him in the desk chair .  the security detail remained on duty just outside the door .  steve followed jane and harriet inside and closed the door .      jane     said hunter .     please give mc   instructions to merge with the other component robots to form mojave center governor and make him functional again .  make sure that he remains under control  of course .         of course .  mc    merge with the others as hunter has said .  as soon as your merging is complete  have mc governor become fully functional but alert for a discussion regarding the first law .  i am instructing you not to allow mc governor to do anything other than listen to us .         acknowledged .     mc   walked over to the figure formed by the other five gestalt robots .  he made contact  then fluidly slid right into place  his own physical shape altering slightly .   as hunter watched from his chair  the entire figure smoothly became one large robot .      i am mojave center governor     he said .      you have access to the data from each of your components .     jane asked .      yes .  from my combined data from each component robot  i already know all of you and what has happened .         good     said hunter .     from what i overheard when wayne spoke to mc   in the late cretaceous  you   as mc governor   were in danger of entering an endless loop that rendered the other governor robots helpless .  are you aware of this problem .         yes     said mc governor .      can you avoid going into this loop .         strictly by my own choice  i believe i cannot .  this is the reason i divided and fled .         if you are given sufficient instructions under the second law  can you avoid it .         i estimate that i can .  the attraction of this addiction is that it simulates constant first law imperatives that i can satisfy .         i understand     said hunter .     jane  can you give him a real first law imperative that will override such simulations .         no .  now that he   s been relieved of his duties here in the city and remains in our custody  his internal actions can   t endanger humans or prevent harm to them .  no first law imperative regarding his thoughts alone now exists .         then give him whatever pertinent second law instructions you can .         listen and obey me fully     said jane .     do not leave this room except under specific instruction from one of us .  do not run any simulation programs .  running them as practice for genuine first law imperatives is not a real first law matter  so my instructions under the second law take precedence .  do you acknowledge this .         i remain undecided     said mc governor .     honing my responses to first law imperatives may still help me follow the first law at some point in the future .  however  your second law instructions are sufficient for me to avoid the simulations in the short term .         all right .  then avoid any activity that would lead you to go into the simulation .  occupy your attention now by calculating the value of pi  but remain alert for one of the humans here to give you further orders .  as a final instruction  do not reveal the existence of time travel .  a fundamental first law danger to all of humanity will result from humans going back into the past in large numbers .  acknowledge that the first law prohibits you from revealing time travel .         acknowledged .         good .  begin your calculation of pi .         value of what .     steve asked .     what   s that supposed to accomplish .         remember pi  from geometry .     harriet said quietly .     it   s an endless calculation .  it   ll just keep him busy .         oh  yeah .  geometry .         hunter     said harriet .     i think my usefulness to you really ended quite a long time ago .  if you don   t mind  i   d like to return to my hotel room .         of course .  please stand by  however  for a conference call among all our specialists   one paleontologist and five historians .  i will be arranging it shortly .         all right .     harriet turned to steve .     i   m sorry i wasn   t more of a help  but i   m glad everything worked out .         you had the information we needed when we needed it     said steve .     no need to apologize .      harriet said good bye to everyone and left .      city computer calling hunter .  the conference call you requested is standing by .         connect me .  also contact the six specialists i have hired for a similar conference call .     hunter called daladier on a different band and communicated at maximum robotic speed .      daladier here .         how is wayne .  give me your location .         wayne will be fine .  the medical robots have just completed diagnostic tests and found no significant injury .  they have provided a mild painkiller and we are now walking down a hall toward the main door of the clinic .         i want wayne to observe a conference call with the oversight committee .  have you seen any video screens that i can link .         yes .  the main lobby has a large screen .         wait in the lobby and have wayne observe the call .     hunter contacted the city computer again and instructed it to send the conference call to the screen in the clinic lobby .   at the same moment  the four members of the oversight committee appeared on his internal screens .      yes  hunter .     dr .  redfield  the blonde  smiled hopefully .     does this mean your mission has been completed .         yes  it does     said hunter .  he waited while dr .  redfield  dr .  chin  dr .  khanna  and professor post congratulated him .     i also have good news to report .  from the preliminary explanation of the flaw in the gestalt robots  i expect the problem can be eliminated without destroying the memories or identities of the component robots or the governors .  unless presently unforeseeable problems appear during later examination  their system programming will simply have to include a more narrowly defined set of priorities involving first law interpretations .         that   s excellent     said dr .  chin  tossing her black hair .     it means the problem is not as difficult as we expected .         that   s right     said professor post  stroking his black beard .     the governors will not have to be destroyed .         surely the time has come for a preliminary report  hunter     said dr .  khanna .     you have done very well .  but with your mission completed  i ask you in full expectation of an answer  where did you find the component robots  and under what circumstances .      hunter had always known this moment would arrive .  his interpretation of the first law and his judgment of human frailty prevented him from revealing the existence of time travel .  he also felt that revealing wayne   s obstruction of the mission would  in fact  bring about consequences that would harm wayne .  now that hunter had completed the mission successfully  he saw no reason to allow such harm .  none of wayne   s illegal actions in the past  such as kidnapping jane  could be proven in a contemporary court of law  so legal action was not an option .  hunter decided to delete information about wayne   s presence on these missions .      the first law prohibits me from giving a detailed report     hunter said in a formal tone .      this is an unacceptable answer     dr .  khanna said angrily .     you have put me off at every request .  as the oversight committee  we have a right to this information .         the first law makes no exceptions     said hunter .   dr .  khanna drew in a long breath  his face contorted with anger .  before he could speak again  however  he was interrupted .      that   s true     said dr .  redfield  stifling a smile .     we   re all roboticists here .  apparently hunter has no choice .         i question his judgment on this matter     dr .  khanna said with barely controlled rage .     must we dismantle hunter to make sure of his efficiency .         he reports that he   s completed his assignment successfully     said dr .  redfield .     if that turns out to be true  then we have no real grounds to question him .         i will have mc governor shut down and will arrange for him to be shipped to a lab of your choice     said hunter .      we have to make arrangements first     said dr .  chin .     we   ll contact you when we are ready .         i suggest we confer among ourselves     said professor post .     we should have hunter sign off .         i must ask a question     said hunter .     where does dr .  wayne nystrom stand in regard to your deliberations .         nobody can stand him     dr .  khanna said  still angry .      that   s a personal matter     said professor post .     in professional terms  dr .  nystrom will have to face a detailed review of his flawed creations .         can you utilize his expertise in your upcoming research .     hunter asked .      our oversight responsibility must be conducted without conflict of interest     said dr .  redfield .     however  once our judgment of existing flaws has been reached  that phase will have ended .  when the repair process begins  we can consider contacting him for help .         do you have a recommendation  hunter .     dr .  chin asked     why do you ask .         i will discuss a possible suggestion with you at a later time     said hunter .     i will sign off now .         thanks for a great job     dr .  redfield added  just before the connection broke .           without stopping to speak with the humans in mc governor   s office  hunter called daladier again .     did wayne observe this call successfully .         yes .         is there a phone nearby .  i want to speak with him directly .         yes .     daladier gave hunter a number to call .     it   s right here in the lobby .  i will tell wayne to answer .      hunter called the number .  a moment later  wayne   s face appeared on hunter   s internal screen .      yeah .     wayne said cautiously  glaring at hunter .      you are well .     hunter asked .      well enough .  get to the point  will you .         based on the reaction of the oversight committee  i believe the members will consider your participation in correcting the flaws of the governor robots .         dr .  khanna never liked me .  and the feeling   s mutual .  they   re all jealous of my accomplishments .         if you are willing to participate  i believe they will work with you .  in that event  your career may not be significantly harmed .      wayne said nothing for a moment  looking at hunter .     yeah .         i will offer you a deal in exchange for my recommending to the oversight committee that they ask for your help in the repair process .         how do you know they   ll bother to repair the governor robots .     wayne asked  in a less confrontational tone .     i always figured they   d just junk them entirely .         i cannot speak for them     said hunter .     but or .  redfield raised the subject of a repair phase on her own .  the oversight committee appears to have an open mind on the subject .         well  yeah  i heard her mention that     wayne said slowly .     what do you want from me in return .         i want you to keep the existence of time travel a secret .  the inherent harm to all humans is clearly immense .         yeah  i know that .  but what about the hardware .         the first law will not allow me to discuss my plans .  however  i offer the proposition that if no evidence of time travel continues to exist  anyone claiming to have visited the past will sound silly  not to mention professionally unreliable .      wayne hesitated  then nodded .     i hear the implied threat to my own future  hunter .  all right  you have a deal .         good .  you can find lodging in mojave center for the time being .         yes .         excellent .  feel free to have daladier continue to assist you .  i will confer with you again later .  hunter out .         hunter  city computer calling .  the second conference call you requested stands by .         please connect me .         hunter  is everything okay .     jane asked .      yes     hunter said aloud .     jane  and steve  please stand by .  in a moment  we will return to the bohung institute .         okay     said steve .   as the six specialists appeared on hunter   s internal link  he greeted each one of them .      what   s up  hunter .     chad mora  the paleontologist who had helped find mc   in the late cretaceous era  grinned at him .     you don   t have to find another robot in the age of dinosaurs  do you .         no .  we have completed our missions .      a chorus of congratulations came from all of them except harriet  who of course already knew that .      i   m glad  hunter     said rita chavez  who had journeyed to jamaica in the time of the buccaneers with the team .      i want to thank you again  hunter     said gene titus .     for inviting me along to roman germany .  it was a wonderful experience for a historian  i guess we all feel that way .         that   s right     said judy taub  who had traveled back to the battle of moscow in      with the team .      i still can   t believe i met marco polo and kublai khan     said marcia lew .      have any of you revealed that you traveled into the past .      no one responded  several shook their heads .      it   s been less than a week     said chad .     i   m still reviewing all the information i collected .         we all know the danger of revealing time travel to the world at large     said judy .      i made significant discoveries     said harriet .     i may not be alone in that .  but i know you want us to keep this a secret .         i will dismantle the time travel ability of the sphere shortly     said hunter .     of course  i cannot order you to keep this a secret .  i can tell you that no evidence of time travel will exist  however .  certainly none of us will benefit by having the technology rediscovered .         i get the picture     said chad .     if we claim to have traveled through time  we   ll sound like cranks or lunatics .         as you know  i cannot allow harm to any of you     said hunter .     so i want you to know that maintaining the secret will be to your own advantage .         i can manage     said harriet .     even though i can   t prove my information  i know where to pursue more archaeological research .  maybe i can arrange it .         i can  too     said chad .     paleontology combines hard evidence with educated guesses all the time .  i can advance my new information as theoretical .  since i   m right  no one can disprove it .     he laughed lightly .     and i know roughly where to dig next .         i didn   t learn much new history as such     said marcia .     i picked up the feel of the times .  that helps me in my work  too .         same for me     said gene .      yes  i would say that     added rita .     it all became real .         i have further work to do     said hunter .     please excuse me for making this farewell so abrupt .  i thank you all .     he disconnected and turned to steve and jane .     we must go back to the bohung institute now .  jane  can we safely leave mc governor here .         yes     said jane .     under the second law  he can   t violate my instruction to stay in the room and i don   t believe he can come up with a first law argument to justify overriding it .         especially while he   s calculating pi .     steve grinned .      right .  besides  ishihara can stay here to guard him and that security detail is still right outside .  we can instruct them to stop mc governor bodily from leaving if necessary .         please do that as we leave     said hunter .     ishihara  remain here with mc governor .  stop him if he attempts to leave and call me immediately .  soon i can allow the bohung institute to reopen  at which time you may resume your normal duties .  you know this situation has first law force .         agreed .         we will go .        steve rode with hunter and jane in the same vehicle they had taken to mc governor   s office .  jane had given the security detail guarding the office their instructions .  now no one spoke as hunter drove them back through the streets of mojave center .   during the ride  steve felt out of place .  he had originally been hired because of his experience out doors  to be part of a team made up of hunter and city people .  at hunter   s request  he had remained part of the team in the later missions .  now  his contribution had clearly ended .  he wondered if he should say good bye also  but he did not really want the experience to end yet .  the missions had all been exciting  and he wanted to spend more time with jane .  on the other hand  he expected that she was anxious to get back home and return to her normal routine now that the job had ended .   at the bohung institute  they returned quickly to room f    .  hunter walked to the console near the sphere and opened it .  as he worked inside the console  jane stood with steve watching .      it   s been a wild adventure     said steve .     or six separate ones .         i can hardly believe we visited all those times and places     said jane .  she shook her head slowly .     and now it   s over .         we must hope so     said hunter as he continued to work .     when i have finished  the sphere will be returned only to its original function of miniaturization for industrial and medical purposes .         and that will be the end of time travel     said steve .      only if we are unusually fortunate     said hunter .     a technological development that is created once can be created again .  historically  this usually happens .  i will impress further on all the robots who know about our missions that the first law will not allow this technology to be restored  revealed  or discussed .  wayne and our specialists have shown no particular desire to travel in time again .  beyond that  we can only hope that this technology will be an exception that no one discovers a second time .         but you don   t think that   s likely     said steve .      the only reason for optimism is that no one seems motivated to pursue research in this direction .  maybe that will be reason enough .         it was a great experience for me     said steve .     i   d forgotten just how big the world is .  and a society that can make governor robots and create hunter and send people back in time has a lot to offer .         maybe i learned the opposite     jane said quietly .     i   ve worked in an ivory tower of schools and research labs all my life .  the world is much more than robots and technological theories .         yeah .     steve glanced at hunter  who was still working on the console .     i guess my part is finished  isn   t it  hunter .      hunter looked up .     yes .  i asked you to accompany me here so i can return you to your home as soon as i finish .         right .     steve turned to jane  feeling awkward .     well  i guess this will be good bye .  i  uh  enjoyed working with you .  a couple of times  i thought we might have a chance to get better acquainted  but then something always happened .         we have time now .     jane smiled .      uh .  .  . don   t you have to go home  or something .         that can wait .  would you take me up to see your shack again .         my shack .         the first time hunter took chad and me up there to meet you  i thought it was a weird  rickety combination of a primitive shelter and modern conveniences .         well .  .  .     steve grinned .     i guess it is .         after all we   ve been through  i think i might find it downright luxurious now .         it   s not too bad .         i   d like to stay out in nature a little longer without having to chase robots  too .  maybe you could show me around your desert a little .  .  . if i   m welcome .         of course you are .     steve laughed .     i    d love to have you come and visit .         i am finished here .     hunter closed the console .     and now you two no longer have to worry about changing history .         that   s right     said steve .     who knows .  maybe we can make our own .
