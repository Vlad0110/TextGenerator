and robert e .  warnick             into trouble and out of school        trouble .     asked jeff  a little shakily .     why am i in trouble .     he was only fourteen  for all his height  and it seemed to him that he had been asking that question for at least twelve of those years .   at first he had had to ask it of his parents  then his older brother  his teacher  and his computer control .  it hadn   t been too bad then  but having to ask it now of the head of the space command was setting a new record .  he didn   t exactly feel good about it .   standing right next to jeff was agent two gidlow  who was no help at all .  he was dressed entirely in gray  and his angry red eyes glared at jeff with contempt .  even his skin seemed sallow and off color .      you   re not only in trouble     gidlow said to jeff .     you are trouble .      he turned to admiral yobo and cut the air horizontally with a sweep of his hand  as if that were jeff   s neck it was passing through .     admiral  when a troublemaker muddles the computers .  .  .  .      the admiral stayed calm .  the space academy  which was under space command  had serious problems to face and he was at the cutting edge of it all .  the matter of a misbehaving cadet was not something he had to twist his insides over .   besides  he liked jeff  who was the kind of tall and clumsy teenager he himself had once been some years ago  though that was beside the point   and he found himself wearied now and then by gidlow   s strenuous disciplinarianism  though that was beside the point  too  .      see here  gidlow     said admiral yobo with a mild frown corrugating his wide  black forehead     why all the fuss .  remember that you are not part of the academy and have no authority here .  if you   re going to follow up every prank by hauling the cadet in question into my office to be grilled by federation security control  i   m going to have no time for anything else .  all i   ve gotten so far is that he was trying to sleep learn  and there   s nothing in the rules against that .         if you do it right  there isn   t  admiral     said gidlow .     doing it wrong is another thing .  he tied into the main computer network  he says by accident          of course by accident  agent gidlow     said jeff earnestly .  he pushed his curly brown hair out of his eyes and stood as straight as he could so he   d be taller than the agent .     i mean why should i do it on purpose .      gidlow smiled unpleasantly .  his rather pointed teeth seemed as gray as his clothing and his sallow skin .     if you prefer  cadet  you did it out of stupidity  which is no better .  admiral  i bring this to you because it is a security expulsion matter  and that   s for you to handle .         security .         the way this cadet tied himself into the main computer network  by accident  he says  has resulted in the kitchen computer getting the wrong set of data .         data .  what data .     gidlow pursed his lips     it would not be proper to discuss it before a cadet .         don   t be a fool  gidlow .  if this is an expulsion matter  the young man has a right to know what he   s done .         one thing is  and it may be enough all by itself  as a result of his idiotic link up  everything is being filtered through the kitchen computer .  and this means  among other things  that all the recipes are now in martian colony swahili .      the admiral  who had been playing with the buttons on his desk  began to chuckle as he stared into his private viewer .     i see that one jefferson wells  age fourteen  failed to pass martian colony swahili last semester .         yes  sir     said jeff  trying not to fidget .     i didn   t seem to get the hang of it .  i   m doing makeup now  sir  and i was trying to sleep learn before the final exam next week .  i   m terribly sorry about the computer .  i thought i was following the directions correctly  and i can   t think where i went wrong .         you can   t think  period     said gidlow .     what it amounts to  of course  admiral  is that until the recipes are reconverted into terran basic  or until the kitchen computer is reprogrammed to handle martian swahili  there   s no way of running the kitchen .  no one in space command is going to be able to eat .  we won   t even be able to have canned food released .  i think     he added glumly     we might be able to get a supply of stalk celery that hasn   t yet been indexed .         what .     roared yobo .   jeff stirred uneasily .  he remembered with a sinking sensation that admiral yobo was famous for his thorough knowledge of martian swahili  including its colorful expletives  and also for his prodigious appetite .      yes  sir     said gidlow stiffly .      but that   s ridiculous     said admiral yobo through clenched teeth .     the computer should know martian .      gidlow looked sidewise at jeff  who was trying to stiffen his stand at attention even further .  he said  almost in a whisper     very important secrets have been shoved into the kitchen computer  along with everything else  and computer control now says that everything in the kitchen computer is classified .  that means the cook robots won   t work  and it will be a long haul before we can get into the kitchen computer to do anything about it .         which means     said the admiral     it will be a long haul before i  before any of us can get anything to eat .         yes  sir  which is why this is expulsion material .  in fact  we   re going to have to take this cadet mentally apart before we expel him  in order to find out if he   s learned any classified material .         but mr .  gidlow     said jeff a little hoarsely  for his mouth had gone dry with fright  he had heard stories about what could happen to people under mental invasion     i don   t know any swahili  not even now .  the sleep learning didn   t do any good  so i didn   t get any classified material .  i didn   t get anything except some strange martian recipes          strange .     said the admiral  glowering .     you think martian food is strange .         no  sir  that   s not what i meant          admiral     gidlow said     he clearly got classified information he thinks are recipes .  he must be taken apart .      jeff felt desperate .     there   s nothing classified in me .  just recipes .  what makes them strange is that they   re in martian colony swahili  which i keep telling you i don   t understand .         then how do you know they   re recipes .  eh .  eh .  admiral  this little troublemaker is convicting himself with his own mouth .         i know the martian names for some of their dishes     said jeff .     that   s how i know .  i like to go to martian restaurants .  my brother used to take me to them all the time .  he always says there   s nothing like martian cooking .         quite right .     admiral yobo stopped glowering and nodded .     quite right .  your brother has good sense .         that has nothing to do with anything  admiral     said gidlow .     the cadet will have to leave school and come with me .  i   ll find out what he knows .         i can   t leave school     said jeff .     the semester is almost over  and i   ve signed up for summer school so i can learn advanced robotics and invent a hyperdrive .      gidlow sniggered .     with your record  you   ll probably use the hyperdrive to send space command into the sun .  no one   s invented a hyperdrive  and no one ever will .  and if anyone ever does  it won   t be a numbskull like you .  you   re not going back to school  because you   re suspended  permanently  i hope .      yobo said very quietly     am i not the one to make that decision .         yes  admiral     said gidlow .     but under the circumstances  you   ll find you can   t make any other decision .  where matters of security are concerned          please     jeff said faintly     it was all an accident .     the dark  paneled walls of the admiral   s private office seemed to be closing in on him  and gidlow seemed to be getting bigger and grayer .      accident .  hah .  you   re a danger to the solar federation     said gidlow .     and even if you weren   t  your stay at the academy is over .  it so happens  admiral  that cadet jefferson wells   s tuition payments are long overdue .  i have investigated the matter and found that there is no money with which to make the payment .  the wells family corporation is bankrupt .  farley gordon wells  the so called fargo wells  has seen to that .         no .  that   s a l  that   s not true .     jeff shouted in outrage .  admiral yobo bent forward in his enormous chair .     fargo wells is the head of the family .         yes  sir     said gidlow .     do you know him .         only slightly  only slightly     said yobo without any expression in his face .     he used to be in the fleet .         forced to resign  because of general incompetence  i suspect .  it clearly runs in the family .  and he   s just as incompetent in handling the family finances .         it   s not so .  it   s not so .     jeff said .      if it   s not incompetence  then it   s general sabotage .  it   s the only alternative .  he could be in the pay of ing   s league for power .  one of ing   s spies .         you   re wrong .     shouted jeff .     my brother is no traitor .  he wasn   t forced to resign .  he had to resign when our parents were killed in an accident and there was no one else to run the family shipping business .  and i   m sure he did a good job .         such a good job     said gidlow     that he didn   t even leave you enough money to pay your tuition .  which doesn   t matter  because even if you had a million credits  you would have to leave  and that should be a consolation to you .  you will come with me to security control for prolonged probing .  and if you know where your brother is  i   ll send you to him when we   re quite through with you .     gidlow looked up at the admiral .     i tried to locate fargo wells and failed .         i don   t know why     said admiral yobo calmly .     i   ve consulted computer central  and there seems to have been no trouble .     his fingers stabbed quickly at the control buttons on his desk  and the screen on the wall lit up .   jeff   s heart leaped as his older brother   s image appeared .  he needed fargo   s strength and cheer  but that was only an initial feeling  followed by sudden dismay .  there was no familiar twinkle in fargo   s sharp blue eyes  and his rumpled black hair was neatly combed .   i really am in trouble  jeff thought .  even fargo isn   t letting himself be himself on my account .   fargo   s holographic image nodded gravely .     i see that you have company  admiral  and i can guess the reason .  does our mr .  gidlow believe that jeff is in ing   s pay .  i admit that my kid brother is big for his age  but no space cadet should be forced to undergo one of gidlow   s famous probings .  even the matter of ing the ingrate should not justify that .         your guesses miss the mark  mister wells     gidlow said stiffly .     it is not that we suspect your brother of being in league with ing  though there are few we can completely trust these sad days .  we merely want to find out what classified material he learned from the computer in martian swahili  and i assure you we will .  you will not stop me  mr .  wells .         gidlow  i admire your firm and absolute assurance  but space academy is part of space command     said yobo     and when probing is in question  i somehow suspect that i am the final authority .         when matters of security are concerned  we cannot have divided responsibility  admiral .  with respect  i make the decisions there .         with respect  gidlow  you don   t .     yobo rose majestically  looming up like mons olympus on his native mars .     i will decide what   s to be done with the boy .      suddenly fargo laughed and began to speak in rapid martian colony swahili .   gidlow gasped  while admiral yobo clenched his huge fists and frowned .   jeff felt bewildered .     fargo  what are you doing .         mentioning a few state secrets  little brother .      the admiral looked down at jeff .     you didn   t understand a word of that  did you .         no  sir .         he   s lying     gidlow said .      i don   t think he is     said yobo .     it would have taken a polished actor to remain blank faced  considering what fargo wells said .  it is quite safe to accept the fact that wells has just proved  in his little charade  that the boy   s attempt to sleep learn failed  as he said it did .  he may return to the academy .         i must protest  admiral     said gidlow .     the director of the academy has admitted to me that the boy   s tuition is so far overdue that only his excellent  his previously excellent  record has kept him in school .  she said she thought the boy could get a scholarship  but in view of his damage to the computers  that is not in the range of possibility now .      as admiral yobo began to glower again  fargo wells intervened smoothly .     there is something in what gidlow says  admiral .  we don   t have much money  and we can   t pay any tuition .  it   s almost summer and my brother can probably use a vacation  and  well  we may be able to begin to restore our fortunes in the interval .     he winked at jeff .   but jeff drew back at the suggestion .     i don   t want a vacation  admiral .  i like it at the academy .  i want to join the fleet some day .         not this summer     said fargo flatly .     and it will be worthwhile for you  jeff .  we   re not completely penniless .  we have a scoutship  and we can get spacer jobs  which will be useful experience .  there   s even enough to get you back to earth by transmit so that we can celebrate summer solstice together .      at any other time  jeff   s heart would have bounded at the thought .  summer solstice was tomorrow  and the entire system would be at one in its celebration .  all the giant space homes  or    spomes     each with their tens of thousands of inhabitants  the lunar state  the martian colony  all kept the conventions of the calendar of the earth   s northern hemisphere .   even australia had finally given in .   it was in deference to the original solar federation headquarters in the old un on the northern hemisphere island of what was now the manhattan international territory  which had agreed to consider itself  rather reluctantly  part of the solar federation .   jeff turned pleadingly to the admiral .     if i can be allowed to stay at the academy  sir  for my summer courses       fargo intervened .     kids that mix up computers need to get away from them and stay awhile in a nice primitive spot like manhattan .  under my care  of course .  don   t you agree  admiral .     fargo and yobo exchanged a long look .   jeff felt resentful .  he hated it when grown ups talked over his head as if he were not there .  fargo hardly ever did that .  what was the matter .      yes     said yobo .     go and pack  jefferson wells .         but i      began gidlow .      the boy goes home     said yobo .     he   s of no interest to you .          come on  jeff     said fargo .     the faster you hurry  the sooner you   ll be deprived of gidlow   s fascinating company .  come on  and i   ll tell you interesting stories about the misdeeds and ambitions of ing the ingrate .  remember the motto tgaf  eh .  see you tonight .     his image faded out .      what does that motto mean .     demanded gidlow .   jeff thought quickly .     that   s just fargo   s way .  he means all difficulties can be overcome .         tgaf .  all difficulties can be overcome .  admiral  there is some sort of conspiracy          no     said jeff .     it   s just the way he thinks of difficulties .  he   s so handsome that .  .  . well  tgaf means    the girls are findable .         the admiral burst into a loud roar of laughter .     that   s authentic fargo     he said  and jeff tried to stifle his sigh of relief .      in any case     said gidlow     this boy will not be coming back to the academy .  be sure of that  boy .     he swirled out  the very lines of his back showing his anger .   why does he hate me so .  jeff wondered .   but admiral yobo  looking down kindly at him  said     things will be better after a while  jefferson .  i once knew your parents  you know .  they were good friends of mine  and good seismologists  too  till io got them .  not good businesspeople  though  any more than fargo is .     he held out a slip of paper to jeff .      what is this  sir .         a credit voucher .  use it to buy a teaching robot  one that can tie in to the solar educational system .  learn enough to get back into the academy on a scholarship .      jeff put his hands behind his back .     sir  i won   t be able to pay you back .         i think you will .  i don   t think fargo would ever be able to  but somehow i suspect you have a firmer hold on common sense than he has .  anyway  it isn   t that much money  because i   m not all that rich  or all that generous .  you   ll have to buy a used robot .  here  take it .  that   s an order .         yes  sir     said jeff  saluting automatically .  he hurried out  confused and worried .  tgaf .  was fargo right .              choosing a robot     packing did not take much time .  cadets owned very little besides clothes and notes  although jeff did have one valuable item  thanks to fargo  a book .  it was a genuine antique  a leather bound volume with yellow edged pages that had never been restored .  it contained all of shakespeare   s plays in the original  in the very language from which terran basic was derived .   jeff hoped nobody from security control would stop him  open the shakespeare  and see fargo   s underlining in    henry the fifth .     or that  if they did  they wouldn   t understand the old language .      the game   s afoot     henry had cried out  but what game was fargo after with his tgaf .  was it ing .   jeff told his closer friends among his classmates about the bankruptcy and the kitchen computer  but he went no farther than that .  he put the book into his duffel bag with a fine air of indifference  even though he was alone in his quarters .  one should always practice caution .   he took the shuttle to mars .   once on mars  he made a quick meal of spicy eggplant slices on cheese  as only martian cooks could make it  then he lined up at the mars city matter transmitter .  through the dome he could see the distant vastness of mons olympus  the largest heap of matter on any world occupied by human beings .  it made him feel very small .   and very poor .   maybe i should give the credit voucher to fargo  jeff thought .  he needs it more than i need a teaching robot .  but i   ve always wanted a teaching robot  came the immediately rebellious afterthought .      wells next .      for a second  jeff almost decided to turn on his heel .  why should he take the transmit .  it was so expensive .   matter transmitters had been in use for years  but they still required enormous power and very complex equipment  and the cost of using them reflected that .  most people took the space ferry from mars to luna and then to earth .  why shouldn   t jeff be one of them .  especially now with the family near bankruptcy .   still  the ferry took over a week  and with the transmit he would be home today .  and fargo clearly wanted him there in a hurry .   all this went through jeff   s head in the time it took for the most momentary of hesitations .  he went into the room .  it was packed with people  luggage  and freight boxes .  the people all looked rich or official  and jeff slumped in his seat hoping no one would notice him .   as he waited for the power to go on  he wished again that he could invent a hyperdrive .  everyone knew there actually was a thing called hyperspace  because that   s what hycoms used for the instantaneous voice and visual communication that was now so common .  it was by hycom that fargo   s image had appeared in the admiral   s office  for instance .  that   s what    hycom    meant  after all     hyperspatial communication .      well then  if they could force radiation through hyperspace  why couldn   t they force matter through it .  surely there should be some way of devising a motor that would let a spaceship go through hyperspace  bypassing the speed of light limit that existed in normal space .  it probably meant that matter would have to be converted into radiation first  and then the radiation would have to be reconverted into matter .  or else .  .  .  .   fifty years ago  an antigrav device had been invented  and before then everyone had said that was impossible .  now antigravs could be manufactured small enough to fit into a car .   maybe the two impossibles had a connection .  if you used antigravs in connection with matter transmitters  that operated only at sub light speeds   you could  he blacked out .  one always did that in transmit .   there was no sensation of time passage  but the room was different .  it held the same contents  but it was a different room .  he could see the clock in the cavernous chamber outside .  not quite ten minutes had passed  so the transmission had been carried through at  he calculated rapidly in his head  allowing for the present positions of mars and earth in their orbits  not quite half light speed .   jeff adjusted his watch  walked out of the transmitter room  and was on earth .  he wondered if his molecules had survived the transmission properly .  now wasn   t this a case of conversion into radiation and back  after a fashion .  surely it could be improved to the point where  oh well .   the matter transmission people always insisted that it was impossible for molecules to be messed up in transit  and no one had ever claimed damage .  still .  .  .  .   nothing i can do about it anyway  jeff decided .   but if you were going to take the risk  he thought  why not do the thing right .  hyperdrive would be much the better deal .  it might still mean conversion to radiation and back  but at least you could go anywhere  and that would give you much more in return for the risk .   right now  by transmit  you could only go to another transmit station .  if you wanted to go somewhere that didn   t have a transmit  you would have to go by ferry or freighter to the nearest transmit  and that could take anywhere from weeks to years .  no wonder the federation was stuck in the solar system .   and that   s why ing   s rebellion was so dangerous .   jeff called the family apartment from grand central station  manhattan   s public transmit terminal  to let the housekeeping computer have enough time to send cleaning robots out to make a last minute cleanup of the dust .     the apartment  when he got there  looked as always .  old  of course  but that was as it should be .  all the wellses had been proud to own an apartment on fifth avenue in a building that had been kept going  apparently with glue and wishes  for centuries .  it had disadvantages  but it was homier .      welcome  master jeff     said the housekeeper computer from the wall .      hi     jeff grinned .  it was nice to be scanned and recognized .      there is a message for you from your brother fargo  master jeff     said the computer  and a cellostrip pushed out of the message slot with a faint buzz .   it was the address of a used robot shop  which meant that fargo and admiral yobo had talked again after jeff had left the office .   why .  jeff wondered .  for old time   s sake .  did gidlow know .   it was still afternoon in manhattan .  there was time to go to the shop .   jeff felt faintly uneasy about buying the robot now that he was about to make a purchase .  should he argue with fargo and try to make him take the admiral   s money for himself .   but the admiral had to have talked with fargo on the subject .  there had to be something behind all this  but what .   before leaving  jeff dialed a hamburger from the kitchen computer  which was always in perfect order  thanks to fargo .  he said     first things first     and hunger came first  even for him  let alone for a growing boy .   how much more will i grow .  thought jeff .   it was a good hamburger .     the self important fat little man who ran the used robot shop considered the sum jeff announced he had at his disposal and didn   t seem at all impressed .     if you use that for a down payment     he said     you can have an almost new model like this .  a very good buy .      what he referred to as    this    was one of the new  vaguely humanoid cylindrical robots in use as teachers at all the expensive schools .  they could tie in to main computer systems in any city and have access to any library or information outlet .  they were smooth  calm  respectful  good teachers .   jeff studied the almost new model  wishing that manufacturers had not decided years ago to make intelligent robots look only slightly like human beings .  the theory was that people wouldn   t want robots that could be mistaken for real people .   maybe they were right  but jeff would much rather have one that could be mistaken for a real person than one that could be mistaken only for a cartoon of a real person .   the almost new model had a head like a bowling ball  with a sensostrip halfway up like a slipped halo .  it was the sensostrip that served as eyes  ears  and so on  keeping the robot in general touch with the universe .   he stepped closer to look at the serial number above the sensostrip .  a low one would mean it was fairly old and not as almost new as the manager of the store made it sound .  the number was quite low .  what   s more  jeff didn   t like the color combination of the sensostrip .  each one was different  for easier differentiation of individual robots  and this one was clashing and unesthetic .   but it didn   t matter whether jeff liked or didn   t like any part of that robot .  if he used his money for a down payment  where would the rest come from .  he just couldn   t commit himself to monthly payments for a year or two .   he looked about vaguely at the transparent stasis boxes  each of which held a robot with a brain that was not in operation .  was there something he could afford here .  something he could buy in full .  an older model that worked .   he noticed a stasis box in a corner  all but obscured by others in front of it .  he wriggled between two boxes and moved one of them in order to look into it .  half hidden like that  it had to be a not so good robot  but that was exactly what he could afford .   actually  what was inside didn   t look like a robot at all .  of course  it had to be one because that was what stasis boxes were for .  any intelligent robot had to be kept in stasis until sold .  if the positronic brain were activated and then kept waiting to be sold  it would get addled .   just standing around doing nothing  thought jeff  that would addle me .     what   s in that box .     said jeff abruptly .   the manager craned his neck to see which box jeff was referring to  and a look of displeasure crossed his face .     hasn   t that thing been disposed of yet .  you don   t want that  young man .         it must be an awfully old robot     said jeff .  the thing in the box looked like a metal barrel about sixty centimeters high  with a metal hat on top of it .  it didn   t seem to have legs or arms or even a head .  just a barrel and a hat .  the hat had a circular brim and a dome on top .   jeff continued to push the other boxes out of the way .  he bent down to see the object more clearly .   it really was a metal barrel  dented and battered  with a label on it .  it was an old paper label that was peeling off .  it said     norb   s nails .     jeff could now distinguish places in the barrel where arms might come out if circular plates were dilated .      don   t bother with that     said the manager  shaking his head violently .     it   s a museum piece  if any museum would take it .  it   s not for sale .         but what is it .  is it really a robot .         it   s a robot all right .  one of the very ancient r  models .  there   s a story to it if anyone is interested .  it was falling apart  and an old spacer bought it  fixed it up          what old spacer .     jeff had heard stories about the old explorers of the solar system  the human beings who went off alone to find whatever might be strange or profitable or both .  fargo knew all the stories and complained that independent spacers were getting rare now that ing   s spies were everywhere  and now that ing   s pirates stole from anyone who dared travel to little known parts of the system without official federation escort .      the story is that it was someone named mcgillicuddy  but i never met anyone who ever heard of him .  did you ever hear of him .         no  sir .         he   s supposed to have died half a century ago  and his robot was knocked down to my father at an auction .  i inherited him  but i certainly don   t want him .         why isn   t it for sale  then .         because i   ve tried selling it .  it doesn   t work right  and it   s always returned .  i   ve got to scrap it .         how much to you want for it  sir .      the manager looked at him thoughtfully .     didn   t you just hear me tell you that it doesn   t work right .         yes  sir .  i understand that .         would you be willing to sign a paper saying you understand that  and that you cannot return it even if it doesn   t work right .      jeff felt a cold hand clutching at his chest as he thought of the admiral   s money being thrown away  but he wanted that robot with its spacer heritage and its odd appearance .  certainly it would be a robot such as no one else had .  he said  with teeth that had begun to chatter a bit      .  .  . sure  i   ll sign if you take the money i have in full payment and give me a receipt saying    paid in full .     i also want a certificate of ownership entered into the city computer records .         huh .     the manager said .     you   re underage .         i look eighteen .  don   t ask to see my papers  and you can say you thought i was of age .         all right .  i   ll get the papers filled out .      he turned away  and jeff squatted .  he leaned forward and peered into the stasis box .  this mcgillicuddy must have put the workings of a robot into an empty barrel used for norb   s nails .   jeff looked more closely  putting his face against the dusty plastic and lifting one hand to block off light reflections .  he decided that the hat was not all the way down .  a band of darkness underneath showed that the robot had been put in stasis with its head not completely inside the barrel .   and there was a strange thin wire stretching from inside the darkness to the side of the stasis box .      don   t touch that .     shouted the manager  who had happened to look up from his records .   it was too late .  jeff   s outstretched finger touched the stasis box .   the manager had hopped over  mopping his forehead with a large handkerchief .     i said don   t touch it .  are you all right .         of course     said jeff  stepping back .      you didn   t get a shock or anything .         i didn   t feel a thing .     but i did feel an emotion  thought jeff .  awful loneliness .  not mine .   the manager looked at him suspiciously .     i warned you .  you can   t claim damage or anything like that .         i don   t want to     said jeff .     what i want is for you to open that stasis box so i can have my robot .         first you   ll sign this paper  which says you   re eighteen .  i don   t want you ever bringing it back .     he kept grumbling to himself as he put it through the computoprint device that scanned the writing and turned it into neat print in triplicate .   jeff read the paper rapidly .     you look eighteen     the manager said .     anyone would say so .  now let me see your identification .         it will tell you my birthdate .         well  cover it with your thumb .  i   m not bright and won   t notice you   ve done that .  i just want to check your name and signature .      he looked at the signature on the card jeff presented .     all right     he said     there   s your copy .  now  credit voucher  please .      he looked at it  placed it in his credit slot  and returned it to jeff  who winced  for it meant that virtually everything the admiral had given him had been transferred  quite permanently  from his account into the store   s .  it left him with practically nothing .   the manager waddled through the mess of boxes and touched the raised number on the dial box of the one that held the robot in the barrel .  the top opened .  with that  the thin wire slowly withdrew into the barrel  and the hatlike lid seemed to settle down firmly so that the band of darkness disappeared .  the manager didn   t seem to notice .  he was too busy trying to shift the stasis box into better position .      careful .  careful .     said jeff .     don   t hurt the robot .      with its hat up and its wire out  jeff wondered if the robot had really been in a position to think .  he felt again a stab of sympathy .  if that had been so  it must have been awful to be trapped inside a box  able to think but unable to get out .  how long had it been there .  it must have felt so helpless .      please     he said to the manager .     you   re being too rough .  let me help you lift it out .         too rough .     said the manager with a sneer .     nothing can hurt it .  for one thing  it   s too far gone .      he looked up at jeff with an unpleasant expression on his face .     you signed that paper  you know .  i told you it doesn   t work right  so you can   t back out .  i don   t think you can use it for teaching purposes because it doesn   t have the attachments that will allow it to tie into the education system .  it doesn   t even talk .  it just make sounds that i can   t make sense of .      now  for the first time  something happened inside the barrel .  the hatlike lid shot up and hit the shopkeeper in the shoulder as he was leaning over the box .   underneath the lid was half a face .  at least that   s what it looked like .  there were two big eyes  no .  jeff leaned across and saw that there were also two big eyes at the back   or maybe that was the front .      ouch     said the manager .  he lifted a fist .   jeff said .     you   ll just hurt yourself if you try to hit it  sir .  besides  it   s my robot now  and i   ll have the law on you if you damage it .      the robot said in a perfectly clear voice that was a high and almost musical tenor .     that vicious man insulted me .  he   s been insulting me a lot .  every time he mentions me  he insults me .  i can speak perfectly well  as you can hear .  i can speak better than he can .  just because i have no desire to speak to my inferiors  such as that co called manager  doesn   t mean i can   t speak .      the manager kept puffing out his cheeks and seemed to be trying to say something  but nothing came out .   jeff said  quite reasonably     that robot can certainly speak better than you can right now .         what   s more     said the robot     i am a perfectly adequate teaching robot  as i will now demonstrate .  what is your name  young man .         jeff wells .         and what is it you would care to learn .         swahili .  the martian colony dialect  uh  sir .     it suddenly occurred to jeff that he ought to show a decent respect to a robot that clearly displayed a certain tendency to irascibility and shortness of temper .      good .  take my hand and concentrate .  don   t let anything distract you .      the little robot   s left  or possibly right side dilated to a small opening  out of which shot an arm with a swivel elbow and two way palms  so that it was still impossible to tell which was its front and which its back .  jeff took the hand  which had a pleasantly smooth  but not slippery  metallic texture .      you will now learn how to say    good morning  how are you .     in martian swahili     said the robot .   jeff concentrated .  his eyebrows shot up  and he said something that clearly made no sense to the manager .      that   s just gibberish     said the manager  shrugging .      no  it isn   t     said jeff .     i know a little swahili  and what i said was martian swahili for    good morning  how are you .      only this is the first time i   ve been able to pronounce it correctly .         in that case     said the manager hastily     you can   t expect to get a teaching robot that   s in working order for a miserable eighty five credits .          no  i can   t     said jeff     but that   s what i got it for .  i have the paper and you have the money  and that ends it  unless you want me to tell the police you tried to sell an inoperable robot to a fourteen year old .  i   m sure this robot can act inoperable if i ask him to .      the manager was puffing again .   the robot seemed to be getting taller .  in fact  it was getting taller .  telescoping legs were pushing out of the bottom of the barrel  with feet that faced in both directions .  the robot   s eyes were now closer to the level of the little shopkeeper  who was a good head shorter than jeff .   the robot said     i would suggest  inferior person  that you return the eighty five credits to this young man  and let him have me for nothing .  an inoperable robot is worth nothing .      the manager shrieked and stepped back  falling over a stasis box containing a set of robot weeders .     that thing is dangerous .  it doesn   t obey the laws of robotics .  it threatened me .     he began to shout .     help .  help .         don   t be silly  mister     jeff said .     he was just making a suggestion .  and you can keep the eighty five credits .  i don   t want them .      the manager mopped his brow again .     all right  then .  get it out of here .  it   s your responsibility .  i don   t ever want to see that robot again .  or you  either .      jeff walked out  holding the hand of a barrel that had once contained norb   s nails and had now sprouted two legs  two arms  and half a head .      you   ve got a big mouth     said jeff .      how can you tell .     said the robot .     i talk through my hat .         you sure do .  what   s your name .         well  mac  that was mcgillicuddy  called me macko  but i didn   t like that .  mac and macko sounds like a hyperwave comedy team .  but at least he referred to me as    he    instead of    it .     that was something  anyway .  it showed respect .  what would you like to call me  jeff .      jeff should have corrected the robot .  all robots were supposed to put a title before a human name  but it was clear that the robot he had didn   t follow customs too well  and jeff decided he didn   t mind that .  besides  he would get tired of being called master jeff .   he said     have you always been inside a barrel of norb   s nails .         no  only since mcgillicuddy found me  that is  since he repaired me .  he was a genius at robotics  you know .     then  with obvious pride  the robot added     the barrel is part of me  and i won   t wear out .  not ever .         oh  i don   t know     said jeff coolly .     your label just fell off .         that   s because i don   t need a label .  this old but serviceable barrel doesn   t contain nails any longer .  it contains me .  i like this barrel .  it   s good  strong stainless steel .         all right     said jeff .     in that case  since this wonderful barrel once held norb   s nails why don   t i call you norby .      the robot blinked and said     norby .  .  . norby .  .  .      as though he were rolling the sound round on his tongue and tasting it  except that he didn   t have a tongue and probably couldn   t taste .  then he said     i like it .  i like it very much .         good     said jeff .  and he and norby walked off  still hand in hand .              in central park     the housekeeping computer  not having feelings or much intelligence  didn   t disapprove of norby .  that relieved jeff  who realized that he should have known that the housekeeper would not give him anything to worry about  and would  in fact  be incapable of doing so .  of course  the housekeeper didn   t approve of norby  either  but that didn   t matter .   now that he was home and could relax  jeff surveyed his purchase critically .     does your head come out of the barrel any further  norby .         no .  this is all there is of my head .  it   s all i need .  it   s all anyone needs .  does it matter .      jeff studied norby   s large  oddly expressive eyes .     i guess it doesn   t  but how do you get repaired .  do you come out of the barrel .         certainly not .  there   s no me to come out of the barrel .  it   s part of me now .  mac welded me in so tightly  this barrel is my armor  my skeleton .  do you get out of your bones when you see the doctor .  come out of the barrel indeed .         don   t get mad about it .  i   m just asking .  how do you get repaired .  let   s face it  norby  i can   t afford much in the way of maintenance  so i hope you   re not planning on breaking down .         if you   re worrying about cost  jeff  forget it .  i will never need repairs .  i am good at repairing other machines  but as you see me  i will always be .     norby whirled rapidly around on two quickly moving feet  but his eyes kept staring firmly at jeff .  or the front two did  or was it the back two .     as you see  i work perfectly .  mac was a genius .         mcgillicuddy .         of course .  why use five syllables when one will do .  besides  that   s what mac wanted to be called .  mac .  i said to him     if you want mac  mac  mac you   ll get .         that   s three macs in a row .         as many as he wanted for the way he worked me out .  of course  he had help .         oh .  what kind of help .      norby  who had been jiggling happily  came to a dead halt .  he stared at jeff solemnly  then sucked in his head .      i said  what kind of help .      norby said nothing .   jeff said     look here  i   m asking a question .  you   ve got to answer .  that   s an order  and you   ve got to obey an order .      from under the hat came a small and muffled     do i have to .  can   t we be partners .         partners .  well  norby  i see now why your other owners had trouble with you .  you spent too much time with an old spacer who was so alone that he forgot you were a robot and treated you like another human being .  you   re not one  you know .  you   re my teaching robot  and you   re not going to be able to do much teaching if you act insubordinate .      the hat elevated slightly  and norby   s eyes peeked over the rim of the barrel .  only part of them could be seen .     that   s not why the other owners had trouble with me .  i just didn   t want them .  i was wrong about them  so i made them take me back .         next you   ll say you made a mistake with me  and make me take you back .         i might  if you act the way you did just then .  and why should you expect me to obey orders .  would you have bought me if i were just another teaching robot .      jeff laughed .     if you put it like that  no .  i suppose you   d say it was a weird impulse .  i think i liked your looks .  you   re the funniest looking thing i ever saw .         funny .  there   s a certain dignity about me .  very gracefully proportioned is what i am .         all right .  don   t get offended again .  i guess it was your graceful proportions .  it made me buy you on a strange impulse .         no impulse  either .         no .         no .  after the last time i was returned  i managed to keep my head just a little elevated  and i even put out my feeler and grounded it .  the manager was entirely too inferior to notice .  anyway  it meant i wasn   t going to be sold to just anyone who walked in .  i could watch customers and feel them          feel them .         feel their minds .  that   s why i knew right away that i liked you and          thank you  norby .         well  you seemed reasonable and not too uppity .  you felt like the kind of person who wouldn   t come over all superior to a poor robot .  i think maybe i was wrong .         i apologize  norby .         all right .  apology accepted .  anyway  i did my best to appeal to you so you would want to buy me  and i tried to get the manager to say nasty things about me  that wasn   t hard  because that would get you to want me more .  it worked .         okay  then  norby  we   re partners .     jeff realized that norby had not mentioned the loneliness  so jeff didn   t either .     could you have fixed that rattletrap taxi we took home from the robot shop .         if i had the parts  which would have to be enough to build an entirely new taxi  i think .  the taxi   s antigrav was so bad we skimmed two feet off the ground most of the way .  and the robot brain of the taxi was so old and deteriorated that it should have been scrapped two years ago .     norby sounded distinctly superior .      most of the taxis in manhattan are like that     said jeff .     are you going to tell me about mac and what he did to you and what kind of help he had .  i only ask as a friend and partner .         oh  sure .  no problem .  absolutely .  but not now .  what i   m going to do right now is plug myself into the house current and enjoy a refreshing electronic bath .  i hope you have enough money to pay your electric bill  jeff .         so far     said jeff .     if you don   t take baths every hour  that is .         i am not that gluttonous     said norby haughtily .  he scuttled over to a corner and plugged himself in  his barrel body over the carpet with his legs out just far enough to balance him as he rocked back and forth humming to himself .   jeff grinned .  whatever this mcgillicuddy had done to manufacture norby  it must have been unique .  jeff had never encountered a robot like norby  or heard of one either .  wait till fargo came home and met the thing .   come to think of it  why wasn   t fargo already home .     midnight came and went .  the summer solstice should be celebrated at dawn .  that   s what fargo had said .  and he took the celebration seriously  so where was he .   jeff finally slept  uneasily  because he was worried and because he could hear norby exploring the apartment  opening books and fiddling with equipment  and he couldn   t help wondering if norby were doing any damage .   but mostly he was worried about fargo .  fargo was a good brother .  he   d been almost like a parent  reliable and responsible  except for his habit of getting into trouble unintentionally and upsetting schedules .      wake up .  it   s almost dawn .         fargo .     said jeff  rubbing his eyes .      it   s norby .  if you want to celebrate the solstice at dawn in the park  you   d better go .         but fargo isn   t here  and the park   s not all that safe       norby   s head popped up to full extent .     not safe .  what are you worrying about .  you have me  don   t you .  i   ll protect you .         you   re too little .  i need fargo .  he   s an expert in martial arts .  he   s been teaching me  but i   m not as good as he is  and he made me promise i wouldn   t go into the park at night without him .         what are martial arts .  show me .         all right     said jeff  getting out of bed and shaking his head woozily     if you   ll let me wash up first .      fifteen minutes later he was in his pants and shirt .  he struck a pose in front of norby and yelled .      well .     said norby  after waiting a little .     what happens next .         you   re supposed to attack me .      norby promptly rushed at jeff  who leaned back  grabbed one of norby   s arms in passing  and heaved .   the barrel hit the opposite wall and bounced to the floor .  all the limbs had been reeled in and all the openings shut as soon as jeff had let go .  the barrel rolled across the room .      norby .  are you all right .  i didn   t mean to throw you so hard .  it was just reflex .      no sound came from the barrel .      hey  are you damaged  norby .      the sound came  muffled and sulky     i can   t be damaged  physically .  but my feelings are hurt .         you   re not supposed to have feelings .         but i do  just the same .  just because you   re human doesn   t mean you have the right to decide i don   t have feelings .         i   m really sorry .  i   ll be more careful .     jeff picked up norby and started toward the door .  norby   s barrel was awkward and heavy  and jeff realized he had a hard task on his hands .   norby   s hat elevated  and his eyes looked at jeff .     what are you doing  jeff .         i   m carrying you to the park .  i thought maybe you wouldn   t want to walk on those short legs .         what you mean is that with your long legs it would be painful for you to shorten your stride to match mine  right .         well  yes .      norby made a small grinding noise .     you mean well  jeff  but there   s a great deal you don   t know .         i never denied that     said jeff .      and well you shouldn   t .  i   ll let you in on a secret .         what secret .         this one     said norby  extruding a hand that grabbed jeff   s .  he then floated upward and forward  pulling a surprised jeff toward the window .      you   ve got antigrav .     shouted jeff .     miniaturized anti          not so loud     said norby .     we don   t need to have everyone hear about it .         ouch .     said jeff  his head grazing the bottom of the lifted windowpane .  he had time to be glad that their apartment was so old that it had windows that could open  and then he was sailing across fifth avenue toward central park .  he wasn   t dangling downward with an arm being pulled out of its socket  as he would have been if he were holding onto a passive rope .  instead it was as though norby   s antigrav were spread out over him  holding him up  lifting him .  .  .  .   norby said     i thought i had antigrav  but you can never tell .  i suppose i can remember how to work it .      central park was beneath them now .  behind them  low in the east  the sky showed a diffuse light behind the skyscrapers even though the sun was not yet up .  beneath them the park was still in the deep shadow of night .      i   ve always wondered what personal antigrav would be like     said jeff  excited and breathless .  the wind whipped his curly brown hair back from his forehead .      it   s hard work  if you want to know  and i don   t know when my next electric bath will come .         it seems easy to me .  easy and delightful  like swimming in an ocean of water you can   t feel  like swooping through          that   s because you   re not the one who   s producing the antigrav field  so it   s no work to you     grumbled norby .     don   t get so stuck up about how it feels that you forget to hang on .  hold more tightly .  also  tell me where i   m supposed to go for this solstice celebration of yours .         it   s in the ramble  that wooded section beyond the boathouse  with the boating pond circling    round to the other side .  go down  now .         not so fast .  i   ve got to figure out how .  we can   t just drop .  you   ll dent a bone or something .  besides  it   s dark  and i can   t make my internal light bright enough to show the ground without running out of power .  i can   t do antigrav and bright light both .  what do you think i am .  a nuclear powerhouse .     norby circled  and they sank downward  then up again with a jerk .      hey     shouted jeff     watch out .         look  i   ve got to get this right  don   t i .     said norby .     it   s not easy to ease into the gravitational field and let yourself sink just right .     he grunted .     okay  now  now .  i wish i breathed so i could hold my breath .         i   ll hold mine     said jeff .      good .  that helps psychologically .  it   s hard to make out the ground from the shadow in this dark .      with a thump that rattled his teeth  jeff found himself on his knees and elbows  which were dug well into moist dirt .  his head stuck out over a pool of goldfish in the center of the small grassy clearing .  they were lucky  it was the very place jeff would have had norby aim for if it had been light enough to see .   jeff could see the goldfish despite the dark .  the pool seemed to be lighted from within  which was odd  because manhattan was usually too broke for fancy lighting in public parks .      norby .  where are you .     jeff called  trying to shout in a whisper .   the light in the pool brightened  and slowly a shape rose up and out of the water .  it was a barrel shape  draped in water lilies .  it continued to rise until it was suspended a foot over the water  and then it spun rapidly in the air  scattering drops  as a dog shaking itself would do .   jeff received some of the spray and shouted     hey .      the barrel slowly stopped spinning .  two legs emerged from the bottom and started a good try at a dignified walk  in the air  down to jeff .   norby   s hat popped up .     i didn   t judge it quite right .  i turned on illumination just a little too late .  still  that was an excellent landing  if i do say so myself .         you   ll have to say so yourself     said jeff  brushing at himself without much effect .     i   ve got mud allover me  and you   ve managed to make me good and wet  too .         you   ll dry     said norby .     the mud will dry  too  and then you can shake it off .         how about you .     said jeff .     are you waterlogged .  you won   t turn rusty  will you .         nothing damages me     said norby .     stainless steel outside  and better than that inside .     he carefully untwined a water lily frond from around his middle and dropped it in the pond with a finicky gesture .   norby put out his illumination  but it was getting light enough for jeff to be able to see him even in its absence .     now i know why a simple judo throw landed you on the dome of your hat     he said .      you charged before i was ready     norby said .      i did no such thing .  you charged     jeff said .      i mean you defended yourself before i was ready .         no such thing  either .  you just can   t manage your own technology .  you said so yourself when we were antigravving .         it was hard  i admit  but i managed     norby said .     look at that landing .         you managed imperfectly     jeff insisted .     that landing nearly drove us through to china .         well  i try     said norby in an aggrieved voice .     you couldn   t get any other robot to do this for what you paid for me .  besides  it   s not my fault .  i was damaged in a spaceship crash  and then mac fixed me so that i would be undamageable  you see .  he used salvaged equipment for that and          what salvaged equipment .     demanded jeff .      oh  well  if you   re going to disbelieve everything i tell you  i   ve got nothing more to say .         what salvaged equipment .  darn it  you   ve got to answer my questions sometimes .  you   re a robot  aren   t you .         yes  i   m a robot  so why don   t you understand i   ve got to tell the truth .      jeff took a deep breath .     you   re right .  if i sounded incredulous  i apologize .  what salvaged equipment  norby .         salvaged equipment from an old spaceship we found on an asteroid .         that   s impossible  i believe you  norby  i believe you .  i know you wouldn   t lie  but that   s impossible .  nobody   s ever found a ship on an asteroid just lying around .  wrecks are always salvaged at once by space command .  in this computerized age  space command always knows when a wreck takes place  and exactly where  too .         well  this one wasn   t salvaged by space command .  it was just lying there  and it was salvaged by us .  and how can i tell you which asteroid it was .  there are a hundred thousand of them .  it was a small asteroid that looked exactly like all the other small asteroids .         what happened when he repaired you .         he just kept chuckling all the time .  he seemed very pleased with himself and kept saying     oh boy  oh boy  wait till they see this .     he was a genius  you know .  i asked him what it was all about  but he wouldn   t tell me .  he said he wanted me to be surprised .  and then he died  and i never found out .         never found out what .         about the things i could do .  like antigrav .  and how to do it .  sometimes i can   t get things sorted out in time  and that   s why you could throw me .  and then i don   t land right because i don   t have enough time to make the judgments i need .  please don   t tell anyone about this .         are you kidding .  of course not .         the scientists would take me apart  or try to  in order to find out how i do the things i do  and i don   t want them to .  .  . to try to take me apart  i mean .  i   d be glad to tell them if i only knew myself .      jeff sat back  his arms wrapped around his muddy knees .  he looked up at the sky  which was reddening now in the onrush of morning .     you know  i   ll bet it was an alien spaceship .  it would be the first real proof that there is alien intelligence out beyond our solar system .  in fact  norby  if that were so  you would be the first real proof of that .         but you won   t tell .  you promised .     norby   s voice sounded panicky .      never .  i won   t tell  friend .     jeff reached out and shook norby   s hand .     but we   ve got to get on with the solstice celebration .         all right     said norby     but that might not be easy .  it seems to me that there   s a herd of elephants somewhere .      footsteps were indeed approaching .  lots of them .   jeff seized norby and scuttled behind a bush .  down the path between the trees came a group of people .  each person was holding binoculars .      bird watchers     whispered jeff .      what are those .     norby asked .      a new species of human being .  i haven   t seen anything like that before .         that   s because you spent too much time in space with mcgillicuddy watching asteroids .  human beings like to observe the activities of other animals .  these people watch birds  not asteroids .         you mean they pry into the privacy of birds .         birds don   t care .         but don   t these human beings have anything better to do .         watching birds is a good action .  would you rather they stood about and littered .         birds litter .  they          shut up  norby .      the leading human  an elderly lady in tweeds  stopped beside the fishpond .     here     she said     is a good place to watch for owls .  we   ve had them in central park for the last century .  before that  they would stop here occasionally  but wouldn   t stay .  there were always enough rats and mice for them to eat  but either the air was too polluted or the city was too noisy .  either way  they would decide that the price of a good meal was too high .  now they seem to like manhattan  as all of us good manhattan patriots do .  at least the little screech owls do .  i   ve been told they nest in the trees around here  and since it is not yet sunrise  there   s hope we may see an owl on the move .         i don   t want to see an owl on the move     said norby .      what   s that .     said the tweedy woman sharply .     who said that .  if there   s anyone here who doesn   t want to see owls  why did you come .         i don   t like owls .  they   re probably scary     said norby .      only if you look like a rat     whispered jeff     and you don   t  though i wouldn   t put it past you to act like one .  now keep quiet .         there   s something behind that bush     said a boy .     right there .         muggers .     screamed a girl  waving her binoculars .     they   ll knock us down and take our binoculars .         i don   t need your binoculars     said norby .     i have telescopic vision when i want it .         really .     said jeff  fascinated .     that could be convenient .         maybe they   re ing terrorists     said a man     and they   re holding a secret conference here in the park .      the group of bird watchers was suddenly very still .   jeff held his breath  and even norby was quiet for a change .   at that moment  a shape detached itself from a dark tree and swooped down over the heads of the bird watchers .      we   re being attacked by the terrorists     yelled the same man who had mentioned them before .   the woman in tweeds stood transfixed  clasping her hands .  she didn   t seem the least bit frightened  only excited .     look .  look .  it   s a great gray owl .  a canadian .  it   s rarely seen this far south .  my first central park sighting .      the other bird watchers paid no attention .  they were scrambling back up the path  clutching their binoculars .     let   s go back     one of them shouted .     what   s the use of watching birds when terrorists are watching us .       jeff couldn   t bear to ruin the bird watching .  he didn   t particularly want to get involved  but he had no choice .  he stood up  facing the bird watching leader .     i   m not a terrorist  ma    am  or a mugger  either .  i   m here to celebrate the summer solstice .  a family tradition .         oh my     said the woman .     the owl is gone .         i hope so     said norby .     it was big enough to decide i was a mouse .      jeff pushed norby with his elbow .     i   d be ashamed to be afraid of a little bird .         a little bird .  its wings were twelve feet across .         quiet .     said jeff  and norby subsided  muttering .      perhaps you   ll see it again  ma   am     jeff said .      i certainly hope so .  seeing it even once was the thrill of my life  but what is that behind the bush .         that   s  uh  sort of my baby brother .  he scares easily .         i do not     said norby .     i   m as brave as a spacer .         as a what .     asked the woman .      he said he   s brave .  he   s not afraid of anything as long as he knows he can run away .         i   m as brave as a lion     shouted norby .      he   s never even seen a lion .         i   ve seen lions in pictures     norby said .     mac had an old encyclopedia on his ship .  i know how to be brave .  i don   t run from danger .         your baby brother talks quite well for someone so small     said the woman  edging toward the bush .      he   s a prodigy     jeff said  blocking her off     but he   s very shy .  you   ll embarrass him very much if you come too close .  of course  he does talk a lot  but that   s only because he has a big hat  mouth  i mean .  now i really have to start celebrating the solstice .      the woman said timidly     i don   t suppose i could watch .         no  you can   t .  you   re supposed to be bird watching  not me watching     shouted norby .      he means it   s just a private family ceremony     jeff said apologetically .     it   s not traditional for anyone to watch .      there came a shout from the woods .     are you all right  miss higgins .      the woman smiled .     see that .  they were very afraid  but they came back to rescue me .  that   s very touching isn   t it .     she raised her voice .     i   m perfectly all right  good friends .  i will be right with you .     then  again to jeff     would you like to join our group some other morning .         oh  certainly     said jeff     but hadn   t you better go back to them .  they must be dying with worry for you .         i   m sure they are .  we meet every wednesday morning and on special occasions .  i   ll send you a notice .  what is your name and address .      jeff told her  and she wrote it down in a small black notebook .   off in the distance  the owl hooted .      this way .     called miss higgins to her group .     we may get another glimpse of it .      she plunged back into the darkness of the wood  and jeff could hear that she had found her group and was leading them off on another path .  finally the park seemed deserted again  except for the small sounds of animals and the predawn twittering of birds .      that was horrible .     norby said .      not at all     jeff said .     it was just a little delay  and a harmless one .  far worse things used to happen in good old central park .         muggers and terrorists .     norby asked .     tell me about them .         they   re violent people from long ago .  central park is perfectly civilized today .         then why did you say you weren   t supposed to go into the park at night .      jeff blushed .     fargo worries about me too much .  sometimes he thinks i   m a little kid .  still  the park is civilized now .  you   ll see .         i   d better see     said norby .     i   m a very civilized object  and i prefer to avoid anything uncivilized .                 out of central park     jeff stretched .  he hadn   t had enough sleep  but daylight was on its way  and it was the solstice .     come on  norby .  let   s go our civilized way to the special place of the wells brothers .         special place .  it   s yours .  you own it .         not really .  not legally .  it sure feels ours  though .  it feels deep down ours .         but not legally .  if we   re going to have trouble with policemen  i don   t want to go .         we won   t have trouble with policemen     said jeff irritably .     what do you think this is .  the asteroids .  just follow me .     he started to walk down another path on the other side of the fishpond  but stopped and looked back at norby  who hadn   t budged .   jeff said     well then  go on your antigrav if you want to  norby .  i know walking is difficult for you .         i can walk perfectly well when i want to     norby said .     i like to walk .  i   ve won walking races .  i can walk higher and deeper than anyone  just not faster .  human beings think that fast is everything when it comes to walking  and they   re not so fast anyway .  ostriches and kangaroos go on two legs  and they   re much faster than human beings .  i read about them          in mac   s encyclopedia  i know .  kangaroos don   t walk  they hop .         human beings hop  and they can   t go as fast as kangaroos .  besides  they look undignified when they hop .  if they had bodies like barrels  like mine  they wouldn   t .  watch me when i hop .         okay  hop if you want to  but watch where       it was too late .  norby tripped over a tree root and went over headfirst .  his head didn   t move downward  however  his legs moved upward .  his body rose in the air  upside down  legs waggling out of the upper end  eyes upside down at the lower end .   jeff tried to be serious about it  and managed for about fifteen seconds .  then he burst out laughing .      there   s nothing to laugh at .  i just decided to turn on my antigrav     said norby  outraged .      upside down .         i   m just showing you i can do it every which way .  it   s a poor antigrav that only works rightside up .  anyone can do that .  i   ve won upside down races .  i can be more upside down than anyone else .         and can you also be rightside up .         certainly  but it   s not as dignified  and i wanted to show you the dignified way .  since you insist  however  we   ll do it your silly way .     norby righted himself with what certainly looked like an effort  then sank down slowly until his feet were on the ground again .  he teetered a little  but he said     ta la     and stood on one foot as though he were trying to look like a ballet dancer .      well     he said     how do you want me to go .  forward or backward .  i can go any possible way .  do you want diagonal .         what you really mean     said jeff     is that you don   t know which way you   ll go until you actually try it .  right .         wrong .  said norby in a loud voice .     and let me tell you one thing  if you   re so smart .         yes .      in a much milder voice  norby said     the one thing i want to tell you is that i think we should walk to your solstice place  jeff  before the sun comes up on us and it   s too late .      he held out his hand .  jeff took it and  hand in hand  the robot and the boy walked on the woodland path into the more deeply wooded part of the ramble .  the sky was sufficiently light now to make it easy to see the shapes of trees and stones .   they walked happily down the path into a deep glade with a little stream running through it  a stream that ran from a spring that seemed to come from a cleft in the enormous rock face at the end .  on top of the miniature cliff of the rock face was a railing .  there another path crossed the rock  became a tiny bridge  and circled down to join their path .   a willow tree  small but graceful  bent over the stream  and around its roots grew lilies of the valley  their white cups clear in the dim light .  the light wind caused them to nod and send out their delicate perfume .      i like this     whispered norby .     it   s beautiful .         i didn   t know robots could understand beauty     jeff said .      sure .  an inflow of nice electricity is beautiful when your potential is down .  i thought everyone knew that .  besides  i   m not just an ordinary robot     norby said .      i can see that .  the alien bits in you were from another robot  a wholly different kind  or from an alien computer or something .         that has nothing to do with it  jeff .  the trouble with you protein creatures is that you think you invented beauty .  i can appreciate it  too .  i can appreciate anything you can appreciate  and i can do anything you can do .  i   m strong and i   m superbrave  and i   m a good companion in adventure .  let   s have adventures  and i   ll show you .  then you   ll be glad you have me .         i   m sure of it  norby .  honest .         mac always wanted adventures  but he kept waiting  and the result was that he ended up never having any  except finding the alien ship .  and then nothing happened .         except to you .         you   re right .  i got fixed up .         mixed up  you mean .  you   re certainly one mixed up robot .         why do you make fun of me .  just to show me that human beings are cruel .         i   m not cruel .  i   m glad you   re mixed up and have the alien parts in you .  that   s what makes you strong and brave and       at that moment norby  who was standing with his legs stretched to their full length  widened his eyes to their fullest .     yow .     he yelled .      what is it .     jeff asked .  he tried to let go of norby   s hand  but the robot held on with painful tightness  while pointing backward with his other hand .  jeff remembered that norby had eyes in the back of his head .      danger .     said norby .     enemy .  alien .  death and destruction .         where .  what .  who .     jeff looked here and there and  finally  up  just in time to see motion across the little bridge .  two figures were advancing quickly  too quickly to be made out in the half light .   there were three men  two men chasing one man .      norby .     jeff cried out .     it   s fargo  and he   s being attacked .                 spies and cops        let   s go     shouted jeff as norby lifted them with his antigrav .     bombs away .     and they came down directly on the head of the larger of the two attackers .  jeff was ready for the most desperate fight of his life  but the man wasn   t .  he crumpled to the ground under jeff   s weight  hit his head against the paving  and passed out .      get the other one  fargo     jeff yelled .  he was panting because most of the wind had been knocked out of him .      i don   t have to     fargo said .  he was panting  too .     your barrel did .      there was norby  closed up and on his side  next to the other attacker  who seemed to be groaning in his sleep .      that   s no barrel  fargo     said jeff  scrambling to his feet .     that   s       fargo wasn   t paying attention to him .  his eyes were shining with excitement .  he liked fights and running and risks and danger  while jeff did not especially like them .  he wouldn   t avoid them  but he didn   t like them .  in fact  he would avoid them if he could  whereas fargo usually went out of his way to get into trouble .  jeff wondered again  as he often had  whether it was worth being related to fargo .  all in all  though  he always decided it was .      now what   s this all about  fargo .     he asked  feeling like the older brother instead of the younger .      i might ask you the same question .  how did you get here .  you weren   t here a minute ago .  where did you come from .  the sky .  and how did you knock out that bruiser  and what are you doing carrying a barrel about with you .         never mind all that .  who are these guys  and why are they after you .  i thought the city administration was going to get rid of the muggers .         they   re not muggers  jeff .  anyway  not ordinary ones .  they   ve been following me ever since i talked to admiral yobo about you and  uh  other things .  i thought i   d lost them in the station at luna city  but that was dumb of me .  they just went on ahead and waited at the apartment .  fortunately  i   ve this sixth sense .  .  .  .         like me     came norby   s muffled voice .     i   ve got a sixth sense  too .         what .     said fargo .     did you speak  jeff .  or is there someone else here .     he looked about .      never mind .  go on  tell me .  you were coming to the apartment with that famous sixth sense of yours          yes .  something told me not to go in without questioning the computer outlet i stuck under the doormat  and it told me that the apartment had been broken into and that two men were inside .  i questioned it further  and it told me you had gone out before the break in  so i knew you were safe .  well  there was nothing in the apartment i was worried about except you  and i wasn   t going to fall into their trap .  i had to find you first .  then we could take care of them together .  as we did  kid  right .         don   t forget i helped out     said norby in a loud whisper .      what .     said fargo .      pay no attention     said jeff .     so you came to the park .         certainly  i knew you   d be here solsticing .  but they came after me  and i had to lose them .  i almost did .  but just before i got here  there they were when i was practically on you  so to speak  and then you were on them .         me  too     came the whisper .      there it is again     said fargo .     i   m not insane  and i   m not hearing things  and you wouldn   t be just sitting there  jeff  if you didn   t know who was talking .  you better tell me .     he walked over to norby  still on his side  and looked down at the barrel .     what is this .  don   t tell me you brought a libation for the solstice and then spilled it .         no     said jeff .     that barrel is my robot .         are you kidding .  what kind of robot is a barrel .     he put out his foot and pushed it gently .      that   s extremely impolite     norby said .     why do you let him do that  jeff .     the robot extruded his legs and arms and struggled upright .  his hat lifted  and two eyes glared furiously at fargo .     if i kicked you      he said     i   m sure you would object .         what do you know .     said fargo  sounding dumbfounded .     it is a robot .  where did you get it  jeff .         at a secondhand robot store .  you told me to get a teaching robot  and that   s what it is .  and he   s my friend  mostly .  are you all right  norby .         yes     said norby     and i   m glad you think i   m your friend  even though you don   t treat me like one .  surely you don   t expect me to stay all right when you persist in putting us into these dangerous situations with muggers          that   s a teaching robot .     said fargo .      he sure is .  he   s teaching me that life is complicated and dangerous     said jeff .     but you still haven   t told me who these muggers are .  or don   t you know .         well  i don   t know them by name  but i suppose they   re a pair of ing  s henchmen .      with his foot he prodded the smaller one  who was still groaning .     they don   t seem to be badly damaged  unfortunately .      suddenly the larger one grunted  opened his eyes  and rolled over  reaching for a short stick that lay in the grass .   norby extended an arm farther than jeff knew he could  grabbed the stick  and touched the henchman with it .  the henchman yowled and seemed to collapse .   norby threw the stick to jeff .     take it     he cried .     my sixth sense tells me you may find it useful .      fargo walked over  took the stick from jeff  and examined it closely .     hey  what we   ve got here is an illegal truth wand  with a built in stunner .  that   s an expensive item and a beautiful job  too .  this shouldn   t be available outside the space fleet .         that shows how inefficient the fleet is     norby said .      anyone can rifle its stores .         don   t tell me the fleet is      began fargo .  he broke off and said     what kind of robot have you got here  jeff .  robots have a built in prohibition about harming human beings .  it   s called the first law of robotics .         there   s another sample of gratitude for you     norby said .     i suppose you would have been happy if that mugger had used the stunner on you .  you didn   t even recognize what it was when it was lying on the grass .  come to think of it  he probably couldn   t have managed to stun you with it .  if you don   t have a brain  there   s nothing to stun .         listen here     said fargo     a robot shouldn   t be insulting .     he strode toward the robot  who galloped toward jeff .      leave him alone  fargo     jeff said .     he doesn   t really hurt human beings .         of course not     said norby .     it   s not my fault i fell on one of them .  it was jeff who said    bombs away .     and i was just trying to protect human beings  meaning you  fargo  using the word loosely  by seizing the truth wand before the mugger did .  how did i know it was set to  e stun intensity .  and i didn   t mean to touch him accidentally .  listen  jeff  i don   t trust that dumb brother of yours .  is he on our side .         yes  he is     said jeff .     and he   s not dumb .         well  he worries about my hurting muggers  and he doesn   t worry about the fact that he   s hurting my feelings  and i call that dumb .         he doesn   t know you yet .  and he doesn   t know how sensitive your feelings are .      fargo asked     why is your robot talking to you  jeff  while he   s facing me with his eyes closed .         his eyes are open on this side     jeff said .     he has a double ended head with a pair of eyes on each side .  i bought him at the store you recommended .         which has a proprietor     said norby     who is seriously dishonest  and stupid .  he tried to cheat jeff .         you mean that the proprietor stuck you with that barrel  jeff .         no     said jeff .     i insisted on having norby .  he sort of .  .  .  appealed to me .  actually  the proprietor tried to keep me from taking him .         really .  it appealed to you .  and this robot calls me dumb .         listen  fargo .  don   t call the robot    it .     this robot   s name is norby  and he   s a very unusual robot .  he   s just a little mixed up .         you weren   t going to tell anyone about me     wailed norby .      fargo isn   t just anyone .  he   s my brother .  he   s part of us .  besides  saying you    re mixed up isn   t telling .  fargo is going to find that out after he   s been with you for five minutes .  with you around  it   s got to be the worst kept secret in the world .         there you go hurting my feelings again     said norby .     just because i   m a poor  put upon robot  you think you can say anything at all to me .         let   s stop this love feast     fargo said drily .     we have more important things to do .  for instance  our captives are about to wake up .  you   d better use the stunner  jeff .         we   ve got to get them to talk  fargo  and we can   t do that if they   re stunned .  norby  tie them up before they   re completely awake .         with what .     asked norby .     i may be a mixed up robot  but i   m not so mixed up that i can tie up people without rope .  do i look as though i   m carrying rope on my person .         use this     fargo said  tossing norby a coiled wire .     this was going to be a fancy solstice celebration in keeping with family tradition  but what with one thing and another we won   t have any at all .         what has the wire got to do with the solstice .     jeff asked .      never mind     said fargo loftily .     i   ll surprise you next year .  that is     he added with a sigh     if we get to next year  what with one thing and another .      norby  meanwhile  with surprising efficiency  tied the hands of the captured pursuers tightly behind their backs with the single length of wire so that they were tied to each other as well .  he then closed up again and appeared to be just a barrel resting on the grass beside jeff .      give me the wand     said fargo .   jeff hesitated .     don   t you think we   d better get the police .  even in manhattan  civilians are not supposed to take the law into their own hands .         this is my affair     said fargo     and i   ll handle the police if it comes to that .     he took the wand from his younger brother  who gave it up with obvious reluctance  and waved it in front of the two men .     welcome to the world  gentlemen .  first  your names .      the two men clamped their mouths shut  but at the first touch of the wand  the big  burly one yelped .  then  with a growl  he said     i   m fister .  that   s sligh .         ah     said fargo .      a sly spy .         spelled s l i g h     said sligh .     and you can   t keep us  wells .  the longer you do  the worse it will be for you in the end  and for your brother  too .  i warn you .         warning noted     fargo said .     but before i cower in terror and let you go  let   s find out a few things .     he adjusted the wand .     you won   t get hurt now unless you lie .  telling the truth pleases a wand like this  and do keep in mind that this is your wand i   m using .  any illegality in this respect is on your side .     he prodded sligh .     first  i   d like to know who ing is  and what he looks like .  is he by any chance a beautiful woman .  that might make things a little better .          i don   t know     said sligh .  he was  or had been  neatly dressed in brown  with slicked back hair and a long  sharp face .   fargo continued prodding  but when sligh didn   t flicker an eyelash  fargo said a little discontentedly .     odd .  you must be telling the truth  unless the wand is malfunctioning .  are you fully determined to tell me the truth  then .         sure     said sligh  and almost immediately cried out     yipe .     and writhed a bit .      no  i guess the wand is not malfunctioning  so you   d better tell the truth unless you like the sensation you just felt .  that goes for you  too  fister .  very well  then  sligh  you don   t know what ing looks like .  does that mean you   ve seen him only in disguise or that you   ve never seen him at all .         no one   s ever seen him     said fister hoarsely .      shut up     said sligh .      what   s ing   s ultimate goal .      there was a pause  and sligh   s face contorted itself .      the truth  sligh fox     said fargo .     even trying to lie hurts when the wand nudges you .         there is actually no need to lie     said sligh with a growl .     you know what ing is after .  he wants to head the solar system  for its own good .         of course  for its own good     said fargo .     i wouldn   t think for a moment that he   s thinking of his own good  or that you   re thinking of your own good .  you   re all just a noble bunch of patriots thinking only of others .  i suppose you want to replace the more or less democratic federation with a more autocratic type of government .         a more efficient one with more determined leadership .  yes  it will do ing good  and me good  too  but it will do everyone good .  i   m telling the truth  the wand isn   t touching me .         that just means you believe what you say to be the truth .  i   ll give you credit for kidding yourself into thinking you   re noble .  maybe ing feels that way  too  though i doubt it  and wish i had him under the wand .  what will you call ing when he   s won out .  king ing .  queen ing .  boss ing .  leader .  lord .  emperor .         whatever ing chooses .         and how is ing planning to accomplish all this .  where do i come in .      sligh squirmed .     anyone opposing ing would have to be negated or converted .  you would be an ideal convert .         you hoped to do it by applying this wand long and hard .         that would just keep you quiet and cooperative till we took you away .  we have other methods for the actual conversion .         no doubt  but there   s more to it     said fargo .     you weren   t after me until quite recently .  i wonder why .         it would not be advisable for me to tell you .         i   m sure you believe that  so it   s not a lie  is it .  yes  you can avoid pain by telling truths that reveal nothing .  on the other hand  perhaps i don   t need your revelation .  i suspect that ing   s plan is to take over space command  first of all .  once that is in his control  he can maneuver easily to take over the federation itself .  and it has recently occurred to him that i would be an ideal person to infiltrate the command and betray admiral yobo .  after all  the admiral is my friend and trusts me  and i am badly in need of money  and that need will make it easier for me to be converted .  in fact  there   s your    other method    for conversion .  plain  old fashioned bribery .  am i right .      sligh hesitated only briefly .     all i can say is that ing has plenty of money  and he is generous with those he considers his friends .      jeff broke in suddenly .     fargo  that   s not all          shut up  jeff .  now  mister sligh  i am turning the truth wand on myself .  see  i haven   t changed the setting .         yes .  so what .         i   m going to tell you something  and if it isn   t the truth  i   ll feel what you felt when you tried to lie .  do you think i can hide it .  do you think i   m tougher than you are .         no     snarled sligh .      very well .  i   m telling you that there is no chance of converting me .  i   m out of the fleet and i don   t care  because i   ve got other things to do  but my brother   s only ambition is to be in the fleet and serve space command someday .  he   s not like me .  he   s only fourteen  though he   s tall for his age  but he   s already shown that he   s dead serious and reliable .  nothing will make him side with ing  and nothing will make me do anything to spoil his plans .  so give up on both of us .         is that wand still turned on .     said sligh .      jeff  ask me a question i can lie to .         are you interested in women  fargo .         not at all     said fargo  who then let out a wild cry and dropped the wand .     did you have to ask me for that big a lie .     he said  holding both sides .  his eyes were watering .   then  as the pain abated  he said to sligh     now let   s get back to you and ing .  tell me       jeff interrupted .     something   s coming .      the soft whirring noise of an antigrav motor sounded not too far away  and in a moment there was a blue and white police car hovering overhead .  its searchlight was aimed down at the shaded clearing where the sun  still low on the horizon  had not yet penetrated .   a directed and magnified sound beam came down sharply  its loudness carrying all the overtones of authority     we are answering a general distress call  giving these coordinates .  no one move .  we are the police .      fargo at once stepped away from the two bound figures  dropped the truth wand  and raised his arms .  jeff raised his arms as well .  norby remained a barrel .  after a moment   s hesitation  sligh and fister began to call out     help .  help .         what in blazes is going on down there .     said the amplified police voice .  a figure in blue leaned out  surrounded by the faint glow of a personal shield .      hey  fargo     said jeff .     personal shields are finally on the market .  can we afford a couple .         not on your life     said the policeman .     they cost a fortune  and civilians aren   t allowed to have them .         is that why you don   t have one  sligh .     asked fargo .     or is ing too cheap to get you one .         mine is out of order     said sligh .     the manufacturer guaranteed it  but       fargo laughed .     i guess ing tried the bargain basement .      the policeman leaned out further .  the personal shield glittered on all sides but did not hide the very efficient stunner that the policeman was holding .   fargo said     if it   s that expensive  officer  how come city hall can afford them .         they can   t     said the policeman .     very few of us are equipped with them .  fortunately  for me  the mayor is my father .  now just what is all this .         as you can see      began fargo .      don   t tell me what i can see  because i can see what i can see .  i see two helpless men tied up  and two others standing near and in possession of what looks like an illegal truth wand .  which in turn makes it look very much like a mugging  and makes me sense  somehow  that i have the honor of speaking to the muggers .         hey     said jeff .     you   re not a policeman .      the policeman said sharply     do you wish to see my identification .         i mean  you   re a woman .      fargo said     better late than never  jeff .  there   s hope for you if  at the tender age of fourteen  you   ve finally learned to tell the sexes apart .      the policeman said      a policeman is a policeman  regardless of gender .  now  have you anything to say before i arrest you on the perfectly obvious evidence that          hey .     said jeff .     you   ve got it wrong .  we   re the victims .         indeed .  victims are usually the ones that are tied up .         that   s right     called out fister .     get us loose .  they jumped us when my friend and i were here in the park for a religious observance of the solstice .         are you solarists .     asked the policeman with interest .      brought up solarists by very pious parents     said sligh .     both of us .  my friend and i .  and these two hoodlums violated our religious rights by          madame cop     said fargo .     i suggest you take these two men  and my humble self  to the nearest police station for questioning .  u sing their truth wand  or a police version if you   d rather  you will soon find out that these men are followers of ing the ingrate  and that they were pursuing me in order to force me to join them in their nefarious business .  with great skill  i turned the tables on them and          okay .  stop talking  if you know how .  in the first place  untie those two men .  when that   s done  i will have you grabble meshed individually to the police car  and my partner and i will loft you to the station .  any objections .         i sure haven   t     fargo said .     jeff  untie those villains  but don   t get between them and this stunning woman   s stunner .         your manner     said the policeman     is somehow familiar .         women usually find it so .         to an obnoxious extent  i am sure .  what   s your name .         fargo wells .         farley gordon wells  by any chance .         that   s the full version .  yes .         you   re the kid who put fabric dissolver into the air conditioning system of neil armstrong high school .         the same .  i knew that would never be forgotten .  and  jumping jupiter  you must be the first girl who got it  full strength .  albany jones  right .  if you weren   t wearing that uniform  i   d have recognized you at once  except you probably look even better now .         you   ll never know     said albany jones .     and i think my father  the mayor  still has a strong desire to meet you .       fargo swallowed .     well  maybe later  when all this is over .      sligh  who was now standing upright and rubbing his wrists  said     this is an immoral person  you see .  you can   t believe anything he says .         the truth wand will tell us     said jones .     all four of you take hold of the grabble          wait     said fargo .     not my brother .  he   s here for the solstice celebration  and he   s only fourteen .  please let him go with our keg of nails  that barrel there .  you have me .      jeff said     just because i   m fourteen doesn   t mean i          shut up  jeff .  our parents are dead  albany .  i   ve had to bring him up  and it   s hard being an only parent to a headstrong youth .         stop     said jones     or i   ll dissolve in floods of tears .  you   ll do  he can go .         go home  jeff     fargo said .     sligh and fister no longer infest the apartment  obviously  but check the door computer first anyway .      as the three men were grabble meshed upward  fargo waved and called out     i   ll be back as soon as possible .      jeff watched them sail out of sight .  the park was in full daylight now .   he picked up norby and tried to balance him on his right shoulder .  the barrel seemed to weigh a ton  as though it were full of scrap iron  which  in a way  it was .      you could at least turn on your antigrav     he whispered into norby   s hat .   slowly  jeff began to rise .      only a little antigrav  idiot .      just as slowly  he sank back to the grass  holding what now seemed like an empty barrel .   he began to walk in the direction of home  swinging along briskly  when norby   s eyes suddenly peered out from under his hat .     are you going home right away .  don   t i even get to see the solstice celebration .         you can   t .  we missed it .  the sun   s well above the horizon .         can   t we pretend it hasn   t come up yet .  who   ll know .         we   ll know .  you can   t make fun of things like that    . well  i   ll tell you what .  i can do the oneness  that doesn   t have to be exactly at sunrise .  it   s supposed to be done each solstice and each equinox .  that   s four times a year .         i know elementary astronomy  jeff .      jeff walked back to where they had been interrupted by fister and sligh in pursuit of fargo .  it was still in shadow  still fairly cool  and if the brilliance of day was distracting  it at least added a touch of friendliness to the surroundings .   jeff put norby down and sat cross legged on the grass beside the tiny stream .  he rested his hands  palms up  on his thighs  and half closed his eyes .   after a minute  norby said     you   re not doing anything .  what   s happening .      jeff opened his eyes .  he sighed and said     don   t interrupt me .  i   m meditating .  i am trying to sense the oneness of the universe  and you have to quiet your nervous system to be able to do that .         my nervous system doesn   t need quieting .         how do you know .  it   s never been quiet .  if you don   t sit still without making silly sounds  we   re going straight home .  just let me tune into the oneness .      norby pulled in his arms and legs with an annoyed snap  but he let his eyes peer out from under his head .   jeff resumed his position .  it felt good  as always .   after a while  he said softly     i am part of the universe  part of its life .  i am a terran creature  from the life that evolved here on earth .  wherever i go and whatever i do  i will remember earth .  i will respect all life .  i will remember that we are all part of the oneness .      after another silence  jeff stood up .  he bent to pick up norby  who extended his legs suddenly and moved away .      what   s the matter .     asked jeff .      does all that apply to me  jeff .         of course it does .  you   re as much a part of the solar system as i am  and everything that lives in it is ultimately of earthly origin .         but am i alive .         you have consciousness  so you must be .     jeff started to smile  but norby had seemed so serious .     look  norby  even if you   re not alive in a human sense  you are part of the oneness .         what about the part of me that is alien and isn   t part of the solar system .         it doesn   t matter .  the oneness includes every star in every galaxy  and everything that isn   t a star or a galaxy  too .  terrans or aliens  everything is part of the oneness .  besides  i sure feel part of you and fargo and everyone i care about .  don   t you feel part of me .         i guess i do     said norby  shooting out his left arm so that he could take jeff   s right hand in his .     maybe we   re both important .      he jiggled happily on his backwards and forwards feet for a second and then said     jeff  we   d better walk home .  that will look better than using antigrav .  i feel better .  i   m funny looking  but nobody should mind that .  i   ve got consciousness and i   m alive and i   m at one with the universe .  isn   t that right  jeff .         yes  norby .         and what   s more  the universe is at one with me  isn   t it  jeff .         i think it   s more fitting for you to be at one with the universe .         it think it would be nice to consider the universe   s feelings  too  jeff .  i think the universe would be pleased to be at one with me .         well .  .  . maybe .      it was an exceedingly pleasant day .  there were joggers moving along the roads now  and norby waved to each as they passed  crying out     i am at one with you .      jeff pulled at his hand .  don   t disturb them  norby .  jogging is hard work .         you know     norby said     when you were meditating  jeff  i tried to do the same .  i think i had a dream .         you   re not supposed to sleep .  come to think of it  i don   t think robots know how to sleep .         i had to learn while i was in the stasis box .  it protected my mind .  anyway  i half thought i was in a strange land .  i was aware of the park  but i was also aware of the strange land .  i was aware of both at the same time .  doesn   t that make it a dream  jeff .         i don   t know  norby .  i don   t think that   s the way i dream .      norby ignored that .     i dreamed about this strange land that seemed to be something i had never actually seen  but i can   t be sure .  how do i know where all of me has been  come to think of it .  maybe i was remembering instead of dreaming .         if you go to this strange land  norby  don   t go there without me .         i won   t go anywhere without you  jeff  except i think i don   t know how to go anywhere  really .  i only know how to get back .         back where .         back here from wherever i   ve been .         but how can you get back if you don   t know how to get there in the first place .         i can go .  i just don   t know how how to go .         you mean whenever you travel anywhere  it isn   t really controlled .         i guess that   s it .         that   s inconvenient  norby .         but i   ll always get you home .  after all  my function is to protect and teach  so you can   t blame me if i   m not perfect at taking you places .  you   ll keep me  won   t you  jeff  even so .  you won   t sell me to someone else .  i will try to be a good robot .         i know you   ll try     jeff said  but he did wonder just a little bit what good it would do for a robot as mixed up as norby to try .              manhattan falls        here   s fifth avenue     jeff said  rounding the corner of a wall     and pretty soon we   ll be home and ready for a nice breakfast .         and a plug into the socket for me     said norby .     don   t forget my needs .      they started out across the sidewalk  hand in hand .  they had nearly reached the curb when jeff said in a tense  low voice     oh  no .         what .  what .     said norby .      get back .     whispered jeff  turning and taking sudden long strides .   norby went over backwards  and his barrel body made ominous scraping noises on the sidewalk until jeff shook the robot   s arm .     turn on your antigrav a little .     he whispered .   they melted back into the nearest bush .      i don   t suppose you care to tell me what   s happening     norby said in an aggrieved tone .     i   m just a robot  i suppose .  you think i   m just a hunk of steel  i suppose .  i don   t have any       jeff caught his breath .     shut up     he said  still panting a little .     why don   t you use your eyes instead of that noisy rattle you call a voice .  can   t you see there are men in uniform around the apartment house .         cops .     said norby .      those aren   t police uniforms .         sanitation men .  park security .  hotel doormen .         is this a time to be funny .  i think they   re ing   s men .  and if they   re strong enough and bold enough to conduct a raid       jeff was talking to himself rather than to norby  but norby interrupted .     maybe they   ve taken over the city .         i don   t see how they can have done that .  manhattan island runs itself  sort of  and insists on having no outside armed force on its acres  but even so          if it   s just a raid     norby said     they   re taking a big chance and they have to be after something important .  i guess they must be after me .         you .         who else .  it   s our apartment house  isn   t it .  and you and i live there  and we   ve just had a fight with two of ing   s men and it can   t be you they   re after  so it   s got to be me .  that   s logic .  i   m very good at logic .         why does it have to be you .  why can   t it be me .      norby made a sound like a snort and didn   t answer .     they can   t have taken the whole city     he said .     albany jones approaches .      a police hover car was circling above  moving slowly as though searching for something .  the uniformed men guarding the entrance to the building shot at the car without effect .      how do you know it   s albany .     jeff asked .      it   s her car .  i don   t know if she   s in it  of course  but it   s her car .  i tune into motors .  it   s very simple to recognize one from another .  that   s one of the things i could teach you besides languages .  don   t forget i   m a teaching robot .  languages are my specialty  but i   m sure i could manage a few other things .      the hovering police car dropped a spine cluster into the midst of the men below .  understandably  the result was panic .  some of the men dived for the doorway and the others for the two ends of the block .  when a spine cluster explodes  the results are felt only in the immediate vicinity and are not fatal  but those at the receiving end feel as if they   ve tangled with twenty porcupines .  and removing the spines is neither easy nor painless .   street traffic diverted quickly as drivers recognized that a fight was going on .      why don   t you signal the hover car .     norby said .     it has to know where we are .         i was about to     said jeff  waving energetically from behind the bush .  the police car sank downward slightly  and something fell out .  jeff tried to catch it  misjudged  and received it roughly on his right shoulder .      ouch .     he groaned .     ever since i met you  norby  things have been falling on me  or i have been falling on things .  i feel black and blue allover .  why didn   t you catch it .  you can   t be hurt .         my feelings can .  and with you lurching around trying to catch it  what could i do .  you nearly stepped on me as it was .      jeff was still rubbing his shoulder .     what is this .         it   s the same belt device that albany was wearing in central park  a personal shield .  if you use it  ing   s men won   t be able to touch you .         but how am i going to use it .  i don   t know how it works .         that   s why you have me .  i know how it works .  i   ve already deciphered its simple mechanism .  put it on  then turn this switch here when you need protection .  your arms go in these places .  no  no  that metal part goes in front .  can   t you see .         that metal part     grumbled jeff     is what hit my shoulder .  is it on right now .         yes     said norby     though actually i   m plenty of protection for you anytime .         anytime there   s no danger .     jeff turned the switch on the belt and was instantly aware of the faint radiance that surrounded him .  the street  the sky  and the buildings all took on a slightly yellow tinge that made everything look particularly bright and cheerful .   norby didn   t sound cheerful  however .     jeff .  i can   t get through to you .         sure you can  norby .  i hear you perfectly .         i don   t mean that .  i mean i   m outside the field .      jeff turned off the field  picked up norby  and turned the field back on .  the personal shield enveloped them both .      what   s the difference .     jeff said .     you can   t be hurt  and if you can protect me  you can surely protect yourself .         i get lonely     said norby .   the police car had descended nearly to surface level .  albany leaned out and shouted     get in .  hurry .  those ingrates are corning up with a full sized blaster .      jeff tried to climb aboard with norby desperately hanging onto him .  norby activated his antigrav and it came on so strongly that jeff found himself turning upside down .  albany pulled him in .     goodness     she said     you and that barrel are light .  don   t you have any insides .      jeff could hear shouting and heavy footsteps behind him .  there was the sound of an unpleasant explosion as the car zoomed upward .  it shook in the air vibrations but remained untouched .      ing   s men seized the police station     albany said .     they came right behind me .  they may have seized all the police stations in manhattan .     she bit her lip and shook her head .     i   m afraid we   ve underestimated the ingrates .  they always seemed a minor nuisance  a bunch of inept terrorists .  but it   s clear now that that was just a screen .  they   ve set up a formidable force  and they   re prepared to take over the system .         how did you get away .     jeff asked anxiously .      my personal shield  of course .  i must tell my father to get the city council to equip all the cops with shields .  but i suppose it   s too late now  at least for manhattan .  it   s space command that          but what about fargo .     jeff said anxiously .   albany swallowed .  her brows contracted unhappily over her large eyes .     the truth is i don   t know .  they grabbed him when they came out of the police transmit  and i was so busy getting away i had no chance to see what became of him .  he had given me his address when i was taking him to the station .     she looked a little guilty .     we always get the names and addresses of those we take into custody     she added .     purely routine .         yes  yes     said jeff  who wanted her to get to the point .  what had happened to fargo .      i drifted by the apartment house  just in case he had gotten away and gone there .  i had no idea where else he might go .  when i saw the house guarded by the ingrates  i thought he might have been trapped in the vicinity .  then  of course  i found you .      she said that with a certain note of disappointment .   jeff disregarded that .     then you don   t know where fargo is .         no .  i   m afraid i don   t .  what we   ve got to do now is to find a transmit in manhattan that hasn   t been taken over by the ingrates .  we   ve got to notify space command  or the ingrates may be able to take over all earth .  they wouldn   t attack manhattan unless they   ve already seized the key communications network .  that   s what worries me .     she paused and looked solemnly at jeff .     if we can   t notify space command          put me down  miss jones     jeff demanded .     i have to find fargo .         i can   t put you down .  you   d be taken instantly .  and there   s no need to worry about fargo .  your brother is quite attractive .  .  .  . what i mean is  he   s quite intelligent  and i   m sure he can take care of himself .  we have bigger worries .  space command itself may be infected by ing   s people .         fargo had some kind of private conversation with admiral yobo     jeff said .     that may have been the problem they were concerned with .  and maybe that   s why fister and sligh were after him .  they didn   t want to convert him .  they wanted to finish him .  miss jones  please let me look for him .  they   ll kill him .         if i may make a suggestion     norby said .   albany jumped at his voice  and the hover car lurched as she inadvertently yanked at the controls .     that   s not a barrel     she said .     it   s a robot .  don   t let that silly thing get in our way .         that silly thing .     shouted norby .     you   re the silly thing  or you wouldn   t be so busy talking you can   t see the danger right ahead .  there are cars approaching  shield protected hovercars that probably belong to this ing person you   re so worried about .  if i were you  i   d go somewhere else quickly  but  of course  i   m just a silly thing  so don   t listen to me .         ing   s cars .     albany looked about in horror .  it was clear that the trouble was even worse than norby had thought .  they were surrounded .   albany   s mouth tightened .     ing must have been planning this a long time .  he   s taking over manhattan as though it were a meatball and he were a wolf .  well  we   ve got shields .  shall we fight it out .         with what .     said jeff .      i   ve got a long range stun gun and a hand blaster .         will they work on shielded cars .         no     admitted albany .      does this car have shielding .         are you kidding .  with the manhattan fiscal situation .  no  only our personal shields  courtesy of daddy .         then they   ll destroy our hover car in fifteen seconds  and we fall     jeff looked down for a quick estimate     thirty stories  i think .         you might as well surrender  then     norby said .     that will give us time  and i   ll be able to think of some way of saving the situation .  i   m terribly ingenious .         is surrendering a sample of your ingenuity .     albany asked .     anyone can surrender          there   s nothing else to do right now     jeff said     and it may be the only way of finding fargo .  we   d better do it right away .  one of ing   s cars looks as though it   s bringing a blaster to bear on us .     he turned off his shield and handed the device to norby .     can you hide this in your  uh  inside .         i suppose i can     norby said     but it will make me feel as though i have indigestion .  why don   t you swallow it .  you have a sort of hollow inside  too .         funny  funny .  here  take miss jones   s .      carefully  while making little noises of displeasure  norby put away both shield devices as albany took the hover car down to the ground .  they were followed  of course  and when the ingrates swarmed out of their cars  albany and jeff surrendered .   they were careful to look scornful and superior when they gave themselves up .  at least they tried  and it was especially hard for jeff  who kept norby under his arm .  norby made no attempt to look either scornful or superior .  he merely concentrated on looking like a barrel .     the central park precinct station was inside an old brick building and had the aura of centuries of use and occasional slipshod repairs .   sligh and fister hustled albany and jeff toward the station   s transmit .  despite the chronic shortage of municipal funds and the best efforts of every city councilman  there seemed no way of economizing on those transmits .  each police station simply had to have one for any necessary travel through space .   jeff was still holding norby .  sligh scowled .     you   re not dragging that barrel around everywhere  wells     he growled .     it made a lump on my head once  and you   re not going to use it as a weapon again .  hand it over and i   ll melt it down for scrap .  or we   ll use it as ballast .  maybe we   ll just smash it with a sledgehammer .      jeff clutched norby tightly .     i need this barrel     he said .     it   s a device that   s necessary to  to my health .         are you going to tell me you   ve hidden a kidney filter in that old barrel .         i didn   t want to tell you .         and i suppose you   ll die without it .         i  ah .  .  .  .     jeff hated to lie  but sligh seemed to be doing it for him .      you   re not fooling me  you dumb kid     said sligh .     you look too big and healthy to need any machine for your health .  i bet that   s got wells money in it .  maybe gold .  give it over .      norby whispered through his hat     don   t stand there  jeff .  step back into the transmit .      jeff paused to wonder what norby had in mind  and suddenly he felt a pinch .      hurry up .      albany was already in the transmit .  fister and sligh  facing it  were on either side of jeff  who had his back to it .  the pinch made jeff jump backwards  and as he did  norby   s hands extended full length  pushing fister and sligh in the other direction  out of the transmit doorway .   albany  reacting at once  slammed the door shut .     now what .  the transmit mechanism works from outside .         maybe so     said norby  leaning against the door     but i   m managing to work it through the metal  didn   t i tell you i   m ingenious .         they   re going to force their way in      began albany .      i   m almost finished     norby said .      but we have to get to where they   ve taken fargo     jeff said .      i   m sensing his presence     norby said     and i   m adjusting the controls so we   ll go there directly .  i hope .      a queasy sensation hit jeff in the pit of his stomach  and he blacked out dizzily .  when he came to  he saw that they were in a different transmit .  he scrambled to his feet and helped albany to hers .  she brushed at her clothing and seemed pretty annoyed .      you didn   t exactly handle that in a smooth way  norby     jeff said .      well     said albany     i don   t suppose we can blame your robot .  the transmit is old and not working well .  i don   t think any of the city transmits have had repairs for five years .         norby  are you going to be able to get the doors open .     jeff asked .      in a minute .  in a minute .  and  on the other side  we will find your brother .     the doors opened  and they stepped out into a huge  gray room .  overhead there was a section of glassite dome and beyond that a dim  rolling fog .      or maybe we won   t     norby said in a small voice .      where on earth      said albany .      i don   t think anywhere on earth     said jeff .     norby .  where are we .         is there a city named titan anywhere on earth .     norby asked .      a city named what .      jeff said blankly     what does it say .         it   s in colonial german .  that   s another language i can teach you .  it would come in handy anywhere beyond the asteroids .         beyond the asteroids .     said jeff in a shout .     what does it say .  i don   t care if it   s sanskrit .  what does it say .         it says    property of titan outpost .     i figure titan is a city in the german sector of the european region and i just may have miscalculated a small bit .         titan     said jeff in an exasperated tone     is a satellite of saturn  and you have miscalculated a whole lot .         are you sure .     norby asked .     it could happen to anyone .         of course i   m sure .  where on earth would we be under a dome .  look up there .  you realize titan has a thick atmosphere that is mostly nitrogen at a temperature near its liquefying point .  you might have gotten us outside the dome  and then miss jones and i would have died a horrible death .         how could i have gotten you outside the dome .     norby shouted .     i sensed human beings  and i thought it was fargo .  there are no human beings outside the titan dome  so i wouldn   t have brought you there .  there are human beings inside the dome  and it   s not my fault one of them isn   t fargo .      he turned back to the transmit controls .  jeff blacked out again .      we   re here .     said albany .     space command .  thank goodness .  we   re safe .  norby  you rate a medal .         no  he doesn   t     said jeff angrily .     he rates a blaster shot in the bottom of his barrel .  those are not space command uniforms .         are you sure .     said albany .     well  look at them again .      two men approached them as if ready to attack .     down with the enemies of ing the incomparable .     they shouted as they rushed at them .      oh  no      said albany .     they   ve even taken over out here .      one of the men reached albany  but seemed to trip and went flying over her shoulder .   she looked pleased .     did you see that .     she asked .     it works .  they taught me judo and combat techniques during training  but i didn   t think i could really  oof       the other man reached her and threw an arm about her neck .   jeff rushed toward her .  in a strangled voice  albany said     no  let me handle him .  get the other one .      the first man was getting groggily to his feet .  jeff stepped back to let him rise  but norby kicked him in his rear end and he went down on his face .  norby then rose in the air  turned off his antigrav  and came down hard on the back of the ingrate  knocking his breath completely out of him .   albany  meanwhile  was swaying back and forth with the second ingrate  who was trying to tighten his grip on her .  in rapid succession  she dug her elbow into his solar plexus with a hard jab and stomped fiercely on his toes with her heavy police boot while smashing into his nose with the back of her head .  he let out a screech and let go .  albany seized his wrist  spun on her toe  and twisted his arm .  when he bent  she placed her hip under him  twisted harder  and sent him flying .  he hit his shoulder hard when he landed and lay groaning .      let   s get into the transmit before any others come     albany said .   as soon as they were safely inside the transmit with the door closed  norby extruded from within his barrel body a thin  flat metallic tape that spread out horizontally .  he pressed the tape against the wall .      ah     he said     i should have done this the first time .  it greatly intensifies my sensitivity and my powers of concentration .  it takes a great deal out of me  however  and i never know when i   ll get my next gulp of electricity .  if ever .         have you got fargo this time .     asked jeff anxiously .      yes .  definitely .  no mistake .      again jeff felt that queasy sensation  but he managed to retain consciousness this time .      this transmit is in better condition     norby said .     and now i think we   ll find fargo .      the doors opened  and norby said     in fact  i   m sure you   ll find fargo  because there he is .      jeff could see an enormous room draped with banners and lined on either side with armed men .  in the center was a platform  upon which rested what could only be a throne .  fargo  his arms folded across his chest  was sitting on the edge of the platform  and someone else  someone clothed in metal to such an extent that he looked very nearly a robot  sat on the throne .      here   s company  anyway     fargo said .     the beautiful albany jones  my resourceful brother  and his graceful barrel .  how did you find me anyway .  and why haven   t you brought an army with you .         silence .     roared the figure on the throne in a voice as metallic and rasping as a defective machine .      ing speaks .     said fargo sarcastically .     let all be silence  while i welcome the newcomers to the court of ing the innocent .  note the distortion of his voice  which is uneuphonious even when undistorted .  note the graceful aluminum of his costume  designed to cover an unattractive body  and the facial mask which serves to spare his audience a view of his face  which is deformed  or his feelings  which are disgraceful  and the       the man on the throne gestured  and a guard stepped up to fargo and lifted a weapon threateningly .      since ing fears words but is brave enough to attack an enemy when the odds are a hundred to one  i shall be quiet     said fargo .   albany and jeff marched up to fargo  jeff holding norby  who was  of course  tightly shut .   ing   s voice sounded again  harsh and repugnant .     we have here two brothers who  between them  know a great deal about the space academy and the fleet .  and what they know  i will know .     his voice took on the sound of contempt .     in addition     he rasped     we have a lady cop with a rich father who will help me take over earth  if he wants his little girl back in her present shape and form .  and i see something that looks like a barrel .  give it to me  jeff wells .      jeff held norby tighter and said nothing .      it won   t do you any good to hold it     said ing .     i am told it is a curious barrel with arms  when it wishes to have arms .  and legs too .  it is something i wish to examine .  hand it over  boy  or i   ll have it separated from you at your shoulders .      norby whispered through his hat     move closer to miss jones .      jeff cautiously stepped sideways until his elbow was against albany   s shoulder .      now both of us move toward fargo     norby whispered .     we   ve all got to be touching .         i   ll touch fargo     whispered albany .     but why .         i have an ingenious idea     said norby in his ordinary voice .     it talks .     said ing .     it is a robot and i want it .  i am emperor here  and i must be obeyed .         the history of emperors on earth has been a sad one     fargo said .   albany was leaning against fargo   s shoulder  and jeff against albany   s .      let me tell you about napoleon bon          keep quiet .     ing barked .     sergeant .  get me that robot .  kill the woman if any of them resist .      norby suddenly cried out .     the personal shields .     he tossed one to albany and one to fargo .  then he clung tightly to jeff and hummed a strange sound .              hyperspace        comet tails .     said norby .      where are we .     jeff asked as he stared at the strange castle on the hill facing them .  terraced gardens spilled down the hill  and directly ahead was an elegant marble castle in miniature .      what i did     norby said hurriedly     was to transfer fargo and albany outside the building .  that would give them a head start .  with their personal shields and albany   s knowledge of judo and fargo   s quick wit  you   re always telling me how bright he is  they ought to rally a counterattack          yes  yes     said jeff impatiently     but where are we .         well     said norby  his hat swiveling as he looked about     what i was trying to do was to get us to space command .  i memorized the coordinates mac gave me long ago  but maybe they weren   t right .         yes  yes     said jeff  still more impatiently .     where are we .         well     said norby     that   s the one little thing i don   t know .         you don   t know .     jeff looked about  despairing .  the surroundings were beautiful .  the sunlight was bright and warm .  there was a soothing rustle all about  but where on earth  or off earth  were they .     can   t you do anything right  norby .  you   re a poor excuse for a robot .         i try .  it isn   t always easy .     then norby said in a small voice     i wanted you to own me .  i see now that it was a great wrong .  you   re all mixed up with a robot that   s all mixed up .  i   ll try to get you home  jeff  and i   ll stay here  and you   ll be rid of me .  i   m sorry .         no     jeff said .     i don   t ever want to be rid of you .  it doesn   t matter how mixed up you are  i   ll just be mixed up along with you .     he reached for norby .     i wish you weren   t so hard     he said .     it   s difficult to hug you .         i don   t care     said norby .     hug me anyway .  i   m so glad you want to keep me .         just the same     said jeff     i wish we knew where we were .      at that moment something came out of the small castle .  it looked distinctly dinosaurish  except for its size     a miniature allosaurus .     said jeff uncertainly .  he stepped back .   the creature came up to his knee  it wasn   t even as tall as norby .  it was wearing what seemed to be a gold collar and  as it swished its tail  it emitted a series of variegated sounds .      is it talking or just making noises .     jeff asked  feeling an extreme urge to reach out and pat its reptilian head .      don   t you understand it .     norby asked .     i keep forgetting that you   re not a linguist .  it  or rather  she  says you   re cute .         i think she   s cute  too  but what   s a miniature dinosaur doing anywhere on earth .  and how is it that she talks .         i don   t think this is earth     norby said .      but you understand the language .  doesn   t that mean you ought to know where this is .         to tell the truth  jeff  i don   t know how i come to understand the language .  i didn   t know it was in my memory banks until i heard it .  and i don   t remember ever having been here before  unless  unless this is the place i dreamed about .         but what did you do to get here .     jeff was scarcely aware that the dinosaur was nuzzling his hand .  automatically  he began stroking her head .      i just shifted through hyperspace .  that   s why it   s so hard to get back .  i could always get you back through normal space  but .  .  .  .         you went through hyperspace without a transmit .     asked jeff in a half shout .   norby retreated a step .     is that illegal .         it   s impossible .  no one can do it .         i did it .         but that   s true hyperspatial travel .  how did you come to know how to do that .         i thought everyone knew how .         well  then  how do you do it .      norby thought awhile .  then he said     i know how to do it  but i don   t know how to do it .         that doesn   t make sense .     jeff was sitting on the grass  and the creature had her forepaws in his lap and her head resting on his shoulder .  she was making a sound like a soft    gruffle  gruffle  gruffle .     jeff was running his hand down her long neck  which had pointed projections all the way to the tip of her tail .      do you know how to raise your arm .     norby asked .      certainly .         do you know how to raise it .  can you explain exactly what it is you do to raise your arm .  what happens inside your arm that makes it go up .         i just decide to have my arm go up  and it does .         well  i just decide to jump through hyperspace  and i just do .  i can go anywhere in an instant .  but i don   t know how i do it .         but  norby  that makes you the most valuable creature in the solar system          oh  i know that .         i mean  you really are .  no one else knows how to go through hyperspace without transmits .  it would be the greatest discovery of the age if any human being could make it .     jeff began stroking the dinosaur faster and faster .     it was my ambition to make the discovery myself .  that   s why i wanted to go through the academy and learn all i could about hyperspatial theory .  it   s my dream to invent hypertravel some day .  now  with you to help me          i said i only know how to do it  nothing else .  is that why you want to be with me  jeff .  because i know how to hypertravel .         no .  i told you i was glad i was with you before you told me about it .  but now i   m twice as glad .     jeff was pulling the creature toward himself  yet he still wasn   t aware of it .     well then  if you came here  where are we .         but that   s the other thing  jeff .  i know how to do it  but i guess i don   t know how to aim right .  i intended to go to space command  and i miscalculated .  i don   t know where we are  and yet i know that creature   s language .      jeff looked down at the dinosaur and suddenly realized that she was softly licking his left ear with her warm  dry tongue .  he went over backward  and she tumbled out of his lap .  she got to her feet and unfurled the leathery ridges on each side of her back spines .      wings .     jeff choked .     she   s got wings .  she   s a pterodactyl or something .         nonsense     said norby .     any fool can see that she   s a dragon .         dragons are mythical beasts .         not here .         what makes you so sure .  you don   t even know where    here    is .         i think part of me knows  but i can   t tune in to it .  i   m sorry  jeff .  i   m so mixed up  i think i ought to be destroyed .         not before you get us back .  and even then  i won   t let anyone destroy you .  but get us back  norby .  it   s important .         don   t get mad  jeff  but i   m having a little trouble figuring out how .  i may have moved far out of the terran solar system .  if only i could remember where this was .  part of me seems to have been here before  or why would i dream of it .         you know .  .  . i   ll bet it   s the alien mechanisms mcgillicuddy used in you .  the alien thing  whatever it was  was once here  whenever that was  and you just snapped back to that place without really thinking .         in that case  hey .     norby went over sideways as the little dragon broke into a sudden run and pushed past him .  she ran into the small castle .   jeff helped norby up .      baby dragons never have manners     norby said .     i remember when      he paused .  then in a discouraged voice he said     no  i don   t remember .  for a minute  i was sure i had remembered remembering dragons  but i don   t .         you   re getting me confused again .         i can   t help it .  maybe we   ll be stuck here too long to be able to help fargo and albany defeat ing .         i   m hungry  norby .  maybe we can find some forms of life to eat .  but what about you .  you   ll never be able to plug into an electric socket here .  you   ll starve .  maybe that will inspire you to remember how to get back .          actually  i can   t starve .  electric sockets give me between meal snacks .  for the real thing i dip into hyperspace  and i can do that anywhere  anytime .  there   s unlimited energy in hyperspace .  you ought to try it .         i would  if i were able to     jeff said .     what   s hyperspace like .         it   s nothing .         that   s very helpful .         i mean it .  hyperspace is nothingness .  it isn   t space or time  so it has no up or down or when or where .  when i   m in it  i can sense a .  .  . well  sort of .  .  . i guess it   s a pattern that isn   t really there but is potentially there because that   s what the actual universe is  the pattern that   s sort of potentially there in hyperspace .  .  .  .         norby .         well  i didn   t say i could explain it .  i can   t .  all i know is that hyperspace is definitely potential  i mean  it   s potentially something  as if it   s got reserve energy that comes into use for creating a universe  that of course is actually part of itself .  .  .  .         you   re losing me again .  how is a universe created .         i think that a spot in hyperspace suddenly gains a where and a when .  how it   s done or happens is beyond even me  so of course it   s beyond everyone in the solar system  and even if i could explain it to you  you wouldn   t know how to understand it .         thanks for your high estimate of my intelligence .  all i really want to know is if you can figure out how to get back to our solar system .         certainly .  i just have to tune into the pattern in hyperspace and find out where to go .         then you   d better do it soon .  there   s a bigger dragon corning .         perhaps     norby said  as he backed closer to jeff     the little dragon   s mother wants to thank us for being nice to her baby .         don   t count on it     jeff said  snatching up norby .  there was no use running .  the dragon had long  strong legs  and wings as well .  she was only as high as jeff   s chin  but she had gleaming  pointed teeth in double rows  top and bottom .   she made the same kind of sounds the little dragon had made  only much louder .      what   s she saying .     whispered jeff .      she says we are aliens and we might have to be taken to the grand dragonship unless she can teach us to talk .         well  what are you waiting for  norby .  tell her you can talk .      norby delivered a rapid patter of sounds  and the dragon responded with similar sounds .      jeff     norby squawked     let   s leave right now .  that foul reptile insulted me .         what did she say .         she said i was simply a barrel and that i smelled of nails .         i suppose she   s right .  the barrel did once          don   t finish that sentence .  we   re going .         no  we   re not .  if we dash off somewhere  we   ll be lost twice as bad .  let   s listen to what she has to say .      but she said nothing more .  instead she plunged toward them  plucked norby out of jeff   s arms  and then bit jeff on the neck .  she licked her chops and wrinkled her snout as if she had tasted something bad .  then she placed norby carefully on the ground and went back to the castle .      help  norby .  i   ve been bitten by the dragon .  she   s probably rabid .  i   ve been bitten by a rabid dragon vampire .         not very deeply     norby said  examining jeff   s neck .     it   s just a scratch .  barely enough to draw blood .  i have a feeling there   s a reason for it .         i have a feeling i hurt .  and her reason is that she wanted to taste me .  next time she   ll make a meal of me .  do you want me to be eaten up by a dragon .  think  you dumb barrel .  get us back home .  get us anywhere .  i don   t care how lost we get .      my dear sir .  there is no need to agitate yourself .  whoever you are  there must be communication in order for there to be a meeting of minds .   jeff   s mouth fell open .  he swallowed noisily .     norby  i just heard a voice  in my mind .      in order to communicate with you  i had to taste your pattern since you do not understand vocal speech .      i tell you someone   s talking  norby .         it   s that abominably rude dragon mother  jeff .  do not condescend to answer her .      just wait until i disinfect myself and my child  for we touched you  and since you are an alien you are probably full of germs .      i am not full of germs     yelled jeff .     you are .  i   m sure i   ll get tetanus from your bite .  with all those teeth  you probably never use toothpaste .      no gentleman would say such a thing .  i use toothpaste and mouthwash  and so does my dear little daughter  zargl .  i think you had better leave .  no respectable jamyn would want you on this world .  i will place the hyperspatial coordinates of this world in the memory bank of your storage barrel     storage barrel .     cried norby .   and i will thank you to leave .      do you have the coordinates  norby .         yes  but i won   t use them .  not if they come from her .  not          norby  use them  or i will take you apart with my bare hands and mix you up so that you never get unmixed  .      the mother dragon appeared in the doorway of the castle  holding the baby in her arms .  she made shooing gestures with her wings .   away .  away .  you crude monster .      come on  norby .         all right  i   m trying .  but i think you are a crude monster to make such vicious threats against me when it was only half an hour ago you were saying you loved me .         i do love you  but that   s beside the point .  get going .         give me a chance .  if you start shouting and hurrying  i   ll just get mixed up .         must i tell you that you   re always mixed up .         all right .  i have the coordinates  and i know earth   s coordinates  and i   ll concentrate on your brother .  and now .  .  .  one .  .  . two  i hope it works  three .  .  .  .        they were skimming over manhattan island  and central park was a patch of green far below .   jeff held norby firmly under his arm and shouted     you   re too high up  norby .  farther down and not too fast .         you   ve got your hand over two of my eyes .  all i can see are clouds and blue sky .  okay  that   s better .  down we go .         there   s a crowd in the park     jeff said     and they   re surrounding the central park precinct house .  get down so we can see what   s happening .         what if we get within blaster range .     norby asked .      try not to .         that   s easy for you to say .  you   re not the one who   s flying .         come on  norby .  lower .      the crowd was milling about as if it didn   t know its own mind .  they had spilled over into the traverse  along which there was no traffic .   a group of ing   s men were outside the precinct house  blasters ready .  their leader was crying out     disperse  you rebels  disperse  or we   ll fill the park with your dead bodies .         do you suppose he   ll really do that .     norby asked .     i don   t know     jeff said .     if ing wins the day with too much bloodshed  he   ll create hatred for himself  and he must know that  so i think he   d like to take over painlessly .  still  if his men get desperate          well  they   re liable to  jeff  because there   s your brother and that woman policeman friend of his  and they   ve got personal shields on .      they could hear fargo   s voice shouting     forward  citizens  save our beloved island from ing   s ignominies .  follow me .      they didn   t follow .  they remained irresolute .  one man shouted     it   s easy for you to say     follow me     you   ve got a personal shield .  we don   t .         all right  then     shouted fargo .     watch us  and then join in .  come on  albany .  get their blasters .      the leading ingman shouted     take them alive .  ing will pay a heavy reward for those two .      they spread out .  fargo charged in  blocking an arm that was bringing down a blaster butt first  and then landed a heavy blow in his assailant   s solar plexus .  the ingman doubled up and lost interest in the fight for a while .   albany jones circled another ingman  making little    come on    gestures with her hands .  he charged  and she turned and bent  blocking the charge with her hip  seizing his wrist  and tumbling him over into another henchman .  both ingmen went sprawling .   norby cheered loudly .     that   s it     he shouted .     knock them all out .         there are too many of them     said jeff .     fargo and albany will be smothered after a while if the crowd doesn   t help them .  norby  take me over the park .  maybe the bird watchers are still around .          what good will they do .         i want their leader  miss higgins .  she struck me as a stalwart woman without fear  and that   s the combination we want .  come on  norby .  if we can   t find her  we   ll have to join fargo ourselves  and we won   t be enough  either .      they were flying over central park in zigzags  looking for the small group with a tweed clad woman in the lead .     what   s one crazy woman going to do  jeff .         i   m not sure  but i have a feeling she can help .  and she   s not crazy .  she   s enthusiastic .         is that they .         maybe .  get down lower  and let   s land on the other side of those trees .  i don   t want to panic them .      jeff and norby moved cautiously through the trees .     that   s the woman     said jeff .     miss higgins .  miss higgins .      miss higgins stopped and looked about .     yes  what is it .  has anyone seen the grackle .         it   s i  miss higgins .      miss higgins stared at jeff for a moment .     oh  yes     she said .     it   s the young man and his little brother .  we saw you at dawn  and here you are wanting to join our afternoon expedition .  how enthusiastic of you .         not quite  miss higgins     said jeff .     it   s ing and his ingrates .  they are trying to take over the park .         our park .  is that the noise we   ve been hearing .  it scared the birds and just about ruined the afternoon watching .         that   s the noise  i   m afraid .         well  how dare they .         perhaps you can stop them  miss higgins .  there   s a crowd of angry patriots  but they need a leader .         where are they .     cried miss higgins  waving her umbrella .     lead me to them .  bird watchers  wait here  and make note of any cardinals and blue jays you might see .  remember that cardinals are red and blue jays are blue .         we   re in a hurry  miss higgins     said jeff .     would you just hold my hand .      miss higgins blushed .     i suppose it would be all right .  you   re quite young .      jeff seized it  pulled her closer  put his arm about her waist  and said      all right  norby  full power upward .  you   re carrying two .      miss higgins let out a muffled scream .     really  young man .     and then she just gasped as she rose into the air .      back to the precinct     shouted jeff .     there   s still fighting going on .         it   s a beautiful view     said miss higgins .     this is really the way to do bird watching .  we can follow them as they fly .      jeff and albany were hemmed in  and the ingmen were very wary in their approach  but it seemed just a matter of time .  a few of the ingmen faced the crowd  holding them off with blasters .      get down  norby     said jeff .     and you  miss higgins  lead the crowd against those ingmen .         indeed i will     said miss higgins .     barbarians .         we   re coming  fargo     shouted jeff .   they landed .  miss higgins broke away quickly  and norby rolled toward the nearest ingman who promptly fell over him .  one of norby   s arms shot outward and seized the ingman   s blaster .  he flipped it to jeff  who seized it .   meanwhile miss higgins marched up to the crowd  brandishing her umbrella and shouting in a surprisingly loud voice     come on  you cowards .  are you going to stand there and let those villains seize your park .  central park was made for birdwatchers and for good people  and not for villains .  save your park if you have an ounce of manhood and womanhood in you .  are you going to let me do it all alone .  i   m one weak  nearly middle aged woman  and here i go .  who   ll follow me .  onward  higgins   s soldiers  marching for the right .      she charged forward  umbrella high  and norby suddenly shouted .     hurrah for miss higgins .      the crowd took it up  and soon there was a confused roar    hurrah for miss higgins .  hurrah for miss higgins .      the mass of people moved forward  and the ingmen instantly turned and made for the relative safety of the precinct house itself .  the crowd  wild with fury  followed .   jeff held back norby and kept him from following .     no  no .  things are all right without us now .  what we   ve got to do is get to space command .  can you do that if i give you the correct space coordinates .         sure .  right through hyperspace .         do you have the energy .         you bet .  i filled up on hyperspatial charge when we came through it from dragon land .         good .  and i must say that going through hyperspace is very pleasant .  i didn   t feel a thing .  it was like blinking  or like a hiccup allover your insides .         that   s because i have a built in hyperspatial shield     said norby .     didn   t i tell you old mac was a genius .  i guess that   s why i don   t need a transmit .  i am a transmit myself  and if you hold me tight  you come with me .         how did you know i   d come with you .         i just guessed you would .         what would have happened if you had guessed wrong .         it would have been pretty horrible for you  jeff  but you know i   m never wrong .         i know no such thing .         well  there   s no use talking to you when you   re that unreasonable .  give me the coordinates of space command .  okay  here we go .                 showdown        ouch .     said jeff .  this time he had landed on one side  still holding norby .  his right elbow hurt like mad .      where are we .     whispered norby  his eyes peering from between the barrel and the hat .     have i gotten us to the right place .         you have     said jeff  sitting up with a groan .      never fail norby  they call me .      jeff looked about and found himself in the midst of the highest officers in the space command  including admiral yobo  who looked as if he had been glaring and swearing for some time .   in back of jeff was the open door of space command   s transit station .      it   s working .     one of the officers cried  rushing past jeff into the transmit .      this boy must have come by transmit and rolled out just now     said another .     didn   t anyone see him .  with this kind of security  we could expect ing himself to appear among us .         i saw him arrive     said yobo in his rolling bass voice .     i think you    ii find that however cadet wells arrived  the transmit is again out of order .      again out of order  not still .  the admiral was careful not to describe exactly what he had seen or hint that arrival had not been by transmit .  a good man  thought jeff .  quick thinking and on the side of all decent cadets .      may i speak to you alone  admiral .     jeff asked .   yobo stroked his chin thoughtfully  then nodded at the others  an offhand gesture that had the clear force of a command .  the officers left .      my robot      jeff began .      you bought that robot with the money i gave you .  that was all you could get .     said the admiral .   norby stirred  but jeff punched the barrel from behind to keep him quiet .     it is a very good robot     jeff said     with a number of good and also exasperating abilities .  and he will teach me martian swahili in no time .  he is also a clever engineer and can fix the transmit .  ing and his ingrates have control of manhattan and          we know about that  cadet wells .  he   s issuing orders for total surrender and insists on being called    emperor .     my own feeling is that the transmit isn   t broken  but is under control from the other end .     yobo looked calmly at jeff .  then he said      and what do you say about that .         aren   t you going to do anything .     jeff asked .      i   m certainly not going to surrender     yobo said     but i have to be careful .  all of manhattan is hostage to ing  and other places on earth may fall to him  too  unless          unless what  sir .         unless your brother can do something .  he has been my close adviser in all this .  he suspected that ing would strike at manhattan first  and he has taken measures .         what measures .         we   ll have to see     said yobo calmly .     meanwhile  what is it you want to do .  anything besides fixing the unfixable transmit .         i guess my robot can   t really fix the transmit if ing   s blocked it .  may i consult norby  that   s my robot   s name  sir .         go ahead  cadet .      jeff bent over norby   s hat and asked in a whisper     what now .      norby   s answer was so soft that jeff couldn   t hear  so he bent closer until his nose touched norby   s hat .  his nose tingled and he stood up .     ow .      norby   s hand reached over to jeff   s leg and grabbed it hard .   i don   t want the admiral to hear .  i think i could gimmick a small ship  if he   ll give us one  and hyperjump us to earth .   jeff gulped .     norby .     he said faintly  feeling the tingle through his leg this time .   i think the dragon made you responsive to telepathy if i touch you .  get me a ship .      cadet wells .     said yobo .     are you sane .         most of the time  sir .  and norby is  too  some of the time .  what we want is a small ship  just large enough to hold me and norby .         why .         the idea is to move it past any security network ing may have  and then fit it into his headquarters .  i   ve been there  and i recognized it .  he had it all draped in flags  but i could tell it was the main waiting room of the old grand central station .  it had a museum smell about it  and i learned every inch of it when i used to visit it as a youngster .  i know the transmit coordinates of the station  or at least norby does because he memorizes transmit coordinates whenever he   s been anywhere .  .  .  .         cadet  you mean well     said yobo     but without a transmit it will take days to get to earth  and with a transmit you wouldn   t need a ship .  you don   t need a ship to make a trip to earth .  i   ve got the fleet itself ready to do it  but ing threatens to blow up manhattan if i as much as move a ship .         that   s just bluff .         you   re sure of that .  you   d risk earth   s most renowned relic of ancient days  its most famous center of population  on your certainty .         the fleet would be noticed if it made a move  but one ship  one small ship      .      nonsense .  it would be noticed  too .  you should understand the efficiency of space detection  cadet .  you   ve been in the academy long enough for that .         please  admiral     said jeff .     trust me .  my robot is very good with machinery  and perhaps he can speed up one of your small ships and arrange to have it deflect the spy beams and move it right into the grand central waiting room .         you   re suggesting an impossibility     said yobo     unless .  .  .  .     he stared hard at norby .  then he added     unless this  uh  barrel you clutch so tightly is by way of being a sorcerer .  what about my private cruiser .  would that be small enough .         how small is it .         small enough to hold just me  although you and your robot barrel can squeeze in if you don   t mind sleeping on the floor .         why would we have to sleep on the floor  sir .         because you can    t have my private cruiser without me on it  and i sleep in the one bed .  that   s the privilege of rank  cadet .         take you  sir .     jeff leaned over norby   s hat and whispered     can you move the admiral along with the ship and us .      norby squeaked     no .  look at the size of him .      yobo heard that and smiled .     i   m not exactly stunted  but i am not going to sit here helpless .  i   ve had enough of this whole thing .  if you can get a ship into grand central station  cadet  i want to be with it .  if anything happens to me  there are several good men  in their own estimation  if in no one else   s  any one of whom could succeed me at once .      jeff said promptly     norby  you can do it .  don   t let me hear any negatives .  admiral  you can come  but let me be in temporary command .         cadet wells     said yobo with a grim smile     you are more like your brother than i would have imagined .  but before we make a move  you   re going to tell me exactly how you expect to move the ship to earth .  any ordinary movement and we   ll be lost  and you know it .      jeff thought awhile .     admiral     he said     will you give me your word that what i am about to say will be held in strictest confidence .         that   s an impertinent request     yobo said .     any information you have that is of importance to system security should be delivered at once and without restrictions .  what do you mean    strictest confidence .      jeff said miserably     well  sir  norby can move us through hyperspace without a transmit .         indeed .  i rather suspected you had something like that in mind  since nothing else would accomplish what you plan to do .  and how does norby bring about this impossibility .         i don   t know .  and he doesn   t  either .         after this is over  shouldn   t he be taken apart so that we can find out the secret of hyperspatial travel .      norby squawked .     jeff  have nothing to do with this oversize monster .  he   s as bad as that dragon .         what dragon .     asked yobo .      just a mythical monster  sir .  but that   s why i want the information held confidential .  if it   s found out  all the scientists would want to take him apart  and they still might not find out  and then we might not be able to put him together again  and we would end up with nothing .         we would kill the goose that lays the golden eggs     whispered norby angrily .     tell him that  jeff .  only make it a more intelligent bird .       jeff nudged norby into silence .     as it is  admiral  norby would make an important secret weapon for the federation .  he has all sorts of powers that he can handle with perfect ease  almost .         very well  but why aren   t we taking a squadron of armed men and a battle cruiser  then .         well  admiral  norby   s powers are  for the moment  somewhat limited .      the admiral laughed .     you mean he   s a small robot and can only handle small things .         you are not a small thing  you overgrown human  you .     shouted norby .   the admiral laughed again .     i suppose i   m not .  but let   s go ahead  you undergrown barrel  you .  i   ll have my personal cruiser made ready .      an hour later they were on the cruiser  and norby had plugged himself into the ship   s engine .     i don   t promise i can make this work     he grumbled .     getting an entire ship with me through hyperspace is no small task .         you can do it  norby     jeff said .      me .  an undergrown barrel .         yes  you .  an ancient  intelligent  very brave  and powerful robot     said jeff .      and if you don   t  i will take out your works and fill your barrel with peanut butter  rancid peanut butter  so that the dragon mother won   t notice the nail smell anymore .        the jump through hyperspace was not quite perfect .      we   re not inside grand central     said jeff .      well  there it is  right ahead     norby said indignantly .     you have to allow for a little slippage .  ask any engineer .         this will do fine     said the admiral .     we just require a tiny normal space correction .      two seconds later  the admiral   s personal cruiser was hovering on an antigrav beam in the air above ing   s throne .  the ship was draped in flags  and a window behind it was smashed .      brilliant  admiral     said jeff .     brilliant .      norby groaned .     it was my hyperspatial jump  and it   s my antigrav beam .  i   m the one who   s brilliant  only i don   t know how long i can hold the ship up .  my insides feel as if they   re caving in .      let the admiral get some credit  norby  jeff said telepathically .  rank has its privileges .      now hear this .     the admiral   s bass voice rolled out across the vastness of the room .  ing himself  his mask still in place  was standing next to his throne looking up at the ship .  he made no sound .  his soldiers stood as if in a trance  stunned by the appearance of the ship .      we have all of you under our guns     said admiral yobo  touching a button so that at least one gun extruded from the hull and aimed itself directly at ing .     put down your weapons and surrender .  there will be no solar empire and no emperor .      the ship settled slowly upon the throne  smashing it .  jeff heaved a sigh of relief .   ing ran for the transmit .      stop him .     jeff cried .      we don   t want to kill him     the admiral said     or they   ll make a heroic martyr out of him .  let   s see  now  i might be able to destroy the transmit  but that might          let me out  jeff     said norby .     i   ll do it .      the admiral  coming to an instant decision  touched another button  and a panel opened .     get him  little robot .     he cried .   norby hurtled out and aimed himself at ing  but the transmit doors were opening and ing was almost there .   out of the transmit stepped fargo  albany  and a band of armed manhattan policemen .     greetings  emperor     fargo said with composure .     we were about to depose you  but i see from norby here that my younger brother must have arrived with the same notion in mind .  you can   t beat the wells brothers .      fargo     came the booming and unmistakable voice of admiral yobo     what happened .  report .         admiral .  you   re here  too .  well  it was simple .  we were imprisoned here  but albany and i got out  thanks to norby  and after that things worked out exactly as i had hoped .  the population of manhattan was rising in revolt .  it may be small  but the people of this island are very patriotic .  i attacked the central park precinct house and took it  aided by some clever martial arts on the part of this beautiful policewoman  albany jones  whom i expect will be promoted as a result .         we were also helped by a woman who said she was a birdwatcher     albany said .     the woman  a miss higgins  said she didn   t care what happened to the rest of the universe  but that central park belonged to the people .  she led the crowd against ing   s ignominies and personally incapacitated at least seven ingrates before i lost count .         we liberated and armed a number of policemen and then proceeded to take over other areas     fargo continued .      at this moment any part of manhattan not under our control is rapidly coming under it .  and as for you  ing the inglorious  i suspect you will shortly have a large headache .      ing had been standing in stunned and helpless silence  while his men were raising their arms in surrender .  norby  who had been circling him  now lunged for his head  which he struck with a metallic clang .  ing went down hard and  as norby sat on him  the mask came off his face .   the admiral   s voice rang out in disgust .     i might have known     he bellowed .     ing the intriguer is fussbudget two gidlow .  i suspected it might be someone in security .  how else could a takeover be carried through with such precision .         gidlow knew you would suspect that     fargo said .     i think he tried to sell you the notion that i might be the traitor to turn you off the scent .         he almost succeeded     yobo admitted .     my apologies  mr .  wells .  i will make it up to you .  the contributions of you and cadet jefferson wells will not be forgotten .         how about norby .     shrieked norby  pounding his feet on gidlow ing   s chest .      nor will cadet norby be forgotten .         i   ll be a cadet .     norby cried out in delight .      honorary     the admiral said .      take this demon off me .     gidlow ing yelled .     you can   t kill me like this .  i demand a fair trial .         let   s give him a fair trial right now     norby said .   using his antigrav to lift him in the air  norby clamped his legs about ing   s neck and dragged the would be emperor to his feet .  norby swayed from side to side  forcing ing to waltz about on his skinny  silver covered legs .   the waiting room rocked with laughter .  even ing   s erstwhile henchmen joined in .  the police photographer eagerly ran his holographic camera  filming it all in moving three dimensional image .      ing   s revolution is over     the admiral said .     the men of the manhattan police force have done nobly .         if you   ll notice     albany said  sweetly but firmly     half the police force are women .         true  my dear     the admiral said  and bowed to her with admiring gallantry .     and so are half of the soldiers in my space command .  i was merely using an old fashioned figure of speech .  which reminds me that your uniform seems to be strategically tom  and i must compliment you on your figure .         admiral     said fargo     it is as nothing compared with what textile dissolvers can do  but all such compliments are reserved for me .         then i congratulate you  mr .  wells     said the admiral     on your good taste  in cops as well as brothers .                 full circle     after the revolt had been settled  there was a victory dinner in the admiral   s private quarters on the great revolving wheel of space command .   the admiral had been given a new decoration for his broad chest .  fargo had been rewarded with a grant of money that made him thoroughly safe from bankruptcy .  albany  who sat close beside him  very close  had been promoted to police lieutenant jones .  and jeff had been given a scholarship and a commendation  too  so that he could continue his studies as a space cadet .   norby sat in the seat next to jeff   s  with a large portfolio under his arm .  within the portfolio was the official piece of pseudo parchment that proclaimed to    all and sundry to whom this citation shall come to notice    that norby wells was hereby appointed to the rank of honorary cadet in the space command    with all the privileges and honors inseparable from that position .     norby had not yet found out what those privileges and honors were  but he was still asking .   jeff noted with satisfaction  for he was still a growing boy  that the food at the admiral   s table was considerably better than the food at the cadets    table .  norby had an extension cord leading into the nearest electric plug  and he was gorging himself to repletion  though  as he remarked later  the admiral   s electricity tasted no better than anyone else   s .      i guess the kitchen computer is working now  eh  admiral .     jeff said .      perfectly     said the admiral with great satisfaction .      you can thank norby for that     jeff said .     he   s very good with computers .         when i fix them     norby said     they work like poetry in motion .         good     said the admiral .     but  fargo  what was that remark you made to your brother the day he ruined the computer  tgaf .          it stood for    the game   s a foot .     it was my way of telling him that he and i were going to try to find ing .  i didn   t know he was right there with you .  one thing  though  admiral .  .  .  .         yes .         confining ing to an asteroid prison doesn   t seem enough .  security is notoriously lax in the asteroids  and he may get out .         what if he does .     the admiral said indifferently .     everyone   s laughing at him .  the quickness with which his attempted revolt collapsed and the holographic images of his final dance with norby on top of him have reduced him to a figure of fun .  the film has been shown throughout the solar system .  he could do nothing at all now  even if he were released .         i don   t know about that     jeff said darkly .   a junior officer  looking uneasy  rushed into the room .     admiral  .         yes  ensign .         the main computer of space command has just started reciting poetry .  all the messages come out in verse  including the recipes from your private kitchen computer  which is now too addled to get the robot cooks to perform properly .      the admiral rose from his chair .  putting his napkin gently beside his place  he asked     my kitchen computer .         yes  sir .  the remainder of this meal will be delayed .      the admiral roared     norby .      there was no response .      norby .     jeff shouted  banging on norby   s head .   norby said in a low  snuffling voice     i told the computers to work like poetry in motion .  maybe they took me literally .  computers are very stupid .       the admiral roared     i demand that this barrel          cadet barrel     said norby in a whisper .       .  .  . be thrown in irons .         please  admiral     said jeff     he   ll fix it in a jiffy .         i give him fifteen minutes .         norby  get rid of the extension and get to work .         oh  all right  but it   s the fault of the computers .         and of a very mixed up robot     jeff said .  he looked up defiantly at the rest of the company .     but my very mixed up robot  and no one else can touch him .  not even you  admiral .          norby   s  other  secret      to the beautiful younger generation  patti  leslie  nanette  robyn             danger     jefferson wells sat in front of the main computer screen  trying to keep his mind on earth history .      hey  norby     he called out     i hope you   re fixing the kitchen computer without making things worse .  albany jones and my brother  fargo  will be here soon and i don   t want to leave the roman republic again just because the chicken has to be basted .      no one answered .      norby .     jeff made it to the kitchen in a fast stride  his legs were long for a fourteen year old  and found no one fixing the computer or attending to the cooking .   jeff shook his head .  he knew lots of people with personal robots  but he was the only one blessed with a mixed up robot .  he basted the chicken in a hurry  muttering to himself .  then he hastened back through the living room and into the bedroom .   there  in front of the other terminal of the main computer was norby  his back eyes firmly shut .  jeff could tell from the dim reflection in the computer screen that norby   s second pair of eyes were open on the other side of his head .  those eyes were staring at words that moved down the screen almost rapidly enough to blur  for norby could read faster than most people could think .  this was especially true when he closed one pair of eyes in order to concentrate entirely with the other pair .   norby   s body  a metal barrel about sixty centimeters high  teetered back and forth on his fully extended legs  the feet of which were symmetrical fore and back .  his multi joined arms  just as fully extended  had hands that also faced both ways .  one of those hands remained pressed dramatically to his barrel torso .  the other flung itself away suddenly  in a gesture common among politicians and actors .      friends  romans  countrymen     intoned norby in a voice a little too deep to be natural to him  the words sounding through a hidden speaker in his unremovable domed hat .  norby always talked through his hat  which lifted only far enough to show his four remarkably human eyes .  he proceeded to raise his outstretched arm and point at the computer terminal as if it were an audience .      lend me your ears  i come to bury caesar  not to praise him .  .  .  .         i   ll bury you .     jeff said     if you don   t fix the kitchen computer in a hurry .      norby opened his back eyelids and blinked at jeff .     it   s such a boring machine  jeff .  it doesn   t know any shakespeare .         i think that means you haven   t figured out how to repair it yet .         and it doesn   t like me .  it thinks i   m alien .         the kitchen computer has no feelings and practically no brains .  there   s no use bragging to it about how your first owner put alien parts in you .         oh     said norby .     then don   t you think i should avoid associating with inferior machines .  don   t you think i should improve the quality of my mental data bank by studying .      jeff groaned .     you could at least study real history .  all you do is indulge yourself in shakespeare or try to remember how to get to whatever alien planet your alien parts came from .         well  you won   t find it .  you humans haven   t even settled beyond your own solar system  and you haven   t developed telepathy .  .  .  .         great galaxy .  what   s the use of you being able to communicate with me telepathically if you   re not going to use it to help me learn history quicker .     jeff stomped back to the kitchen and set about mashing the potatoes  a job the kitchen computer was supposed to do .   norby pattered after jeff  his telescopic legs almost completely withdrawn so that he seemed very small and humble .     you don   t seem grateful that i succeeded in helping you pass the martian swahili exam .         right now i need help with history     said jeff  thumping the bowl so hard that a bit of unmashed potato flew up and hit him on the nose .  exasperated  jeff rolled his eyes upward and saw that more potato was stuck on the ceiling .     for a supposed teaching robot  you probably haven   t learned one bit of history yourself .         i have too .  i   ll prove it to you .      jeff never had a chance to ask norby what he meant  because at that moment the door speaker buzzed to attract attention .  then it announced     cadet wells  admiral yobo is here to see you .         he   s here  on earth .  to see  me .  let him in .      jeff dashed into the living room  forgetting the large plastic apron he had tied around his waist .  norby  retracting his legs all the way inside his barrel  made use of his personal antigrav to sail through the air beside him .   jeff   s legs tangled with a scatter rug and he sat down abruptly  while norby hovered over his head and made an odd sound .      are you laughing at me .     jeff asked through clenched teeth .      that   s an interesting question     said norby .     let me see if the facts correlate .  number one  i do have emotive circuits  and number two  you do look rather funny .  .  .         that   s enough     said jeff  scrambling to his feet .     robots manufactured in this solar system do not have emotive circuits or a perverted sense of humor .  i order you to go into the bedroom  and don   t come out until you   ve learned history  or how to cook .      norby shut his back eyes at jeff  went into the bedroom  and slammed the door shut .      hello  admiral     jeff said as he opened the door to the hall .     welcome to my apartment .      boris yobo was big and his enormous black hand engulfed jeff   s in a hearty shake that seemed to loosen jeff   s shoulder from his body .      cadet     he rumbled     where   s that brother of yours .  i haven   t been able to reach him .     yobo took off a plain civilian coat to reveal a splendid uniform  weighed down with solid rows of medals  most of which could be worn only by the head of the federation   s space command .   jeff was sure that admiral yobo was not in the habit of paying calls on space academy cadets  not even orphaned ones  nor even on their older brothers who happened to work as agents for the space command .  especially unannounced calls .     fargo should be here soon for dinner  admiral .      yobo sniffed .     whatever it is  it smells good after the synthomeals they   ve been feeding me at the meetings i   ve been attending .  if we continue to eat those meals we   ll never work out ways of controlling this new batch of pirates plundering the solar system .  in fact  i   d be tempted to join them myself .      he sniffed again .     your earth food doesn   t have quite the tang of the stuff we grow under domes in the mars colony .  personally  i don   t think you earth people know how to season properly .  shall i demonstrate .         it   s almost done  sir     jeff said     so it   s too late for improvements .     admiral yobo was known for his exotic gourmet taste in food  and once a dish suited his fancy  it was inedible to anyone else .     would it be all right for me to know why you are here .         smells like roast chicken .         and left over meatloaf .  albany jones is coming  too .         you can have the meatloaf  but the chicken would suit me well .  i suppose  cadet  you want to know why i didn   t phone first .      yobo sat on the couch heavily and didn   t wait for jeff to reply .     for all i know     he said     your phone is tapped by spies from the inventors union .  they   re a difficult  proud and powerful group  and they   re determined to get the secret of miniaturized antigravity devices like norby   s .  that   s why i   ve come here secretly to warn you that the inventors union may try to kidnap your robot .  maybe soon .         no .     said jeff .     they   ll want to take norby apart .  i   m not going to let them .      yobo said     the inventors union is working around the clock to discover how to make miniantigrav units  and they   re getting impatient .  so are some others .  everyone   s tired of antigrav units so big that only a six person vehicle can accommodate them .  even i   m tired of them .  now either that old  mad spacer  mcgillicuddy  invented miniantigrav  or he found it on an alien spaceship that nobody else can find and used it when he constructed norby .  since mcgillicuddy   s been dead for years  there   s only norby left to work with .  you know  jeff  i   m fond of norby  but surely you understand that the needs of the federation .  .  .  .         norby doesn   t know how he does it  admiral  and he doesn   t remember an alien ship .         he doesn   t have to know or remember .  my scientists at the space command could analyze his workings down to subatomic levels .  .  .  .         no       said jeff .     no sir .  i won   t allow it .  norby is my property .     he shoved both hands through his curly brown hair .     the phone rang with the family call signal .   relieved at the interruption  jeff said     wells answering .      the screen lit up to show farley gordon wells  twenty four years old  athletically wiry  a little taller than jeff  his eyes blue  his hair wavy and dark .  behind fargo was a strikingly attractive girl in a manhattan police uniform .  she was beautiful  and she looked happy in a way  it seemed to jeff  that most women looked when they were around fargo .      hello  kid monster     said fargo .     i   m still at the precinct .  i   m afraid i   ll be late .         hello  geriatrics case     said jeff .     you always are .         albany   s fault .  her professional responsibilities required her to foil a holdup with some high powered karate  which made it necessary for her to change uniforms and .  .  .  .     fargo   s eyebrows suddenly elevated .     is that admiral yobo behind you .  what have i done .         probably a great deal     said yobo     but nothing i   m aware of at the moment .  this is a social call .  space home life gets boring  even in a spome as big as space command .  don   t you remember my suggesting dinner when i was in new york for meetings .      fargo   s eyebrows came down and closed together     is this the week you   re having meetings in manhattan .  when i   m in love .         just for this week .     asked albany  her beautiful eyes crinkling .      bring some tgaf candy with you when you come  fargo     said jeff .      sure     said fargo  with a grin .     you   d better start dinner without us  though i won   t be expecting too much left over with the admiral there .      the phone shut off .      tgaf     said jeff     is our private family code .  it stands for    the game   s a foot    .  it means trouble so fargo understands that you   re here on business  not a social call .      yobo sighed  and sat down at the table .     i know that private family code of yours .  i wish you had one that indicates big trouble  because your romantic brother believes he can always talk himself out of danger  and we may need more than talk this time .         are we going to need weapons .     asked jeff .      i   m not sure  but we had better be ready .  i don   t know when or where  or even  if  the inventors union is likely to strike  but we   ve got to prepare for the worst .     the admiral stopped talking and sniffed .     you   re letting the chicken dry out     he said .      norby     called jeff     serve the chicken .      there was no answer and jeff flung open the bedroom door .     that crazy barrel has gone again .         taken off into hyperspace .     asked yobo .      he must have .  i hurt his feelings  or maybe he needed to refuel .  that   s where he does it .  what are we going to do .         about norby .  nothing .  the chicken comes first     said yobo  heading for the kitchen .   during dinner  jeff managed to make his way through half a drumstick with an almost total lack of appetite as he waited for norby to return .  finally he said     sir  i   m afraid that norby may have overheard you .  he   s a pretty brave robot  but he does have this prejudice against being taken apart  and he may have gone into hyperspace to save himself .  i can   t communicate with him when he   s there  and he   s supposed to tell me when he   s going .         indeed .     said yobo  who had already demolished his drumstick and a mountain of mashed potatoes and was slicing himself a helping of white meat .     since there   s nothing we can do about it  let   s finish dinner .  i   m sure he   ll come back because it will get lonely out there after a while .     admiral yobo attacked the chicken again .  between bites he said     but see here .  everyone knows about norby   s personal antigrav .  but only you and your brother and i know about norby   s secret ability to enter hyperspace with his built in hyperdrive mechanism .  if the greedy inventors union finds out about his hyperdrive  added to his miniantigrav  they   ll tear the solar system apart to get it .         fargo thinks norby   s ability to travel in hyperspace is related to his miniantigrav     jeff said .     so it   s all one secret talent of norby   s .         what fargo thinks doesn   t mean a thing .  the only way to keep the inventors union away from norby is to arrange to have my own scientists .  .  .  .         please  sir          cadet     thundered yobo     you know that eventually someone has to examine norby  and it might as well be my scientists .  he   s too valuable to be just the pet robot of a boy .      jeff stared at the admiral in horror .  he   s the enemy  too  he thought to himself .  what do i do .   there was no time to wonder if any answer to that question existed because at that moment there was a loud thump in the bedroom .      norby .     asked jeff  getting up from his chair .  he felt a wash of relief sweep over him at the thought that his robot might be back .  yet a feeling of fear came almost immediately afterward at the thought of what yobo might do .   following the thump  however  there was a more complicated noise  a very strange one .  strange  that is  to be heard in an apartment in the sovereign nation of manhattan  usa sector of the terran federation .      jeff  that was a rather disturbing growl     yobo said .     have you got an animal in there .  it sounded like a large one .         not that i know of  sir .  .  . norby .      a small barrel shot out of the bedroom into jeff   s outstretched arms .  norby   s hat tilted back and a pair of wide open eyes looked up .      it   s not my fault .     said norby .   jeff   s lips tightened .  norby said that frequently  and usually  it wasn   t true .   something followed norby into the living room .  it was sand colored .  it looked hungry .  and it had the beginnings of a mane .      space and time .     said yobo  in a husky whisper     it   s a lion .  i   ve been meaning to get around to visiting the africa of my ancestors  but i have no great desire to have this portion of it visit me .         norby  what have you done .     jeff asked  scarcely able to force the words out .   the lion advanced slowly into the room .              getting away        it   s only a small lion     said norby plaintively .     just a cub .         a cub  my foot .     said jeff  who was clutching norby and backing toward the kitchen door .     it   s almost full grown and you know it .  where did you get it .         in a sort of zoo     said norby .     it jumped on me and came with me when i went into hyperspace to get home .  it wasn   t my fault .  it followed me .      admiral yobo grunted and stood up .  slowly  majestically  he picked up the chair on which he had been sitting and held it in front of him  the legs pointing at the advancing lion .  he moved around the table until he was standing in front of jeff  shielding him .   the lion roared  and yobo brandished the chair menacingly .  the lion snarled and lifted one broad paw .   norby   s hat slammed down until his head had disappeared inside the barrel .  his arms and legs sucked inward as well  so that only the metal barrel remained in view .      coward     muttered jeff  but he might have been talking to himself .  he was ashamed that he was not defending his own admiral as a space cadet should  instead of vice versa .   the lion   s uplifted paw showed its claws as he hit out at the chair leg .      get back  you fatuous feline     shouted yobo  stamping his foot as he pushed the chair forward .      what zoo .     jeff asked norby as the lion began to alternately growl and roar .      not a nice one     came the words through the hat .     very bad .         i can see that     said jeff .     the lion looks underfed .         cadet .     roared yobo  louder and deeper than the lion .     stop practicing the fine art of conversation by making diagnostic comments .  do something .  get into the kitchen and send for help .  my ancestors might have battled lions  but not while wearing dress uniforms .  i don   t plan to get down to hand to paw wrestling with this beast .  it looks as though it might have fleas .      the lion sprang and yobo met it with the chair and forced it back .  it snarled again and the muscles in its haunches bunched as if it were about to spring again  possibly over the chair .   jeff put norby down and ran to the table .  the lion  possibly surprised at the sudden movement  stopped snarling at the admiral and turned its menacing yellow eyes on jeff  who snatched up what was left of the roast chicken and threw it at the lion .      a dubious accomplishment     said yobo  as the lion retreated to a corner and began to devour the chicken  bones and all .     you   ve bought a little time  at the cost of feeding my dinner to that underfed  oversized cat .  now get to the phone and .  .  .  .      the door speaker interrupted .     fargo and albany are here     it announced .   since fargo   s thumbprints were keyed to the lock  jeff didn   t have to let him in .   as she entered the apartment  albany gasped  reached automatically for her gun  and stopped the motion midway .     drat .  no gun     she said turning to fargo     well  you loquacious lout  you   re the one who tells me it isn   t dainty to wear a gun on a date .  you say smooth talk is all one needs .  well  smooth talk that oversized tomcat .      fargo   s eyes had lit up when he saw the lion .  they always did at the sight of danger .  but then they fell .     is that my dinner that lion is eating  after i   ve saved up an appetite just for the occasion .         it   s my dinner the lion is eating     said yobo  still holding the chair in the direction of the animal .     i came here to explain to jeff that the inventors union appears to be planning to confiscate norby as an alien device possessing great technological secrets  and norby seems to have retaliated by bringing us a wild pet from a bad zoo .         jeff always wanted a kitten     said fargo     but this is ridiculous .  that lion has finished the chicken and i   m pretty sure he considers it only an appetizer with ourselves as the main course .      the lion gave a cursory lick to its paws  licked its lips on either side with a huge  pink tongue  and then growled .  it eyed the four human beings with what seemed to be unsatisfied hunger and aggressive ideas .  it rose to its feet and snarled .   jeff said     fargo  do we still have those sedative pills you bought when the family shipping business went bankrupt and you thought you wouldn   t sleep well .  you never took them  but maybe the lion .  .  .  .      fargo lifted his finger .     good idea .  they should still be in the kitchen behind the matchbox we never used till you got a pet robot that plays with kitchen computers .      jeff kicked norby .     stick out your head and legs and go find those pills or i   ll tell the admiral to take away your honorary cadethood .         you wouldn   t     said norby .      oh  wouldn   t i .  try me  and bring the meatloaf  too .      norby   s appendages and head popped out of his barrel and he ran into the kitchen in the kind of partial antigrav mode that allowed him to take long strides .  he came back almost at once with the pills and with the meatloaf in its glass container .   jeff stuffed the pills into the meatloaf while yobo made small lunges with the chair legs at the advancing lion  who growled louder .  albany was speaking softly into her wrist phone .   she said     the central park greater zoo says it has no room for another lion and it   s against the law for us to have one in an apartment in the first place .  we could get into a lot of trouble .         the lion   s been telling us that for quite a while     said yobo  shoving the lion back a step .      the bronx zoo will take one  if we can present a certificate of ownership .  i don   t suppose jeff has one     she finished .      not lately     said jeff  swinging the meatloaf .      but i   ve called for an antigrav squad car to come up to the windows here .         better than nothing     said jeff  and let go of the meatloaf  which hit the lion in the muzzle .   fargo said indignantly     must i start my vacation by letting you throw the only other dinner we possess to the lions .      yobo said     that doesn   t matter .  i don   t eat red meat .  cadet  did you put the sedative pills into that meatloaf .         all of them  admiral     said jeff .      good .  then it shouldn   t be long .      yobo sat down and began to eat vegetables while the lion finished the meatloaf .     vegetarianism is good for you     he announced .     have some .         have some what  honored admiral .     asked fargo  with exaggerated politeness .     you   re eating it all .  besides  i don   t believe that the lion will be put to sleep .  those were pretty old pills and i never tested them .         there   s the squad car     said albany .     fully automated .  nobody in the precinct was keen on riding with a lion .       the lion yawned  displaying all of its large  efficient looking teeth .   four humans  an automated police car  and a guilty robot waited impatiently for the lion to decide to go to sleep .      i   m sorry  jeff     said norby after awhile .     i suppose it is my fault .  i got mixed up .         that   s apparently his specialty  little brother     said fargo .     when mcgillicuddy mixed up his insides  he mixed up norby .     fargo turned to the robot .     how did you come to think it was a good idea to bring a lion home from the zoo  norby .         it jumped on me  fargo  and tossed me around as if i were a beach ball .  then it took a grip on me with its paws and i thought that if i went back into hyperspace that would scare it loose  but it didn   t .  it was too stupid to be scared and it must have held on to me because when i was back in the apartment  it was here  too .         but where was this zoo  and why did you go there .     asked fargo .      it   s a long story     said norby .   the robot turned to jeff  who came to his defense immediately .     he   s too upset to explain clearly  fargo .  it was just some zoo in europe or somewhere .         in europe     said norby at once .     that   s right .      the lion   s head sank to its paws .  it snored loudly and distracted fargo  who shook both fists in the air and said     see .  you don   t need a gun  just a few pills .         and someone to think of the pills     grumbled jeff under his breath .   yobo had finished the vegetables and began on the large cake jeff had bought for dessert .     i trust  cadet  that you will think of a way to get the beast over to the police car  because i do not intend to help lift it .  i   m wearing my dress uniform and i   m convinced that animal has fleas .      albany marched toward the lion with a determined look on her face  but fargo stopped her .  he said     you have your dress uniform on  too  and that beast must weigh     kilograms .  it   s a man   s job .  jeff and i .  .  .  .      albany was promptly offended .     what do you mean    a man   s job .     i   m as strong as you are  and jeff is a boy .         jeff may be a boy     jeff said     but he believes in thinking out a problem and not just slam banging into it .  that   s what fargo always said i should do .  so it   s up to norby .         i don   t want to pick him up     norby said .      i don   t care whether you want to or not .  you just follow orders .  put your arms under that lion and intensify your antigrav and put him into the police car .         but jeff  the lion is smelly and it has fleas .         fleas aren   t going to bother you  and i never heard you complain about smells before .         it may be sleeping lightly .  it may wake up .         norby  all this is your fault in the first place  and you   re the one who   s equipped to deal with the problem .  i   m giving you a logical order  and i order you to obey it .         oh  very well     said norby  going to the lion .      i   ll never get used to your robot     said yobo .     there isn   t another one like it in the federation .         you mean sassy and rebellious .     asked fargo .      i mean intelligent and emotional     said yobo .  there was no smile on his broad  high cheek boned face .     it   s amazing that only the inventors union is after him .  we should all be .  i imagine that if we can find out how he works  everyone will want a norby instead of the stupid  dutiful machines the federation allows .         nobody would want a mixed up robot     said fargo with a shrug .      i don   t know about that     said albany .     i think he   s cute .      norby winked one of his back eyes at her  wrapped his arms around the lion  and elevated .  the lion opened one eye  growled  and began to struggle .      hold him .     shouted jeff  running to help .      i   m managing     said norby .     you wanted me to do it myself and i   m going to do it .  i   ll show you .  .  .  .     he was balancing the sleepily struggling lion on the window sill .     this stupid life form is scratching my barrel .          don   t drop him to the sidewalk .     yelled jeff .     stupid or not  it is a life form .  put him in the car safely .         all done     said norby  stepping back from the window .  the door of the police car shut  and jeff could see the astonished and groggy lion inside .   albany spoke into her wrist radio and the car flew off .     okay .  the car will take the lion to the bronx zoo  where keepers are ready to take it into temporary custody pending determination of ownership .         are we going to get fined .     asked jeff .      not likely     said albany .     they haven   t forgotten how we rescued manhattan from ing the ingrate  so it will be easy to fix things up .  besides  the admiral can use his influence .         no  i won   t     said yobo .     you leave me out of your report .  i don   t want your manhattan authorities to know i   m here .  my problem is with norby  not with the lion .      norby jiggled up and down on his legs .     i   m jeff   s problem  no one else   s .      unfortunately     said yobo .     you   re everyone   s problem .  the inventors union wants to investigate you scientifically .         you mean  tear me apart .     squeaked norby at the highest pitch of his voice range .     eviscerate my insides .  tangle my circuits .  electrocute my electronics .  spoil my beautiful appearance .  i   ll disappear and never come back  that   s what i   ll do .         no  you won   t     said jeff     because i   m not going to let anyone do anything to you .         it   s a family matter     said fargo .     i   m jeff   s guardian and legally responsible for anything he owns .  we   ll sue .  .  .  .         don   t bet on getting the chance     said yobo  drily .     i think it would make sense to have a serious discussion on how to handle the obvious necessity of doing something about norby .         i   m hungry     said albany  tossing back her long  blond hair .      unfortunately     said fargo     there   s nothing to eat .  what the lion didn   t devour  the admiral did  so we   ll have to go to one of the neighborhood restaurants .  if you   ll cover up that uniform of yours  admiral  you can come disguised as an ordinary citizen .  if we can get a shielded booth  we can talk privately there  out of reach of the inventors union .      the admiral had no chance to respond because there was a thunderous knocking on the apartment door and a loud call that drowned out any announcement the door computer might have tried to make .      open up .  federation security officers .      fargo went to the door and leaned nonchalantly against it .     my lady love and i are here and we don   t want company .  go away .         we have a federation warrant to confiscate your robot on behalf of the inventors union .  open up  or we   ll break down the door .      there was another violent knock .      go to the bedroom     whispered yobo to jeff     and i suggest you both go on a little trip now .  .  .      yes  sir     said jeff .  he added quickly     if i don   t get back right away  fargo  please go on vacation in our scoutship .  we can join you because norby can tune into your ship with his space location sense .         sure i can     said norby .  there was a short pause while norby   s eyes blinked .     i think .         we   ll be sunk if we have to depend on norby     fargo said .   norby squawked incoherently at that  but the admiral pointed imperiously toward the bedroom as the banging on the door grew more forceful .   jeff and norby dashed into the bedroom .  norby grabbed jeff   s hand     ready .      jeff nodded .  he was thinking .  it   s a good thing they don   t know norby   s secret that he can vanish into hyperspace without special equipment  or they wouldn   t have announced what they were here for .   just before they disappeared  jeff and norby heard albany say     oh  hello  men .  do have this small left over piece of cake .      the grayness of hyperspace swallowed jeff and norby .              jamya     norby   s personal protective field came on automatically to save them from lethal stress of hyperspace  so jeff was aware only of gray nothingness .  and  since time does not exist in hyperspace  he was no sooner aware of it when he was out of it again  with only a vague memory that norby had been trying to explain  telepathically  how he had got into the bad zoo .      where are we .     asked jeff .  they were sitting on a grassy lawn  facing interesting treelike plants that seemed familiar .      you again .      the voice was not speaking in terran basic  but jeff understood  and norby was already answering in the alien language .  nobody had the advantage of having eyes in the back of his head  except there wasn   t any real back to his head  all sides were front  .   jeff turned around .  in the other direction was a landscaped hill with a large castlelike structure on it .  at the foot of the hill  quite near to jeff  was a miniature castle with a female dragon standing in the doorway .  she was green  her large eyes fringed by eyelashes  and she held a smaller version of herself .  both wore thin gold collars .   jeff said softly     you   ve brought us back to jamya  norby .  i thought you didn   t know how to get here .         i don   t     norby answered in a low voice .     it   s some instinct or something .  i just came .  part of me knows the planet of the dragons .         well  then  please don   t insult the jamyns this time .     he rose and bowed politely .     how do you do  ma   am .  and how is your pretty daughter  zargl  whom i see in your arms .         i   m fine     said the young dragon  as she spread her wings and flew to jeff   s shoulder .     i   m glad you came back .  you didn   t stay long last time .  i   m also glad you   ve learned our language .      jeff hoped his smile would seem a pleasant expression to the dragons .  a gentle dragon bite had established telepathic communication with him when he and norby had come here once before  and the bite had made it possible for him to learn the jamyn language telepathically  almost at once .  perhaps the dragons could learn terran basic through telepathy .      i detect your thought     said the mother dragon in terran basic .     if you speak your language carefully and think more clearly  then i will learn more quickly .     she switched to jamyn .     it is more important  however  for you to continue to improve your knowledge of our language  which is clearly the more civilized of the two .      jeff did not think it would be wise to dispute that .  he said     yes  ma   am     in careful jamyn .      i discussed your earlier arrival with the grand dragon  and she said you must know the secret of hyperspace travel  which we jamyn have never been given .  we were meant to stay on our own planet .         do you have many visitors .     jeff asked .      we have had none at all .  you were the first .  that   s why the matter had to be discussed .  it was decided that if visitors are approved by the mentors  they will be permitted to stay for a short period .  do you intend to remain .         do we intend to remain  norby .     asked jeff .      not exactly .     norby blinked several times in that exasperating way he had when he was debating whether or not to confess that he   d gotten mixed up again .     part of me seems to want to be here  and knows the way even though the rest of me doesn   t .  and i do know the language .  i just can   t quite remember what a mentor is .         in terran basic  it means    wise teacher        said jeff .      it means the same in jamyn     said the mother dragon .     they are our teachers .  we were once a wild and primitive species  but the others came and left mentors to help us  as our legends say  and  of course  our legends are inspired and therefore true .  by the way  you mustn   t think of me as mother dragon .  that is quite belittling .  my name is ziphyzggtmtizm .      jeff knew only so much could be expected of telepathic learning .     may i call you zi .     he asked .   ziphyzggtmtizm whispered it several times softly to herself  then said     yes .  i like it .         who are the others .         that is difficult to say .  there are no descriptions of them in our legends  and the mentors have never told us anything about them .  .  .  . zargl .  stop clawing at the alien   s top scales .  mind your manners .  besides all that long  soft tangle may not be clean .      zargl took her claws out of jeff   s hair and said     what   s your name  alien .         i   m jeff and this is my robot  norby .         odd     said zi .     robots are small devices for mechanical labor  controlled by household computers  and are without personality or intelligence .  naturally  they belong to thinking jamyns  as any machine might .  this norby that you call a robot  however  seems to have personality and intelligence .  how can he be owned .         that is a good question  come to think of it     said norby .      norby and i are partners     jeff said before norby could work over the question .   the baby dragon left jeff   s shoulder and flew down to perch on norby   s hat .      get off  get off     shouted norby  waving his arms .     won   t     said zargl .     you   re not a mentor .         i am  too     said norby .     i am a teacher .  i   ve been teaching that human boy languages  history  and  uh  galactic travel .      jeff sighed .  could you call it galactic travel when you were never sure where you were going  or how you would get away  or if you would return home when you did get away .      would you care to have something to eat in my house .     asked zi  courteously .     it was rude of me to chase you away last time and i would like to make amends .  the mentors know you are here by now  but they may not get round to you for a while because  as far as we know  they spend most of their time meditating .  they are trying to tune in to all parts of the universe so they can find the others .  we will have time to eat .         i   m not sure i can eat your food     said jeff  trying to sound apologetic so as not to give offense .      i   ll test it first     said norby .      you being so accurate .         yes  indeed     said norby  extending his legs to their longest and putting his hands on the sides of his barrel .     testing the structure of foodstuffs is absurdly simple for a genius robot like me .     norby stalked into the dragon   s home and jeff followed .   norby passed the food as safe .     good protein     he said .     high in fiber  lower in cholesterol .  it will do you good  jeff .      except for something blue and mushy that he decided not to try  jeff thought it was delicious .   the dragons    furniture was another thing .  it was not built for human dimensions and angles and almost nothing looked the least bit comfortable .  the exception was something in one corner that looked like a battered old green hassock .      may i sit on this  zi .     jeff asked .      certainly .  it   s an antique tail rest that has been in our family for generations .  it   s still quite useful .  of course  you don   t have a tail  you poor thing  but you are certainly welcome to rest the place where the tail ought to be .      jeff sat down and found it comfortable enough .  it had a small design on top that resembled a diamond shaped figure on the dragons    collars .  a more interesting design of complicated wiggly patterns circled the sides of the hassock .   jeff said     where is your husband  zi .         what is a husband .         well  the male of the species who  that is .  .  .  .         male .  oh  you mean a different variety of a life form .  i   ve read that such a phenomenon occurs on other planets .  we don   t travel  as i told you  but the mentors have provided us with good galactographies .  when i read about the peculiar customs and habits of other worlds i can only be grateful that we jamyns live on a civilized planet .         but if you don   t have males  how do you have children .         ah  you need males for that on other worlds  don   t you .  i   ve never really understood that .  we bud  you know  and i don   t see how it can be done conveniently any other way .  zargl was such a cute bud  right here under my wing .  you should have seen her .  but actually     she brought one wing forward and covered her eyes with it briefly     we don   t really talk about budding among ourselves .  it   s private .  you   re not jamyn  of course  so you don   t matter .         but if you bud     said jeff  a little argumentatively     there   s very little alteration of inherited characteristics  and you can   t evolve .  in our species  the genes always get mixed up so that children aren   t exactly like their parents and we evolve quickly .         see     whispered norby to jeff     it   s good to be mixed up .     jeff glared at him  and norby closed his eyes and pretended he hadn   t said anything .      according to our traditions  the others helped us to stay the same .  i suppose  since the universe itself is changing  that there should be creatures that change .  i wish you and your species well  for while we jamyn contribute stability  perhaps you terrans contribute exciting change .         exciting  indeed     said norby  bouncing up and down slightly .     you have no idea how mixed up all the terran life forms are     he glanced quickly at jeff as he emphasized the word     especially human beings .  their history has all the excitement of nasty wars and wicked persecutions and foolish plots and .  .   .         norby .  how can you say such things about your own world .     jeff asked .     you   re just ashamed of being mixed up yourself .         i told you i couldn   t help the lion .  i explained it all to you while we were in hyperspace and you   re not helping me in the least with my new secret .  it scares me .      what new secret .  thought jeff .  he tried to remember and failed .   just then the dragons    computer made a chiming noise .      oh     said zi .     what an honor .  it   s a direct signal from the mentors    castle .  i   ve never been worthy of a direct signal before .  how my friends will envy me .     she spread out both her wings as far as they would go and bowed deeply in the direction of the chime .   the computer said     the aliens are summoned for an audience .  only the aliens .  they must come at once  and alone .      norby ran over to jeff  his hat so low that you could barely see his eyes .     i don   t want to go .  i   m afraid .         why .  you think part of you may be from here  don   t you .  jamya may be where your alien portions were formed .         i don   t care .  let   s go back to earth and find fargo .  .  .  . or maybe we could disguise ourselves and join a circus traveling through the solar system .         the inventors union will find us if we do     said jeff .     do you want to be taken apart .      suddenly the dragons    computer screen swirled with an eerie color .  when it cleared  a cold light shone on a monstrous shape standing in a cavernous space on two thick lower limbs .  the figure had four arms  a head that bulged on top  with a slit below the bulge that could have been a mouth  and three iridescent patches on the bulge that could have been eyes .      mama .  i   m scared .     wailed zargl  leaping into her mother   s arms and folding her wings .   jeff realized  a bit uneasily  that he felt the same way .  and yet he was larger than zi and  for all he knew  he might be larger than the creature on the computer screen .  he flexed his arm muscles to reassure himself that he still had them  and wished he knew as much about karate as albany jones did .  he grabbed norby and stood up straight .      ouch .     jeff had forgotten that the dragons    ceiling was low  and  in the process of rubbing his sore head and trying to stoop  he dropped norby  who fell with a clunk .      ouch .     norby said .     you keep dropping me  jeff .  what kind of an owner are you .         why don   t you turn on your antigrav when you feel yourself falling .  you would if you weren   t so busy retracting .     looking around for allies  jeff saw with discouragement that norby was not completely withdrawn into his barrel and muttering ominously .  zargl was cowering in zi   s arms  and zi had backed as far from her own computer screen as possible .   zi said with clear embarrassment     of course  there   s nothing to be afraid of  but i never saw a mentor before .  we only receive verbal messages and there are no pictures of them in our books .  this is most unusual .  .  . and a gr reat honor  i think .         but zi     said jeff     how can you be afraid .  we humans have always imagined dragons to be completely brave .  it was dragons who terrified others .  dragons could even breathe fire .         oh  we can do that .     said zi  not taking her eyes off the apparition on the screen .  she breathed out a small blue flame .     that   s one of our old  primitive defenses  but it takes a lot of energy to separate the hydrogen from the .  .  .  .      jeff had backed away from her .     there .  you see .  even though you   re small  you shouldn   t be afraid .      zi said  indignantly     i am not small .  only the grand dragonship is larger than i am  and she   s my aunt .  and i   m not afraid of the mentor  if that   s a mentor .  i   m just overcome by respect and awe .      but she acted afraid .   jeff shrugged and turned back to the screen .  the strange figure was staring at them  if those patches of shimmering color were indeed eyes .      what do you want .     jeff demanded  determined that he wasn   t going to show fear  whatever the others did .      courtesy and respect     said the figure in a kind of creaky voice  as though it were something that was not often used .     i   ve summoned you to the presence  and you have not hurried .  see to it that you come immediately to the mentor castle on the hill .  alone .     the screen went blank .   norby   s head popped up .     not without me .         i thought you were too scared     jeff said .      i am  but i   m less scared when i   m with you .  besides  if we   re together we can both escape through hyperspace .  if we were separated     he added virtuously     i wouldn   t dream of escaping on my own and leaving you in danger here .         we   ll think about escape later     jeff said     after we find out what the mentors want .  come on  partner .                 mentors and hassocks     jeff wanted to pretend that norby didn   t have antigrav but this had disadvantages .  the path up the hill to the large castle was steep  and the paving was ravaged by age .  it was rough and uneven  and rank weeds grew in the cracks .   jeff sighed inwardly at the discomforts of their progress  while norby  walking on his two way feet  complained loudly and repetitiously until jeff finally decided that carrying him was easier than listening to his grumbling .   halfway up  jeff was forced to say     you   re no pleasure to carry uphill full weight  norby  so could i persuade you to turn on your antigrav a little .      norby complied with his usual mixed up judgment of intensity  so that jeff had to shout     not that much     as his feet began to leave the ground .     you   ll reveal the ability .      norby added a bit of weight and they continued to climb .   it soon became quite apparent that the paving was not the only imperfection .  what had appeared to be lovely landscaping turned out to be full of flaws  although here and there it seemed as if someone had tried  halfheartedly  to prune trees and weed flower beds .      the mentors don   t seem to care how things look     said jeff .      what   s that .     norby asked  jiggling so much that jeff lost his balance and let go of him .  whit his own full weight suddenly restored  jeff sat down hard .  fortunately  he sat on a patch of weeds growing where a paving stone should have been .   norby came down much more gently .     you keep letting go of me .  what   s the matter with you .         why were you jiggling .  what    s the matter with you .     jeff got up and rubbed himself where he had made contact with the ground .      i was looking at that .  it startled me .       among the flowers off to the side was an odd little metal creature  much smaller than norby .  it had a long arm with pincers at one end  another arm ending in a scoop  and yet another that looked like coiled wire .  underneath were lots of little legs  and the whole thing slightly resembled a terran crab .   the creature uncoiled its wire  touched jeff with it  and immediately backed off  waving its other arms furiously .      we aren   t going to hurt anything     said jeff .   the creature made no sound but turned away and began to weed the garden .      i think it   s just a gardening robot     jeff said .     it looks very old  all dented and discolored .  no wonder the castle grounds aren   t in good shape .         it   s not intelligent     norby said and sailed into jeff   s arms again .     it was nothing for you to be afraid of .         i   m not the one who .  .  .  .     began jeff  and then gave it up as a bad job .   they climbed on to the castle until its gigantic metallic door loomed ahead of them .  it had hinges  but no doorknob .      do we knock .     asked jeff     i don   t see signs of a computer scan .         you might not recognize one on this planet     norby said .      well  do you .         no     said norby .     i keep feeling i know this place  but the memory is so faint  it doesn   t seem to help me .  the diamond design on the door seems familiar .         that   s because it   s also on the dragons    collars and on the top of their hassock .  didn   t you notice .         come to think of it  i did .         i   ll bet .  but now that you do  what does it mean .      norby paused .  then he said in a hurt tone     i wish i weren   t so mixed up with terran parts .  if all of me were alien  or jamyn  i   d probably understand everything .         i doubt that  somehow  but try to think .  does the design tell us what to do  or is it just the mark of the others .         that   s it     norby cried out triumphantly .     it just came to me like a flash .  it   s the mark of the others .  now why didn   t you think of that .  that   s how the others marked their special property .  and if you use the right computer technique  the diamond plus that squiggly border design around the door .  .  .  .         it was around the hassock  too     said jeff .      i   m glad you noticed     said norby .     well  the diamond plus the squiggly border design tells you how .  .  .  .         tells us how to what .         i   m sorry  jeff  but that   s the part i can   t remember .      and just as jeff was going to express his opinion of that  the massive door began to creak slowly open .  jeff could see nothing inside but a long  dark hallway .      well  let   s go in  norby .      norby took a step backward .     do we have to .         certainly .  that   s what we came for .     jeff strode boldly through the door and down the hall  looking for an opening into a room .  norby ran behind him  mumbling .      what are you talking about .     asked jeff .      i   m not talking .  at least  not words .  i   m going over equations that keep popping into my head .  i think the squiggly design is a set of mathematical relationships .  i   ve got to figure it out .  i want to understand myself so i don   t keep getting into trouble  like landing in the coliseum by mistake .         the old building on columbus circle in manhattan .  why     did you land there .         no .  the one in rome     said norby impatiently .  i told you all about it in hyperspace .       there didn   t seem to be any doors  and the corridor began to wind .      i couldn   t understand you in hyperspace .  when were you in rome .         when i got the lion .  don   t you remember the lion .  it was all very unpleasant in the coliseum .  people were fighting in armor and other people were being eaten by lions .  then guards picked me up because i was in the way and threw me into the lion   s cage .  .  .  .         norby .  was the coliseum  intact .         sure .  not at all like the ruin in the pictures of rome .      jeff stopped short before another sharp curve in the corridor .     are you telling me the truth  norby .  we were studying roman history and you were working with shakespeare   s julius caesar .  so when you left .  .  .  . norby .  you couldn   t have .      norby said     well  where did the lion come from .  i was thinking how nice it would be to see old julius himself  and maybe i didn   t quite make it and was a century short  a century later in time than julius  with christians being thrown to the lions  and one of the lions came with me .      jeff  feeling stunned  said    that means you actually traveled through time  but scientists say that   s impossible .         well  i did it anyway .  i just don   t know how .         you don   t know how you do anything .         i   m sorry     said norby .     i guess time travel is my other secret .         can you go back into time again .         i don   t know .      jeff shook his head .  he walked around the bend in the hall and saw an archway leading to a vast auditorium .  high  thin slivers of windows shed a feeble light into the murkiness .  in the shadows were formidable figures like the one they had seen on the computer screen  all standing very still .      the mentors     said jeff .      hundreds of them     agreed norby     but they   re inactivated .     .      inacti .  .  . do you mean they are robots .  dead robots .         i can always tell a robot .  .  . almost always .      jeff walked into the enormous room  moving from one figure to another .  they were all about a meter taller than he  each with the bulge on its head and the slit and three patches .  there was no color or light in the patches .  their black  metallic surfaces were discolored and  in some places  cracked .  they certainly seemed inactive  and very old .   norby sidled in ahead of jeff and began rapping the mentors  surfaces with his knuckles  now that he was sure they weren   t alive .  he stopped so suddenly that jeff almost tripped over him .      something   s alive in here     whispered norby .     one of them is still alive .  and the building  it   s alive  too .  there   s a big computer inside the walls .  i should have tuned in to it before .  i think it   s time to go home  jeff .      jeff squared his shoulders and looked around  but he saw nothing moving in the shadows .      what do you want .     he called out loudly .     you sent for us .  what do you want .     c  there was no answer  but jeff became conscious of a faint vibration in the soles of his feet .  norby was right  the building was alive .  had the castle itself sent for him .      what do you want of me .     he called again .      jeff .     yelled norby .     help .     four scurrying little machines  similar to the gardener robot outside  plunged out of the darkness and hurtled toward norby .  they grabbed and held him by his arms and legs .   as jeff started toward norby  one of the large mentor robots suddenly moved .  its eyepatches began to gleam with an iridescence that was like shining quivering worms .  its four arms rose .      jeff  don   t let it near you .     norby cried out as he struggled to shake off the little machines .   it was too late .  the robot   s arms extended and caught jeff in a tight grip he could not break .      norby     jeff yelled     go into hyperspace .  try to leave the machines behind  but take them with you if you have to .         what about you  jeff .         i   ll be all right  until you get back .  i know you   ll remember how to get back     said jeff  not at all sure that norby would .   norby pulled in his head  and with the small attack robots hanging onto his arms and legs  disappeared .      good riddance .     the big robot that was holding jeff spoke now in a coarse grinding voice .  he spoke in jamyn .     i do not approve of alien machines .  or alien life forms  either .         now wait     said jeff  trying vainly to twist an arm out of the robotic grip .     i   m here on a friendly visit .         if you are friendly  prove it by staying and performing a task for us .      as he spoke  the mentor lifted jeff and carried him to the back of the room  where he pressed a depression in the wall with one of his feet .  the wall split in two and slid aside  revealing machinery that glittered and flickered with shifting lights  although nothing else moved .  in the center of the machinery  there was a space big enough for ten human beings to stand upright .  the mentor placed jeff in the space and stood back .   jeff tried to leave  but found himself encased in walls of force that he could not see but that stung him badly when he touched them .  he sat down in the center and waited .   the lights around him began to turn and focus  as if they were concentrating on him .   i   m being scanned  he thought .     yes  you are  a telepathic voice replied  think slowly and clearly so that the scanning of your thoughts will be done correctly .      no  i won   t     said jeff  aloud .     i   m not going to let you find out where i come from .        you will stay here until everything is found out and you have completed your task .      i   m not a machine .     jeff was shouting now  trying to let feelings of indignation drown out his thoughts .     i   m protoplasmic .  organic .  i need food .  what about that .        the jamyn will provide .  now stop talking so that your mind can be explored  or you will be punished .      i won   t stop .  ow .     he   d been given a rather unpleasant electric shock .   he stopped talking and began to think furiously     friends  romans  countrymen  lend me your ears .  .  .  .        where is your planet .     never heard of it .     i come to bury caesar  not to praise him .     ow .  if you give me more electric shocks  i   ll fall unconscious and you   ll have only mixed up gibberish in my thoughts to read instead of good shakespeare .     why are you here .  what do you call yourself these days .     the best species in the universe  that   s what we call ourselves .  and what do you mean these days .     to be or not to be  that is the question .  whether    tis nobler in the mind to suffer      it went on for some time .  fortunately .  for jeff  there was no need to get the shakespearian speeches word perfect  or even to think of different ones .  after a while  he just kept repeating    to be or not to be    over and over again .  he had two more electric shocks  but after the second  he pretended to stagger and began to think nonsense syllables with all his might .  after that there were no more shocks .  outside the walls of force  the figure of the mentor seemed still  as if it had run down .   and then there was another telepathic voice in his mind .     jeff .  i   ll get you out of here .   jeff saw norby beside him  inside the scanner .    norby .  i thought you weren   t coming back from hyperspace after all .     after i refueled i left my attackers in hyperspace and hyperjumped into your prison .  i   m going to try to get us out of here and into the dragon   s house .     no .  take us home .     what if the mentors    computer can detect where i head for .     that   s smart  norby .  i should have thought of that .  but why zi   s house .     because i   ve decided we want her hassock .  i don   t know what it is  but it   s from the others  and i think it   s supposed to be opened .  i   m sure zi doesn   t know that .   but the mentor did .  its thoughts suddenly seemed to thunder out  overriding those of norby .     it is i who must have that hassock .  i see a picture of it in your mind .      hurry     said jeff  aloud  taking norby   s hand .     hyperjump .      it was as if they only dipped in and out of the grayness and there was zi   s little castle ahead .      tiddledewinks     said norby .     i meant to land in her living room .    and here come more of the mentors    attack force  he added  pointing to the small crablike machines which could be seen as little dots beginning to scurry down the hill from the castle .  jeff and norby ran .   zi came out to meet them  along with zargl who began to squeal with delight at seeing jeff again .     what is it .     zi asked .     how are the mentors .  how important you must be to be granted audience by them .         later     said jeff .     may we have your hassock .  i mean the thing you rest your tail on .  it may be a device from the others .         then please take it .  i am afraid to own such things .  do come again for dinner .     she stepped into her little castle  and then emerged with the hassock  which she handed to jeff .   jeff held the hassock to his chest .  it was smaller than norby  and much lighter in weight .  the cover  which felt like leather  was a faded green  much scuffed by years of having scaly dragon tails rubbing about on it .   norby said     i   m sure  somehow  that this hassock opens up if you figure out the mental key encoded in the squiggles around its sides .  something   s inside .         what .         i don   t know .  but don   t keep talking  jeff .  those little attack robots are almost down the hill .       norby activated his antigrav and sailed under jeff   s other arm  the one that wasn   t holding the hassock .     ready .     he asked .   the oncoming crablike robots scurried faster .      put down what you are holding and surrender yourselves .  you are our prisoners     they cried out in chorus  their squeaky voices painfully shrill .      no     said jeff .     you have a nice planet but you don   t know how to make visitors feel at home .  now  good bye .         wait  don   t go     they all squeaked .   jeff said     straight back to our apartment  norby .  the security police will be gone by now .  make sure your protective shield reaches around the hassock while we   re in hyperspace  and don   t think about our home coordinates very hard .  i don   t want the mentor to know .         don   t worry     said norby .     i don   t think he   s strong enough to use telepathy without the help of his main computer  or without touching us .      the attack robots were almost upon them .     let   s go  norby .      the grayness came and went  and they were falling .     norby     shouted jeff     turn on your antigrav before we hit .      they zoomed upward and jeff  trembling a little  looked down .  he was still holding the hassock under his left arm  and norby under his right  and they were no longer on jamya .  that was clear .   but they weren   t in the wells    apartment either .  there was no apartment  no building  no manhattan .  only a vast whiteness stretched below them .      snow .     said norby .     it   s summer .  what   s snow doing here .         that   s not just snow     jeff said .     that   s a glacier .                 time and other troubles        you   ve brought us to alaska .     jeff was shivering .     or some such place far north .  or someplace far south  like antarctica .  or maybe even to some other planet .         this is earth .  i   m certain of it     norby said as they skimmed above the ice .     the coordinates check  and i   m sure that   s earth   s sun .  i guess it   s antarctica .         no  it isn   t     jeff said .     if that   s earth   s sun  it   s quite high in the sky  so it can   t be antarctica .  or alaska  either .  i   d say it was the tibetan plateau  except we   d be able to see mountains  and we don   t .         don   t get all excited  jeff .  here come some horses  and maybe we can ask the riders .  .  .  .      jeff squinted in the direction norby was pointing .     there aren   t any riders  and those are camels .  big  shaggy camels  and they   re walking over snow .  uh  oh .      norby   s pair of eyes facing jeff closed suddenly and then popped open    you think .  .  .  .         yes  i think .  which you don   t .     jeff studied the circle of the horizon .  what had seemed to be solid whiteness resolved itself into a slope  and in the south  if it was south  there was a valley with stunted pine trees beginning where the glacier ended .  the valley went on and on  deeper and deeper  and way out was the atlantic .  or was it the pacific .      norby .  there   s another herd of animals over there by those pine trees .  take us closer .      it was worse than jeff had imagined .     do you know what those animals are .     he demanded .      elephants     quavered norby     and they shouldn   t be up in the snow country  should they .         it   s worse than elephants .  those elephants are extinct elephants .         but they   re alive .         they   re alive now  but they   re going to be extinct some day .  look at them  norby .  elephants don   t have long blond hair .  they   re mastodons  and we   re seeing them with our own eyes  which no one else of our generation has ever done .         maybe they   re woolly mammoths .  aren   t woolly mammoths supposed to live in cold climates .         not any more .  not since the last ice age  which is where you   ve taken us to .         i   m sorry  jeff .  i really am .  i was thinking so much about time travel that i automatically did it when i was just trying to get us home .         you said you didn   t know how .         i don   t  but something inside me .  .  .  .         oh  never mind     jeff said .     anyway  mammoths had large round bulges on top of their heads and mastodons didn   t .  mastodon bones were found up the hudson river valley in the eighteenth century .      jeff paused .  then he said thoughtfully     well  then  this is the hudson river valley  or what will become the hudson river valley once the glacier retreats .  over there is the prehistoric hudson canyon with a river carrying melted glacier water to the sea  and it will be covered by ocean in our own time .  this could even be before the indians entered the americas .  norby  you   ve got to take us to our own century .     the hassock was getting awkward to hold in the cold  and jeff tried to balance it on his hip .  he wished he could put his hands in his pockets because it was so cold .      jeff     norby said     i   m too scared to try .  i muddle things .  maybe we should just stay here .         in this ice age .  we   ll surely freeze to death .  and if we go south to where it   s warm  we   ll still have nothing to eat  no weapons for catching game  and nobody to talk to but each other .  besides  i want to be back in my own time .         but i don   t know how to get back .         you got back from the roman coliseum .         well  when the lion jumped on me  i got so scared that i stopped thinking .  i just time jumped .         then do it again now .         i can   t stop thinking .      it   s my responsibility  thought jeff .  norby is just a mixed up little robot with talents he doesn   t understand or know how to use very well .  it   s no use blaming him or trying to make him solve the problem .  i   ve got to do it .  fargo always says    don   t think a lot  little brother  just think smart  and when you decide to act  do it with all your heart     he was still having trouble with the awkwardly shaped hassock .  he couldn   t get a comfortable grip on it with his chilled fingers .    how do i think smart .  he wondered .     i don   t understand you  norby interjected .  then he remembered .  ever since the dragon bite  he and norby had been able to telepathize when they were in contact and thinking hard .  he said     i was just trying to think  norby  and you   re reading my mind .         i wish you could read my mind and tell me how to get back to our own time .  i can do it  but i can   t seem to make myself .  maybe it isn   t part of either the alien me or the terran me  but from the two being mixed together .      there was silence for a while  during which jeff could feel himself shivering and hear his teeth chattering .  finally he said    all i can hear in your mind is    oh  my  jeff will sell me if i keep being so mixed up .     now  just stop that  because i   m not going to sell you .  you   re my robot forever  mixed up or not .         thank you  jeff     said norby .     and all i can hear in your brain is    i   m so cold .  i   m so cold .     i feel terrible about that  jeff .         well     said jeff miserably     at least it   s summer here  or the sun wouldn   t be so high in the sky  and it   s a clear afternoon  with no wind blowing .  it   s cold enough  but it could be lots colder another day or another season .  let   s try together  norby .  i   ll think hard about our apartment .  you tune into that image in my head and then perhaps you   ll find the time coordinates maybe by reflex .      they tried and failed .      it doesn   t work .     norby wailed .   jeff bit his lip and tried not to feel despair .  there had to be some way out .     norby     he said     maybe we   re not trying hard enough because we don   t really want to go back to the apartment  and it might not be safe .  if we could go to our family scoutship  the hopeful  that might make more sense  only .  .  .  .         only what .         well  i   m not sure where it is .  it could be at the big dock that orbits mars along with space command  now that fargo is part of admiral yobo   s team .  but there are thousands of berths there  and i don   t know which one would be hopeful   s .  in fact  i can   t be absolutely sure the scoutship is even there .         we can try     said norby .     try to visualize the space command dock .  you   ve seen it  haven   t you .         yes  but i can   t visualize the hopeful there .     jeff clumsily managed to shift the hassock under his arm to a new position and tried to grip it comfortably .     i can imagine the control room of the hopeful clearly  however .  maybe we can tune into it regardless of where she is .     he winced with pain .     i   m so cold that the arm holding this hassock hurts .  my muscles are cramping .     .   at that very moment  the hassock fell out of jeff   s numbed arm and tumbled over and over in the air  down  down to the snow .      oh  no     he shouted  and beat his arm against his chest to get circulation back into it .  he didn   t have a chance to make much noise or do much beating because the wind was knocked out of him by the force of norby   s dive .   zoom .  norby plunged through the cold air  holding onto jeff  and he managed to get under the hassock .  he caught it just before it hit the ground .  in the process  however  he let go of jeff .   fortunately  norby was just starting his upswing again so that jeff fell without the added velocity of the dive  and the top layer of the snow was soft .  he landed spread eagle on his back and was half buried .  he struggled clumsily to his feet .   contritely  norby swept down again  .  holding the hassock in one arm  while the other arm stretched out to take jeff   s hand .   up in the air again  jeff writhed in his efforts to knock off the snow that clung to him .      hold still     said norby .      i can   t .  if the snow stays on me it will melt from what little body heat i have and i   ll get wet .  and one thing that   s much worse than being this cold is being this cold and wet  too .         think about the control room .      jeff tried .  fargo had taught him concentration and meditation techniques years ago  and now he needed them to save his life .     the hopeful .  small .  neat .  useful .     don   t think in words  jeff .  just pictures .   the pictures came and slowly jeff immersed himself in them  relaxing and trusting norby to hang on to him  and to the hassock  too  and at the same time to keep them in air with his antigrav .   as jeff relaxed  the pictures came more vividly until he forgot he was cold and cramped and desperate  or even that he was himself .  he was he and norby  looking at the control room of the hopeful seeing it clearly in their joined minds  so clearly that it was real  located in space and time .   and suddenly they were there .        oh .     said albany  who was much too cool a policewoman to scream .   jeff smiled at them weakly and shivered uncontrollably as he brushed at his hair to remove the melting snow .      it was all ice     norby shouted .     jeff nearly froze .  it was all my fault  but i couldn   t help it .      fargo waved him to be quiet and had his hands on jeff quickly .     explain later .  get those clothes off .         but albany .  .  .  .     protested jeff .   albany turned around .     i won   t look     she said .      get them off  i say     fargo said .     it doesn   t matter whether she looks or not .  and get me a blanket  norby .     in a few minutes  jeff relaxed in the warmth of the blanket while fargo rubbed a towel vigorously over his head and face .     now tell me     fargo said     where were you .         on a trip     norby put in brightly .      with a hassock .     asked albany .      listen .     jeff interrupted .     is it safe here .  no security police .         just our own devoted manhattan police     fargo said  putting his arm about albany   s trim waist     whom i was trying to persuade to go off on a little search expedition with me .  she says she can   t because a fiscal crisis in manhattan has forced the lay off of so many police that she dare not stay off the job for any length of time .  did you ever hear anything so crazy .         you mean we   re still in manhattan .     jeff asked .     i thought the ship would be at the space command dock .         it was  earlier  but after you left our apartment  i let the security police search it .  naturally  they found nothing and left  breathing fire and slaughter .  then i sat around and waited for you .  but days passed  and you didn   t come back  so i decided i   d look for you in the ship .  but i brought it back to earth first because i wanted albany along .  after all  she   s a good person in a fray  and at other times  too .         what do you mean    the days passed    .     demanded jeff .     how long do you think i   ve been gone .         i don   t think  jeff  i know .  you   ve been gone thirteen days .         what .         why be surprised .  don   t you know how long you   ve been gone .      jeff shook his head .     i guess i   m going to have to tell you norby   s other secret .         are you going to tell it while a non family person is in our midst .     said norby sounding outraged .  his head popped in and out of his barrel .   albany smiled  as beautifully as she did everything .     that   s all right .  since i can   t go with you on this trip  i had better not hear any secrets just yet .  and now i must go back to my precinct .      she headed for the airlock .      do you mean we   re in manhattan .     asked jeff again .      on the great lawn of central park     said fargo     which isn   t quite according to regulations for a craft of this kind  but i have an official paper from admiral yobo  and a police officer i know pulled a few strings     he smiled at albany     so here i am .      he went to the airlock and looked back at jeff .     while i   m escorting my exasperating lass  who would rather be on her job than with me because of her civic spirit  why don   t you have a cup of hot chocolate .  you might as well get warm inside as well as out .  and eat something if you   re hungry .      fargo and albany went out .   jeff said to norby     i hope you realize you got us back nearly two weeks late .      norby said     you really expect everything  don   t you .  didn   t i get you back right on the button  right in the control room .  so i was a few minutes off .         a few minutes        fargo came back into the hopeful in a hurry .  he sealed the lock behind him .     prepare for takeoff  mates .  the security police have discovered that my ship is in central park and they want to search it .  we either leave now while albany tries to hold them off  or you two will have to disappear again .         where shall i take you  jeff .     norby asked cheerfully .      not again     jeff said .     take off  fargo .  i   ll stay in the hopeful .  i can   t stand the thought of getting lost in time and space again .      fargo   s eyebrows shot upward  but he said nothing as he handled the controls .  the hopeful lifted .   the computer outlet spoke .     security police in antigrav car outside  captain .  you are under arrest and ordered to surrender your ship .  if you try to leave  you will be brought back by force grapple .         so they say     said fargo     but they   ll have to catch us first .         but they will     said jeff .      no  they won   t .  i will lose them in the cloud layer  and while they   re looking for us  we   ll get into hyperspace if norby can manage it .  we   ll go in and never come out  so far as they are concerned .         then they   ll know we have hyperdrive .         no  they won   t .  they   ll only know we   ve disappeared  and presumably crashed .  they   ll spend days looking for the smashed torso of our scoutship .     fargo turned to norby .     can you turn this ship   s engine to hyperdrive as soon as we   re into the cloud .     he asked .      i can channel my hyperspace entry system into the ship   s computer .  she   s a stupid computer but maybe she   ll be able to follow my instructions .  if she were as intelligent as i am .  .  .  .         just do it  norby     fargo said .   jeff  at the thought of facing another jaunt through hyperspace  buried his head in his hands .              opening the hassock        that was a piece of cake     fargo said .      thank you     norby said         but you can say that because you   re not the one who had to do it .  i had to work myself to death to get that stupid computer to do the right thing .  are you all right  jeff .      jeff peered out from his blanket .     well  i am tired     he said     and hungry  too .  do you mind if i   m tired and hungry .  is there a law against that .         that   s just like a boy     said norby .     always tired and hungry  and always getting short tempered about it .      fargo turned around in his captain   s chair and fiddled with the computer .     a meal will be served shortly  jeff  but it will be food and water in the brig if you don   t tell me what   s happened to you  and what norby   s other secret is  although after you talked about being lost in space and time  i guess i can guess the latter .          we don   t have a brig     jeff grumbled     and first i want to eat .     he watched the glass door where the food would make its appearance .  he didn   t care what kind of synthomeal the hopeful would manage to provide  so long as she did it quickly .   with a slight sound like a burp  the hopeful served up synthoburger  synthofries  and real  if reconstituted  applesauce .   fargo   s blue eyes were amused as jeff dove into the food     i see i   ll have to wait a long time to hear the story .      through a mouthful of fries  jeff said thickly     get it from norby  not that you   ll get an unbiased story .         he   s communing with the ship   s computer .         and i can   t be interrupted right now     norby said importantly .     i   m making some very delicate adjustments on the computer so that maybe you   ll be able to put the ship into hyperdrive even if i   m not with you .  i   ve altered the antigrav engine slightly to fit  because you can   t get into hyperspace unless your hyperdrive is based on antigrav .         how do you know .         it   s just a feeling i have .  this universe is all tied up with gravity  and i don   t think you can get out of normal space unless you get rid of gravity for a while .  or it could be vice versa .  maybe antigrav works by tying ordinary space to a little hyperspace .         where are we now .     jeff asked some minutes later  his mouth still full of food .      i don   t know     said fargo .  .  .  .    norby .  unplug yourself and tell us where you   ve brought us .  that   s a pretty planet out there  but it sure isn   t earth .         jamya     mumbled norby .      oh  no .  not again .     jeff suspended his labors over the applesauce and said     fargo  you   d better have the whole story .      fargo listened quietly while jeff recounted his and norby   s experiences on jamya .     in summary     fargo said     we are faced with friendly dragons and villainous robots .         yes     said jeff     and the only mode of escape is a small robot who not only can   t handle hyperspace with accuracy  but who also gets you to the right place at the wrong time and nearly freezes you to death .         well  i like that .     said norby  leaving the computer .     and here i worked my circuits to the bone for you .         it seems to me     said fargo     that there   s unfinished business on jamya .  i vote for landing .         so do i     said norby .     i keep yearning for that planet .         i   m against it     said jeff .     never trouble trouble till .  .  .  .         two against one     fargo and norby said simultaneously .      the only trouble is     fargo said  a couple of hours later     that the computer informs me there   s some sort of force barrier around the planet .         right     said jeff with sudden satisfaction .     zi told me the jamyns weren   t allowed to travel to other planets  and i presume people from other planets aren   t allowed to travel to jamya .  she said we were the first visitors ever .  so let   s go somewhere else .      norby said     we got to jamya before because we used hyperdrive and went past the barrier by going out of normal space .  all we have to do is to use hyperdrive now .         wait     jeff said .  he knew fargo and he knew norby  and there wasn   t much use trying to talk sense to either of them .  the only thing to do was to place another problem before them and then  maybe  he could get some sleep .  with his eyelids drooping on their own  what he needed very badly was a little unconsciousness .  after that  he might be able to face jamya .     don   t you think you ought to find out why the mentors want that hassock .     he asked .      isn   t the best way of finding that out simply to ask the mentors .     fargo asked .      no     jeff said earnestly .     they never thought about the hassock till norby mentioned it .  maybe they don   t know what   s in it .  and it   s norby who thinks he can open it if he can work out the meaning of all that stuff around the sides .         you   re right .  sensible boy .  norby  make a note  your young owner has the makings of a brilliant adult .         yes  fargo     norby said     i have always suspected that .  it isn   t easy to decipher the designs on the hassock  though .      jeff heaved a sigh of relief .     i   m sure it isn   t  so just take your time norby  and don   t hurry it .  and while you   re working i   ll catch up on some much needed sleep .  fargo  please  don   t do anything while i   m sleeping .      fargo yawned .     i won   t     he said .     i could use a little nap myself .     he leaned back in his chair  pushed his pilot   s cap over his eyes and was  in fact  asleep almost before jeff was .     eight hours later fargo and jeff were eating breakfast while norby was trying to explain that the others    code was extremely difficult .      but why .     asked jeff .     you understand the jamyn language  so why can   t you read their writing .         because it   s not just writing .  it   s code .     said norby  a bit shrilly .      and it may not be jamyn .  this is probably a code used by the others  whoever they are  and it may not be coded from the jamyn language .  anyway  i   ve got part of it .  the first half says    all purpose .     at least  i think it does .         all purpose what .     asked jeff .      i don   t know .  i can   t make out the second half .      fargo grinned and took the last synthobiscuit .     all purpose flour .  all purpose weapon .         it probably just means all purpose cushion     said jeff  discouraged .     that   s what the hassock was used as .  the dragons used it to rest their tails on .  it was apparently very good for that .  and i suppose you   re no nearer to opening it now than you were at the start .         no .     the little robot   s eyelids lowered halfway  and jeff almost expected a teardrop of oil to come out .      any hints .     asked fargo .     i mean  as far as opening it is concerned .         well  besides the words calling the hassock an all purpose something  there are numbers .  they come in batches in an odd pattern .         show me     said fargo .   he and norby huddled over the print out from the computer  which represented norby   s attempts to solve the riddle of the hassock .   as for jeff  he stared at the viewscreen while the other two muttered to each other .  the planet  jamya  seemed to swing in the black ocean of space  wreathed with clouds .  he thought he could see blue ocean and green brown landmasses beneath the clouds  or was it just one large landmass .  were the dragons the only intelligent creatures on jamya .  jeff thought they probably were  because zi had not mentioned any other civilized creatures besides the mentors .   and what of the mentors .  why did they want the hassock .  and what task had they wanted jeff to perform .  they had never gotten around to describing that .  what could one boy do that the mentors and their powerful computer could not .   jeff shook his head .  he couldn   t figure it out .  he hoped norby was doing better with the hassock .   meanwhile fargo said     if that part of the code stands for numbers  it may be a double code with the numbers standing for words .         if so  fargo  it   s too much for me     norby said .     i   m just a small stupid robot and you mustn   t expect too much of me .      jeff realized that things were pretty bad for norby to whine along those lines .      let up for a while  fargo .  why don   t we just sit and sing for a while until our brains clear .      there was a long pause while fargo simply stared at his younger brother .  then he pounded his right fist into his left palm .     my brother is a genius .         why .  what did i do .      fargo was too busy laughing to answer  so norby answered for him .      i think     he said     that fargo   s decided that the numbers on the hassock stand for musical notes .  i think he   s right .  as soon as you mentioned music  jeff  my brain told me it was the solution .  i   m surprised fargo saw it  too .  you both have your moments  for human beings .      it took another hour  but  with the help of norby and the hopeful   s computer  fargo decided he had the song .      shall i sing it .         yes .     said norby .      no .     said jeff .     let me get a stun gun first  in case the hassock turns out to be a lethal robot machine of the others .         we don   t have any stun guns     fargo said cheerfully .     you know my motto    clever words are all you need .             albany uses karate     said jeff .      well     said fargo  shrugging     beautiful women have their ways .  if there   s a nasty little machine inside that hassock  we   ll make it norby   s responsibility to deal with it .         why me .     asked norby .      because you have your moments  for a robot .      jeff laughed .     well  then  go ahead  fargo .  sing .      fargo sang the coded notes .  after the last note rang out  they watched the hassock .  nothing happened .      wrong rhythm  do you suppose .     fargo asked .      i think it should be in a minor key     said norby     now that i come to think of it .         if you didn   t have your thought processes mixed up     said jeff     you   d come to think of it beforehand instead of afterward .         better afterward than not at all     said norby loftily .     my alien machinery has been a big help to you .  how far would you have gotten on this hassock without me .         true enough     said jeff .   fargo sang again  a sad song this time  slow and melancholy  and jeff wondered what the hassock might contain that had to be released in this sorrowful fashion .   the song ended .  the three in the control room  and the ship   s computer  too  were all silent .  outside  the planet jamya was also silent .   but something began to happen .  the hassock cover seemed to be getting thinner  lighter  and suddenly it cracked in two  the halves falling apart like a neatly struck eggshell .      by all the satellites of jupiter     said fargo     what is that .      it was green and fuzzy  or maybe they were fuzzy scales  or scales so small and neat as to look like fuzz .  whatever it was  it looked like another dragon  all curled up with its head hidden .   the creature uncurled  shook itself  and the scales became much fuzzier .  it was a small animal about the size of a cat  with a round head and tiny pointed ears  a thin gold collar  and an odd snout with fangs .   fargo backed away .     norby  do you think we ought to be protected from that fanged thing .      norby did nothing but stare at the creature .      is it familiar to you  norby .     jeff asked in jamyn  hoping the creature would understand .   its small ears pricked up  but the animal only yawned .  it shook itself once more  stretched  and began to circumnavigate the control room  sniffing at everything and waving its long  very fuzzy tail .      when cats wave their tails  it means they   re angry     said fargo .      but when dogs do  they   re happy     said jeff .     if this is like the dragons  it ought to be able to understand when we speak jamyn .         as a matter of fact     said norby     it   s a    she     and she doesn   t talk .  she   s not very bright  you see  but she   s not dangerous  either .  i remember now .         why was she hidden away like that in the hassock .         i can   t quite figure that out .         how do you know it   s a    she    .     asked fargo .      they all are .  like the dragons .  only this type lays eggs .      the fuzzy green creature got as far as jeff and stood on her hind legs to sniff him .  he put out his hand and let her sniff that  too .  she didn   t bite  but bumped her head under his palm as if she wanted him to stroke her .  automatically  he did so  thinking that she acted just like a cat  even if she didn   t feel like one .  she felt both soft and bristly  a combination that jeff couldn   t find words to describe .      i always wanted a cat     he said .   under his hand  the creature began to change  the snout receding  the ears and tail lengthening  the fangs disappearing .     meow .     it said softly .      it is a cat     said fargo .     come here  kitty .      the creature ran to fargo .      nice kitty     he said as he stroked her     can you be a dog .      it was even more amazing .  she changed her body contours until she looked very much like a dog .     woof .     she said .      now i remember     said norby .     that   s an all purpose pet .      jeff said     the others may not be so bad after all .  i like their taste in pets .         let   s hope she continues to like us     said fargo  cuddling the all purpose pet  who now resembled a very green beagle  fargo had always been partial to beagles  .  she licked his ear and purred .      beagles aren   t supposed to purr     said jeff  somewhat annoyed .  he couldn   t understand why females seemed to like fargo best .  he was glad he had norby  who wasn   t at all cuddly  but was his robot and never showed any signs of wanting to like anyone else instead .   fargo said     let her purr .  i   m going to name her oola .         why oola .     jeff asked .      because it seems to fit her     fargo said .   the all purpose pet pricked up her ears  now long and drooping  and whined a little .   fargo chucked her under the chin and said     how about that .  do you like your name  oola .      she patted fargo   s face with her paw  more like a cat than a dog  and grinned  with her tongue hanging out .      see     said fargo .     it   s her name .  she admits it .         you   ve got a pet that   s half beagle and half cheshire cat     said jeff     and she   ll probably change to fit everyone   s mental wish and you   ll never know what you   ve got .     he still felt a bit jealous .     i wonder where the others got her .         made her  probably     said norby .     some day on our travels we   ll find the animals the others took genes from to do the biosynthesis of this one .  and don   t ask me how i know this .         we won   t     said jeff  while fargo continued to play with oola .     but i do think  norby  it   s time for you to tell us why you brought us back to jamya  before we go down there to risk life and limb .      there was a long silence .  finally norby spoke very softly .      because i think it   s home     he said .     more and more  i think it   s home  my home .  and i don   t want to be afraid of home .                 more time and trouble     a cold apprehension gripped jeff .  it had nothing to do with the mentors .  was norby going to begin to feel as though he were a jamyn .  wasn   t part of him terran .  was he going to choose between his two parts and turn his back on jeff .      hey  norby     jeff said  sounding as jovial as he could  to conceal his feelings .     don   t get upset .  we   ll help you discover all about jamya and you   ll find there   s nothing to fear .      the trouble was  jeff thought inwardly  that he had been making entirely too many caustic remarks about norby   s being mixed up .      the mentors are after you  jeff     norby said .     i don   t know why they think they can use you  but i don   t think you ought to take the chance .  i   d better go down to the planet without you .  i can always escape them by moving into hyperspace .         oh  no     jeff said .     you   re not getting away from me  i mean  i can   t let you take any chances without me .  you and i are a team  an inseparable team  now and always .  right  norby .         if i may interrupt this dialog     said fargo with a grin on his face     i   d like to point out that i am the senior member of this expedition  so i have to be consulted when decisions are made .  i say that we   re all going .  together .  you don   t think  do you  that i   m going to sit here and spend my time wondering what   s happening to my little brother and his robot .         well     said norby     that would be three of us against the villains  providing i don   t have to spend all my time rescuing you two .         there   ll be some spare time for you to hide behind us  norby     said fargo  stroking oola  who was lying in his lap .      leave norby alone  fargo     jeff said .     he never hides behind anybody .         i don   t .     norby said in a surprised tone .      besides     jeff hurried on     i have an idea .  those mentors down there seemed very dangerous and not likely to listen to reason .  but they are all very old and lots of them are dead and maybe they   ve deteriorated with time .  after all  they were put on jamya by the others to teach the jamyn how to be civilized .  why don   t we go backward in time to when jamya was first found by the others and before they put up the force barrier .  maybe we   ll speak to the young mentors when they were healthy and reasonable .         hmm     murmured fargo     and then we   d know what the others were like .  not a bad idea .         i don   t like it     norby said .     the others were probably more dangerous than the mentors .         do you remember that they were .     jeff asked .      well  no .  i feel as though no part of me came into existence until long after the others left  so i guess i wouldn   t know anything about them .         are you telling us     fargo asked     that some of your parts are the creation of the mentors .         that could be     norby said .     i don   t really know .  i can   t even remember what i used to be .  maybe i wasn   t really a robot .  maybe i was a computer on that spaceship that mcgillicuddy found .  anyway  i   m scared of the others .         then we won   t go back that far in time     jeff said .     do you think you can take us back the right amount if all of us concentrate on young mentors .         well     said norby     fargo can   t help  but you and i can join telepathically  and i   ll try to link myself with the hopeful  too  and we   ll go back to soon after the mentors arrived  i hope .         good .  i   m sure the young mentors will be reasonable     said jeff .     come here  norby .  sit at the ship   s computer  and i   ll hold your hand .      a little wire pushed out of norby   s hat and inserted itself into the ship   s computer .  his hand grabbed jeff   s and held tight .      okay .     norby asked .      i   m not afraid     said jeff .     in fact  i   m completely confident in you  norby .  if we could get back from the ice age smack into the hopeful   s control room  we ought to be able to move the hopeful back into time with pinpoint accuracy .      jeff closed his eyes so he could concentrate better  also to shut out the doubting expression on his brother   s face .  so what if norby got things wrong now and then .  think of all the things he got right .  norby kept saying that  and he was right  too .   now .  .  . concentrate on jamya .  .  . move back .  .  . back .  .  .  to a much earlier time .  .  .  . think of mentors  with shiny metal  moving easily  resonant  pleasant voices .      jeff .     fargo   s voice was urgent .     norby .  the two of you  come out of it .         what .  .  . what .  .  .  .     jeff came to  blearily .     what   s wrong .         i   m not sure .  you two have been still and silent for half an hour .  you didn   t tell me how this works  either of you .  does it take you that long to do it .         i don   t know .  didn   t anything happen .         nothing at all .  i had a momentary sensation of dizziness at the start  but it passed  and here we still are and there jamya still is .      norby was quite conscious  too  for he made a snorting noise and pulled his wire out of the computer .     of course  we   re still here and jamya is still there  but the position of its sun is different .  it   s now spring in the continent where the dragons live  a long ago spring .         you mean we   ve moved back in time .         of course .         in that case     said fargo .     get out of my chair  little robot  and let me take us down to this planet of yours .      he put oola on the control room floor  where she sat placidly  and licked herself like a cat while still looking like a beagle .   down they went  skimming across the jamyn continent .   jeff said     can you find zi   s castle  norby .  you did that two times before without trouble .         in our time  jeff .  the castle doesn   t exist at this time in the past .         i mean .  .  .  . locate the place where the castle will some day exist .         i get no feel for it     said norby  sounding worried .   the hopeful skimmed low over the planetary ocean and headed back over the continent again .      trees .  lots of trees     fargo said .     those sea creatures that looked up at us might be interesting .         no     said norby sharply .     the mentors chose land creatures to civilize .  maybe we went back too far .  maybe there   s no animal life on land at all .         not likely     fargo said     when it   s so richly forested and vegetated .  see  there   s a group of animals below in the grassland .     he sent the hopeful downward in a sharply banked curve for a closer view .     they look something like bipedal dinosaurs  but i don   t see any sign of wings .         that   s odd     said jeff .     they don   t even have them furled .  i think they don   t have any wings .      the hopeful came in for a quiet landing and rested upon the grass at some distance from the herd .  fargo moved to open the airlock .      hey     said the ever cautious jeff     aren   t you going to analyze the air outside .      fargo paused .     you   ve been here  haven   t you .  and you breathed .  and you   re alive .         that was at a different time .  why don   t you ask the computer .         oh  well .     fargo looked pained .     what   s the air like .      the computer said     breathable .  there are plant seeds and spores to which allergies might exist  but i can   t test for that without more information .         we   ll chance it     fargo said  as he picked up oola .   they moved out on the grass  which was waving in the wind .  it was rather cool  but jeff remembered the glacier and decided that he could get along easily with this kind of coolness .   jeff said     i   ll just step over there and speak to the dragons .  i can speak jamyn  you know .         look out .     yelled norby  tugging at jeff   s pant legs .   the dragons were approaching en masse  and at a run .  they were also speaking  but not in jamyn .  their language  if it could be called that  consisted entirely of loud roars  screeches  and hisses  punctuated by little puffs of smoke from their nostrils .      jeff  old boy     said fargo  trying to control oola  who was snarling and barking alternately .     these are not friends of yours .  it   s my opinion we had better get back into the ship at once .      without arguing the matter  they did so  shutting the airlock behind them .      i thought you told me that the dragons were smaller than human beings     fargo said .   these were as big as the hopeful .  in the viewscreen  they could see the dragons swarming over the ship  trying to find a place to bite .  their fangs sounded like jackhammers upon the hull .      fargo     jeff said     i don   t think their teeth are made of ivory .  they look shiny  as if they were made of metal  or of diamonds .         you   re right  jeff  and they may damage us .     he moved to the controls .     we   ll have to get away .         they aren   t speaking jamyn     said norby unnecessarily .     i don   t think they   ve ever been civilized .      fargo moved the hopeful slowly upward on antigrav so that the dragons clutching at the hull gradually peeled off .  the huge animals were now spouting flames in their frustration .  fargo seemed fascinated .      from a whiff i got outside     he said     i think they make their flames by splitting hydrogen sulfide .  .  .  .         the computer says the hull is heating under those flames     said norby .     we should get back into orbit .      again there was no attempt to argue the matter  and the ship rose precipitously .  when it was safely in orbit  the three had another conclave  while oola chased her tail round and round in the control room .      my feeling is     fargo said     that we did get back to a time before the others  even before the mentors created a civilization on this planet .  we went backward in time too far .         i think that   s my fault     jeff said .     not norby   s .  he did very well .  it   s just that when norby and i were linked and trying to move backward in time  i felt some kind of fear  and perhaps that threw us off .         you weren   t feeling my fear     said norby  sounding outraged .     i was certainly not afraid .         no  no     said jeff .     you don   t understand .  you see  i was thinking of the mentors very hard .  and i felt something about them that i must have felt when i was in their scanning room  but didn   t realize i   d felt because i was too full of my own fears .  do you understand what i mean .     he looked at fargo helplessly .   fargo said     sure  but what was it you felt without knowing you felt it .         it was the mentor who was afraid .  i was feeling its fear when we were trying to move in time .         was the mentor afraid of you  do you suppose .         no .         of the others .     norby asked .      i don   t think so     said jeff .     the mentor was awfully afraid  though  and he needed me .  i don   t know what for  but it had something to do with his fear .         if he is afraid of something and needs your help     fargo said     it doesn   t seem to me he can afford to do us any harm .      sounding doubtful  jeff asked     should we go forward  then  and see if we can find the young mentors .         can we .     said fargo with a grin .     it   s up to you two .         let   s try again  jeff     norby said .     maybe there   s nothing to fear .  maybe it was only mentors    fear that made you afraid .      jeff almost said     you were more afraid than i was     but he pressed his lips together and didn   t say it .  instead  he held out his hand .     sure     he said     let   s try again .      half an hour later they gave up .      no dizziness  no nothing     said fargo .     i guess we   re still in the same time .         well     said norby     it seems to be very different to go into a time i   ve already existed in .  it   s easier to move to a time earlier or later than when i   ve been there .  do you know what i mean .  i tried to push us all forward until we were well past where the mentors showed up  but i couldn   t seem to do it .         in that case     said jeff  with a sinking feeling     that would mean that you  or parts of you  were present on jamya sometime after the mentors appeared  just as you thought you might be .  i guess you   re really jamyn .         i suppose so     said norby .     it   s exciting  isn   t it .      jeff didn   t think so .  but all he said was     can you slide forward only a little into the future  before the time when you were constructed .         i can try .         i can see where it   s difficult to move to a time where you   ve already existed     fargo said     because one of the big paradoxes of time travel involves the possibility of meeting yourself .  still  why don   t we go really far into the future and find out what happened to us in the jamyn historical records of the future  so that we   ll know what to do to fix everything up .  that would be exciting .         that sounds like another paradox to me     jeff said  sounding unhappy .     i don   t think we can do that .  the future isn   t all written out .  suppose we find out that we were killed when we went back to jamya .  then we would be in despair and give up and that might be why we were killed .         i don   t understand that     said norby     but i don   t want to be killed .         don   t worry  little robot     fargo said     we won   t let that happen  but i see jeff   s point .  all right  norby  just move us up into the nearest part of the future you can manage  shortly after the mentors begin to work .      jeff and norby tried again .  this time jeff visualized a young mentor and tried to feel full of confidence .  he was distracted because oola suddenly began to howl like a lost hound .      hush  hush  my beauty     said fargo  stroking her long ears as she sat quivering  pressed against his leg .  she stopped howling  but she whimpered instead .   jeff was about to say     let   s try it again  norby     when fargo cried out without any trace of his usual humor .     wait .  she   s gone .  oola   s gone .                 not dangerous enough .      jeff looked about in astonishment  and the viewscreen caught his eye .  jamya was much closer .  norby must have been clever enough to move them nearer to the planet as they moved in time  presumably to put them inside the force screen once it was set up .  but what about oola .  she certainly was not in the control room .   jeff said     maybe she   s in the sleeping quarters .  maybe we all blacked out .      but fargo was already out of the room searching .  a few minutes later he was back  his face deeply troubled .     she   s not inside the ship .         oh  my     said norby .     i never thought of her .         you mean you forgot to bring her forward with us .     jeff asked .  then  when norby failed to answer  jeff shook him .     well .  say something .         don   t rattle my works     norby said .     i   m trying to figure it out  and getting me all jarred inside doesn   t help .  it   s not my fault .  i suppose she exists in this time somewhere and it was  therefore  much more difficult for the oola of the future  our oola  to exist here than for us .  and i didn   t allow for that and she couldn   t come along  i think .         if that were so  we could find her here  in this time     said fargo .      what time is this time .     jeff asked .     when are we .         i don   t know     said norby in a querulous tone .     i get all mixed up with all these crises and with getting shaken and everything .      fargo and jeff looked at each other .  jeff said     it   s my fault  fargo .  i should never have suggested time travel  at least not involving you and oola and the hopeful .  norby and i should have taken our chances alone .         don   t be foolish     fargo said .     you couldn   t leave me out of this .  we   ll just find oola here and now .         yes  but that will be before she was put into suspended animation and before we released her from the hassock capsule  and she won   t remember us .         then she   ll learn about us allover again  or  rather  all over previously  for this time is long before the time we got her .         we don   t even know how long before     muttered jeff .      it   s not my fault     shouted norby .      it doesn   t matter     fargo said .     we have to explore the planet  oola or no oola .  knowledge is better than ignorance  even if it   s sometimes more uncomfortable  so down we go for a landing .           there   s the castle .     jeff said  as the hopeful skimmed along above the treetops after a number of passes over the continent  with norby guiding them very uncertainly .   norby said     see .  didn   t i tell you i could lead you there .         on the twenty fifth pass     said jeff .      the tenth     countered norby .     maybe the ninth .  you don   t know how to count .      jeff remembered that he wanted to be nicer to norby .     that   s true .     he said .     you did a very good job .      but norby just said     huh .      jeff said     i don   t see any of the small buildings where dragons like zi live  just the big castle .         that   s a good sign     said fargo .     you can see a number of huge robots there  and they   re all busy doing something or other .  the small buildings haven   t been built yet  i suppose .  maybe the small dragons haven   t even evolved .         yes     said norby .     everything has just begun .  all the mentors are new .         oh .     said jeff .     if you know that  why did you tell us you didn   t know what time it is .         because i didn   t     said norby indignantly     but that doesn   t mean i can   t use my eyes .  look at those robots .  can   t you see that they   re shiny .  they   re nothing like those old wrecks you and i saw in the castle when we were there before  i mean later  i mean before in our lives but later in time .         i know what you mean     said jeff and fargo  speaking together .   the robots were watching them as the hopeful sank to rest just before the castle .  the biggest signaled to the rest  who went inside the castle .  then the one remaining robot walked up to the ship .      message from outside on my radio pickup     said the hope . ful   s computer .      let   s hear it     said fargo .   it came promptly in forceful  clearly enunciated words     strangers  you have entered our planetary space without permission .  speak and reveal yourselves and your purpose .      the language was  of course  jamyn  and norby translated for fargo .      i think it would be more polite to answer from the airlock  in person     said fargo .     it shouldn   t be too risky .  the airlock door can be closed quickly if the mentor makes a sudden move .  and since you speak jamyn  younger brother  you   ll have to be the one to take the chance .         maybe i should be the one to do it     said norby     i speak jamyn like a native .         no     said jeff  who didn   t like norby   s reference to being a native .     i think it would confuse the mentor if you appeared .  he   s probably never seen a robot like you  and if he can sense that you are part jamyn  he   ll wonder how you came to be on this spaceship .  i don   t think it   s a good idea for them to find out we   re from the future .  in fact     jeff frowned and shook his head     suppose we do or say something that changes the future .         just being here and being seen may have done that      said fargo     but what   s the difference .  now that we are here  let   s see it through .  these robots may look like newer versions of the ones you met in our own time  but they don   t give me the impression of being aggressive .  they seem reasonable .         i don   t know what you base that on  fargo     said jeff     but if you really think so .  .  .  . hey  look at that .  there   s oola .      oola  or a creature exactly like the one who had originally emerged from the hassock  bounded out of the castle and stopped beside the mentor who had spoken .  she wagged her tail .   jeff said     she must have realized we   re here .         no     said norby .     don   t be ridiculous .  you two haven   t been born yet .  she can   t possibly .  .  .  .         and it might not be our own oola     said fargo  sounding a bit depressed at the thought .     there are probably lots of all purpose pets on this world  just as there are lots of big robots .  presumably  they   ve only just begun to unpack the little gardening robots and those police robots you saw running around the castle .      the computer said     the message from outside has just been repeated a bit more forcibly .         we   d better get going     said jeff with a sigh .  he opened the airlock and stood just inside the outer door .  he smiled in what he hoped would seem like a friendly fashion  then he remembered that on earth some animals thought baring the teeth was a sign of hostility .  he looked serious at once and said  in jamyn     i greet you .         ah     said the mentor in a deep voice .     you know our language .         yes     said jeff .     we are friendly people who are interested in this world which we have come upon in our travels .  we hope you will help us by explaining what your world is like  who you are  and what you are doing here .     he spoke very slowly  trying not to make any unfortunate mistake in his jamyn  and trying also not to give away too much about themselves .  behind him  he could hear norby translating for fargo .   the mentor stared at jeff as though it were uncertain what to say in response to the boy   s bold statement .  and while the silence held  the all purpose pet suddenly changed her shape .      what   s she doing .     asked fargo in a whisper from behind him .   jeff whispered .     i was trying to concentrate on her because looking at the mentor makes me a little nervous  and it just occurred to me that our oola had never gotten round to looking like a bear and this one changed immediately .      the mentor looked down at the all purpose pet who might or might not have been oola .  the little bear was sitting on its haunches and waving its forepaws at jeff .      interesting     said the mentor .     according to data left in our main computer by those who made us  there were creatures in the form of this little one  but much larger  on an icy planet they visited .  there were also creatures rather like you in appearance whom they took to another planet for a suitable civilizing procedure .  are you those specimens .         no     said jeff .     we travel on our own .  did your makers take a cave bear  too  the creature that  in form  was like the one beside you  now .         they did indeed bring specimens of various animals for us .  we  i  bioengineered some creatures into this all purpose pet .  some resembled the shape she had when she came out of the castle .  the originals had large and undesirable fangs .  i constructed something smaller and more affectionate  altogether more suitable as a pet .         fargo .     said jeff  turning back to him .     i think oola may have been bioengineered from a saber toothed tiger  a smilodon  but there may have been some cave bear thrown in  along with other ice age .  .  .  .      the mentor interrupted him .     it is impolite to talk in another language that we do not know     he said in reproving tones .      i   m sorry     said jeff  and he tried to explain about oola  but succeeded only in getting muddled in his attempt to avoid mention of time travel .  that proved useless under the penetrating stare of the large robot .      i think i understand     said the mentor .     i doubt  though  that these animals you speak of  smilodons and cave bears  are your contemporaries .  you do not speak of them as though that were true  and you are sufficiently different in behavior from the specimens taken by our makers to make it reasonable to suppose you are from the future of that planet .  if you are  do not tell us anything about the future  because we do not want to know .         smart robot     muttered fargo  when he heard the translation .      we are in trouble     said jeff  carefully refraining from comment on what the robot had said about the future .     we need to know who you are and what you are doing on jamya .         we mentors     said the robot     were activated by the main computer in the castle .  it is our task to bioengineer the most promising species on this planet and to train them to become civilized and self sufficient .  you have met the jamyn .         we   ve seen them .  large animals .         too large .  and too stupid .  we   ll change that  though  for they have definite possibilities .  for that  we need a simple planet like this with one landmass and one intelligent species .  we are here to keep  to keep  a home going .      the big robot looked down at his feet  as if he were emotionally upset .  jeff thought it wasn   t any wonder that norby had emotive circuits .      a home for the others .     jeff said .   the robot   s huge head turned up to jeff .     you know of the others .  i referred to them only as our makers .         only that they exist .  what are they like .  when will they return here .         i am disappointed     said the mentor .     i had hoped you would know .  before they left the castle and its computer on this planet  jamya  they erased from the computer all knowledge of their appearance and former history .  all that is left in the computer is the bare fact that they existed  and were here for a time .  after they left  the computer activated us and we began our work  but we wonder about the others .  we would like to know the organic creatures who made us .         how do you know they were organic .  perhaps they were robots  too .         there is physical evidence that they were organic .  there were the remains of food preparing machines .  there were cremation ashes which we analyzed and which seemed to show residues of proteins and nucleic acids such as those in the living creatures of this planet and  no doubt  in you .         could you deduce anything about the appearance of the others .         they could not have looked like you because your bodies have the wrong shape to use their equipment  but that is about all we can say .  it is a problem that bothers us considerably .         jeff     whispered fargo with clear worry     i think we   ve got to know .  ask him if the others bioengineered the primitive human beings they found on ice age earth  and if that   s what he meant by saying we were different from the people that were found there .      jeff   s hands went cold at the possibility that the human species was the product of interstellar meddling  but he put the question to the mentor in carefully phrased jamyn .      you seem concerned at the possibility  small organic friend     said the mentor     if i may call you that .  by now  i have sensed your friendship and good will .  there is no record that the others did anything to your people except remove a few specimens to educate and put on another planet  we don   t know where .  it is only jamya that seems to be getting special treatment .  we hope it is because the others want it for their own home .  for that  we mentors get it ready .      jeff felt intense relief that the difference the mentor had detected had lain in their wearing textile material rather than furs  or something like that .  and then he felt silly .  the evolutionary record of mankind was too smooth to suppose there had been outside meddling .   he looked down at the all purpose pet .     did the others want you to develop an all purpose pet .      the mentor took a step backward .  its eye patches dimmed .     no  that was my idea .  it seemed to me that a mentor might enjoy a pet .  i also thought that some of the offspring of such a pet might be useful as exchange items in dealing with visitors to this planet  but then i found instructions left by the others forbidding trade .  it turned out the others had also placed a force barrier around the planet to keep outsiders from coming here .  that was one of our concerns when your ship suddenly appeared .  how did you jump the barrier .      jeff said     we have a special ship that can come or go through hyperspace anywhere .         i hope     added norby in a small voice .   fargo poked jeff .     ask if we can exchange something for the all purpose pet .  i want oola back .  i have this craving for that little thing .  funny  considering the short acquaintance .         you spoke of using your pet for trade  exchange with outsiders .  is there anything we can exchange for the creature .     began jeff .     we have .  .  .  .      but the mentor   s eye patches shone red  and jeff stopped .      no .     the mentor snatched up his pet and held her in his lower two arms .  the upper two arms were drawn up  fists clenched .     i said i would exchange some of her young .  she has not had any yet and i do not yet know if she can have young .  so i am going to keep her .  she is my experiment .  i am different from the rest of the mentors .  i am  innovative .      jeff felt he had better change the subject .     do you have a name .     he asked .      i am first .         ask about me  jeff .     said norby .      mentor first  do you have any small robots .         those you see  for gardening  for construction  for discipline with respect to organic creatures  and so on .  they are not intelligent  but they obey our commands .         do you have any others we don   t see .         no .         do you take commands from the main computer in the castle .         no .  we are self controlled under my general guidance  of course .  the castle computer does not have the consciousness we do and it is merely our tool .      jeff could not help thinking that the robot seemed very proud of its own superiority to all the others  and that it was this that led it on to giving information freely  information that might turn out to be useful .   it was almost as though mentor first caught a whiff of this thought  for he said     you ask too many questions .  you disturb my peace of mind  and your presence here and the thoughts you have induced in me may change the future .  i will ask the castle computer to wipe out the memories of you from my mind .      the mentor   s eyes flared red once more .  odd metal eyelids drew up from the bottom  covering the eye patches completely .     go back to your own time  or we will take forceful measures to destroy you .      there was the feel of danger  and to jeff it seemed only sensible to retreat into the ship and shut the airlock door .  in the viewscreen  he could see mentor first standing there  waiting for the ship to leave  while norby was translating to fargo .   jeff said  looking a little shamefaced     i   m sorry  norby .  we didn   t find out about your origins  or about the others  except that they were organic and not robots  but it   s getting dangerous here  and i   m sure we might end by changing the future .      fargo hesitated  then he strode to the control room chair  seated himself in it  and called out     norby .  come here and plug yourself in .  we can go back to our own solar system  in our own time  and do some exploring for mcgillicuddy   s asteroid  the one where he found your alien ship .  that will keep you out of the hands of the inventors union  and it might be more exciting than this .          wasn   t this exciting .     jeff asked .      what .  a reasonable conversation .  very tame .         isn   t it exciting to learn things .  when the mentors were new  they had no robot like norby  that   s why he can be here .  but mentor first bioengineered oola for himself and is emotional about her .  and she   s here  which is why our oola couldn   t be here .  but that still leaves the problem of why the mentors became so angry and villainous later in time  and we ought to find out why .      fargo said     that mentor first of yours seems to be getting angry and villainous .  he   s ordering up some machinery and it may be some sort of weapon .         then let   s leave     said jeff     but let   s go back to our present time in jamya .         yes .     norby said  loudly .     i want to find out why i was made .  the mentors here don   t know about me  but i   m sure part of me is jamyn .  i know i was never part of these gardening robots because they don   t have emotive circuits or imagination .  jeff  take my hand  and i   ll try to move the whole ship forward in time to when you and i left jamya .         well     said fargo  settling back in the chair with a shrug     back to something old .  everything will continue to be tame .         you wouldn   t say that if you   d been inside the mentors    computer scanner     jeff said .     go forward  norby .  i   ll visualize the castle as we first saw it .      this time the ship itself seemed to shiver .      there   s a miniature dragon outside     fargo said .     i tell you again .  everything will be tame .                  not so tame        hello     said zargl .     you   re back .  you shouldn   t be .      jeff waved at her as he left the hopeful  followed by norby and fargo .  then he waved at zi  who was coming out of her home rather hurriedly at the sight of the ship .      this is my sibling  fargo     he said to mother and daughter dragon  pronouncing the name carefully .  he hesitated before choosing the jamyn word to describe fargo   s relationship to him .  there was no jamyn word for    brother     of course .   jeff then asked  with a fine air of casualness     how long have we been gone .         fourteen day nights     said zargl .     ever since you left  the jamyns have been arguing about what to do if you returned .  the mentors sent word that you are to be captured and taken to the castle if we ever see you again .  isn   t that exciting .  of course  they didn   t expect you to come with a ship and reinforcements .         which probably makes it even more exciting     muttered fargo  as norby translated softly for him .     maybe things won   t be so tame at that .  ask this pseudoreptile to bite me so i   ll be able to understand her language .         good idea     said jeff .     then if things don   t live up to your notions of danger and adventure  you   ll at least be able to tell albany that you were bitten by a dragon .  and you  norby  you can tell her how you missed by a couple of weeks again .      norby said haughtily     can you do better  jeff .      jeff  still mindful of his manners  said     no  i can   t .  true is true .  zargl  would you bite my sibling  just a little bit .  just a tiny little bit .      zargl said     certainly .     she came shyly up to fargo  and nuzzled his arm .     your sibling is very attractive     she said to jeff .      there you are     said jeff .     the girls always fall for him .      fargo smiled .     it   s to be expected .  no one can resist my devil may care attitude and my incredible charm .         it   s the way he shows his little teeth     she said  showing her own much larger ones .  then she nipped a bit of flesh on fargo   s forearm between an opposing pair of her sharp teeth .   fargo said     ouch     and frowned at the tiny droplet of blood that seeped from each of two delicate puncture marks .      there you are     said jeff .     the knowledge is transmitted by the blood somehow .  the bite is so neatly done  it won   t even bruise .  in a few minutes  you   ll be able to catch the jamyn words telepathically  and not long after that you will understand them spoken aloud  and be able to speak them yourself .      fargo waved his arm .     i wish they could teach differential equations that way .      zi  who had been looking at the hopeful very carefully  now pointed her right front claw at it and said     what   s that .         that   s our small scoutship     jeff explained .     it   s ours free and clear  in fact  it was all we had left when the family business failed a few years ago .  .  .  .         look at that       said fargo  with sudden energy .     jeff  do you see what i see .      jeff turned to look at the hopeful and there in the open airlock was a green creature peering up at the castle  and panting .      oola .     cried out jeff in astonishment .     i   ll bet she automatically joined us when we went forward in time past the point when we opened the hassock .         she seems to know the castle     fargo said .     look at her reacting to it .      zi said     i have never seen a creature like that before .  how can she know the castle if i have never seen her .         oola was inside your hassock     said jeff     the one you let us have .  she was bioengineered by a particular mentor named first .         first .     zi scratched her tail .     he is an important part of our legends .  the great mentor named first organized the construction of the buildings on jamyn  and carried out the instructions of the others for the civilizing of the jamyn and  as you see  did a very good job of it .  all jamyn are in awe of first and feel great respect for him .         and where is first  now .         no one knows .  perhaps he is still at the castle .  perhaps he was the one that spoke to you on my computer screen .         that can   t be     said jeff .     the mentor who spoke to me  and who saw me in the castle  was malevolent .      a bell chimed in the dragons    house .     excuse me     said zi .     zargl  come with me and begin the preparations of a meal for our guests  while i find out what the grand dragonship wants .     in a lower pitched version of her voice  she said to jeff and norby    it is a great honor for her to call upon a mere congressperson such as myself    .  she seemed to breathe quickly at the thought of it .   left to themselves for a moment  jeff said in terran basic     fargo  things seem no different here than when we left .  zi remembers our previous visit just as we do .  doesn   t that mean that our visit to the past of jamya didn   t change anything .         let   s hope so     fargo said .   norby  however  teetered nervously on his partly extended legs .     i can tell  jeff  i can tell .  i can sense that nothing important has changed .  mentor first must really have had his memories of us wiped out .  and that means that the mentors in the castle right now are still crazy and mean .         good     said fargo .     maybe that will mean a chance for us to be battling real nasties .      zi came out of her house carrying a little table  and zargl followed with dishes of food .     you   ll have to sit on the lawn     she said .     please accept my apologies for that  but i have no furniture in my home that will fit your peculiar bodies  no offense intended .  even my hassock  my tail rest  is gone  for you have changed it into an unknown green animal .  still  it   s such a lovely day  i thought you might be willing to have a picnic before the grand dragonship arrives .         a picnic would be very welcome     said jeff .     and i   m looking forward to meeting such an exalted person .         and she   s my great aunt  too     said zargl  holding up her foreclaws and making them quiver .     isn   t she  mother .         she certainly is  my dear child  and my own aunt .        half an hour later  they were all  including oola  finishing the meal .  oola kept looking up at the castle and twitching her tail when norby suddenly shot up on antigrav  his foot catching jeff   s ear on the way .      what are you doing .     asked jeff  rubbing his ear hard .      i want to hurry back to the hopeful      said norby .     i suggest you two bring oola and join me .  look what   s coming .      from over the trees at the left of the castle  came a strange airborne procession .  majestically  a retinue of jamyn flew toward zi   s home  and from their jeweled claws hung a glittering hammock that supported a dragon considerably larger than zi .      it   s my aunt     cried zi  clacking her teeth in excitement and respect .     please do not leave .  i so want you to meet her .      the hammock came overhead and was let down in front of them  dragons hovering about with a great swirl of wings to insure that it landed safely .      make way for her grand dragonship     shouted all the dragons in a medley of squawks that was totally unmusical .   when the hammock was flat on the lawn  the grand dragon stepped off it .  she unfurled her wings  each leathery portion brightly painted in contrasting colors  and shook them .  a diamondlike jewel adorned each point of the projections that went down her back to the tip of her gilded tail .      so  my niece     she said  holding herself high with her wings akimbo to make the colors show dramatically     you make friends with the enemy when i instructed you not to .         i   m sorry  aunt  your dragonship  but i do like these humans and their little robot .  and zargl and i had already made friends with them weeks ago  so it was already too late when your instructions came .  and see  they have discovered this green creature that was inside my tail rest  which they call by the interesting nonsense word     hassock .             you don   t understand     said her dragonship .     this green creature  as you call it  is the mentors    pet .  they have watched the situation through monitors and they have sent me to correct the theft .  otherwise we will be punished .         correct the theft .     asked fargo .     what do you mean by that .  the hassock was given us by your niece freely .         nevertheless     said the grand dragon     you two strangers and your ugly robot and this pet will be brought to the mentors .      norby said to jeff in a furious whisper      are you just going to stand there and let her call me ugly .      oola whined and became more like a beagle than ever .   fargo said     this pet is my pet .  it belongs to me now .         no  she doesn   t     screamed the grand dragon  stamping her foot  which was large and had wicked claws on it .     my guards will prove that by overpowering you .  .  .  .         that would not be sporting  your dragonship     said fargo .  he paused and bent down to norby .     have i got the right word .  jamyn is not an easy language to learn in a great hurry .         say it isn   t fair .  .   norby said in jamyn .     dragons don   t play sports the way you do  but they are fair .         surely  your dragonship  you have some more civilized way of settling a dispute than brainless force .     fargo smiled his most charming smile .   the dragon guards began to move toward him  but the grand dragon gestured them back .     this stranger appeals to our civilized nature     she said     and no one can appeal to that in vain .  it would be an insult to the mentors otherwise .      she smiled  too  her pointed teeth and front fangs showing to full advantage .  she adjusted her jeweled gold collar and stepped forward until she was only a few centimeters from fargo .  she was a little taller than he was  and  counting the tail  considerably bigger .      there .  it will be i alone against two of you and a robot .  it is three to one in your favor so it is you who will be uncivilized  yet i will personally bring all of you to the mentors .         is that indeed so .     said fargo  as he thrust out his chin .      fargo .     said jeff  reverting to terran basic     let   s just go with her .  .  .  .         never .     said fargo  pushing up his sleeves .      listen  you   re not going to try to punch her  are you .     asked jeff .     her fangs will tear into your knuckles .         fist fighting is crude     fargo said  adjusting his stance .     i   m going to see if i can use any of tl e defensive arts that albany has taught me .  i wouldn   t mind having a sword or rapier  though .  cold steel against hot fang  eh .         this isn   t funny .     said jeff .     you can   t win .      norby was ascending and descending on his telescopic legs  forcing his way between jeff and fargo and shouting     listen to me  you human idiots .  the jamyn respect tradition and authority and they never use force among themselves .         well .     asked fargo     are you trying to spoil the fun .         of course .  your kind of fun is no fun .  but there is something else .  .  .  .     he rose on antigrav and whispered in fargo   s ear .   fargo nodded  but did not change his position     en garde  sir  i mean  madam  your dragonship .     he moved into the ready to attack position .   the grand dragon snorted and little puffs of smoke came out of her nostrils .     there  you see .  you have made me revert to the primitivism of my ancestors  you have forced me to be angry enough to breathe fire .  you ought to be ashamed of yourself .          it would not be fair for you to use fire     fargo said .      i do not intend to .  i will cow you by the superior nature of my personality and take you all to the mentors  who will imprison you .      the grand dragon and fargo moved toward each other .  they began circling  feinting  and reaching .  suddenly the grand dragon lunged and fargo went head over heels .  the grand dragon drew back in surprise .  clearly  she hadn   t expected that to happen .   fargo picked himself up with a groan .     she   s quick .      jeff watched the battle with sinking heart .  karate against slippery dragon scales was not working too well .  fargo managed to trip the grand dragon  who seemed more surprised than ever when she went down  but once she got back  she retaliated immediately  saying     if you    are going to be aggressive  so will i .         the fight isn   t fair  your highness ship     said fargo gravely .     your arms are much longer than mine .  may i have a short stick .         certainly  since that will make all the more plain your uncivilized nature and force you to abase yourself to my higher culture .         norby     said fargo     go get the skewer in the galley .  you know the one that you were curious about the other day .  that ought to be about the right length .      jeff   s eyebrows shot up .  the object norby had been curious about had been an apple picker that fargo had bought at a tool sale  a sticklike device with a collapsible grasper at one end for plucking apples too high to reach by hand .  fargo would buy anything that was a bargain  however useless .  it was one of the reasons the family business had done so badly after the deaths of their parents .   the battle began again with fargo wielding the apple picker against the grand dragon   s sharp foreclaws  which  however  she wielded so carefully that fargo had not yet been scratched  .   they again circled and circled  reaching out  feinting  but the grand dragon was obviously getting angry over the fact that fargo had not yet admitted her superiority and given in .  she was puffing smoke in spite of herself and growing angrier still at this demonstration of her animal nature .  fargo took advantage of the manner in which her anger was disrupting her concentration .  as she lunged forward  he leaped to one side  caught her arm  pulled her forward  and down she went .      bravo .     said jeff .      stupid human being     muttered norby .     showing off  when i have told him how to conclude this ridiculous exercise in a perfectly simple way .  .  .  .         i   m not sure i should fight a female     said fargo  pushing back his hair     but there are no males on this planet for me to fight .      he stopped talking because the grand dragon was up  fire spurting out of her nostrils .      that   s very animal     said fargo  waggling his apple picker at the grand dragon   s nose .   she stifled the flame  but as fargo sprang forward  she unfurled her wings and elevated  then made a feint at him from the air .      unfair .     shouted jeff .      it certainly is     said fargo  reaching up with the apple picker  activating the grasper at the end and seizing the golden collar which circled her scaly neck  just as such collars circled the necks of every other dragon they had seen .  one twist  a pull  and the collar was off .      mine .     shouted fargo     spoils of war .     he put it around his own neck  where it hung loosely .   jeff watched what followed in amazement .  the grand dragon  instead of soaring majestically  began to flap her wings frantically .  the enormous effort broke her fall  but did not prevent it .  she landed on the lawn with a loud    plop    and in a most undignified posture .   her guards gaped .  zi and zargl hid their mouths with their claws .  norby tittered metallically .      what happened .     asked jeff .      this is an antigrav device     said fargo  touching the collar .     i   ve been thinking that the dragons must be too heavy to fly  especially with such comparatively small wings  and norby confirmed that .         that   s right  come to think of it     said jeff .     they didn   t have wings at all in their prehistoric history .  remember .         i do .  the mentors must have added them as part of their bioengineering program for esthetic reasons and perhaps to add stability in antigrav flight .     fargo elevated .     it   s done mentally .  one thinks    up    and there one is .  a great device .  probably norby has one incorporated into his own works .         of course  i do     said norby shrilly .     i keep telling you all the time i   m jamyn in origin  in part .         now     said fargo     i think i   ll pay a visit to the castle under my own steam and not as anyone   s prisoner .      the the grand dragon had recovered from the mixture of shame and physical confusion that had beset her  and now she struggled to her feet .  her guards rushed to her side as she screamed     get that stranger .  bring him down .         no     said fargo  skimming over her head .     i think not .  i won the fight fairly and you cannot try to upset the result without showing yourself to be most uncivilized .  you just sit there and recover  your majesty  while i .  .  .  .         no you don   t     said jeff .     not alone  you don   t .     he snatched up norby under his left arm and scooped up oola with his right .     we   re all going .  up norby  to the castle .                  villains .      as jeff and norby swept up and forward to follow fargo  who was already approaching the castle door  jeff saw that the grand dragon was vehemently ordering her guard back .  either she had taken seriously fargo   s stem comment about uncivilized behavior  or else she had decided it didn   t matter how the strangers were brought to the castle as long as they got there .   inside the castle  everything seemed the same as before .  the four intruders  two humans  one small robot  now on his feet again   and one all purpose pet  proceeded down the dark corridor .  around the sharp curve and into the auditorium  which was still lined by the silent figures of dead mentors .  oola was restless in jeff   s arms .      where   s the villain .     asked fargo .     i don   t see any live robot .       his voice echoed in the vast room  and no one answered .   jeff took norby   s hand  and then fargo   s .    let   s talk telepathically .  it will be safer  and perhaps private  but we have to touch each other  jeff said to their minds .     what   s that .  that was fargo  startled .     i   m sorry .  i forgot you haven   t experienced telepathy .  eerie  isn   t it .     certainly not .  that was norby .  his thoughts were loudest because he was designed for telepathy .  it is a perfectly natural way of speaking to one another if one has the talent for it .   jeff smiled to himself .    yes  but we human beings aren   t used to it .  do you sense anything  robot or otherwise  that   s alive in this building  norby .     i   ve been trying .  i think there   s a barrier field around this room at the moment .  i can   t sense beyond it .  it comes from the scanning section of the computer  part of which must be on the back wall  though nothing shows there .   fargo let go of jeff   s hand and walked quickly toward the back wall .  jeff ran after  pulling norby with him .  he caught up to fargo  and grabbed him .     don   t let go of us  fargo  or we can   t communicate privately .  and don   t touch that wall  or the computer may give our thoughts to the mentor .     jeff  you are fourteen and i am twenty four .  as your much older brother .  .  .  .     you can also be my stupid brother .  i   m the natural leader here  age or not  because i   ve been here before .  .  .  .    and you got yourself captured .  i   ve been working with the giant computers at space command so i ought to .  .  .  .   while they argued  neither managing to finish a sentence   norby withdrew his legs and arms into his body  elevated on his antigrav  and floated slowly to the featureless computer wall .  jeff and fargo stopped their mental conversation and watched him as he sailed up and down the wall  over and back .     what are you doing  norby .     he can   t hear you now  fargo  when you talk telepathically .  you aren   t touching him .     i forgot .  maybe you should be leader for a while  jeff .      i am leader     said norby out loud .     i can sometimes catch the telepathic drift  even when i   m not touching you .  this is my planet  after all  even if i can   t remember much  so let me try .         try what .     asked jeff .      try using my intuition .         do you have one .         not a human one .  i seem to have a built in imagination and the ability to make guesses and take chances .  or maybe being with human beings has taught me how to take chances  even though i certainly don   t enjoy it .  still .  .  .  .      norby   s feeler wire came out and entered a small crack in the surface .  minutes passed .  norby   s back eyes closed .  suddenly the crack began to expand and the wall opened like sliding doors .  inside was an opening covered by a misty atmosphere and around the opening was the mechanism of something that might have been a computer  though it was certainly like no computer jeff had ever seen .   jeff said so and fargo added     well i   ve seen a great many more computers than you have  jeff  but it isn   t like any i   ve seen  either .  what is that place inside .         that   s the scanning room  fargo     said jeff with distaste .     don   t go in .  it doesn   t feel good .      norby fiddled with the computer and the mist began to clear .   fargo said     there   s an old beat up mentor .  what   s it doing in the scanning room .      jeff stared at the huge figure within the computer .     i don   t know .  there was no mentor there when i was inside .      norby put out his legs and arms and walked back to jeff .     i must go inside the scanning room .  it is necessary .         aha     said fargo     your alien nature is coming out  norby .  you   re not planning to turn us over to the mentors  are you .     he did not sound as though he were entirely joking .   jeff fired up at once .     don   t talk to my robot that way  fargo .  he   s loyal to us .         are you sure .         he rescued me from mentors before  and i would trust him even if he hadn   t .      norby came closer to jeff and touched his hand .     stay here with fargo  jeff .       and thank you for trusting me  he added telepathically .   norby inserted his wire into the computer once more .  the mists began to swirl up as the protective field formed  but before it closed in entirely  norby hopped inside  withdrawing his wire as he did so .   jeff changed his mind at once  feeling oddly alone without norby   s funny barrel shape in his reach .     i shouldn   t have let him go  fargo .  it was a mistake .  we   ve got to get him out of there before he   s destroyed .         why should he be destroyed .  that   s not a very brave robot .  he wouldn   t go in there in a million years if he thought there was danger .         he   s plenty brave in a crisis .  besides  he may have miscalculated .  norby   s part jamyn and if the mentors made him  perhaps they will try to keep him  or change him or .  .  .  . i don   t want that .  i want norby back  just as he is  mixed up and all .         patience  patience     muttered fargo  studying the computer   s complex surface .  he touched a few spots .  nothing happened .      on the other hand     jeff said     maybe we should wait and do nothing .     he knew he wasn   t thinking clearly .  he wanted to believe that norby knew what he was doing  but with norby  one could never tell when his mixed up nature might rise to the surface .   fargo seemed totally absorbed in feeling the odd surface of the computer .  he also put his hand out to the mist at the computer entrance and drew it back quickly .     no entry .  strong barrier field .  the question is  can we undo it somehow .     he went on trying .   jeff finally managed to put it into words .     what if norby doesn   t want to come back with us  fargo .  what if he would rather be on his native jamya than come back to earth with me .  what if  and what   s happened to oola .  i put her down when norby went inside and now i don   t see her .         oola     called fargo .     here .  come to me .         woof .     she was still beaglelike in appearance as she bounded out of the shadows  ears flapping .  she sprang into fargo   s arms  licked his nose  and wriggled in her effort to get down again .      all right     said fargo .     you can get down  but don   t run away .  stay right here .      she sniffed allover the floor  as if she were looking for something .  then she followed a trail up to the scanner entrance  was blocked by the barrier field  and sat down .      oooo o o o .      jeff   s spine tingled at the sound .  oola howled more like a primeval wolf than a beagle .     she must miss norby     he said  hoping it was that .      i feel like howling in frustration  too .     fargo said .     i   ve fiddled with some things on the surface that seemed promising  and a few that didn   t  and nothing happens .  i can   t figure out this computer .  i just can   t fit my mind into the alien mind that constructed it .      oola stood on her hind legs and pressed her nose against one of the little panels marked irregularly over the surface .  the mist began to clear at once .      i touched that one     said fargo indignantly .      maybe it had to be touched by something cold and damp     said jeff .   norby was facing them at the opening .     i   m so glad to see you     he said .     i couldn   t seem to open the scanner again from inside  and i was afraid that you   d never manage to work the other side .  i felt very scared at the thought of having to stay in here forever  because i was having trouble getting out through hyperspace .  how did you remove the energy barrier .      his legs were telescoped out as far as they could go  so that he seemed to be walking on stilts .  indeed  he was walking  moving round and round the immense hulking shape of the silent mentor  who was sitting on the floor  with his eye patches covered .      oola did it     said fargo .     and what were you doing in there .         i was trying to wake him up     norby said  pointing to the large robot     but i failed .      oola bounded inside and  with one leap  landed on the mentor   s shoulder .  she settled down and yowled in his ear  her fangs growing and her body altering to look more tigerish .      she   s reverting to her original shape .     jeff said .   abruptly the mentor stood up .     she is mine .     he said .  his voice was harsh as if the mechanism for producing it was seriously out of order .  his body was covered with discolorations and dents .  he seemed even older than the first time jeff had encountered him .      if she   s yours     demanded fargo  sounding angry     what was she doing inside a hassock all these years .  you didn   t even know where she was .  you didn   t care for her one bit  and i do .  i claim her .  oola  come to me .      oola jumped down and stood between the mentor and fargo  looking anxiously from one to the other  her ears growing first longer and beaglelike  then shorter and tigerlike .   the mentor   s massive head turned to jeff .     you were here intruding before .  you refused scanning  and you would not help me .  you will be scanned now  you and this other creature like you .      fargo stepped between jeff and the mentor .     now just a minute  sir .  not only are you wrong about the all purpose pet  you are wrong about us .  we mean no harm .  we have come to find the origins of our own robot  part of whose mechanism may have come from jamya .  .  .  . norby  where are you .      norby was inside his barrel completely up against the computer .  only his feeler wire was extended and it touched the computer .   jeff ran to him     norby .  are you all right .  answer me .     he bent to touch him and got an electric shock .     fargo  something   s wrong .  norby   s tied in to the computer and i can   t get him loose .         release our robot  mentor     said fargo threateningly .   with that  the mentor   s eyes flashed red .  his two right arms seized fargo about the waist and held him up in the air .      monster .     shouted the mentor .     you interrupted me at important work and i may never .  .  .  . i will not endure this .  you will be scanned until everything you know and are becomes part of the computer and your body will be left an empty shell incapable of harming or disturbing me .      fargo stopped struggling because nothing could break the mentor   s grip .  instead  he laughed  and at that jeff shook his head .  it was fargo   s up and at    em laugh  and it never failed to create trouble .   jeff stepped up close to the mentor to try to reason with him  as fargo had so carefully taught him to do all his life  and as fargo so infrequently did himself .   it was too late .  still wearing the antigrav collar taken from the grand dragon  fargo rose in the air  carrying the mentor with him .  they swung out into the main auditorium  zooming up into the thick darkness of the high ceilinged room .      fargo  don   t .     jeff called  but fargo was out of sight in the gloom and did not answer .      norby  come out of it .  help me .  i can   t antigrav without you .         meow .     oola pressed against jeff   s leg and he patted her  absently .  as he did so  he became aware of the thin  expandable collar around her neck .      oola  can you antigrav .         rowrr .     oola   s fangs disappeared and she looked very much like a terran housecat  purring against jeff   s leg .   there were terrible noises coming from the darkness overhead  and jeff  feeling frantic about fargo  picked up oola .  holding her close to his chest  he bent his head to hers and thought  very hard  picturing a small cat going up in the air .   oola meowed once more  and jeff began to rise .  linking himself telepathically with a not to bright all purpose pet that had saber tooth ancestors was an interesting experience  but difficult to manage .  they went up and down  and finally sailed upward  a bit too quickly  toward the mentor .   the darkness began to separate into distinct shapes  and jeff could see that the mentor was still holding fargo .   fargo   s eyes were shut  his jaw grimly set .   jeff somehow guided oola that way .     don   t hurt my brother  mentor .  if you want me to help you .  .  .  .      fargo opened one eye     shut up  kid .  i   m under a strain  trying to do battle with this antiquated hulk  and i have no room to take care of you .         why don   t you just threaten to let go of your antigrav .         then i fall  too  don   t i .         just a little .  fall slowly and let him bang against the floor  then up  then down with another bang  and so on .     jeff had trouble getting the words out  so anxious was he that fargo understand .   the mentor understood .  he made a sound like gears grinding horribly .     i will let you go  alien monster  if you get me down to the ground .  don   t do as the other monster suggests .  i am nearly dead and i will be quickly destroyed it there is hard contact with the ground .      fargo looked at jeff .  jeff looked at fargo .      let   s go down     said jeff     nice and easy .     unfortunately  he didn   t count on oola   s reaction .  without warning  she jumped from his arms to the mentor   s shoulder and jeff found himself in midair without antigrav .   he cried     help .  i   m falling .      fargo yelled  too  as he desperately dropped with the mentor and tried to snatch at his falling brother .   jeff was trying to shrink back from the rapidly approaching floor when he felt two hard hands grab him .  they were not fargo   s  but the mentor   s .  jeff was hanging from the mentor   s left arms  facing fargo  who was still wearing the antigrav collar  and was still clutched by the mentor   s two right arms .   fargo cancelled the fall with such vigor that all three  four  counting oola  shot upward again .      wow .     said fargo  shaking his head to free his left ear from oola   s enthusiastic licking .     that was close .      he slapped jeff   s arm and grinned .     let   s all go down slowly  now  and have a reasonable conversation about this .  haven   t i always told you  jeff  that logical argument is better than derring do .         sure     said jeff .     you   ve always told me .  what you don   t do is show me .     his feet reached the floor and the mentor let go first of jeff and then of fargo .   the two brothers watched while the enormous robot  with oola resting comfortably on his shoulder  clumped slowly back into the scanning room  where norby still sat inside his barrel .  the mentor sat down and put his head in his hands .      suddenly  i   m sorry for him     said fargo in terran basic .     he   s such an old robot .         i think he   s mentor first     said jeff in jamyn .      yes     said the mentor  looking up .     how did you know that .         we came to see you  long ago  just after you had been activated to do your work here     said jeff  gently .  the mentor first they   d met then had been so strong  so gleamingly new .      surely you could not be alive for so long  we were activated thirty thousand years ago .  and i do not remember you     said the mentor .  he said this in terran basic .      you have learned to speak our language .     said jeff .      since you left two weeks ago  the computer analyzed your language and i have learned it  enough to know that you pity me .  an alien such as yourself should not take the liberty of pitying me  it is not your place to do so .  and yet  and yet i find it strangely comforting .  perhaps  now  you will help me remove this terrible fear i have .         what is the fear .     jeff asked softly .      when you would not help  i scanned you  hoping the computer and i could find out how you got to jamya .     the mentor   s head hung lower  and his body seemed to quiver .      what   s the matter .     asked fargo .     are you afraid of us .         no  no .  i am afraid of myself .  i am so seriously out of order that  at times  i am not in a position of mental stability  and the moments  of insanity  have come more frequently .  when my pet came back to me so unexpectedly  i felt myself becoming sane once more  but i don   t know how long that will last .  if i become insane again  you must leave me here in the scanner .  the computer is adjusted to deactivate me if i become too dangerous .      jeff was horrified .  suddenly the thought of mentor first as a villain seemed grotesque .  he was a sad and suffering machine .   jeff protested     but you mustn   t kill yourself .         i must  if i cannot be cured .  and i do not think a cure is possible .  i am too old .  all the other mentors have died  and i am too much alone .  caring for the jamyn by myself is more than i can manage and even my pet has been away from me for too long .  we have no means of entering hyperspace to refuel ourselves  you see .  the others wanted to isolate this planet  and they must have thought they would be back long before our enormous supply of fuel would be consumed  but they have not come back .         and you thought i came from hyperspace     said jeff     and could get you into hyperspace where you could refuel  and perhaps find the others .         yes .  it is as though you read my mind .  .  .  . but the disturbance in my brain has progressed too far .  it is too rate .  go away .         then have the computer release norby .  he can help .  norby .     shouted jeff .      i heard     came norby   s voice  and his head popped up .  he elevated on antigrav and hung in the air before the mentor .      i was exploring the computer  jeff     norby said .     i   m sorry you thought i was helpless in its grip and that you were upset by that  but i could not allow anything to interrupt me .  i   m done now  though  and i   ll be glad to help you  mentor first .  i will take you into hyperspace so you can refuel .      the mentor   s eye patches flared in a blue iridescence  but quickly dulled .     you .  a small alien robot .         i am not alien .  i   m yours .  you made me .  at least partly .  can   t you tell .         you don   t look familiar     said mentor first .     you are lying .         take my hand     said norby .     find the data in my mind .  it   s available now that i   ve explored the data banks of your computer .  i remember  and you will  too .      they touched  and while jeff watched  his heart thumping  the mentor   s eye patches began to brighten and he reached out his two lower arms to hold norby   s barrel .     you are the searcher     he said in jamyn .      part of it     norby said .     when you realized that the others might not be returning and that you could not go into hyperspace to find them or to refuel  you finally worked out a device that would go into hyperspace for you .     norby spread out his arms .     inside me is that device .         you never returned     said mentor first  softly     and i thought my attempt to build a hyperpenetrator had failed .         your attempt did not fail  and i found the ship the others had promised to send  but a collision with a small asteroid ruined the ship and damaged me .  i lay paralyzed for a long time until a human being named mcgillicuddy  a creature like these two with me  explored the asteroid on which the ship and i were wrecked  and found me .  he repaired a damaged robot of his own  using some of my parts .  since i have been in this new and beautiful shape  i have been drawn back to jamya over and over .  now i remember everything and can help you and at the same time  fulfill my original function .         it is too late  my son  i am dying .         no .  come with me to hyperspace and refuel .         i do not think i can .  i am too weak to refuel now .         i   ll do it  and channel the energy to you .     a wire extended from norby   s hat and touched mentor first   s chest .     now  father  join minds with me .  i will think of hyperspace  and together we will go .  .  .  .     norby and mentor first vanished .               pirates .      oola whined  her ears lengthening .  she slunk on her belly over to fargo .   stroking her ears  fargo muttered     poor oola .  i guess she   s tom between mentor first and me .  and poor me  because i guess if mentor first lives  i   ll end up minus a pet .         he   d better live     said jeff     even if it means you being petless .  and he   d better come back with norby intact  because without norby  how are we going to get home .  the hopeful will be forever stuck within the energy barrier around jamya if we can   t make use of norby   s mixed up abilities .         you   re right .  but let   s be optimistic .  when norby gets back  we   ll go out in search of the others  if they still exist .         or  if they don   t  we must at least find that wrecked ship of theirs that mcgillicuddy stumbled on .  no telling what information it might have on it .         either way     said fargo     whether it   s the others  or their ship  we   d better do the finding before anybody else in the federation does .         absolutely     said jeff .     we could use that knowledge as ransom for norby .  it   s norby i worry about .  right now  and after we get back home .      the two waited with increasing impatience .  then fargo said     this doesn   t seem to be an appropriate time for it  but i   m getting hungry .  how about you .      jeff said     i   m a growing boy  superannuated brother .  i   m more or less always hungry .         too bad .  part of the problem of being organic rather than metal is that one has to refuel so much more often .  do you suppose zi will feed us if we go down there .         sure  she   s a great hostess  but her aunt  the grand dragon  will try to chew us up .         let me try my charm     fargo said  sauntering out with oola in his arms .     charm or whatever  jeff thought a while later  it certainly worked .   fargo  collarless since he had restored her property to the grand dragon  had eaten and was now serenading her dragonship  who sat in royal splendor against the sunset light of jamya .  she reached out with one careful claw every now and then and ran it through fargo   s hair .      these are such pleasant scales     she said .     soft and fine .  how did you come to get them .         i have noticed     said fargo     that they have grown softer and finer since i have had the good fortune to meet you  your dragonship .      at this  the grand dragon made a gargling sound that seemed to signify gratified pleasure .  she was obviously infatuated with him .   with his melodic tenor  fargo had no trouble acting the part of a troubadour  and was now well into a peculiar translation of    god save the queen    which seemed to delight the grand dragon .   jeff lacked fargo   s ability to live in the passing moment  however .  he did not enjoy either the food or the song  for he could think only of the absent norby .  even zargl  who sat next to him and made fearsome faces at him in an apparent design to make him laugh  failed to cheer him up .   as the sun sank below the trees  the grand dragon offered to fly jeff and fargo to her palace where they might spend the night .  it seemed to the appalled jeff that fargo might actually accept the invitation  and he said     i think we had better stay in the hopeful  in case our small robot returns .      fargo  looking guilty for a moment  agreed .   but norby did not return  the night was very dark because jamya had no satellite and seemed to be in a section of space rich in cosmic dust that dimmed most of the stars that might have been visible in the sky .      fargo     jeff said  as he lay in the top bunk of their cabin .     i   m so worried i can   t sleep      only snores answered him .  fargo could sleep through anything .   jeff stared gloomily at the darkness above with increasingly dire visions passing through his mind  when he heard oola   s paws plunk against the floor and pad down the corridor to the control room .  apparently  she had leaped down from fargo   s stomach  where she had been curled up when the lights were put out .   jeff slid over the edge of his bunk  dropped quietly to the cabin floor  and followed her .      what is it  girl .     he said  scratching her behind the ears .  she must have changed into a cattish phase now  for her eyes shone in the dim lights from the control panels .   crash .  a falling object struck the captain   s chair  bounced to the floor  and rolled .   jeff put on the room light .  out of the falling object  half a head popped up and large eyes peered from under a metal derby hat .      norby .     jeff cried out in sheer joy .  the pleasantest sight in the world  it seemed to him  was the little robot appearing out of nowhere  even if he failed to make a good landing .  what other robot would be as clumsy as delightful  wonderful  mixed up norby .   norby said     sorry  jeff .  i was so upset i forgot to turn on my antigrav when i reappeared from hyperspace .  didn   t you get my telepathic message warning you i was trying to get back .         no  but i think oola did .         that   s very annoying     said norby .     we   re going to have to work on your long distance telepathy .  .  . but that   s for later .  right now  you   ve got to wake up fargo  and both of you had better help me take the hopeful back to the terran solar system .  after we refueled in hyperspace  the mentor first and i tuned into the others    supply ship and found it on an asteroid  but so have the pirates .  i came back here to get help .         what about mentor first .         he   s holding off the pirates  and i don   t know how long he can do that  so we   d better get to him fast .         did i hear you say pirates .     asked fargo from the doorway .      i   ll say it again .  pirates .  pirates .     yelled norby .     let   s get going .     he grabbed both brothers and all three ran to the computer .   the hopeful emerged in normal space next to the asteroid .      wow  from jamya slam bang through hyperspace to my own solar system .  and right on target  norby     said fargo softly .      have you stopped being mixed up .     asked jeff .      i   m tuned to mentor first .  getting us here was easy .  do you have any suggestions as to how to cope with those pirates who are trying to steal the jamya   s supply ship .  look at the size of it .      following norby   s pointing finger  jeff watched the viewscreen intently while fargo was whispering rapidly to the little robot .   another ship  tiny by comparison  but larger than the hopeful was anchored to the small asteroid .  jeff could dimly see the huge outline of a strange wreck on the asteroid  partially hidden by its irregularities .  on the asteroid  mentor first was confronting three men in spacesuits who were holding weapons .      but are they pirates .     asked jeff  doubtful .     they could be federation police .         no chance     said fargo .     those are known pirates  i recognize their ship .  they   re renegades from the inventors union .  up and at    em .         with what .     asked jeff .     the hopeful doesn   t carry weapons .         you   re not up to date  little brother .  admiral yobo insisted that once i became one of space command   s secret agents  my ship would have to be armed .  you and i will go out in suits and distract the pirates  and norby will plug into system g yy of the computer .  the computer will tell you what to do  norby .      norby was plugging in .     right  fargo .  are you sure you also want me to notify .  .  .  .         yes  those are my orders .  i   m certain     said fargo hastily  pulling jeff to the airlock and throwing him a space suit from the three hanging there .      fortunately  we don   t need antigrav in open space  or on an asteroid either     he added  readying the jet propulsion system of the suit .  he and jeff stepped into the airlock .      i wish you   d tell me what we   re planning to do     said jeff in exasperation  over the suit   s intercom .      just follow me .      jeff followed  landing between the mentor and the three pirates .      howdy     said fargo .     how about cutting me in on the spoils  boys .  if you   ve found anything  that is .      the pirates were clearly startled at the sudden and unexpected voice in their radio receivers .  apparently they had not been aware of a ship materializing silently out of hyperspace and into their vicinity .   one of the pirate guns turned on fargo and jeff  with the clumsiness that attended all movements in open space .      who are you .     demanded the pirate .      fargo wells  descended from an ancestor who was tarred and feathered in north dakota  american sector of the terran federation .  my buddy here and i are interested in what you found .  an old robot .         that robot   s alive  mister     said the pirate leader     and it   s dangerous .  if you want anything out of us besides destruction  you   d better get ready to help us .  that thing is holding some gadget that repels our force guns and produces a nasty shock when you get near enough .  if you two do something useful  maybe you   ll get something in exchange .      fargo said     sounds good  if you can really get something out of an old robot .  is that all you   ve got here .         the wreck of an alien ship  too  that the inventors union might pay a lot for .         why should they .  is there anything on the ship .         that   s what we aim to find out  and we don   t figure on delaying things with talk .  are you going to help us or do we poke holes in your suits and let out all that nice air .         as it happens     said fargo     we   re attached to our air .  my buddy here is a robotics expert  so let him approach that monster .      the three pirates touched fingers and conferred in sound  the waves being carried by the material of the suits .  the first pirate  clearly the leader  switched back to radio .      you have one chance     he said .     if you can handle the robot  fine .  if not  say good bye to each other real fast  because we   re not going to wait for you to say your prayers .      jeff used rocket microsurges to bring himself down to the asteroid surface and approached mentor first in the slow  swaying steps enforced by a nearly gravitationless world .  he touched mentor first and said  telepathically and in jamyn    hold on  first  fargo and i have come to .  .  .  .     i recognized your ship  said mentor first telepathically .  i am recharged and in much better health  but this weapon is nearly exhausted .  i have very few options .  i could tear off their suits and kill them  but i cannot bring myself to destroy living things .  it is against my programming .  and yet i must keep them from taking the ship .   the pirate leader said tensely to fargo     how did your pal get past the repulsion field .  and is he talking to that thing .  how can he talk to an alien robot .         maybe it   s not an alien robot     said fargo .     it could be an advanced experimental gadget of space command .  my pal would be able to speak to a command robot .  he knows martian swahili .      but while fargo and jeff had been engaging the attention of the pirates  the hopeful had been edging closer to the pirate ship .  now the hopeful plunged outward and away from the asteroid  dragging the pirate ship with it so the pirates would be stranded .      a force grapple     shouted the pirate leader waving his weapons furiously .     you tell your friends to bring it back or you both die .  you have one minute to convince me my ship is being brought back .         it   s mutiny     shouted fargo  shaking his gloved fist at the hopeful .     they   ve taken over our ship  stolen yours  and marooned us all .  killing us won   t get you off the asteroid now .  we   ve got to do something fast .  if you don   t have any ideas  i do .         like what .     asked the pirate .  his gun lowered as the uselessness of killing fargo penetrated .      we persuade this robot  probably a command robot  to join us and use him .  .  .  .      you talk martian swahili  too .         a little .      fargo  while still talking rapidly and ignoring the guns that were pointing at him  walked over to jeff and the mentor .  he put his hands on jeff   s suit .    it   s a great thing to have linguistic ability  to say nothing of dragon bites .  try to look as though you   re talking with mentor first  and follow my lead .   he called back on radio to the pirates  and said     my buddy knows how to push this big robot   s obedience buttons  so that   s no problem  and there   s something on the wreck    don   t know what  that will help us get those ships back .  my buddy has to get behind the wreck because there   s one piece of equipment .  .  .  .      he pushed jeff energetically in the direction of the wreck and continued to talk smoothly and persuasively  while the pirates  unable to decide what to do  had no choice but to listen .   hidden behind the alien ship  jeff found norby waiting for him with both small ships nearby .  he took norby   s hand  and telepathically asked    what   s going on .   norby responded    you know fargo .  he   s got it all figured out .  he wants you to take the hopeful and place it above the pirates .     what about you .     i   ll rescue father  and then i have to readjust the hopeful for some heavy duty lifting before we can lift the jamyn ship  norby said  moving off .   inside the hopeful  jeff took off his space helmet and sat down at the controls .  he did not have fargo   s touch at manipulating the hopeful  but spaceships were all but foolproof  thanks to the computers they carried  and jeff had had at least the preliminaries of an education in spacecraft control .   as the ship came over the pirates  jeff saw norby move up unnoticed behind mentor first  seize one arm  and then lift upward with increasing speed  taking mentor first with him  while fargo was busily and energetically engaged in pointing in the other direction .   norby slid into the hopeful easily and then helped mentor first get through the airlock .  fortunately the hopeful   s control room was large .   with deep concern jeff asked    what about fargo .         he   s next     norby said .   the little robot ejected himself from the hopeful and looking like a small metal barrel with a lid partly open  hurled himself at the pirates .   jeff could not tell what the pirates were saying or doing  but they had clearly noticed that mentor first was gone  and their guns were pointing at fargo  when one of them noticed norby speeding down upon them .   as the pirates scattered  norby grabbed fargo  zoomed away from the asteroid  and headed back to the hopeful .  and just then  jeff saw five ships of the command fleet approaching  their lights blazing like bright stars in the sky .               hostage     when the airlock closed  jeff quickly settled the hopeful behind the large alien ship while mentor first watched .      how was that for adventure and drama       fargo said jubilantly as he and norby came into the control room .      listen  fargo  when did you send for the fleet .     asked jeff with a scowl .      at the very start  little brother .         and why didn   t you tell me .         because it was going to take time for the ships to get here .  they don   t hypertravel  and i had to jolly the pirates along till then .  and you   re no actor  kid .  you   d have given it away and they   d have shot us down and taken off in their ship .      norby went immediately to the hopeful   s computer and began to work .   mentor first shook his odd shaped head ponderously and made a sound like grinding gears .  he said in terran basic     it is important that the wrecked ship be taken back to jamya .      he was holding oola  whose loud purr changed into a snarl .      doesn   t anyone approve .     fargo asked .     the pirates are beaten and the command ships will have prisoners .       jeff said     yes  but you heard mentor first .  we have to go back to jamya with the jamyn ship in tow .  we can   t allow the fleet to take it .  that ship is the supply ship the others had prepared for jamya  and it has the material needed to rebuild all the inoperative mentors .         my world     said norby     my people .  we can   t let the fleet have it .      fargo looked from one to the other and then shrugged     i suppose you   re right .  jeff  if you and norby want to link minds with the hopeful   s computer and hyperjump us with the jamyn ship  i   m willing .      norby was holding out his hand to jeff when admiral yobo  encased in a regulation fleet spacesuit  opened the control room door and walked in .  he stopped  stared at mentor first  who was even larger than himself  and said     someone may have to leave and make room .      fargo   s jaw dropped .     how did you get in .         sorry  wells  but surely you   re not surprised to know that i have the combination of every airlock in the fleet .  you   ve brought us three of the worst renegades on our wanted list and it seemed only right that i thank you in person .  .  .  .         that was not necessary  admiral .  .  .  .         and     yobo went on severely     i   ve come here alone to find out what kind of illegalities you   re engaged in .  you   ve got a large sized alien robot  i see  and an alien wreck next to your ship .      norby jiggled forward and backward on his two way feet .     we   ve got to go home  admiral .         yes  home     said mentor first .   yobo looked at the large robot with interest .     it speaks our language  too  and i suspect it belongs to the wreck .  identify yourself  robot .      jeff quickly stood between mentor first and the admiral .     this large robot is norby   s father  and we have to take them both home .         what are they talking about .     yobo asked fargo .      just what they said .         now see here .  .  .  .     yobo thundered .   jeff sighed and closed his eyes  reaching for norby   s small hand  while mentor first   s large one came to rest upon his head .  norby must have been touching the control board  too  because jeff could feel the ship   s computer becoming part of the linkage .  the augmented force grapple reached the alien ship .   then  through the sense organs of the computer  jeff could see the flagship of the fleet  hovering in space near the slowly turning asteroid on which the hopeful rested .   the admiral was saying something in an indignant shout  but jeff tuned it out  linking his mind to norby and mentor first  visualizing jamya .  the hopeful trembled slightly and left the terran solar system with the alien ship in tow .        ah  well     said admiral yobo  leaning forward to take the last cookie  after being assured that they were cookies     one can   t have everything .  i was thinking only this morning that i need a vacation badly  and i suppose a picnic on this lawn can count as one .      jeff grinned at fargo with relief  but fargo did not smile .  oola was reclining on mentor first   s lower arms while zi talked animatedly to him .  the grand dragon hovered near admiral yobo with a sparkling red smile because she had put ruby caps on her fangs in honor of the occasion .  on the other side of yobo  little zargl nuzzled his chest under his medals .      oh  admiral     gurgled zargl     you are the largest and most magnificent human being i   ve seen .  surely you are the leader of them all .         dragons or not     fargo said     that   s women for you .         you didn   t mind when she switched from me to you     jeff said .      that was just good sense .  this isn   t .  and look at oola making up to mentor first .         come on  fargo .  he designed her and he was her original master .  don   t be so jealous .         i   m not     said fargo .     i   m devoted to albany jones and she   s allergic to cats and that probably included modified smilodons .         you   re devoted when you remember to be     jeff chided .      i can   t help distractions .  i   m young  handsome  musical  brilliant  and  if we don   t get the admiral back to space command soon  unemployed again .      admiral yobo rose splendidly from the cushions which had been brought hastily from the palace for the enjoyment of the terran aliens .     gentlemen .  ladies .     he bowed to the grand dragon  whose emotions caused her to breathe so hotly upon his uniform that yobo was forced to move back a trifle .   he continued     this has been a delightful repast and i am proud to be considered as acting ambassador from the terran federation  but i   m afraid that we terrans must return to our own solar system .  by now  our fleet must be convinced i have been somehow destroyed .      mentor first  after some hesitation  held out his top right hand to the admiral  who  after an equal hesitation of his own  took it with his right hand .      it is generous of you     said mentor first     to agree so readily to leave the wrecked supply ship with us after it became clear that you had no way of taking it with you .         it   s called practical politics     said yobo     and is much practiced in the terran solar system .      mentor first said     now that you three have consented to the jamyn bite  and therefore understand our language  we make you honorary jamyn  co equal with the dragons and the mentors  the two intelligent species on this planet .         thanks     said yobo     but .  .  .  .         furthermore  we will work on our wrecked ship  and when we understand its hyperdrive mechanism  we will bring it to the federation as our gift for the start of trade between our two civilizations .         and that means  admiral     said jeff eagerly     that norby would be able to stay with me .  he won   t be in danger from the inventors union once the federation understands that we will be getting hyperdrive soon .         we also want miniantigrav     said yobo  his dark face solemn .      sir     said jeff .     i don   t want norby to be put in danger of destruction .  .  .  .         cadet     said yobo     i don   t either  in fact  you   ll remember that i came to warn you against the aims of the inventors union .  that  however  was before i traveled through hyperspace .  it   s a spectacular achievement  and the federation should not be deprived of this technique simply because of one unimportant robot .  we will do everything we can to inflict no permanent damage upon him  but norby must be examined by our scientists .         no     said jeff  i don   t trust anybody with norby .      mentor first put down oola  whose strange fur was standing on end .  he stood up  taller even than yobo .  the atmosphere of the party suddenly chilled .      norby is my son     said mentor first .     he can trust only me .  jamya is his home  and i need him here to work on the wrecked ship .         but mentor .  .  .  .     began jeff  only to stop as the mentor   s eye patches flared red .      norby will stay here .      the grand dragon  abandoned by admiral yobo  puffed out a cloud of smoke that set everyone to coughing except the two robots .  then she turned to lean heavily upon fargo   s shoulder and began to stroke her claws gently through his hair .      you are silly  all of you     she said .  i have a plan .         ma   am .     said jeff  hopefully .      have you all forgotten that none of you terrans can go home unless norby adjusts your ship to go through hyperspace .  you cannot go to your own planet if you leave norby here  so he must go with you .  in that case  we jamyns must take precautions to make sure that norby is returned to us unharmed  and before very long .         what do you suggest  madam .     asked yobo with an impressive roll to his deep voice .   the grand dragon put her claws around fargo and lifted him off the ground as she rose on her antigrav .     fargo will stay here on jamya as my hostage until norby returns safely .      before anyone  even fargo  could object  the grand dragon flew rapidly over the trees and disappeared with fargo in the direction of her palace .      norby .     said jeff     take me to the palace so i can get fargo back .         no     said mentor first  holding norby .     the grand dragon is quite correct .  if norby must leave  then fargo must stay here till he returns .      oola was acting strangely  her fangs lengthening and then getting shorter as she changed shape back and forth from tiger to beagle .  finally  she barked  whined and rose on her own antigrav .  she licked mentor first   s bulbous head  and as he reached for her  evaded his grasp and flew off in the direction of the palace .   mentor first folded all four of his arms .     so .  divided loyalty .         father     said norby .     oola and i are both mixed up .  she was made from animals that originated on earth  but she was made by you  a jamyn robot .  and i am part jamyn  and part a terran robot .  my loyalty is divided  too .         good     said yobo     then listen to your terran part and come back to cooperate with our scientists  norby .         no     said mentor first     listen to your jamyn part and  after you return these terrans  come back to help me .      norby closed all four of his eyes and withdrew into his barrel .   jeff wanted to say     please stay with me  norby     but could not .  norby had too many beings wanting him for their own purposes .     you want him not for any purpose but your love for him .  the thought was that of zi  who was touching jeff   s arm gently  and who had apparently sensed his thought .   jeff smiled at her and nodded .  he noticed that mentor first   s eye patches were still red  and that admiral yobo   s chin was sticking out grimly .     zi  we were all so friendly for a while .     the friendship is still there .  as is my friendship for you .     but mentor first and admiral yobo seemed filled with hatred of each other .  look at them .     then do something about it  young terran .  find a solution .     that is so easy to say  zi  but i can think of nothing .   jeff felt very young and very unhappy .  admiral yobo wants norby   s miniantigrav and hyperdrive  he thought .  mentor first wants his son  and to restore the other mentors .  fargo wants the freedom to have adventures .  and norby .   norby wants to be with a robot he considers his father  and that   s worst of all .  at least  for jeff it was worst of all .      mentor first     said jeff     how is it that only norby can fix things for you .  he   s not really good at it on earth  and when you first realized who he was  you called him    the searcher .     he was designed to find the wrecked ship  and he has now found it .  his job is over .  why can   t you repair the hyperdrive and work out its mechanism without him .         i cannot do that .         but you gave norby his hyperdrive mechanism .  how was that .      mentor first seemed to be trying to remember .     i installed norby   s device for refueling from hyperspace .  i know that .  it seems to me  though  that one of the other mentors  just before he became totally deactivated  was the one who actually installed the search mechanism that enables norby to travel through hyperspace .         but you were the mentor leader  with the best mind among them .  if the other mentor understood about hyperspatial drive  you must have  too .         i cannot remember     said mentor first .   jeff tried again .     well  then  what about the replacement mechanisms for all the mentors .  now that you have them at last  and can bring them all back into existence  why not do so and have them help you .      mentor first said sadly     thinking is not easy for me  i have been half demented for so many years .  perhaps you are correct  young terran  but norby is my creation  like a son  and still belongs here .      jeff bit his lip  while norby stayed in his barrel .  zi   s thought came again .     courage .  we dragons will help the mentors heal themselves .  it is time for you terrans to leave .     but when we are back home  norby will come here again and stay here .  he will leave me .     after all  that is his choice  is it not .   norby   s legs extended and he bobbed up and down .  his arms came out and rested on his barrel .  apparently he had come to a decision .      all right     he said as his head popped up     i   ll just take these terrans home  and then return .      already  thought jeff  we are nothing but a bunch of terrans to him and he doesn   t care about being my partner .  aloud he said     what about fargo .         he must stay as hostage     said mentor first .     i am sorry  but i cannot trust you  admiral .     .      nor can i trust you     said yobo  starting for the hopeful     on our way  cadet .  on the double .      jeff ran .  norby stumbled after  complaining loudly until he evidently remembered that he had antigrav  for he withdrew his legs and sailed past jeff into the hopeful just after yobo .   he didn   t even look at me as he passed  thought jeff .  he doesn   t like me anymore .      good bye  jeff     said zargl .      take care of yourselves     said zi .      and take this as my gift .      she spread her wings  caught up with jeff  and tossed him a gold collar .      don   t try to keep norby     said mentor first  his four arms folded against his heavy body .   jeff stopped at the airlock of the hopeful and glared back at the mentor .     just you remember to tell the grand dragon that fargo is my brother  and my best friend .      the airlock door closed behind jeff  and he heard a small metallic voice say     i used to be that .      jeff gulped .  past tense .  could he change it .               useful time trouble        i   m sorry  cadet     said yobo as jeff sat down in fargo   s chair in the control room .     i was perhaps a bit undiplomatic in the matter of norby  and i   ve alienated mentor first needlessly .         i would like to trust you  admiral     said jeff .      i would rather you understood me  cadet .  my first duty is to the terran solar system .  i want the secret of hyperdrive and i must have it before anyone else gets it  in particular  before the inventors union does .  the union was founded for praiseworthy purposes  i suppose  but it has been increasingly taken over by militant radicals  who want to use their inventions for the establishment of power .         do you suppose they plan a revolution and to take over the federation .         it   s my job as head of space command to see to it that they don   t .  and if i   m to do that properly  norby   s talents can   t be viewed as amusing toys anymore .  they have become vital .  we must have his secrets .         you   ll be killing the goose that lays the golden egg  sir .  norby  intact  would be far more useful to the federation than any of his parts would be .      they both looked at norby  who was plugged into the hopeful   s computer .      ready to go back to the terran solar system  admiral .     asked norby .      yes .  take me to space command spome .         do you need my help in visualizing it .     asked jeff .      no     said norby .      admiral     jeff said     please watch the monitor viewscreen closely so that you can tell us exactly where to go to drop you off .      once the admiral was occupied in that fashion  jeff leaned forward and touched norby .     you haven   t taught me long distance telepathy  so i   ve had to distract the admiral to keep him from watching us touch .  i   m sorry that we can   t trust him any more than we can trust mentor first .     my father is trustworthy .     they both are  under ordinary conditions  norby  but they both want something desperately  and that   s you .  they want to use your talents  find out your secrets  because for each of them  a world is at stake .     that   s true  jeff .  mentor first wants hyperdrive before terrans have it  because he is afraid of terrans .  i made the mistake of giving him a short telepathic course in human history .  he was particularly appalled at my personal experience with the lions in the roman coliseum .  i tried to explain that human beings have improved in behavior since then  but the fight with the pirates convinced him that you are all dangerous .     that was thoughtless of you  norby .  what you told him of us made him suspicious and defensive  which encouraged yobo to grow suspicious and defensive  and i just wonder if anyone will ever be friendly again .     you won   t have to be mad at me for long  jeff .  i   ll take you home and then bring fargo back  and then i   ll go to jamya where i   ll be safe .   jeff let go of norby and put his hand over his eyes .  i   ve messed things up even worse  he thought .   he was suddenly aware of something on his forearm .  he looked down at it and discovered that the gold collar zi had thrown to him circled it .  he had put it on absently and promptly forgotten it .      admiral .     he said  awed .     see here .  you won   t have to use norby .  this collar is a powerful antigrav device .  take it to your scientists and let them use it to work out the mechanism for mini antigrav .  and from that they might get hyperdrive without trouble .      yobo grunted and took the collar .     how does it work .      jeff said     imagine yourself moving up .      yobo did  and his head hit the ceiling with an audible thump .  he yelled and must have visualized dropping again  for he hit the floor with a considerably louder thump .  he sat there  looking pained .     i accept the mini antigrav part  but what makes you think that will lead us to hyperspatial travel .         fargo thinks it will .           fargo is not a theoretical physicist  but an overgrown adolescent .  i still must have norby .  my duty to the federation .  .  .  .         ready .     asked norby .     i can   t keep my mind properly adjusted forever .          just a minute     said jeff  thinking furiously .     i know you said you could hyperjump back to any solar system yourself  but i don   t want you to .  if you have to be taken over by the scientists of the fleet or leave earth for good  i must  either way  learn the technique of hyperspatial travel to the point where i can do it without you in a ship like this  adjusted for it .      quickly  before yobo or norby could say anything  jeff tuned into the controls of the computer and reached out to touch minds with norby .     you   re up to something  jeff .     you bet i am  norby .  take us into hyperspace  and then out of it to earth  like this .  jeff visualized it for norby  who chuckled .   as the hopeful leaped out of the space time of jamya  jeff felt the usual odd sensation inside himself .  it was much worse than usual  almost as though something had turned over in his abdomen  but that might only have been because he was nervous about what he was doing .   the admiral said     very good  we   re in the solar system .  but where   s space command .  i don   t see any spomes anywhere .         perhaps     said jeff     we missed the solar system .  we may be in the planetary system of another star .         nonsense     said yobo     that   s the moon over there .  it   s quite as usual .  and directly ahead is earth .  those are terran cloud formations .  i   ve studied them for decades .  and if there   s any question .  .  .  . can this visiscreen be adjusted for microwave emission and reception .  yes  i see it can .      he made the necessary adjustments .     we can look through the cloud cover and see the continents .  although clouds can be mistaken  continents cannot be .      even as he spoke  the swirls of white clouds that hid the blueness of earth   s atmosphere thinned and disappeared  and the earth   s globe turned into a circle of ruddy artificial color in which red continents showed up against a black ocean .   yobo   s breath came out in a large whoosh  as though he had been bashed in the abdomen .  it was a minute or so before he could say in a strangled way     there   s no atlantic ocean .  there   s one big continent .  if that   s earth  and it must be because the moon is still unmistakable  we   re     million years ago .      jeff stared at the viewscreen .     interesting .         interesting .     yobo didn   t quite gnash his teeth  but if he had had fangs  he might have shown them .     you and that idiot robot of yours haven   t just moved the hopeful across hyperspace  you   ve moved it in time as well .      jeff said     i   m afraid that   s part of norby   s mixed upness  admiral .  sometimes he takes you right where you want to go and sometimes .  .  .  .         sometimes he doesn   t .  that is horribly obvious  cadet .  since when have you known that norby gets mixed up in time as well .         well  he was reading history .  .  .  .      the admiral waved jeff to silence and shook his finger at norby  whose back eyes were staring at yobo with equal innocence .     listen  you jamyn robot .  did that sick mentor make you capable of traveling through time as well as through hyperspace .  is this something that mentor first planned .         no  sir .     the domed hat slid down until only the tops of norby   s eyes were peering out at the admiral in his wrath .     i think that mcgillicuddy did something that caused this talent of mine .         talent .  it   s a liability .         it   s norby   s other secret     said jeff .     the only trouble is that he can   t seem to go to any time period when he existed  at least not easily  and he can   t go into the future .         you mean we can   t get back to our own time .         oh  no  sir .  i mean he can   t go into the future from our present  the present we used to be in .  i mean .  .  .  .         i know what you mean  cadet .  don   t confuse me .  is this  talent  controllable .         not exactly  sir .  time traveling keeps getting mixed up with space traveling  and we hardly ever go directly where we want to .      the admiral sat down against the visiscreen  his huge shoulders slumped and an expression of dismay on his broad face .      tell me  you miserable robot and you ridiculous human being  is there any slight possibility of my being taken forward to a time when human beings exist on earth .         yes  sir     said jeff .     norby  let   s try .         aye  aye  captain     said norby  overdoing it as usual .   the hopeful shivered and shook  and so did jeff .  what if he and norby got things so mixed up that they were all lost forever .      i can   t see a thing     said yobo as he peered at the visiscreen .     you   ve brought us close enough to earth to be inside the cloud cover .  that   s dangerous  a little closer and .  .  .  .      jeff said hastily     i   ll bring the hopeful closer through ordinary space .  there   ll be no danger .      the hopeful poked her nose out of the cloud and the visiscreen magnified the ground .  they were over a continent  in fact  they were over a city .  in view were buildings and people .   jeff said     we   re back to human beings and civilization  admiral .       norby said     and the coliseum .  jeff  it   s roman times again .  we tied into where and when i was before  so maybe now i   ll get to see how that gladiator came out in the fight .  they took me to the lion cage just when the fight was starting .  big husky fellow  that gladiator .  reminds me of you  admiral .         you mean to say     said yobo  apparently suppressing a snarl     that your fascination with this period of history had caused what passes for a mind in that tin hat of yours to get mixed up and drag all of us into roman times just so that you would have a chance to find out what happened to a gladiator .         i didn   t exactly mean to do it  sir     said norby .     i mean  even if i   d intended to do it  i couldn   t always guarantee that i could .  it   s not my fault that i   ve got emotive circuits and imagination and special talents that get mixed up .  i can   t help being different from other robots .      jeff manipulated the controls of the hopeful and the little ship rose back into the clouds .  hiding a smile  he said     i think we   d better go someplace else .  we don   t want to be seen and cause any changes in history .         changes in  history .     the admiral mopped his brow .     i suppose that if our scientists tried to copy talents such as this  we   d end up with the constant danger of messing up the past and changing history in such a way that none of us would exist .         i think you   re right     said jeff .     maybe the whole human race wouldn   t exist .     he touched norby .     mission accomplished  norby .     right  jeff .  he   s convinced i   m unreliable .     well  you are  aren   t you .     not really .  it   s just that .  .  .  .     never mind .  now let   s really go home .   only they didn   t .      where are we now .     yobo asked weakly .      norby     jeff asked     where are we .      norby was plugging himself into various parts of the computer rather frantically .     i don   t know  jeff .  you got my emotive circuits stirred up and something   s gone wrong .         can   t see a thing in the visiscreen     said yobo .     everything is all shiny and vague .         the screen   s polarized     said jeff in horror .     the light outside is so strong that the hopeful is compensating for it by not letting it show on the visiscreen .  and the instrument panel shows that the outside of the hull is getting hotter and hotter .         i think we   re stuck  jeff     said norby  his voice tinny .      unstick us     yelled jeff .     we humans won   t be able to live much longer if the heat goes any higher .         neither will i     said norby .     i have delicate brain mechanisms .     .  .      then put them to work on solving this problem     roared yobo .   jeff   s head was pounding and he had never been so frightened in his life .     have we come inside a star .         no  cadet .  impossible .  we   d be dead in a microsecond .         then where .  .  .  . look  admiral  the readings show a gravitational pull on us .  we   re being dragged in  or down  somewhere .         i have deciphered the incoming data     said norby importantly     and this is the situation .  we are quite close to a star much dimmer than earth   s sun  close enough so that it is heating us rapidly and is pulling at us strongly .         and we are spiralling inward under that pull     said jeff .     norby  get us out of here quickly .         but jeff  my circuits are resonating improperly .  i can   t .      jeff touched him .     norby  i bought and paid for you  and until you go back to jamya  you are my robot .  join minds with me and we   ll both try to move the hopeful back into hyperspace .       but jeff  we   re both mixed up when it comes to time travel .     we tried to show how mixed up we were to fool the admiral .  but now we   re in trouble  and it serves us right .  so let   s try to move again and let   s try not to be mixed up .   they touched each other and the control panel and suddenly jeff felt as if he were the hopeful herself .   he was not jefferson wells .  he was not norby .  he was just the ship  fighting to save her life and the lives of three sentient beings she carried  and winning .      oof .     said yobo  rubbing his bald head .     that was a rough trip .         we   re out .     jeff picked up norby and jumped around the control room .     we did it .         this is our own time exactly     said norby proudly  his little arms waving triumphantly .      quiet .     roared yobo .     i see space command ahead  and i have never before thought it to be the most beautiful object in the universe  but i certainly think so now .  take me home .      the great artificial world of space command spome  the circling wheel of the fleet   s space home  for which    spome    was the universally used term   hung like a brilliant three dimensional pattern in the blackness of space .   in the distance was mars  around which the spome circled  and jeff could see the lights of the small shuttle boats going back and forth .  people took shuttles because the transmits were so expansive  but soon  with hyperdrive  human beings would be able to spread through the galaxy and establish a great empire of the stars .     maybe that   s not such a great idea  jeff .  jeff was still holding norby .     the mentors will be traveling  too  norby .  there will be room for both of us .     and i   ll be a sort of go between  won   t i .  i   m part both  aren   t i  jeff .      jeff laughed .     well  let   s assume an optimistic attitude  norby .  or at least have a sense of humor about it .  everything might go well .   but admiral yobo shouted impatiently     let   s get a move on  cadet .                  forever mixed     norby was gone .   jeff waited disconsolately in the old wells apartment on manhattan island  earth .  he stared out the window at central park  where the leaves were turning to gold and flame because it was now autumn .  the dying of the year seemed to resonate inside his chest and he felt as though something were dying within him  too .   admiral yobo had sworn strict confidentiality concerning norby   s other secret .  in fact  the admiral had shuddered and said     i will never mention to anyone that your robot is capable of time travel .  if he   s the only being in the universe capable of it  i would be relieved .  if even he were not capable of it  i would be still more relieved .         i understand  sir .         so we can forget about having our scientists go through him to dig up things too dangerous for anyone to have .  in fact  if he weren   t useful and your friend  i would be tempted to put him into a stasis chamber     he had said .      no  sir .  please don   t do that .      the admiral ignored the plea .     we can only wait and hope that the mentors will consider being friends with the federation and give us the secret of the others    hyperdrive .         i   m sure the fleet scientists will discover hyperdrive for themselves just as quickly .         probably .  they   ve already expressed optimism over the matter of the gold collar  and that   s the first step  i suppose .  just keep your robot out of their way so that there won   t be any missteps .      norby and jeff returned to earth from space command .  the admiral himself paid their transmit fees because he said he didn   t want jeff to risk going anywhere with norby through hyperspace .   and now norby was  jeff hoped  back on jamya  where fargo was  presumably  in the grand dragon   s castle dungeon .  he pictured his older brother looking wan and emaciated and longing for earth .  if only norby would be able to persuade the grand dragon and mentor first to set fargo free .  then if he could bring fargo safely back  and not end up with him on some other planet or in some other time .  .  .  .      ouch .     it was a familiar voice .      fargo .     shouted jeff in pure joy .     norby got you out of jamya .         hi  jeff     said fargo  matter of factly  picking himself up from the floor and rubbing his rear end violently .     what was your hurry  norby .     he asked .     i was just beginning dessert when you appeared out of nowhere and grabbed me into hyperspace .      fargo was resplendent in a crimson garment with a full cape that was spangled with gold slivers .  he wore a gold belt  crimson shoes  and a flashy diamond ring .  he did not look at all emaciated .  in fact  he might have gained a pound or two .      jeff was worried about you  i   m sure     said norby through his hat as he rolled across the floor  all his limbs retracted .  his head popped up and he righted himself with his feet out .     he probably thought that her dragonship had you imprisoned in the lowest dungeon under the castle moat .         imprisoned .  i   d been serenading her in the most impressive room in her palace and we were well into another banquet  so couldn   t you have waited till after dinner .         another banquet .     wailed jeff .  at fourteen  one feels hungry much more often than a twenty four year old brother can appreciate .      yes     said fargo .     a special feast in honor of a song i wrote especially for her highness .         fargo  old pal     said jeff  through his teeth     i don   t suppose you mind that i was concerned about you  but albany hasn   t been getting much attention from you lately .      fargo had the grace to blush .  he said     well  i   ll go and see her just as soon as i wash up .  you call her at the department and let her know i   m back .  oh  and i had time to grab a present for you before norby dragged me away into hyperspace and home .  here .      fargo tossed jeff something green and leathery that resembled a miniature hassock about the size of a baseball .      oola   s egg .     said jeff .     it couldn   t be anything else .         right on     said fargo .     this female pet will be yours .         no beagles .  not that i dislike beagles     said jeff hastily  because he didn   t     but i have wanted a kitten .         you may get one with saberteeth  if you   re not careful     said norby sourly .     that hassock grows slowly until the all purpose pet is ready  so you   d better keep it with you and influence it by thinking constantly of friendly kittens .  you   ll undoubtedly like it better than you do me .      jeff felt a leap of hope in his mind  but he tried not to put pressure on norby .  he opened his mouth to reply but could think of nothing .      close your mouth  jeff .  i haven   t finished telling you about all purpose pets .  when they   re upset enough  they grow a leather shell around them  and then you can   t get them out  perhaps for generations  until you sing the right song  and only they know what the right song is .         like the first oola     said jeff  turning the egg in his hands .      call this one oola two     said fargo .      i will .         huh     said norby .     i suppose our apartment will soon be overrun with green critters .         oh .     said jeff .     you said you were going home to jamya .         where   s home .     asked norby  shutting his eyes that faced jeff .  he stomped noisily across the floor to the main computer terminal and tuned it to a particularly idiotic puzzle game .   fargo looked at jeff  who gulped again and pretended to be absorbed in oola   s egg .  he could not beg norby to stay  nor order him .  norby was no longer his possession  but his partner  and the decision had to be up to norby alone .      maybe you   ve got two homes  norby     said fargo gently .     how about using both .      norby turned off the game and shut all four eyes .     maybe nobody wants me .      there was something in jeff   s throat and  when he tried to speak  he croaked .      well  well     said fargo  stretching .     i think i   ll have to leave this to you two to settle .  i   m going to wash and change my clothing .  albany believes in utilitarian clothing and disapproves of men wearing diamonds .         how about gold belts .     said jeff  getting his voice back .  out of the comer of his eye he saw norby   s metal eyelids snap up .  jeff took a deep breath .      oh  that     said fargo carelessly  unhooking the one he was wearing and tossing it to jeff .     that   s a special antigrav belt the grand dragon had ordered for me .  we   ll take turns at it until the fleet scientists design some of their own .      norby snatched the belt from jeff and handed it back to fargo .     no     he said .     you keep it  fargo  jeff won   t need this .  he   ll have me most of the time .      jeff let out the breath and picked up norby .   fargo smiled and said     i   m in charge of this family  norby  and perhaps i should have doubts about you .  it took you a long time to get the hopeful back to space command .  didn   t you almost lose my ship  and my brother and my admiral .         on purpose     said jeff  holding norby tightly     so yobo would see him as unreliable and not want him .      norby jiggled his head up and down in assent .  then he grabbed onto jeff   s arm and said     it gave me time to think  and i decided that i could visit jamya and my father  but what i really wanted after all was to stay with jeff .  he is my friend .         i see     said fargo     but i suspect that you   re just as mixed up as ever  norby .      norby said     i   m afraid so     and one of his eyes that faced jeff closed its metal eyelid in an exaggerated and tremendous wink .      norby     said jeff .     you   re my friend  too  and i want you just the way you are  forever mixed up .
