you talk of murphy and francis moore  gentlemen   said the lamplighter who was in the chair   i mean to say that neither of  em ever had any more to do with the stars than tom grig had .     and what had he to do with  em .   asked the lamplighter who officiated as vice .    nothing at all   replied the other   just exactly nothing at all .     do you mean to say you don t believe in murphy  then .   demanded the lamplighter who had opened the discussion .    i mean to say i believe in tom grig   replied the chairman .   whether i believe in murphy  or not  is a matter between me and my conscience  and whether murphy believes in himself  or not  is a matter between him and his conscience .  gentlemen  i drink your healths .    the lamplighter who did the company this honour  was seated in the chimney corner of a certain tavern  which has been  time out of mind  the lamplighters  house of call .  he sat in the midst of a circle of lamplighters  and was the cacique  or chief of the tribe .   if any of our readers have had the good fortune to behold a lamplighter s funeral  they will not be surprised to learn that lamplighters are a strange and primitive people  that they rigidly adhere to old ceremonies and customs which have been handed down among them from father to son since the first public lamp was lighted out of doors  that they intermarry  and betroth their children in infancy  that they enter into no plots or conspiracies  for who ever heard of a traitorous lamplighter .    that they commit no crimes against the laws of their country  there being no instance of a murderous or burglarious lamplighter   that they are  in short  notwithstanding their apparently volatile and restless character  a highly moral and reflective people  having among themselves as many traditional observances as the jews  and being  as a body  if not as old as the hills  at least as old as the streets .  it is an article of their creed that the first faint glimmering of true civilisation shone in the first street light maintained at the public expense .  they trace their existence and high position in the public esteem  in a direct line to the heathen mythology  and hold that the history of prometheus himself is but a pleasant fable  whereof the true hero is a lamplighter .    gentlemen   said the lamplighter in the chair   i drink your healths .     and perhaps  sir   said the vice  holding up his glass  and rising a little way off his seat and sitting down again  in token that he recognised and returned the compliment   perhaps you will add to that condescension by telling us who tom grig was  and how he came to be connected in your mind with francis moore  physician .     hear  hear  hear .   cried the lamplighters generally .    tom grig  gentlemen   said the chairman   was one of us  and it happened to him  as it don t often happen to a public character in our line  that he had his what you may call it cast .     his head .   said the vice .    no   replied the chairman   not his head .     his face  perhaps .   said the vice .   no  not his face .    his legs .    no  not his legs .   nor yet his arms  nor his hands  nor his feet  nor his chest  all of which were severally suggested .    his nativity  perhaps .     that s it   said the chairman  awakening from his thoughtful attitude at the suggestion .   his nativity .  that s what tom had cast  gentlemen .     in plaster .   asked the vice .    i don t rightly know how it s done   returned the chairman .   but i suppose it was .    and there he stopped as if that were all he had to say  whereupon there arose a murmur among the company  which at length resolved itself into a request  conveyed through the vice  that he would go on .  this being exactly what the chairman wanted  he mused for a little time  performed that agreeable ceremony which is popularly termed wetting one s whistle  and went on thus    tom grig  gentlemen  was  as i have said  one of us  and i may go further  and say he was an ornament to us  and such a one as only the good old times of oil and cotton could have produced .  tom s family  gentlemen  were all lamplighters .     not the ladies  i hope .   asked the vice .    they had talent enough for it  sir   rejoined the chairman   and would have been  but for the prejudices of society .  let women have their rights  sir  and the females of tom s family would have been every one of  em in office .  but that emancipation hasn t come yet  and hadn t then  and consequently they confined themselves to the bosoms of their families  cooked the dinners  mended the clothes  minded the children  comforted their husbands  and attended to the house keeping generally .  it s a hard thing upon the women  gentlemen  that they are limited to such a sphere of action as this  very hard .    i happen to know all about tom  gentlemen  from the circumstance of his uncle by his mother s side  having been my particular friend .  his  that s tom s uncle s  fate was a melancholy one .  gas was the death of him .  when it was first talked of  he laughed .  he wasn t angry  he laughed at the credulity of human nature .   they might as well talk   he says   of laying on an everlasting succession of glow worms   and then he laughed again  partly at his joke  and partly at poor humanity .    in course of time  however  the thing got ground  the experiment was made  and they lighted up pall mall .  tom s uncle went to see it .  i ve heard that he fell off his ladder fourteen times that night  from weakness  and that he would certainly have gone on falling till he killed himself  if his last tumble hadn t been into a wheelbarrow which was going his way  and humanely took him home .   i foresee in this   says tom s uncle faintly  and taking to his bed as he spoke    i foresee in this   he says   the breaking up of our profession .  there s no more going the rounds to trim by daylight  no more dribbling down of the oil on the hats and bonnets of ladies and gentlemen when one feels in spirits .  any low fellow can light a gas lamp .  and it s all up .   in this state of mind  he petitioned the government for   i want a word again  gentlemen   what do you call that which they give to people when it s found out  at last  that they ve never been of any use  and have been paid too much for doing nothing .     compensation .   suggested the vice .    that s it   said the chairman .   compensation .  they didn t give it him  though  and then he got very fond of his country all at once  and went about saying that gas was a death blow to his native land  and that it was a plot of the radicals to ruin the country and destroy the oil and cotton trade for ever  and that the whales would go and kill themselves privately  out of sheer spite and vexation at not being caught .  at last he got right down cracked  called his tobacco pipe a gas pipe  thought his tears were lamp  oil  and went on with all manner of nonsense of that sort  till one night he hung himself on a lamp iron in saint martin s lane  and there was an end of him .    tom loved him  gentlemen  but he survived it .  he shed a tear over his grave  got very drunk  spoke a funeral oration that night in the watch house  and was fined five shillings for it  in the morning .  some men are none the worse for this sort of thing .  tom was one of  em .  he went that very afternoon on a new beat  as clear in his head  and as free from fever as father mathew himself .    tom s new beat  gentlemen  was   i can t exactly say where  for that he d never tell  but i know it was in a quiet part of town  where there were some queer old houses .  i have always had it in my head that it must have been somewhere near canonbury tower in islington  but that s a matter of opinion .  wherever it was  he went upon it  with a bran new ladder  a white hat  a brown holland jacket and trousers  a blue neck kerchief  and a sprig of full  blown double wall flower in his button hole .  tom was always genteel in his appearance  and i have heard from the best judges  that if he had left his ladder at home that afternoon  you might have took him for a lord .    he was always merry  was tom  and such a singer  that if there was any encouragement for native talent  he d have been at the opera .  he was on his ladder  lighting his first lamp  and singing to himself in a manner more easily to be conceived than described  when he hears the clock strike five  and suddenly sees an old gentleman with a telescope in his hand  throw up a window and look at him very hard .    tom didn t know what could be passing in this old gentleman s mind .  he thought it likely enough that he might be saying within himself   here s a new lamplighter   a good looking young fellow   shall i stand something to drink .   thinking this possible  he keeps quite still  pretending to be very particular about the wick  and looks at the old gentleman sideways  seeming to take no notice of him .    gentlemen  he was one of the strangest and most mysterious looking files that ever tom clapped his eyes on .  he was dressed all slovenly and untidy  in a great gown of a kind of bed furniture pattern  with a cap of the same on his head  and a long old flapped waistcoat  with no braces  no strings  very few buttons   in short  with hardly any of those artificial contrivances that hold society together .  tom knew by these signs  and by his not being shaved  and by his not being over clean  and by a sort of wisdom not quite awake  in his face  that he was a scientific old gentleman .  he often told me that if he could have conceived the possibility of the whole royal society being boiled down into one man  he should have said the old gentleman s body was that body .    the old gentleman claps the telescope to his eye  looks all round  sees nobody else in sight  stares at tom again  and cries out very loud     hal loa .      halloa  sir   says tom from the ladder   and halloa again  if you come to that .      here s an extraordinary fulfilment   says the old gentleman   of a prediction of the planets .      is there .   says tom .   i m very glad to hear it .      young man   says the old gentleman   you don t know me .      sir   says tom   i have not that honour  but i shall be happy to drink your health  notwithstanding .      i read   cries the old gentleman  without taking any notice of this politeness on tom s part    i read what s going to happen  in the stars .     tom thanked him for the information  and begged to know if anything particular was going to happen in the stars  in the course of a week or so  but the old gentleman  correcting him  explained that he read in the stars what was going to happen on dry land  and that he was acquainted with all the celestial bodies .     i hope they re all well  sir   says tom     everybody .      hush .   cries the old gentleman .   i have consulted the book of fate with rare and wonderful success .  i am versed in the great sciences of astrology and astronomy .  in my house here  i have every description of apparatus for observing the course and motion of the planets .  six months ago  i derived from this source  the knowledge that precisely as the clock struck five this afternoon a stranger would present himself   the destined husband of my young and lovely niece   in reality of illustrious and high descent  but whose birth would be enveloped in uncertainty and mystery .  don t tell me yours isn t   says the old gentleman  who was in such a hurry to speak that he couldn t get the words out fast enough   for i know better .     gentlemen  tom was so astonished when he heard him say this  that he could hardly keep his footing on the ladder  and found it necessary to hold on by the lamp post .  there was a mystery about his birth .  his mother had always admitted it .  tom had never known who was his father  and some people had gone so far as to say that even she was in doubt .    while he was in this state of amazement  the old gentleman leaves the window  bursts out of the house door  shakes the ladder  and tom  like a ripe pumpkin  comes sliding down into his arms .     let me embrace you   he says  folding his arms about him  and nearly lighting up his old bed furniture gown at tom s link .   you re a man of noble aspect .  everything combines to prove the accuracy of my observations .  you have had mysterious promptings within you   he says   i know you have had whisperings of greatness  eh .   he says .     i think i have   says tom   tom was one of those who can persuade themselves to anything they like    i ve often thought i wasn t the small beer i was taken for .      you were right   cries the old gentleman  hugging him again .   come in .  my niece awaits us .      is the young lady tolerable good looking  sir .   says tom  hanging fire rather  as he thought of her playing the piano  and knowing french  and being up to all manner of accomplishments .     she s beautiful .   cries the old gentleman  who was in such a terrible bustle that he was all in a perspiration .   she has a graceful carriage  an exquisite shape  a sweet voice  a countenance beaming with animation and expression  and the eye   he says  rubbing his hands   of a startled fawn .     tom supposed this might mean  what was called among his circle of acquaintance   a game eye   and  with a view to this defect  inquired whether the young lady had any cash .     she has five thousand pounds   cries the old gentleman .   but what of that .  what of that .  a word in your ear .  i m in search of the philosopher s stone .  i have very nearly found it   not quite .  it turns everything to gold  that s its property .     tom naturally thought it must have a deal of property  and said that when the old gentleman did get it  he hoped he d be careful to keep it in the family .     certainly   he says   of course .  five thousand pounds .  what s five thousand pounds to us .  what s five million .   he says .   what s five thousand million .  money will be nothing to us .  we shall never be able to spend it fast enough .      we ll try what we can do  sir   says tom .     we will   says the old gentleman .   your name .      grig   says tom .    the old gentleman embraced him again  very tight  and without speaking another word  dragged him into the house in such an excited manner  that it was as much as tom could do to take his link and ladder with him  and put them down in the passage .    gentlemen  if tom hadn t been always remarkable for his love of truth  i think you would still have believed him when he said that all this was like a dream .  there is no better way for a man to find out whether he is really asleep or awake  than calling for something to eat .  if he s in a dream  gentlemen  he ll find something wanting in flavour  depend upon it .    tom explained his doubts to the old gentleman  and said that if there was any cold meat in the house  it would ease his mind very much to test himself at once .  the old gentleman ordered up a venison pie  a small ham  and a bottle of very old madeira .  at the first mouthful of pie and the first glass of wine  tom smacks his lips and cries out   i m awake   wide awake   and to prove that he was so  gentlemen  he made an end of  em both .    when tom had finished his meal  which he never spoke of afterwards without tears in his eyes   the old gentleman hugs him again  and says   noble stranger .  let us visit my young and lovely niece .   tom  who was a little elevated with the wine  replies   the noble stranger is agreeable .   at which words the old gentleman took him by the hand  and led him to the parlour  crying as he opened the door   here is mr .  grig  the favourite of the planets .     i will not attempt a description of female beauty  gentlemen  for every one of us has a model of his own that suits his own taste best .  in this parlour that i m speaking of  there were two young ladies  and if every gentleman present  will imagine two models of his own in their places  and will be kind enough to polish  em up to the very highest pitch of perfection  he will then have a faint conception of their uncommon radiance .    besides these two young ladies  there was their waiting woman  that under any other circumstances tom would have looked upon as a venus  and besides her  there was a tall  thin  dismal faced young gentleman  half man and half boy  dressed in a childish suit of clothes very much too short in the legs and arms  and looking  according to tom s comparison  like one of the wax juveniles from a tailor s door  grown up and run to seed .  now  this youngster stamped his foot upon the ground and looked very fierce at tom  and tom looked fierce at him   for to tell the truth  gentlemen  tom more than half suspected that when they entered the room he was kissing one of the young ladies  and for anything tom knew  you observe  it might be his young lady   which was not pleasant .     sir   says tom   before we proceed any further  will you have the goodness to inform me who this young salamander    tom called him that for aggravation  you perceive  gentlemen    who this young salamander may be .      that  mr .  grig   says the old gentleman   is my little boy .  he was christened galileo isaac newton flamstead .  don t mind him .  he s a mere child .      and a very fine child too   says tom   still aggravating  you ll observe    of his age  and as good as fine  i have no doubt .  how do you do  my man .   with which kind and patronising expressions  tom reached up to pat him on the head  and quoted two lines about little boys  from doctor watts s hymns  which he had learnt at a sunday school .    it was very easy to see  gentlemen  by this youngster s frowning and by the waiting maid s tossing her head and turning up her nose  and by the young ladies turning their backs and talking together at the other end of the room  that nobody but the old gentleman took very kindly to the noble stranger .  indeed  tom plainly heard the waiting woman say of her master  that so far from being able to read the stars as he pretended  she didn t believe he knew his letters in  em  or at best that he had got further than words in one syllable  but tom  not minding this  for he was in spirits after the madeira   looks with an agreeable air towards the young ladies  and  kissing his hand to both  says to the old gentleman   which is which .      this   says the old gentleman  leading out the handsomest  if one of  em could possibly be said to be handsomer than the other    this is my niece  miss fanny barker .      if you ll permit me  miss   says tom   being a noble stranger and a favourite of the planets  i will conduct myself as such .   with these words  he kisses the young lady in a very affable way  turns to the old gentleman  slaps him on the back  and says   when s it to come off  my buck .     the young lady coloured so deep  and her lip trembled so much  gentlemen  that tom really thought she was going to cry .  but she kept her feelings down  and turning to the old gentleman  says   dear uncle  though you have the absolute disposal of my hand and fortune  and though you mean well in disposing of  em thus  i ask you whether you don t think this is a mistake .  don t you think  dear uncle   she says   that the stars must be in error .  is it not possible that the comet may have put  em out .      the stars   says the old gentleman   couldn t make a mistake if they tried .  emma   he says to the other young lady .     yes  papa   says she .     the same day that makes your cousin mrs .  grig will unite you to the gifted mooney .  no remonstrance   no tears .  now  mr .  grig  let me conduct you to that hallowed ground  that philosophical retreat  where my friend and partner  the gifted mooney of whom i have just now spoken  is even now pursuing those discoveries which shall enrich us with the precious metal  and make us masters of the world .  come  mr .  grig   he says .     with all my heart  sir   replies tom   and luck to the gifted mooney  say i   not so much on his account as for our worthy selves .   with this sentiment  tom kissed his hand to the ladies again  and followed him out  having the gratification to perceive  as he looked back  that they were all hanging on by the arms and legs of galileo isaac newton flamstead  to prevent him from following the noble stranger  and tearing him to pieces .    gentlemen  tom s father in law that was to be  took him by the hand  and having lighted a little lamp  led him across a paved court yard at the back of the house  into a very large  dark  gloomy room  filled with all manner of bottles  globes  books  telescopes  crocodiles  alligators  and other scientific instruments of every kind .  in the centre of this room was a stove or furnace  with what tom called a pot  but which in my opinion was a crucible  in full boil .  in one corner was a sort of ladder leading through the roof  and up this ladder the old gentleman pointed  as he said in a whisper     the observatory .  mr .  mooney is even now watching for the precise time at which we are to come into all the riches of the earth .  it will be necessary for he and i  alone in that silent place  to cast your nativity before the hour arrives .  put the day and minute of your birth on this piece of paper  and leave the rest to me .      you don t mean to say   says tom  doing as he was told and giving him back the paper   that i m to wait here long  do you .  it s a precious dismal place .      hush .   says the old gentleman .   it s hallowed ground .  farewell .      stop a minute   says tom .   what a hurry you re in .  what s in that large bottle yonder .      it s a child with three heads   says the old gentleman   and everything else in proportion .      why don t you throw him away .   says tom .   what do you keep such unpleasant things here for .      throw him away .   cries the old gentleman .   we use him constantly in astrology .  he s a charm .      i shouldn t have thought it   says tom   from his appearance .  must you go  i say .     the old gentleman makes him no answer  but climbs up the ladder in a greater bustle than ever .  tom looked after his legs till there was nothing of him left  and then sat down to wait  feeling  so he used to say  as comfortable as if he was going to be made a freemason  and they were heating the pokers .    tom waited so long  gentlemen  that he began to think it must be getting on for midnight at least  and felt more dismal and lonely than ever he had done in all his life .  he tried every means of whiling away the time  but it never had seemed to move so slow .  first  he took a nearer view of the child with three heads  and thought what a comfort it must have been to his parents .  then he looked up a long telescope which was pointed out of the window  but saw nothing particular  in consequence of the stopper being on at the other end .  then he came to a skeleton in a glass case  labelled   skeleton of a gentleman   prepared by mr .  mooney     which made him hope that mr .  mooney might not be in the habit of preparing gentlemen that way without their own consent .  a hundred times  at least  he looked into the pot where they were boiling the philosopher s stone down to the proper consistency  and wondered whether it was nearly done .   when it is   thinks tom   i ll send out for six penn orth of sprats  and turn  em into gold fish for a first experiment .   besides which  he made up his mind  gentlemen  to have a country house and a park  and to plant a bit of it with a double row of gas lamps a mile long  and go out every night with a french polished mahogany ladder  and two servants in livery behind him  to light  em for his own pleasure .    at length and at last  the old gentleman s legs appeared upon the steps leading through the roof  and he came slowly down  bringing along with him  the gifted mooney .  this mooney  gentlemen  was even more scientific in appearance than his friend  and had  as tom often declared upon his word and honour  the dirtiest face we can possibly know of  in this imperfect state of existence .    gentlemen  you are all aware that if a scientific man isn t absent in his mind  he s of no good at all .  mr .  mooney was so absent  that when the old gentleman said to him   shake hands with mr .  grig   he put out his leg .   here s a mind  mr .  grig .   cries the old gentleman in a rapture .   here s philosophy .  here s rumination .  don t disturb him   he says   for this is amazing .     tom had no wish to disturb him  having nothing particular to say  but he was so uncommonly amazing  that the old gentleman got impatient  and determined to give him an electric shock to bring him to    for you must know  mr .  grig   he says   that we always keep a strongly charged battery  ready for that purpose .   these means being resorted to  gentlemen  the gifted mooney revived with a loud roar  and he no sooner came to himself than both he and the old gentleman looked at tom with compassion  and shed tears abundantly .     my dear friend   says the old gentleman to the gifted   prepare him .      i say   cries tom  falling back   none of that  you know .  no preparing by mr .  mooney if you please .      alas .   replies the old gentleman   you don t understand us .  my friend  inform him of his fate .    i can t .     the gifted mustered up his voice  after many efforts  and informed tom that his nativity had been carefully cast  and he would expire at exactly thirty five minutes  twenty seven seconds  and five  sixths of a second past nine o clock  a . m .   on that day two months .    gentlemen  i leave you to judge what were tom s feelings at this announcement  on the eve of matrimony and endless riches .   i think   he says in a trembling voice   there must be a mistake in the working of that sum .  will you do me the favour to cast it up again .      there is no mistake   replies the old gentleman   it is confirmed by francis moore  physician .  here is the prediction for to morrow two months .   and he showed him the page  where sure enough were these words    the decease of a great person may be looked for  about this time .      which   says the old gentleman   is clearly you  mr .  grig .      too clearly   cries tom  sinking into a chair  and giving one hand to the old gentleman  and one to the gifted .   the orb of day has set on thomas grig for ever .     at this affecting remark  the gifted shed tears again  and the other two mingled their tears with his  in a kind   if i may use the expression   of mooney and co .  s entire .  but the old gentleman recovering first  observed that this was only a reason for hastening the marriage  in order that tom s distinguished race might be transmitted to posterity  and requesting the gifted to console mr .  grig during his temporary absence  he withdrew to settle the preliminaries with his niece immediately .    and now  gentlemen  a very extraordinary and remarkable occurrence took place  for as tom sat in a melancholy way in one chair  and the gifted sat in a melancholy way in another  a couple of doors were thrown violently open  the two young ladies rushed in  and one knelt down in a loving attitude at tom s feet  and the other at the gifted s .  so far  perhaps  as tom was concerned   as he used to say   you will say there was nothing strange in this  but you will be of a different opinion when you understand that tom s young lady was kneeling to the gifted  and the gifted s young lady was kneeling to tom .     halloa .  stop a minute .   cries tom   here s a mistake .  i need condoling with by sympathising woman  under my afflicting circumstances  but we re out in the figure .  change partners  mooney .      monster .   cries tom s young lady  clinging to the gifted .     miss .   says tom .   is that your manners .      i abjure thee .   cries tom s young lady .   i renounce thee .  i never will be thine .  thou   she says to the gifted   art the object of my first and all engrossing passion .  wrapt in thy sublime visions  thou hast not perceived my love  but  driven to despair  i now shake off the woman and avow it .  oh  cruel  cruel man .   with which reproach she laid her head upon the gifted s breast  and put her arms about him in the tenderest manner possible  gentlemen .     and i   says the other young lady  in a sort of ecstasy  that made tom start    i hereby abjure my chosen husband too .  hear me  goblin .     this was to the gifted    hear me .  i hold thee in the deepest detestation .  the maddening interview of this one night has filled my soul with love   but not for thee .  it is for thee  for thee  young man   she cries to tom .   as monk lewis finely observes  thomas  thomas  i am thine  thomas  thomas  thou art mine  thine for ever  mine for ever .   with which words  she became very tender likewise .    tom and the gifted  gentlemen  as you may believe  looked at each other in a very awkward manner  and with thoughts not at all complimentary to the two young ladies .  as to the gifted  i have heard tom say often  that he was certain he was in a fit  and had it inwardly .     speak to me .  oh  speak to me .   cries tom s young lady to the gifted .     i don t want to speak to anybody   he says  finding his voice at last  and trying to push her away .   i think i had better go .  i m   i m frightened   he says  looking about as if he had lost something .     not one look of love .   she cries .   hear me while i declare        i don t know how to look a look of love   he says  all in a maze .   don t declare anything .  i don t want to hear anybody .      that s right .   cries the old gentleman  who it seems had been listening  .   that s right .  don t hear her .  emma shall marry you to morrow  my friend  whether she likes it or not  and she shall marry mr .  grig .     gentlemen  these words were no sooner out of his mouth than galileo isaac newton flamstead  who it seems had been listening too  darts in  and spinning round and round  like a young giant s top  cries   let her .  let her .  i m fierce  i m furious .  i give her leave .  i ll never marry anybody after this   never .  it isn t safe .  she is the falsest of the false   he cries  tearing his hair and gnashing his teeth   and i ll live and die a bachelor .      the little boy   observed the gifted gravely   albeit of tender years  has spoken wisdom .  i have been led to the contemplation of woman kind  and will not adventure on the troubled waters of matrimony .      what .   says the old gentleman   not marry my daughter .  won t you  mooney .  not if i make her .  won t you .  won t you .      no   says mooney   i won t .  and if anybody asks me any more  i ll run away  and never come back again .      mr .  grig   says the old gentleman   the stars must be obeyed .  you have not changed your mind because of a little girlish folly   eh  mr .  grig .     tom  gentlemen  had had his eyes about him  and was pretty sure that all this was a device and trick of the waiting maid  to put him off his inclination .  he had seen her hiding and skipping about the two doors  and had observed that a very little whispering from her pacified the salamander directly .   so   thinks tom   this is a plot   but it won t fit .      eh  mr .  grig .   says the old gentleman .     why  sir   says tom  pointing to the crucible   if the soup s nearly ready        another hour beholds the consummation of our labours   returned the old gentleman .     very good   says tom  with a mournful air .   it s only for two months  but i may as well be the richest man in the world even for that time .  i m not particular  i ll take her  sir .  i ll take her .     the old gentleman was in a rapture to find tom still in the same mind  and drawing the young lady towards him by little and little  was joining their hands by main force  when all of a sudden  gentlemen  the crucible blows up  with a great crash  everybody screams  the room is filled with smoke  and tom  not knowing what may happen next  throws himself into a fancy attitude  and says   come on  if you re a man .   without addressing himself to anybody in particular .     the labours of fifteen years .   says the old gentleman  clasping his hands and looking down upon the gifted  who was saving the pieces   are destroyed in an instant .     and i am told  gentlemen  by the bye  that this same philosopher s stone would have been discovered a hundred times at least  to speak within bounds  if it wasn t for the one unfortunate circumstance that the apparatus always blows up  when it s on the very point of succeeding .    tom turns pale when he hears the old gentleman expressing himself to this unpleasant effect  and stammers out that if it s quite agreeable to all parties  he would like to know exactly what has happened  and what change has really taken place in the prospects of that company .     we have failed for the present  mr .  grig   says the old gentleman  wiping his forehead .   and i regret it the more  because i have in fact invested my niece s five thousand pounds in this glorious speculation .  but don t be cast down   he says  anxiously    in another fifteen years  mr .  grig       oh .   cries tom  letting the young lady s hand fall .   were the stars very positive about this union  sir .      they were   says the old gentleman .     i m sorry to hear it   tom makes answer   for it s no go  sir .      no what .   cries the old gentleman .     go  sir   says tom  fiercely .   i forbid the banns .   and with these words   which are the very words he used   he sat himself down in a chair  and  laying his head upon the table  thought with a secret grief of what was to come to pass on that day two months .    tom always said  gentlemen  that that waiting maid was the artfullest minx he had ever seen  and he left it in writing in this country when he went to colonize abroad  that he was certain in his own mind she and the salamander had blown up the philosopher s stone on purpose  and to cut him out of his property .  i believe tom was in the right  gentlemen  but whether or no  she comes forward at this point  and says   may i speak  sir .   and the old gentleman answering   yes  you may   she goes on to say that  the stars are no doubt quite right in every respect  but tom is not the man .   and she says   don t you remember  sir  that when the clock struck five this afternoon  you gave master galileo a rap on the head with your telescope  and told him to get out of the way .    yes  i do   says the old gentleman .   then   says the waiting  maid   i say he s the man  and the prophecy is fulfilled .   the old gentleman staggers at this  as if somebody had hit him a blow on the chest  and cries   he .  why he s a boy .   upon that  gentlemen  the salamander cries out that he ll be twenty one next lady day  and complains that his father has always been so busy with the sun round which the earth revolves  that he has never taken any notice of the son that revolves round him  and that he hasn t had a new suit of clothes since he was fourteen  and that he wasn t even taken out of nankeen frocks and trousers till he was quite unpleasant in  em  and touches on a good many more family matters to the same purpose .  to make short of a long story  gentlemen  they all talk together  and cry together  and remind the old gentleman that as to the noble family  his own grandfather would have been lord mayor if he hadn t died at a dinner the year before  and they show him by all kinds of arguments that if the cousins are married  the prediction comes true every way .  at last  the old gentleman being quite convinced  gives in  and joins their hands  and leaves his daughter to marry anybody she likes  and they are all well pleased  and the gifted as well as any of them .    in the middle of this little family party  gentlemen  sits tom all the while  as miserable as you like .  but  when everything else is arranged  the old gentleman s daughter says  that their strange conduct was a little device of the waiting maid s to disgust the lovers he had chosen for  em  and will he forgive her .  and if he will  perhaps he might even find her a husband   and when she says that  she looks uncommon hard at tom .  then the waiting maid says that  oh dear .  she couldn t abear mr .  grig should think she wanted him to marry her  and that she had even gone so far as to refuse the last lamplighter  who was now a literary character  having set up as a bill sticker   and that she hoped mr .  grig would not suppose she was on her last legs by any means  for the baker was very strong in his attentions at that moment  and as to the butcher  he was frantic .  and i don t know how much more she might have said  gentlemen  for  as you know  this kind of young women are rare ones to talk   if the old gentleman hadn t cut in suddenly  and asked tom if he d have her  with ten pounds to recompense him for his loss of time and disappointment  and as a kind of bribe to keep the story secret .     it don t much matter  sir   says tom   i ain t long for this world .  eight weeks of marriage  especially with this young woman  might reconcile me to my fate .  i think   he says   i could go off easy after that .   with which he embraces her with a very dismal face  and groans in a way that might move a heart of stone   even of philosopher s stone .     egad   says the old gentleman   that reminds me   this bustle put it out of my head   there was a figure wrong .  he ll live to a green old age   eighty seven at least .      how much  sir .   cries tom .     eighty seven .   says the old gentleman .    without another word  tom flings himself on the old gentleman s neck  throws up his hat  cuts a caper  defies the waiting maid  and refers her to the butcher .     you won t marry her .   says the old gentleman  angrily .     and live after it .   says tom .   i d sooner marry a mermaid with a small tooth comb and looking glass .      then take the consequences   says the other .    with those words   i beg your kind attention here  gentlemen  for it s worth your notice   the old gentleman wetted the forefinger of his right hand in some of the liquor from the crucible that was spilt on the floor  and drew a small triangle on tom s forehead .  the room swam before his eyes  and he found himself in the watch  house .     found himself where .   cried the vice  on behalf of the company generally .    in the watch house   said the chairman .   it was late at night  and he found himself in the very watch house from which he had been let out that morning .     did he go home .   asked the vice .    the watch house people rather objected to that   said the chairman   so he stopped there that night  and went before the magistrate in the morning .   why  you re here again  are you .   says the magistrate  adding insult to injury   we ll trouble you for five shillings more  if you can conveniently spare the money .   tom told him he had been enchanted  but it was of no use .  he told the contractors the same  but they wouldn t believe him .  it was very hard upon him  gentlemen  as he often said  for was it likely he d go and invent such a tale .  they shook their heads and told him he d say anything but his prayers   as indeed he would  there s no doubt about that .  it was the only imputation on his moral character that ever i heard of .               end of project gutenberg s etext of the lamplighter  by charles dickens             the lamplighter  a free ebook from http
