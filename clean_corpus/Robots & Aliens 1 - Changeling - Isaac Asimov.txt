megen and devon  who are already exploring their own sense of wonder and who have given new meaning to mine .       robots and aliens  isaac asimov    you may have noticed  assuming that you have read my robot stories and novels  that i have not had occasion to discuss the interaction of robots and aliens .  in fact  at no point anywhere in my writing has any robot met any alien .  in very few of my writings have human beings met aliens  in fact .   you may wonder why that is so  and you might suspect that the answer would be     i don   t know .  that   s just the way i write stories  i guess .     but if that is what you suspect  you are wrong .  i will be glad to explain just why things are as they are .   the time is      .  .  .   in those days  it was common to describe    galactic federations    in which there were many  many planets  each with its own form of intelligent life .  e .  e .      doc     smith had started the fashion  and john w .  campbell had carried it on .   there was  however  a catch .  smith and campbell  though wonderful people  were of northwest european extraction and they took it for granted that northwest europeans and their descendants were the evolutionary crown and peak .  neither one was a racist in any evil sense  you understand .  both were as kind and as good as gold to everyone  but they knew they belonged to the racial aristocracy .   well  then  when they wrote of galactic federations  earthmen were the northwest europeans of the galaxy .  there were lots of different intelligences in smith   s galaxy but the leader was kimball kinnison  an earthman  of northwest european extraction  i   m sure  .  there were lots of different intelligences in campbell   s galaxy  but the leaders were arcot  wade  and morey  who were earthmen  of northwest european extraction  i   m sure  .   well  in       i wrote a story called    homo sol     which appeared in the september      issue of astounding science fiction .  i  too  had a galactic federation composed of innumerable different intelligences  but i had no brief for northwest europeans .  i was of east european extraction myself and my kind was being trampled into oblivion by a bunch of northwest europeans .  i was therefore not intent on making earthmen superior .  the hero of the story was from rigel and earthmen were definitely a bunch of second raters .   well  campbell wouldn   t allow it .  earthmen had to be superior to all others  no matter what .  he forced me to make some changes and then made some himself  and i was frustrated .  on the one hand  i wanted to write my stories without interference  on the other hand  i wanted to sell to campbell .  what to do .   i wrote a sequel to    homo sol     a story called    the imaginary     in which only the aliens appeared .  no earthmen .  campbell rejected it  it appeared in the november      issue of superscience stories .   then inspiration struck .  if i wrote human alien stories  campbell would not let me be .  if i wrote alien only stories  campbell would reject them .  so why not write human only stories .  i did .  when i got around to making another serious attempt at dealing with a galactic society  i made it an all human galaxy and campbell had no objections at all .  mine was the first such galaxy in science fiction history  as far as i know  and it proved phenomenally successful  for i wrote my foundation  and related  novels on that basis .   the first such story was    foundation    itself  which appeared in the may      astounding science fiction .  meanwhile  it had also occurred to me that i could write robot stories for campbell .  i didn   t mind having earthmen superior to robots   at least just at first .  the first robot story that campbell took was    reason     which appeared in the april      astounding science fiction .  those stories  too  proved very popular  and presuming upon their popularity  i gradually made my robots better and wiser and more decent than human beings and campbell continued to take them .   this continued even after campbell   s death  and now i can   t think of a recent robot story in which my robot isn   t far better than the human beings he must deal with .  i think of    bicentennial man        robot dreams        too bad    and  most of all  i think of r .  daneel and r .  giskard in my robot novels .   but the decision i made in the heat of world war ii and in my resentment of campbell   s assumption have stayed with me .  my galaxy is still all human  and my robots still meet only humans .   this doesn   t mean that  always assuming i live long enough  it   s not possible i may violate this habit of mine in the future .  the ending of my novel foundation and earth makes it conceivable that in the sequel i may introduce aliens and that r .  daneel will have to deal with them .  that   s not a promise because actually i haven   t the faintest idea of what   s going to happen in the sequel  but it is at least conceivable that aliens may intrude on my close knit human societies .    naturally  i repel  with contempt  any suggestion that i don   t introduce aliens into my stories because i    can   t handle them .     in fact  my chief reason for writing my novel the gods themselves was to prove to anyone who felt he needed the proof  that i could  too  handle aliens .  no one can doubt that i proved it  but i must admit that even in the gods themselves  the aliens and the human beings didn   t actually meet face to face .    but let   s move on .  suppose that one of my robots did encounter an alien intelligence .  what would happen .   problems of this sort have occurred to me now and then but i never felt moved to make one the basis of a story .   consider    how would a robot define a human being in the light of the three laws .  the first law  it seems to me  offers no difficulty     a robot may not injure a human being  or through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .      fine  there need be no caviling about the kind of a human being .  it wouldn   t matter whether they were male or female  short or tall  old or young  wise or foolish .  anything that can define a human being biologically will suffice .   the second law is a different matter altogether     a robot must obey orders given it by a human being except where that would conflict with the first law .      that has always made me uneasy .  suppose a robot on board ship is given an order by someone who knows nothing about ships  and that order would put the ship and everyone on board into danger .  is the robot obliged to obey .  of course not .  obedience would conflict with the first law since human beings would be put into danger .   that assumes  however  that the robot knows everything about ships and can tell that the order is a dangerous one .  suppose  however  that the robot is not an expert on ships  but is experienced only in  let us say  automobile manufacture .  he happens to be on board ship and is given an order by some landlubber and he doesn   t know whether the order is safe or not .   it seems to me that he ought to respond     sir  since you have no knowledge as to the proper handling of ships  it would not be safe for me to obey any order you may give me involving such handling .      because of that  i have often wondered if the second law ought to read     a robot must obey orders given it by qualified human beings .  .  .      but then i would have to imagine that robots are equipped with definitions of what would make humans    qualified    under different situations and with different orders .  in fact  what if a landlubber robot on board ship is given orders by someone concerning whose qualifications the robot is totally ignorant .   must he answer     sir  i do not know whether you are a qualified human being with respect to this order .  if you can satisfy me that you are qualified to give me an order of this sort  i will obey it .      then  too  what if the robot is faced by a child of ten   indisputably human as far as the first law is concerned .  must the robot obey without question the orders of such a child  or the orders of a moron  or the orders of a man lost in the quagmire of emotion and beside himself .   the problem of when to obey and when not to obey is so complicated and devilishly uncertain that i have rarely subjected my robots to these equivocal situations .   and that brings me to the matter of aliens .   the physiological difference between aliens and ourselves matters to us   but then tiny physiological or even cultural differences between one human being and another also matter .  to smith and campbell  ancestry obviously mattered  to others skin color matters  or gender or eye shape or religion or language or  for goodness sake  even hairstyle .   it seems to me that to decent human beings  none of these superficialities ought to matter .  the declaration of independence states that    all men are created equal .     campbell  of course  argued with me many times that all men are manifestly not equal  and i steadily argued that they were all equal before the taw .  if a law was passed that stealing was illegal  then no man could steal .  one couldn   t say     well  if you went to harvard and were a seventh generation american you can steal up to one hundred thousand dollars  if you   re an immigrant from the british isles  you can steal up to one hundred dollars  but if you   re of polish birth  you can   t steal at all .     even campbell would admit that much  except that his technique was to change the subject  .   and  of course  when we say that    all men are created equal    we are using    men    in the generic sense including both sexes and all ages  subjected to the qualification that a person must be mentally equipped to understand the difference between right and wrong .   in any case  it seems to me that if we broaden our perspective to consider non human intelligent beings  then we must dismiss  as irrelevant  physiological and biochemical differences and ask only what the status of intelligence might be .   in short  a robot must apply the laws of robotics to any intelligent biological being  whether human or not .   naturally  this is bound to create difficulties .  it is one thing to design robots to deal with a specific non human intelligence  and specialize in it  so to speak .  it is quite another to have a robot encounter an intelligent species whom it has never met before .     after all  different species of living things may be intelligent to different extents  or in different directions  or subject to different modifications .  we can easily imagine two intelligences with two utterly different systems of morals or two utterly different systems of senses .   must a robot who is faced with a strange intelligence evaluate it only in terms of the intelligence for which he is programmed .   to put it in simpler terms  what if a robot  carefully trained to understand and speak french  encounters someone who can only understand and speak farsi .    or suppose a robot must deal with individuals of two widely different species  each manifestly intelligent .  even if he understands both sets of languages  must he be forced to decide which of the two is the more intelligent before he can decide what to do in the face of conflicting orders   or which set of moral imperatives is the worthier .   someday  this may be something i will have to take up in a story but  if so  it will give me a lot of trouble .  meanwhile  the whole point of the robot city volumes is that young writers have the opportunity to take up the problems i have so far ducked .  i   m delighted when they do .  it gives them excellent practice and may teach me a few things  too .     prologue  a synopsis of robot city  books        he woke up .  .  . somewhere .   he didn   t know where he was or how he had managed to get there .  he didn   t remember anything of his past .   not even his name .   he was in some small capsule without windows .  he could not even see where he was going .   his awakening had stirred a computer into life  and through its positronic personality he found that he was in a massey lifepod .  a badge on his clothing identified him as derec   the name seemed to fit as well as anything .  the positronic intelligence built into the lifepod could help him with very little  it had no information to aid him at all  not even the name of the ship from which it had been ejected .   the lifepod had landed on an asteroid that derec quickly found was inhabited by a colony of robots .  he seemed to be the only human there .  the robots were as little help to him as the lifepod .  strangely silent about their task  they ignored him for the most part .  they were obviously looking for something buried in the rock of the asteroid   it seemed to be the only explanation .  while he tried to decipher just what it was they were looking for and why  a raider ship appeared .   while the robot colony prepared to self destruct  derec made a desperate attempt to escape from the asteroid and contact the raider .   as he was doing so  the raider   s bombardment uncovered a shiny silver object  perhaps five centimeters by fifteen centimeters .  he would later learn that it was called a    key to perihelion .     a pursuing robot revealed that this was the object for which the robots were so obsessively searching .   derec grabbed the key and jumped .  with the power of his augmented worksuit and the almost nonexistent gravity of the asteroid  he reached escape velocity  angling for the raider .  but suddenly his faceplate was filled with a glaring blue light  and he was knocked unconscious .   he awoke on the raider ship and was confronted by a strange creature  wolf like but with fingers instead of paws and a flattened  fur covered face .  the alien   s name  as best he could pronounce it  was wolruf .  the creature escorted derec to aranimas  the captain of the raider ship  which seemed to be a jumble of half a dozen or more ships welded together in a patchwork maze .   aranimas was also an alien  a humanoid of the erani race  and very dangerous .  using a form of electrical prod  he tortured derec to gain information as to what the robots were doing on the asteroid .  derec  of course  could tell him nothing .  aranimas then ordered derec to put together a working robot from the salvaged parts from the asteroid and other raids .   through wolruf  derec learned that aranimas intended to replace the subservient narwe race  who functioned as aranimas   s crew  with even more docile robots .  derec found that he did indeed seem to know a great deal about robotics  the knowledge came naturally to him .  he managed to salvage one positronic brain and enough working parts to create a patchwork robot he called alpha .  the most curious thing about the robot was one of its arms  made of tiny cellular surfaces that seemed infinitely malleable  it could literally shape itself into any form needed .  derec remembered that many of the structures on the asteroid bore that same unique design  and he was filled with a desire to meet the inventor of this new substance .   aranimas   s constant mistreatment of derec  wolruf  and the narwe made derec determined to escape .  with the use of alpha  he and wolruf successfully mutinied against aranimas .  they also met another prisoner on the ship  a human female named katherine ariel burgess .  derec recovered the key to perihelion  and they escaped aranimas   s ship  landing on a refueling station .   there derec learned that kate claimed to know something of his past but stubbornly refused to talk to him about it .  he learned too  that she was suffering from some type of debilitating disease herself  and she also refused to talk about that .   the robots on the refueling station had taken the key to perihelion  and now it seemed that the bureaucrats who ran the spacer society were also after the key .  derec  with ariel and wolruf   s help  recovered it .  through a mistake  kate activated the key while derec was holding it .  in an instant  the two were transported to perihelion  a cold  formless place of gray fog .  pressing the switch on the key again  they found themselves on top of a huge pyramidal tower in the middle of a city .   the compass tower of robot city .   they were to find that robot city was an intriguing place .  the material of which it was composed was shaped like tiny keys of perihelion  and the city itself was undergoing constant change .  buildings would appear and move overnight .  there was a constant blaze of activity by the millions of robots in the city  who claimed to be preparing this place for human inhabitants  though at the moment  the only humans here were derec and kate .     the city was in trouble .  nightly deluges raced through the streets  uncontrollable .  huge lightning storms daily menaced them .  and there was a murdered human  a human named david who had looked exactly like derec .  derec slowly realized that the city   as one robotic entity   was responding to what it considered to be a third law threat to its existence .  the threat was david   s blood  more specifically  the microbes in it .  the rainstorms were a byproduct of the city   s enormous and uncontrolled growth in response to that perceived threat .  to save the city  he reprogrammed the central computer core to deactivate the city   s defenses .   at the same time  kate made an effort to recover the key to perihelion  which she had hidden in the compass tower .  it was gone .  she and derec were trapped here .     they found that the city robots had taken the original key and were making duplicates of it .  in the course of trying to steal one of the keys  derec and kate began to develop a trust for each other .   kate admitted to derec that her real name was ariel welsh .  she was the daughter of a wealthy auroran patron of the sciences .  her mother had furnished one dr .  avery the funds to design and build his pet project .  avery was an eccentric  argumentative genius who wanted to create on going  self sufficient cities to seed the stars for humankind .  avery  though  had disappeared .  robot city  ariel guessed  was his original experiment  now running without avery   s control .  as for ariel  she had been banished from aurora because of her incurable disease  contracted from a spacer .  given a ship and funds by her mother  she   d gone looking for a cure .   it was imperative for her to leave robot city if she was going to live .   in the meantime  robot city had acquired another human visitor  jeff leong  whose ship had exploded just outside the atmosphere .  he was badly injured  to save him  the robots of robot city turned him into a cyborg  a human brain encased in a robotic body .  insufficient knowledge of the bio chemical structure of the brain led to jeff   s slow insanity  though otherwise the surgery was a complete success .   alpha and wolruf had also made their way to the city via a modified massey lifepod  big enough for only one human .   with alpha and wolruf   s help  derec and ariel were able to capture the increasingly violent and unstable cyborg .  using derec   s body as a model  the medical technicians of robot city were able to transplant jeff   s brain back into his own newly healed body .  however  he remained ill and largely out of his senses .   alpha  during the capture of jeff  had received instructions from the cellular material in his flexible arm ordering the robot to change its name to mandelbrot .  derec suspected that the arm  from an avery style robot  might well have also sent a signal to avery to return to robot city .   a choice had to be made  let ariel take the lifepod and escape  or send jeff back .  ariel insisted that jeff must be the one to go .     robot city continued its fascinating evolution .  not long after jeff   s departure  the behavior of the robots began to show definitely odd tendencies .  circuit breaker appeared  a building like two four sided pyramids stuck together at their bases and balanced on one point .  the building  the first work of creative art built by a robot  reflected ever changing colors as it rotated .  three robots  calling themselves the three cracked cheeks  formed a dixieland jazz band .  all this came about as an effort by the city to formulate what it called the laws of humanics   corollaries to the three laws of robotics .  the laws of humanics were supposed to govern   or at least explain   the actions of human beings as the three laws of robotics governed those of positronic intelligence .   the most serious and unusual event in all the strangeness was that a robot was murdered by another robot .  lucius  the creator of circuit breaker  was found with all its positronic circuitry deliberately destroyed  so that the brain could never be reconstructed .  it seemed a deliberate attempt to stifle the advances made by the avery robots .   in the midst of this  avery himself returned to the city  and derec  ariel  wolruf  and mandelbrot quickly discovered that the doctor was a dangerous megalomaniac .  all that mattered to avery was his work  he could not have cared less about ariel   s illness or the plight of the others .  all that mattered to him was robot city .  he had stationed hunter seeker robots around the area to take all of them prisoner until he could analyze all that had happened here   in whatever way was most convenient to him .   they were taken prisoner  and derec  unknowingly  was given a dose of chemfets  miniature replicas of the city material that took residence in his bloodstream .   escaping at last  derec  ariel  wolruf  and mandelbrot left robot city on dr .  avery   s ship .  there  in a hidden compartment  they found a key to perihelion .   it was obvious that avery anticipated their escape  for the ship was sabotaged .  without the ability to home in on the navigational beacons  they could not program the jumps through hyperspace .  ariel had also taken a definite turn for the worse .  derec decided that he and ariel must use the key to perihelion to try to get help for her .  wolruf and mandelbrot would remain with the ship and try to complete repairs or attract help from another ship .   derec activated the key  and he and ariel found themselves in an apartment on earth .  they found earth society paranoid and isolated  with extremely xenophobic attitudes toward spacers .  however  ariel was getting progressively weaker  and derec in desperation took her to a local hospital .  if earth was backward in some ways  it seemed that its medical facilities were better than aurora   s .  they recognized her disease   amnemonic plague   and cured her .   unfortunately  the chemfets in derec   s body were asserting their presence  and he was rapidly getting weaker himself .  with the help of r .  david  an earth robot  they stole a ship from an earth spaceport and headed out to rescue wolruf and mandelbrot .   another spaceship followed them  aranimas  who had tracked the bursts of key static to earth .  in a tense battle  derec and ariel  with mandelbrot and wolruf  managed to destroy aranimas   s ship at great cost to their own vessels .  they had only one option left to them with derec growing weaker  use the key to jump back to robot city .     they emerged from the compass tower into avery   s vacant office  intending to force the doctor into helping derec .  to find him  wolruf and mandelbrot went into the city  while derec and ariel began searching the tunnels underneath the tower .   mandelbrot and wolruf found that the robots were all following the orders of what they called the migration program .  they were leaving the first robot city and seeking new worlds on which to build .  and when they returned to compass tower  they found that hunter seeker robots were searching for derec and ariel  who had fled .   above the planet  a small spacecraft arrived  carrying jeff leong .  back to normal  he was returning to rescue the others .  meeting with derec and company  he was determined to help them find dr .  avery .   it was actually dr .  avery who found them  the hunter seeker robots capturing the company one by one .  the doctor revealed that derec was actually david avery  dr .  avery   s son  and that the chemfets in his body would one day allow him to control every avery robot in existence .  derec would become robot city .   but avery had believed derec would be a willing partner in his plans .  he was very wrong in that .  derec used his new control of the city to free his companions  dr .  avery triggered a key to perihelion before he could be captured .  he fled into the void .   derec and the others gave no thought to pursuit .  at last  they were safe and free to leave .   it seemed reward enough .  .  .  .       isaac asimov   s  robot city    robots  and aliens    changeling    chapter    birth       i feel uneasy about this  dr .  anastasi .      janet anastasi glanced up with a half smile .  she brushed blond hair back from bright  hazel eyes cupped in smile lines .     and just how does a robot feel    uneasy     basalom .     she asked with a laugh .   basalom   s eyes blinked  a shutter membrane flickering momentarily over the optical circuits .  janet had deliberately built in that random quirk .  she built idiosyncrasies into all her robots eccentricities of speech  of mannerisms .  the foibles seemed to make basalom and the rest less mechanically predictable .  to her  they lent the robots individual personalities they otherwise lacked .      the term is simply an approximation  doctor .         hmm .     she wiped sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand and wiped it on the leg of her pants .     give me a hand with this  will you  my friend .      the two were in the cargo hold of a small ship .  a viewscreen on one wall showed the mottled blue and white curve of the planet they were orbiting .  twin moons peered over the shoulder of the world  and the land mass directly below them was green with foliage .  it seemed a pastoral land from this distance  no matter what the reality might actually be .  janet knew that the atmosphere of the world was within terran norms  that the earth was fertile  and that there was life  though without any signs of technology  the ship   s instruments had told her that much .  the world  whatever the inhabitants might call it  fit her needs .  beyond that  she didn   t care .   her husband of many years ago  wendell avery  had said during their breakup that she didn   t care about anything made of simple flesh   not him  not their son .     you   re afraid to love something that might love you back     he   d raged .      which makes us exactly the same  doesn   t it .     she   d shouted back at him .     or can   t the genius admit that he has faults .  maybe it   s just because you don   t like the fact that i   m the one who   s considered the robotic expert .  that   s it  isn   t it  wendell .  you can   t love anyone else because your own self worship takes up all the space in your heart .      his remark had made her furious at the time  but time had softened the edges of her anger .  avery might be a conceited  egocentric ass  but there had been some truth in what he   d said .  she   d looked in that mirror too often and seen herself backing away from contact with other people to be with her robots .  surely she   d been content here on this ship for the last few years  with only basalom and a few other robots for company .   avery she missed not at all  her son sometimes she missed terribly .  basalom and the others had become her surrogate children .      gently     she cautioned basalom .  a spheroid of silvery gray metal approximately two meters in diameter sat on the workbench before her  its gleaming surface composed of tiny dodecahedral segments .  she   d just finished placing the delicate  platinum iridium sponge of a positronic brain into a casing within the lumpy sphere .  now basalom draped the sticky lace of the neural connections over the brain and sealed the top half of the casing .  the geometric segments molded together seamlessly .      you can put it in the probe     janet told the robot  then added     what   s this about being uneasy .         you have built me very well  doctor  that is the only reason i sense anything at all .  i am aware of a millisecond pause in my positronic relays due to possible first law conflicts     basalom replied as he carefully lifted the sphere and moved it to the launching tube .     while there is no imminent danger of lock up  nor is this sufficient to cause any danger of malfunction or loss of effectiveness  it   s my understanding that humans feel a similar effect when presented with an action that presents a moral conflict .  thus  my use of the human term .      janet grinned  deepening the lines netting her eyes .     longwinded  but logical enough  i suppose .      basalom blinked again .     brevity is more desired than accuracy when speaking of human emotions .      that elicited a quick laugh .     sometimes  basalom .  sometimes .  it   s a judgment call  i   m afraid .  sometimes it doesn   t matter what you say so long as you just talk .         i am not a good judge when it comes to human emotions  doctor .         which puts you in company with most of us  i   m afraid .     janet clamped the seals on the probe   s surface and patted it affectionately .  leds glowed emerald on the launching tube   s panel as she closed the access .      what does a human being do when he or she is uneasy  doctor anastasi .      janet shrugged  stepping back .     it depends .  if you believe in something  you go ahead with it .  you trust your judgment and ignore the feeling .  if you never have any doubts  you   re either mad or not thinking things through .         then you have reservations about your experiment as well  but you will still launch the probe .         yes     she answered .     if people were so paralyzed by doubt that they never did anything without being certain of the outcome  there   d never be children  after all .      as janet watched  basalom seemed to ponder that .  the robot moved a step closer to the controls for the launching tube  its hand twitched   another idiosyncrasy .  the robot seemed to be on the verge of wanting to say more .  the glimmer of a thought struck her .     basalom .         yes  doctor .         would you care to launch this probe .      blink .  twitch .  for a moment  the robot didn   t move .  janet thought perhaps it would not  then the hand reached out and touched the contact .     thank you  doctor     basalom said  and pressed .   serried lights flashed  there was a chuff of escaping air  and the probe was flung into the airless void beyond .  basalom turned to watch it on the viewscreen  janet watched him .      you never said what your reservations were exactly  basalom     she noted .      these new robots   with your programming  so much is left for them to decide .  yes  the three laws are imbedded in the positronic matrix  but you have given them no definition of    human .            you wonder what will happen .         if they one day encounter human beings  will they recognize them .  will they respond as they are supposed to respond .      janet shrugged .     i don   t know .  that   s the beauty of it  basalom .  i don   t know .         if you say so  doctor .  but i don   t understand that concept .         they   re seeds .  formless  waiting seeds coded only with the laws .  they don   t even know they   re robots .  i   m curious to see what they grow up to be  my friend .      janet turned and watched the hurtling probe wink in sunlight as it tumbled away from the ship .  it dwindled as it fell into the embrace of the world   s gravity and was finally lost in atmospheric glare .  janet sighed .      this one   s planted     she said .  she took a deep breath .     now let   s get out of here     she said .     chapter    the doppleganger    the probe lay encased in mud halfway down a hillside .  the once silvery sides were battered and scorched from the long fall through the atmosphere  drying streamers of black earth coated the dented sides .  ghostly heat waves shimmered  and the metallic hull ticked as it cooled and contracted .  the echoes of its landing reverberated for a long time among the hills .   inside the abused shell  timed relays opened and fed power to the positronic circuitry of the robot nestled in its protective cradle .  the neophyte mind found itself in total darkness .  had it been a living creature  its birth instincts would have taken over like a sea turtle burrowing from the wet sand to find the shimmering sea .  the robot had its own instinct analogue   the three laws of robotics .  knowledge of these basic rules flooded the robot   s brightening awareness .   first law  a robot may not harm a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .   second law  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .   third law  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not interfere with the first or second laws .   this was the manner in which most of known human space defined the laws .  any schoolchild of aurora or earth or solaris could have recited them by rote .  but to the fledgling  there was one important  essential difference .  to the fledgling  there were no words involved  only deep  core compulsions .  the fledgling had no sense that it had been built or that it was merely a constructed machine .   it didn   t think of itself as a robot .   it only knew that it had certain instructions it must obey .   as survival instincts  the laws were enough to spark a response .  second law governed the fledgling   s first reactions  enhanced by third law resonance .  there were imperious voices in its mind  inbuilt programming  speaking a language it knew instinctively .  the robot followed the instructions given it  and more circuits opened .   an opening appeared in the probe   s hull  and the fledgling allowed itself to rollout .  the skin of its body shimmered  the myriad dodecahedral segments flexing and shifting as it stretched like warm putty .  the robot extruded pseudopods to stabilize the round body .  sensory input was taken in through the skin  optical  auditory  tactile  scent .  at the same time  a larger store of basic files was released into the receptive mind  a heavily edited encyclopedia of carefully chosen knowledge .  it paused  searching the programming as it absorbed impressions of its surroundings .   a voice whispered .   move away from the landing site .  beings may come to investigate  they may be aggressive and dangerous .  hide .   which left the problem  how to move .  the positronic brain searched the files and found an answer .  the skin molded itself further  the pseudopods becoming muscular legs .  the robot scuttled away quickly  moving uphill to a stand of coarse  tall grass .  its round body flattened  the legs retracted  it hunkered down  patient .   as it waited  it inventoried itself dispassionately .  the three laws overlaid everything else in its mind  but there was more .  most of its programming  and indeed this very self evaluation  seemed to be manifestations of the third law .  it must protect its own existence  to survive  it must learn as much as possible .   underneath the laws was the layer of initial programming  most of which the fledgling had already followed in the first few minutes of life .  beneath that was a substrate of complex if then branches .  the robot ignored most of those   they all fed back into the laws in any case .   only one set of impulses was immediately needed  and that flowed directly from the laws .  a robot may not harm a human being .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings  the laws insisted .  but what was a human being .   the programming gave an answer  not a definition but a description  a human being is an intelligent lifeform .  so the fledgling  not knowing what a    robot    was other than a term that applied to itself  knew it had to find human beings  to protect and serve them .  it had to search out an intelligent lifeform .   it began to formulate a strategy .   the fledgling didn   t move  it continued to wait .  intelligence of necessity implied curiosity .  an intelligent lifeform in the immediate area would have seen the fiery  noisy descent .  it would come to investigate the fall .  if no life that met the criterion arrived  then the fledgling would look elsewhere .   the area in which the probe had landed was heavily forested .  tightly packed trees with large  blue green fronds huddled nearby and surrounded the grassy  hillside meadow .  the area was alive with sound now  and the robot could see movement in the twilight under the swaying canopy of leaves .  the air was temperate and fragrant with damp earth  the sound of running water trilled not far away .  this was a good place  the robot decided .  human beings   whatever they might be   would probably find this location pleasant .  had they come here  they might well have stayed .   afternoon faded to evening .  the robot saw several creatures on the hillside  but none displayed any undue interest in the pod .  once  something with a thin  furred body approached .  on muscular hind legs  it stretched out a long  four fingered hand to touch the pod  and the robot saw a marsupial pouch on its stomach .  though the versatile hand made the robot watch closely  the creature did nothing to reveal more than animal intelligence .  it wore no clothing  had no tools  and the robot   s sensitive hearing recorded only meaningless grunts from the beast .  the marsupial glanced around with wide  scarlet pupiled eyes  nostril slits flapping on its wide  flat head .  then it went back down on all fours and bounded off .  the fledgling decided not to follow .  not yet .   nightfall came with a surprising quickness after the sun slipped behind the trees  the air temperature dropped as rapidly .  the forest settled into relative quiet as the nocturnal creatures woke and began to prowl .  the night was well lit .  the larger of the two moons was full  the smaller  at three quarters  rose not long after full night .   somewhere under the trees  a series of coughing barks rose  long and highly modulated .  the robot began to listen closely as the call came again  slightly changed .  another voice answered the first  shorter and deeper  then yet another  followed by a shivering howl .  the intonations were complex and varied  yet obviously from the same species .  already the fledgling had identified repetitive    syllables    in the phrases .   twin shadowed creatures moved under the margins of the trees  sleek and fast .  the fledgling counted five of them  though more may have been lurking farther back in the forest .  one of the pack broke away from the group  moving into moonlight .   the creature was caninoid .  at least  it came closest to matching that type in the inbuilt files of the robot   s brain .  that meant little in itself .  there was nothing in the robot   s programmed knowledge that said a    human being    could not be canine .  standing on four legs  the animal stood a meter from shoulder to ground  powerfully built and broad chested .  the fur was mottled gray and black  glossy with silvered tips  the head was short muzzled and round  with a large skull and wide set  light eyes .  the tail was long and furless  it looked nearly prehensile .  as the robot watched  the creature howled again as if in challenge  revealing molars set well back behind a double rank of incisors   an omnivore  possibly  not strictly a meat eater .  the front legs ended in a clawed paw  but the toes fingers were long  separate  and articulated  with a definite closing thumb for grasping .  the thick elbow joints seemed capable of a wide range of motion .   it stared at the pod gleaming in doubled moonlight .  it reared up on its hind legs  a female  the robot noted  .  with a stabbing motion of her front paw  she gestured  a wave .   moonlight glinted on something on the creature   s chest  and the fledgling adjusted its vision to see the thing more clearly  a long  curved fang  hanging on a string of braided vine .  artifact .  the word screamed in the fledgling   s mind  but she continued to wait .   four others came out of the cover of the trees now  one gray furred ancient  two adults  and a youngling .  they moved swiftly to the sides of the first but carefully stayed behind her .  the adults paced  restless .  the ancient jabbered  half bark  half growl .  the leader shook her head .  the old one barked again  and the leader turned with a growl  showing her teeth .  she cuffed at the old one  but the raking claws missed as the elder cowered back and lifted her muzzle to bare the throat in submission .  the leader turned her back on the others and stared again at the pod .  she approached the crumpled metal  snuffling .   she sat before it .   the tail served as support  and its agile tip curled around the back feet .  the creature cocked her head to one side then the other .  she sniffed again  leaning closer to the pod  then reached out with her left paw .  talons clicked on metal  she tapped the surface  listening to the faint  hollow ringing .   what she did next made synapses open in the robot   s positronic mind .   the tail flicked and curled around a small stick on the ground near the pod .  the stick was brought up  she took it in her paw  clasping it between the thumb and two fingers .  leaning forward  she placed the tip of the stick under a torn flap of metal and levered up a strand of foil insulation .  she pulled it loose and sat back to examine it  letting the stick drop .   tool use .  coupled with the intricate language  the necklace the leader wore and their curiosity about the probe  that was enough evidence .  they were intelligent  that also meant that they were human beings .   with that decision  the unformed body of the fledgling began to take on definite shape  as if unseen hands were molding clay while using the creatures before it as models .  first  the basic wolf like shape  the muscular leanness .  the head extruded  rounded  then pushed out the snout of a nose and the flaps of ears .  fixed optical lenses focused in deep set eye sockets  colored the same startling ice blue .  it could not fully imitate fur  but the surface texture roughened  and the reflective patterns altered so that it displayed a vaguely similar silver gray and black pattern .  after a moment of pondering  the robot also mimicked the secondary sexual characteristics of the leader .  the behavior of the leader suggested that scent was an important sense to them .  that was simple enough .  a quick sampling of the leader   s pheromones  and tiny artificial glands secreted an artificial wolf scent .   a gentle breeze was blowing downslope .  the leader raised her head suddenly .  she went down on all fours  and her lips drew back to bare the dangerous fangs .  she growled  staring up the hill to the stand of grass where the robot waited .   the robot stepped out to meet them .   at the same time  without warning  the leader howled and charged .     chapter    initiate    the wolf creature   s attack was maddeningly swift  but the fledgling   s reflexes were still faster .  she had no time to retreat  only to react .  the third law compelled the robot to move so as to protect herself while the first law stopped her from harming the wolf creature in return .  as the snarling leader leapt toward the robot  the fledgling rolled so that her powerful jaws snapped shut on air  and the claws barely touched the metallic body .  even so  the force of the blow sent the robot flailing in the dirt before she found her balance again .   the fledgling bounded to her feet  turning  but the leader    strangely   hadn   t followed up her advantage .  crouching  the wolf creature bared her teeth once more at the robot and uttered a quick growl that was obviously a command .  the second law demanded that a human being be obeyed  and the fledgling had made the decision that the creatures were human .  yet without understanding the language  she could only guess as to what was being said .   she remembered how the leader had challenged the old one in the pack .  she patterned her behavior after the ancient   s  she bared her throat submissively and backed away .   the ploy worked .  the leader sniffed again  growled softly deep in her throat  and turned .  she padded down the hill without looking back .  halfway to her followers  she stopped and glared back up the slope to the fledgling  standing motionless under the twin moons .  the robot took a step in the leader   s direction  the    human    turned once again and continued on down the hill .   the invitation was clear .  it seemed more dangerous to ignore her than to follow  so the robot did so  imitating the leader   s silent  fluid gait .  once the leader approached the other wolf creatures again  the pack reformed .  the body language and demeanor of the others told the robot that an established pecking order denoted precedence within the pack .  there was a well defined hierarchy in which a newcomer  by all indications  took the lowest rung .  even the juveniles bared teeth as the fledgling approached  and she hung well back as the leader barked commands .  the wolf creatures turned as one and slid quickly back under the cover of moonlit trees .   the fledgling followed closely behind .   under the trees  the pack moved quietly and furtively .  they had obviously been interrupted in the middle of a hunt .  just inside the trees  three young wolf creatures waited for them .  a flint knife hung from each of their necks  and they were yoked to primitive travois  long poles of dead branches lashed together with vines .  the travois held the fragrant  butchered carcasses of dead animals .  each bump caused a cloud of black insects to rise from the meat .   the fledgling stayed with the pack easily  somehow  it felt right to be moving this way under the double shadows beneath the slow rustling of the leaves   having decided the wolf creatures were human  her mind was already adopting their patterns as correct .  the youngest of the juvenile carriers slackened his pace not long after they left the clearing of the pod  dropping back until he was abreast the fledgling with his burden .  he made an inquisitive soft bark as they ran behind the others  when the fledgling didn   t answer  he repeated the sound .   he was obviously waiting for a response  yet the fledgling had no idea what was appropriate .  she knew only one language   that of the words inside her head .  she could give names to the things she saw around her  could even speak them aloud if she wished .  she gave no thought to where that language came from  it simply was .   the problem was translation  to change her language into words these creatures used .  she knew that once she got them to talk  she would quickly acquire a vocabulary .  the robotic memory would forget nothing it heard  the positronic intelligence would discover syntax and grammar rapidly .   but without input .  there was only a void .  a void was dangerous to her  and that was anathema to the third law .  if she understood them and if she could communicate easily  there would be a lessening of danger .  she had to make them speak enough for her to start acquiring the knowledge she needed .   the adolescent was waiting for her response  staring at her as he pulled the travois through the quiet woods .  the fledgling did what her programming decided was the highest percentage action .  she imitated the sound the young male had made .   the effect was not what she desired .  the youngster glared at her with a rolling of pastel blue eyes  sniffed disgustedly  and increased his speed to put distance between himself and the robot .  she let him go .   for a long time  they wound their way through the paths of the forest .   the largest moon had set before the leader came to a halt deep in the forest and several kilometers from the landing site .  the forest had gone dark and tangled .  large vines spun leafy webbings from the trees  the underbrush was thick and prickled with thorns .  a cold dew frothed the edges of leaves  sparkling in the blue white gleam of the remaining moon and spilling down on the pack from above .  the fur of the wolf creatures was beaded with it .   the leader prowled the edges of the clearing as the others sat on their haunches  tongues lolling and their breath steaming in the night air .  the fledgling imitated them  watching as the leader sniffed the air in evident agitation .  the robot sampled the air  there was a faint trace of a bitter animal scent below that of the wolf creatures and their kill .   nearby  a mass of tiny white winged moths spiraled and danced in a shaft of moonlight .  a sloth like animal capered along the pathway of tree limbs  shaking down more of the dew .  the forest was almost too quiet .  the panting of the pack seemed very loud .   beyond the clearing came a thrashing of leaves and the sharp crack of a branch breaking underfoot .  the bitter smell was suddenly very intense .   the moths abandoned their mad cavort and fled silently .   the leader barely had time to growl a warning .   a nightmare vision burst through the trees nearest the leader .  there was a glimpse of red  nearly phosphorescent eyes set in a head that looked as if it had been crushed  wide and flat with an impossibly long jaw bristling with rows of knife edged fangs  fangs that the fledgling recognized as the same as the one that hung on the leader   s necklace .  below  two sets of reptilian  long fingered claws flailed .  the thing moved on thick back legs  larger by far than any of the pack  its stout body armored with beaded hard scales .  a muscular tail whipped around it  tearing into the undergrowth .   it saw the pack  shrieked thinly  and charged .  a fierce blow of the claws raked the leader   s shoulder  and she yelped in dismay .  she crouched  ready to attack  but was obviously overmatched .   a blur of motion passed her .   the fledgling had begun to move from the first sight of the apparition  powered by the first law .   another robot  patterned after the moral codes of homo sapiens  might only have restrained the creature .  but the fledgling was already adopting the mental patterns she had seen in her    humans .     she was a carnivore  a hunter .   she slammed into the side of the thing as it readied to snap at the leader .  powerful as the beast was  its strength was overmatched by the robot   s  and her new form seemed admirably suited to complement her mechanical power .  her teeth clamped down on the beast   s arm and twisted savagely .  the thing bellowed in pain and reared back .   still  the creature was too large  too bulky .  a flick of its arm threw her off as it roared in fury .  the huge mouth opened  giving off a stench of ancient  rotting meat .  the beast snapped at the fledgling  but she had already moved .  as it turned to find her  she leapt again  this time at the long neck of the beast .  she hesitated as her jaws closed around it .  but already the others in the pack were attacking .  if she hesitated  if she waited any longer  they might be injured .   she put pressure on her jaws and felt the windpipe collapse beneath her crushing jaws .   the beast fell  choking .  the rest of the pack swarmed over the body  tearing at it .   all but the leader .  panting  she regarded the fledgling  and there seemed to be little sympathy in her stance .  the forepaws were braced  as if she were waiting for an attack .  the dark lips were drawn back slightly from the gums to reveal the ivory teeth  and a low  relentless growling came from her throat .  the fang at her neck swung softly from side to side .   the fledgling didn   t move .  it seemed best to stand absolutely still .  the leader   s icy stare remained on her for long seconds  while the rest of the pack ripped apart the body of the reptilian beast  while they reformed into a ragged line  while the younglings were strapped back into the travois .   at last  the old one barked a query .  the leader seemed to ponder what had been said .  then her gaze moved away from the fledgling  almost disdainfully .  she padded back to the head of the pack and howled .  they readied themselves to move on again .   this time  the youngling meat carriers waited for the fledgling to go first .  the pack left her a space well up toward the leader .  the old wolf creature moved alongside her .  just before they left the clearing  the old one pointed at the tattered body of the reptile .     hrrringa     he said throatily  then repeated the word .      hrrringa .     the fledgling spoke the strange word  also pointing .  hrrringa  reptile creature .   the old one nodded .  his eyes  rheumy and bloodshot  narrowed with pleasure as the pack began to move again .   by the time the pack stopped to sleep in the early morning  the fledgling had learned several more words .     chapter    kin    packhome .   that was what the old one  the fledgling had learned that his name was lifecrier  called the cave dimpling a rocky hillside deep in the forest .  packhome was where all litter kin   those of the same pack   dwelled .  the fledgling had picked up a name among the kin herself  she would be known as silverside  lifecrier decided  for her flanks gleamed like the scales of a fish  and like a fish her skin was hard and cold .  the name seemed right .      you killed the hrrringa  the sharpfang  and saved keeneye   s life     lifecrier reminded the robot in kinspeech .  following keeneye   s lead  the group from the hunt loped from the cover of trees and started up the long slope to the cave of packhome .  the moons  largeface and smallface  as the hunt called them  had spent most of the night chasing one another behind wind blown clouds .  smallface peeked out from an opening and spilled light down on the pack .      the news will spread quickly     lifecrier continued .     you have status now .  don   t bare your throat to any of the kin who weren   t on the hunt .  you had the right to challenge keeneye for leadership of the hunt  even though you didn   t do so  those at packhome are all lower than you .  let them know your scent  but if one of them acts the superior  challenge them .         i won   t hurt litter kin     silverside said .  already it felt natural to be speaking in their language .  she was no longer simply translating from that odd internal vocabulary she   d somehow known from the beginning .     i can   t .      lifecrier let his tongue loll out between time dulled teeth  amusement .     don   t worry about that .  they   ll back down and keeneye has to support you .  she owes you a life debt .      silverside had spent the last four days with the pack  moving through the forest and resting during the hot  bright days .  she had helped them kill  watched them butcher the animals and send the younglings back home when the travois were full .  she   d listened to them  always learning  as they complained about the lack of prey  as they licked wounds  as they groomed each other  as they talked about old fights and old hunts .   in the four nights silverside had spent with the wolf creatures  she   d learned much of the complex language of the pack .  it was a blend of body language  of modulated yelps and whines and barks .  there were different modes of speech as well  the formal hunttongue used between different packs or to stress superiority among litter kin  an informal kinspeech used in packhome or between friends  the simple beasttalk  which had no words at all but only the high emotional content of the raw animal .   underlying it all were the strong instincts of the pack carnivore  and the robot was rapidly absorbing that mindset .  already her interpretation of the three laws was unlike that of any humanoid positronic intelligence .  a robotics engineer would have considered silverside dangerously unbalanced  one who knew what she   d done to the sharpfang in the forest and watched her behavior over the last several days would have been certain of it .   silverside could already see wolf creatures crowding the opening to the cave  which glowed green in the darkness from phosphorescent moss the kin gathered and used for light .  they yelped greetings to the hunt in glad beasttalk  and there were happy cries at the sight of game dragging behind the remaining carriers .  keeneye led the hunt to the cave opening  then sat on her haunches as the rest of the pack spilled out .  she began speaking quietly to two of the other kin .   there were ten or more litter kin who came from the cave mouth  and silverside could hear and smell pups still inside .  the ones who stayed in packhome during the hunt were the nursing mothers  the infirm  and the very young .  some of them were already taking meat from the carriers and moving it inside .  others greeted mates while the two youngest from the hunt basked in the obvious adulation of the immature pups .   silverside noticed the sidewise glances from keeneye and the others  the half disguised scenting in her direction .  she sat alongside lifecrier  just behind keeneye and out of the press of kin .  keeneye glanced back at her with a hard stare .      i   ve told the kin about you     she said in hunttongue  and there was no kindness in her tone at all .     i   ve told them that you are to be treated as litter kin .  a place will be made for you in packhome .         thank you     silverside replied   a quick bark and a nod of the head .  silverside made her response as cold and formal as keeneye   s .  the hunt leader sniffed at that  nodded  and padded softly into packhome .   silverside could smell lifecrier   s strange delight at the exchange .     she insults you by using the hunttongue .  you know that .         she is the leader     silverside answered .     that means i must obey her .          she   s still waiting for you to challenge her .  i could almost taste the fear .         why would i challenge her .         you came from the void     lifecrier said .  there was an eager lilt in his ancient voice  and he howled softly in beasttalk for a moment .     i saw the trail of fire as you fell from the spiritworld in the stone egg .  you   re the oldmother   s offspring .  you were sent to us  and so keeneye waits for the spirit of oldmother to move you .         i do not feel a spirit inside     silverside told the old kin .      you came from the spiritworld     lifecrier said again  as if that fact answered all objections .      i do not know that  lifecrier .  there is no memory of it in me .  i knew nothing before i crawled from the egg .  i acted as it felt right to act .  i saw keeneye and the hunt  it seemed important that i take on your shape .         that was the spirit of oldmother speaking to you .     lifecrier tilted his graying head and gave a short  excited yip .     you   ve come as oldmother promised .  you   re the sign of forgiveness .  you   re her answer to the walkingstones  and that   s why keeneye is afraid .         the walkingstones .  i do not know the word .  what are walkingstones .      lifecrier had no chance to answer the robot   s query .  keeneye came back out into the night air and trotted directly toward them .  rather than halting as she approached  she continued so that silverside and lifecrier had to give way or be struck .  keeneye sat exactly where silverside had been sitting .      the hunt must go back out     she said in kinspeech .     the meat we killed fills barely half the food cave .  we wasted time finding the stone egg and silverside .      silverside said nothing  but lifecrier gave a short bark of derision .     a waste of time that saved your life     he told keeneye .     you should thank the oldmother for sending you such a waste .      keeneye gave a low beasttongue growl as smallface slid back into cloud cover .  her eyes were bright in the gloom  touched with flecks of green from the phosphorus around the cave mouth .  the wind ruffled the long fur around her neck and brought the scent of forest .     had we not gone looking for the egg  perhaps we would never have met the sharpfang and i would not have a life debt to silverside .  and only an old litter kin too ancient to sire pups says that oldmother sent the egg .  but that doesn   t matter .  the hunt has to feed the kin .         you know that finding silverside wasn   t the reason the meat was scarce .  it   s the hill of stars and the walkingstones    that   s what has made the prey scarce  and that   s why oldmother sent silverside to us .     lifecrier was slipping into hunttongue  his words and posture becoming more stylized .     i  lifecrier  say this because the allspirit lives in me .  i will not let keeneye deceive the litter kin .      keeneye snarled  showing her teeth .     do you want to challenge me  old one .  do you want to lead the hunt yourself .  fine  i   m ready .      others of the litter kin were filling the cleared area around the cave mouth  watching silently .  silverside could scent the tension .  her senses were almost hyper aware  driven by first law programming that translated as a feeling of uneasiness .  she readied herself to move  to come between lifecrier and keeneye if they began to fight .   but lifecrier shook his grizzled head .     the allspirit told me that i was to speak the history of all kin  not lead the pack  keeneye .  that   s why i am lifecrier .  i   ve no interest in challenging you .  if you wish  i   ll submit now .     with that  lifecrier lifted his head so that the throat was exposed to keeneye .  for a moment  the tableau held  keeneye quivering on the edge of attack and silverside ready to intercept the leader   s rush .   but keeneye did nothing .  slowly  lifecrier let his muzzle drop .  his demeanor was haughty  knowing that he   d won this confrontation .     silverside is the gift of the oldmother     he declared loudly so that all the others could hear .      the truth of that remains to be seen     keeneye grumbled .      haven   t the walkingstones taken the lives of kin .  haven   t they driven the prey from the forest around them .  haven   t we seen pups starve and mothers    milk become thin .  haven   t oneeye   s and scarredpaw   s packs warned us not to enter their territory  knowing how desperate we are .         yes     keeneye admitted     but that says nothing about silverside .         i know the old tales   i had them from the old lifecrier  as he had them from the one before him on down through time .  the spirits of kin past live in me .  i know what i know .     again  lifecrier began using the hunttongue as if reciting a litany .     i saw the fiery egg leave a trail across the void to lead the hunt .  when silverside revealed herself  we could all smell the scent of litter kin .  the allspirit woke in me as i tasted it .      lifecrier rose up on his hind legs  pointing with a forepaw over the treetops to the west .     look  we   ve seen the hill of stars from packhome for ten dances .  doesn   t the sight of it make the fur rise on your back .      silverside looked to where the old one had pointed .  faintly  through the swaying foliage  she could see a triangular shape a long distance away .  its dim bulk was pricked with lights as bright as the stars .  she adjusted her vision  bringing the thing into sharper focus .  unwinking rectangles of yellow light were set in a dark pyramid of stone .  artifact .  there was no translation for that word in the language of kin .  artifact .   the vision filled her with a need to know more .      the old tales have muddled your head     keeneye was telling lifecrier .      the old tales begin to seem too much like now  i   d say instead     lifecrier answered  and there was a soft rumble of agreement from the kin around them .     it is as if graymane walked again .      silverside tore her attention away from the sight of the hill of stars .     who is graymane .     she asked .  at that  keeneye sniffed laughter .      so oldmother   s supposed offspring doesn   t know the old tales     she spat .     i know them all too well .  and i   ve little enough time to spend in packhome to listen to them again .     with a shake of her head  she rose and went into the cave .  most of the kin followed her  but a few remained behind on the ledge .      who is graymane .     silverside asked again .   lifecrier had watched keeneye   s departure .  now he turned back to silverside and nodded .     i will tell you     he said formally .  raising his muzzle  he gave a long  mournful howl .     chapter    lifecrier   s tale    listen  oh kin .   lifecrier began  .  gather here and listen .   i speak of a time before time .   i speak to the spirits that live in you so they too will listen and know that we haven   t forgotten them .   i speak of the ending days before the one great pack splintered .   in that long  last winter  two kin of the final litter  sister and brother  came to be possessed by their ancestor spirits .  graymane was taken by the spirit of the oldmother  may her name be praised   and  with the wisdom of the oldmother  she became the first of us to speak the language of the kin .  splitear  her brother  was taken by the spirit of the firstbeast  and thus he spoke no language at all .   this is the way of things  my kin .  both graymane and splitear wished to rule the great pack .  litter kin though they were  no two kin were less alike than graymane and splitear .  splitear was strong and vital .  he was the largest and most powerful of the hunting males  and the savage instinct of the firstbeast rode easily in him .  no other of the pack challenged his right to lead the hunt .   none except his sister graymane .   graymane didn   t have splitear   s hunting skills .  her nose wasn   t as keen to follow the scent of the prey  her eyes weren   t as piercing in the darkness under the trees  her body wasn   t as large or as powerful .   still  her soul was like that of a crystalline rock  unbreakable .  graymane   s challenge of splitear was a horrible struggle  and many in the great pack believed the two would kill each other before one of the two submitted .  their fight on that fateful night lasted from the rising of smallface to its setting  and their growling could be heard throughout the lost caves of that first packhome .   but at last graymane realized that she was overmatched .  her brother must win  and so she bared her throat to him .  splitear howled his triumph to largeface as the strongest have always howled  and graymane slunk away to lick her terrible wounds .  when splitear led the hunters out  graymane stayed behind watching enviously with the pups  the nursing mothers  and others in the pack too weak to hunt .   so it was for two dances of the moons .  the great pack was a wonder  my kin  even then at the end of its time .  the hunt was a glorious vision  with thousands of kin flowing like quick gray shadows under the trees .  packhome was a vast network of caverns bigger than the forest in which we live now  and each litter mother had her own place within it .  the instincts of the spiritpack drove them  and even without the oldmother   s gift of words  the kin had become most favored of all creatures .  of all the beasts of the world  there were none more feared .   now listen to me  for we come to the crux .  the nights of the one great pack were passing quickly .  the hunt was failing  even as our hunt fails us now .  the kin had become too numerous for the land to support  they had preyed too long in the same area .  splitear had to lead the hunt farther and farther from packhome  and few carriers came back from the hunt bearing meat for graymane and the thousands of others .   the forest then was far more dangerous .  huge sharpfangs  larger and more cunning than the one killed by silverside  lurked in the tree gloom .  in times before  they had left the kin alone unless they found a straggler from the hunt or came on a pup wandering in the forest .  but now  with the prey animals killed or driven far away  the sharpfangs had only the kin to eat .  maddened by hunger  they hunted the kin as the kin hunted their own food  not caring for their losses .   a large group of sharpfangs followed the hunt .  during the brightness when the hunters slept  they would attack every day .  without speech  splitear and the hunters couldn   t act as kin do now  helping each other and coordinating their defense .  by the time the third moondance was done  splitear had lost a full half of the hunt and had to return to packhome .   splitear feared that he   d find there only the bones of the rest of the kin .  the spirits in him knew that the end had come for the one pack .  the time had come for the splintering .   during the nights of the long hunt  graymane had done as the oldmother commanded and taught the kin left at packhome the gift of speech .  the wisdom of the oldmother was never more needed .   for splitear was right .  the sharpfangs did rage from the forest to attack packhome  and graymane led the kin against them .  armed with words  able to warn each other and arrange their defenses  the kin killed several of the beasts and sent the rest fleeing back into the forest .  though their own losses were still grievous  they survived .  the kin praised graymane and the oldmother with their new speech .   so it was that when the stragglers of splitear   s hunt returned to packhome at last  they found not bones broken and licked clean of marrow  but the heads of dead sharpfangs hung on poles as warning .  graymane and the others came out to meet splitear .  when they saw how few had returned  they howled their lament to the moons .      how could this have happened .     graymane asked splitear .  splitear could smell the pride in graymane  for she had defended packhome well and knew it .  but splitear couldn   t understand the words graymane spoke and so could not reply .   now  as all kin know  oldmother and firstbeast have always been at odds  even in the void .  firstbeast roused a jealousy in splitear so that he believed graymane was challenging him once more .  with a terrible growling  he threatened graymane .  she cowered back .      there is no challenge here  splitear     she told him .     i beg of you  litter kin  let us become friends .  let me teach you the o dmother   s speech so we can plan for the good of the pack .      the spirit of firstbeast made splitear angrier yet  and he rushed at his sister .  she bared her neck immediately to him  but firstbeast   s rage made splitear brutal  and he ripped the throat from her .   the earth drank graymane    s blood as the spirit of oldmother wailed     all kin are cursed .     oldmother cried as her spirit fled from graymane .  her fearsome shape hung before the cowering kin  blackening the sky  and her eyes like fire burned them .  a raging wind howled and shrieked around her  and dark thunderclouds were her fur .      the one pack will now be scattered and diminished .  you have thrown away my gift like dumb animals .  now i throw away my protection .  you shall howl like the stupid animals you are and not understand one another .  before any kin remembers my gift again  a thousand great dances will pass .  i will teach others who will listen before you .  i tell you  the kin will hear stones speaking before i forgive you .      the allspirit heard oldmother   s curse and thus it came to be .  those of the kin who had learned to speak were afraid of splitear   s anger and so remained silent .  splitear would not lead the kin away from packhome .  the hunt returned to the forest but found little food  and the sharpfangs returned .  splitear himself was killed in one such attack  and packhome was overrun .  the beasts cracked the bones of kin and licked them clean .  those who survived fled into the woods   like animals they ran  splitting into small packs of litter kin .   so it was that the time of the one pack came to an end .     chapter    the hunt       so you think i am graymane returned again .     silverside said after lifecrier had finished the tale .      i do     lifecrier answered emphatically  still speaking in the formal hunttongue .     you have come to lead us back to the time of the great pack .  can you deny it  silverside .  can you say with certainty that i am wrong .      the robot searched her memory .  there was nothing there that directly contradicted the possibility  improbable as it might seem .  beyond the moment of her awakening in this place and the erratic store of knowledge she   d been given  there was nothing .  yet .  .  .      i can   t     silverside answered truthfully  as she had to .  she shook her head .     i don   t know .         you told me that you were formless as the void itself when you came .  you said that when you saw us  you felt compelled to change your shape so that you looked like us .         that is true .         then what i   ve said is also true     lifecrier answered triumphantly  and gave a joyous howl that many of the others joined with .     you   ve been sent because of the walkingstones and the hill of stars .  i know it  silverside .  i know it as i know the old tales .  you   re the sign that the oldmother has forgiven us .      silverside was troubled .  the delicate balance of the three laws shifted in her mind  weighing priorities .     perhaps     she said again .     possibly .  i don   t know  lifecrier .  i cannot answer you .  i don   t know .      silverside glanced back at packhome .  keeneye sat on her haunches at the entrance to the cave  limned in the glow of the moss .  the smell of woodfires smoke preserving the meat in the cold caves was strong in the night .  keeneye stared at silverside and the gathering of kin around her  and there was a distinct menace in her gaze .  silverside knew that if she tried to brush past keeneye into packhome  there would be a challenge .  here and now  with no way to back out of it .   first law imperatives made her turn aside instead  though she hesitated .   with the kin watching  she padded away toward a trail that led to the top of the hill .  as she moved away  keeneye stirred and called after her .      the hunt will go out again tomorrow     the leader said in commanding hunttongue .     you will join us again instead of staying behind at packhome .      the robot looked back .  the second law was clear here  keeneye was a human and the leader .     as you wish     she said .   keeneye nodded .  her eyes glinted  her lips lifted above her incisors .  she gave a low beasttalk growl and settled down in front of the entrance .   silverside turned away from the other kin and continued on .  she spent the rest of the night alone at the summit of the hill  staring at the moons and the hill of stars in the distance .  she pondered all that lifecrier had said and mused over the differences between herself and the kin .   if there was an oldmother  as lifecrier insisted  she said nothing to silverside that night .     keeneye said nothing to the robot when she came down from the hilltop in the first light of morning .   lifecrier was as friendly as ever  but the other kin were less eager than they had been the night before  sensing the unresolved conflict with keeneye .  where lifecrier came up to her eagerly  his tongue stroking her face in the greetings of kin  the rest of the wolf creatures hung back .  though they made way for her as they would have for any higher status kin  they said very little to her unless she spoke first .   silverside   s behavior didn   t help things .  at full light  keeneye ordered the meat to be dragged from the storage caves for the communal meal .  the kin gathered in the largest of the caves  sitting down in a large ragged circle  the pups running in and out among the adults .  smoke preserved flanks passed from hand to hand .   silverside declined her portion .      i don   t eat     she said to the startled adolescent who handed the robot her share .  it was only the simple truth   silverside hadn   t even thought it strange .  it simply was   a fact that somehow she knew .     i cannot even if i wished .  it is not necessary for me .      but she heard the beasttalk grumbling and speculation from some of the others .     you see  keeneye .     lifecrier had said .     she is part of the void  not of the earth .  she is full of the spirit of the oldmother .      keeneye responded with a howl of irritation .     give her nothing  then  if she insists on playing the oldmother     the leader barked .     and if she hasn   t the strength for the hunt because of it  let the sharpfangs have her .     keeneye growled and stalked from the cave herself  smelling of anger and resentment .   the rest of the day  all the kin but lifecrier avoided her  though she   d felt them watching and sniffed their uncertainty .  watching and wondering .   the hunt left packhome in the early evening  after the heat of the day had subsided and the sunlight turned to evening   s gold green .  this time  none of the other kin would place themselves ahead of silverside .  she was second in the ragged line of kin that trotted down the hill into the green  scent filled forest .   packhome was quickly lost behind a screen of foliage and the hunt was immersed in the sights and scents of the forest .  birds were beginning to settle in their roosts for the corning night  quick shadows flitting through the branches .  smaller animals scuttled through the underbrush as the pack moved quickly past .  keeneye led them into the glow of the setting sun  and silverside wondered at that   the perfect recall of her robotic mind could not forget lifecrier   s remark that the walkingstones  whatever they were  had driven away the game near the hill of stars .   yet keeneye padded unerringly in that direction .  once one of the younger kin had questioned keeneye   s path  and the leader had simply turned with a beasttongue growl that sent the adolescent into submissive silence .   after that  there was no more conversation within the pack at all .  they followed keeneye silently along the winding game trails .   had silverside been human or even kin  she might have marveled at the sights  scents  and sounds of the forest .  she might have gaped at the papery pods the size of a youngling dangling from vines and wriggling with some gelatinous interior life .  she might have stopped to sniff the perfumed sap oozing up from below a rocky slope .  she might have been startled by the shrill rasp of tall weeds that were moving though there was no wind .  she might have been captivated by the assorted small animals that leaped across the path or watched as the kin loped quickly by .   her positronic brain saw it all but without passion .  she cared only for that which affected the intricate balance of the three laws .  she noted that although the small life was abundant  there were few signs of the larger creatures that were food for the kin .  she noted the growing apprehension of the pack as keeneye continued westward .   that resonated with the laws .   she saw how lifecrier and the others watched her  waiting to see what the spirit of the oldmother would do  and she wondered if   just maybe   these priorities she felt were a reflection of a goddess   s will .  her logic circuits snickered at the thought but couldn   t entirely banish the possibility .   the weight of possible danger  tweaking the first law  nudged silverside into speech .  she lengthened her stride  moving alongside keeneye .  she used careful kinspeech  not wanting keeneye to feel formally challenged .     i   ve heard lifecrier and the others say that the meat animals have all left because of the walkingstones .  is that true  keeneye .         the oldmother didn   t bother to tell you .         no     the robot answered .  then  when keeneye said nothing further     is it true .     she asked again .   a nod .     you have a problem with that .     keeneye would not look at her .  she continued to trot  her red tongue lolling out between the knives of teeth .   the leader was leaving silverside no opening for further questions  forcing the confrontation she was obviously expecting .   silverside hesitated .  at last she dropped back into the pack again .   they continued on .   by midnight  the pack was very near where the hill of stars had glowed the night before .  there was an odd silence in the woods  as if most of the creatures that normally lived here had gone .  the very silence nudged silverside again .   she did what none of the kin would have dared to do .  the decision was simple  the reasoning complex .   by deliberately failing to define    human     by not even telling the robot that it was a robot  janet anastasi had forced upon her robot an unusual freedom of action and a liberal interpretation of the three laws .  she   d made a construct that didn   t consider itself mechanical .   she would likely have been pleased with what the robot had done so far  with silverside   s    creativity .      but silverside was still bound to the laws .  the second law demanded that she obey humans  and she had accepted the wolf creatures as    human .     in a pack society  the leader spoke for all  therefore  keeneye   s commands must carry more weight than that of any of the other kin .   yet the first law demanded that she protect human life  and logic led her to favor the many over the few .  if keeneye was indeed leading the pack into danger  the first law demanded action .  yet she   d already seen that the very lifestyle of the kin involved danger   the sharpfangs  the leadership challenges within the pack  the scarcity of food .  one could not be    human    and avoid danger .  that damped the strength of the first law .   she had to know more .  she might not be forced to action  but she was compelled to ask .   she ran swiftly in front of the leader .  for a moment  silverside thought that keeneye would simply ignore her and shoulder past  and the balance within her shifted again .  but keeneye drew up short .  the pack came to a ragged halt behind keeneye .  silverside could smell their anticipation .      if the kin need food  what good does it do us to go west .     she used hunttongue  stressing the importance of her question .   keeneye gave her only a low beasttalk rumble deep in her throat .  she glared and sat back on her hind legs  the clawed forepaws threateningly ready .   keeneye was not going to answer the question  silverside realized .  but then lifecrier pushed his grizzled muzzle forward and yapped support .     silverside asks the question we all have  keeneye .      keeneye looked back at the line of kin .  they were staring back  quiet and very intent .  silverside knew that the leader saw the subliminal challenge there .  most of the kin had gathered around lifecrier  saying nothing but lending their unvoiced support to his question .   frost blue eyes turned back to silverside .     do you challenge me now  silverside .  is that what the oldmother tells you .     she asked .      there is no food     silverside said .     the forest here is empty of all the meat animals .  that   s why i spoke .          you don   t even eat the meat .  why should you care .      silverside searched within her mind .     i must do what is best for all kin .         that is the leader   s task .     keeneye growled for emphasis .     only the leader   s task .      balances changed again .   the robot had no doubt that it was more intelligent than any of the kin .  she knew things  whether inborn memory or the oldmother   s gift .  she could see a hundred ways to improve the life of the kin .  she was also physically stronger than any of them  and she could change her shape if need be .   more intelligent .  stronger .  the chosen of the oldmother .  all that  coupled with keeneye   s insistence on coming here  spoke through the laws .   the decision clicked in her mind  firm and certain .  silverside could best obey the laws in her head by leading the pack .      i challenge you  keeneye     silverside said in hunttongue .   keeneye seemed to sigh .  her eyes closed as if in momentary prayer .     as you wish     she said .   the wolf creature came at silverside in a snarling rush  her jaws wide open to rip at the robot   s throat .  but silverside  with the superb reflexes janet anastasi had given her  was no longer there .  she moved back on her hind feet and turned  sliding aside just enough so that keeneye   s momentum took her past her .  silverside reached out and shoved keeneye as she tried to turn .  keeneye nearly crashed headlong into a tree  falling and rolling hard .  the leader bounded to her feet quickly  but there was a dazed glassiness in her eyes .   keeneye stood two legged  howled at silverside  and leaped  fingers out to claw the robot .   this time silverside allowed keeneye to strike her .  claws scraped on her metal flanks without leaving a mark .  keeneye howled in anger  frustration  and pain  and raked at silverside again  trying for the eyes .  they were vulnerable  if her skin was not .  silverside flinched .   rearing back  silverside blocked the curving blow and grabbed keeneye   s hand paw  twisting the joint .  keeneye screeched  though silverside was careful not to break any bones .  slowly  she forced the wrist backward   as keeneye thrashed to get free  as she spat at the robot  as she clawed with her free hand .  nothing she did seemed to hurt the robot .  silverside was far too strong for the wolf creature .   silverside forced keeneye down to the grass and pulled her over on her back .      submit     she whispered to the leader  and it seemed the others heard an odd sympathy in her voice .  she did not seem happy in her victory .      kill me     keeneye grunted back  her lips bared over her fangs .  she snapped uselessly at silverside .     i will not submit .  kill me .      silverside put more pressure on the hold .  ligaments groaned .     submit     she said again .     i need you to help me  and you are useless to the pack dead .  give me your throat .      the defiance went out of keeneye .  the paw was limp in silverside   s grasp .  keeneye tilted her muzzle back in submission .   yet even as silverside stood in triumph over keeneye  there was a crashing of underbrush behind her and a screech of pain from one of the kin .   first law reaction whirled silverside around as a youngling was hurled through the air to fall near silverside .  he rolled on the ground bleeding from a deep gash in his side and yelping in pain .      a walkingstone .     lifecrier shouted .     beware .      silverside   s lips drew back in a beasttongue snarl .   standing over the wounded kin was the apparition that had just burst through the trees .  it stood on two legs  its hands clenched into fists encased in a shiny metal skin .  it was far larger than any of the kin  and if what it had done to the youngling was an indication  it was immensely strong .  behind the featureless head  silverside could hear motors whirring softly .   it smelled of lightning and stone .   the head swiveled .  the apparition seemed to regard silverside strangely .   then  with a swiftness that surprised her  it charged .     chapter    a fight    the pack was milling in confusion .  lifecrier howled a lament for the downed youngling as those in the direct path of the walkingstone scattered .  only silverside was immune to the panic .   she could only respond as the laws allowed her  and the first law left her no choice .   she lunged forward  slamming herself hard into the chest of the constructed thing that had attacked the kin without warning .  there was no hesitation to her action at all   it was a pure first law response to protect the life of    humans .      her jaws closed on an unyielding metallic arm  with a strength equal to her own  the walkingstone flung silverside away .  she rolled to soften the impact  allowing her body to deform to absorb the shock .   she whirled back to attack .   lifecrier and keeneye had rallied the others .  all but the carriers tethered to the travois formed a ragged circle around the injured youngling  protecting him from the walkingstone .  they snarled and snapped  making quick thrusts of their own but staying out of range of the powerful arms .   the walkingstone had stopped  pointing a finger at the pack .  silverside  in motion  saw the fingertip become round and a dark opening appear at its apex .   weapon .  the word screamed in silverside   s head .      keeneye .     she shouted .     scatter .      she hurled herself at the walkingstone   s extended arm .   metal clashed against metal .  a line of searing  intense light cut a crazy swath harmlessly through foliage as silverside   s rush knocked the walkingstone   s arm aside .  the kin yelped and retreated again .   gears whirred menacingly inside the walkingstone .  the smell of it made silverside snarl .  the featureless  impassive face turned toward silverside  who faced it defiantly .  deliberately  the walkingstone pointed its deadly  laser tipped finger at her .  the aiming beam tracked brilliant red across her body  the skin glowed white just behind .  the ferocious heat translated as pain to silverside   s positronic brain  the    human    responses overlaid there made her yelp in response though the tough metal alloy was only scorched  not yet melted .  still  the attack disrupted circuitry to that side of her body .   she went down .   the walkingstone turned its attention back to the pack  now huddled in a knot around the youngling    silverside .     lifecrier called  her fear scent strong .     what do we do .      silverside tried to answer .  nothing happened .  her vocal circuits were temporarily gone as well .   keeneye and lifecrier tried to rally the kin .   the pack had its own peculiar method of fighting  as silverside had seen before on their way from her egg to packhome .  she knew what keeneye   s command barks said .      circle .  keep moving .  keep the walkingstone busy  but don   t let it touch you .     a sharpfang would have been dealt with in much the same way  the pack whirling around it like a clawing  biting tornado  dashing in behind to nip at ankles and then leaping back  harrying the creature until   exhausted and frustrated   it gave them a fatal opening .  then they would swarm in as one and bear it down .   such tactics gave the kin the ability to deal with carnivores far larger and stronger than themselves .   such tactics were horribly ill suited for their current foe .   it required no effort for silverside to picture what would happen if the walkingstone used its laser on any of the kin .  the urgent first law need to respond drove everything else from silverside   s mind .   with the left side of her body still shut down  there was only one possibility .  with anything fashioned to resemble a living creature  the joints   neck  elbows  knees   are the most fragile area .  silverside knew that  as a shapechanger herself  structural dynamics were part of her core knowledge .  her malleable body shifted  altered .  the mostly immobile left side she rounded as best she could  everything else she metamorphosed into a massive  coiled muscle .   she gathered herself .  aimed .   leapt .   metal boomed against metal like a thunderclap .   the walkingstone   s neck was stabilized with supports  but none were designed to withstand the tremendous hammer blow silverside represented .  there was a screech and a wail of stressed steel .  welds popped as the head was suddenly canted at an acute angle .  the glowing eyes dimmed .  the thing staggered  the laser fired wildly and high .  its knees buckled  it seemed to wheeze mechanically .   it fell .   as it fell  silverside heard its voice in her head .  oddly  silverside understood it  for the thing spoke in the language she   d been born with .  central  under attack  badly damaged and shutting down .  .  .  . the voice trailed off .  none of the kin looked as if they   d heard it .   silverside had fallen herself  resuming her wolf shape .  as her body cooled  control returned .  she managed to limp slowly to her feet  and stood on her hind legs over the fallen walkingstone .  it twitched spasmodically  but seemed no threat .  its mental voice was silent .  as silverside watched  a plume of thin  acrid smoke came from the broken neck  and all movement stopped .   silverside lifted her muzzle and gave a beasttalk howl of triumph as she   d seen the other kin do after a kill .  the others howled with her .   lifecrier and keeneye padded over .  both groveled in front of silverside  baring their necks in ritual submission .     you are the bane of walkingstones     lifecrier declared .     you saved our lives and the lives of all the kin here .         yes     silverside answered .  it was not immodesty  it was simply truth .   keeneye rose  her eyes unreadable .     i was wrong     she said .     what lifecrier said of you is true .  you are the wisest of us .  you are the oldmother   s gift .     she paused    you are now the leader of kin .         yes     silverside said .   the decision echoed in all her judgment circuits .     yes  i am     she repeated .     chapter    a hurried departure    the hard thing under his cheek seemed to be a foot .  it was attached to a very smooth and shapely leg  and at the top of the leg .  .  .      derec     a woman   s sleepy contralto said warningly from farther down the bed .  a warm breath tickled his shin .     i   m very  very cross when rudely awakened .         you don   t like it .      ariel wriggled under his attention .     it   s not .  .      she breathed  then sighed .     i   m just tired .         too tired .      she gasped .     oh  you .  .  .     in a flurry of bedcovers  she whirled around .  her mouth touched his .  she rolled him on his back .   much later  they snuggled together .  derec reached out from the cover to touch the contact that caused the wall of the bedroom to become one way transparent .  though in the middle of aurora   s largest city  there was nothing to be seen but green  open expanse .  they looked out over an expanse of a lush rolling meadow  crowned with a stand of magnificent trees .  the orange red sun of aurora slashed through the branches  wedges of light outlined in a miasma of morning fog .   a native whose whole life had been spent on the planet might have shrugged   beautiful auroran sunrises were commonplace enough to have become the norm   but in the year since derec and ariel had been on the planet  they hadn   t yet become blast .  they gazed at the display as if the awakening world had arranged it strictly for their benefit .      it   s very lovely     ariel whispered .      like you .         flatterer .         will it get me anywhere .         we   ll see .  maybe .  a little later  anyway .         there   s no reason to wait .         greedy this morning  aren   t we .  well  you   ll just have to cultivate a little patience .      ariel kissed him again and rolled from the bed .  with a lithe grace  she moved across the room .  she   d recovered entirely from her ordeal in robot city  or at least it seemed that way .  the disease that had warped her personality had been cured  her injuries healed .  she had left robot city and returned to normal .   but not derec .  the chemfets   tiny viral replicas of the robot city material developed by his father  dr .  avery   had been implanted in derec .  though he   d gained control of the chemfets after they    d threatened to take him over  the ordeal had left him permanently linked to the city .  even now he could  ifhe wished  listen to the inner conversations in his body and hear the sounds of the robot city central computer  across light years of distance .  he could give the city orders  direct the actions of its myriad robots  alter its programming .  .  .  .   derec did not enjoy playing god  no matter how minor a one .  he didn   t enjoy being shackled to his father   s mad creation .  he especially didn   t enjoy the fact that he didn   t yet know the full extent of that inner universe .   they were still chained to avery  even now .  their return to aurora and the tale of robot city had made news everywhere on that world .  they were celebrities .  even now  they could not go out in the public areas of the city without someone coming up to them .   the thoughts drove away his good humor .  he looked out at the auroran dawn and suddenly saw nothing .  the dawn might as well have been a computerized image projected on a wall .  he sighed .      i know that look     ariel said from the open door of the personal .     you   re brooding again .         no  i   m not .         you are too .  i   ve been with you too long not to know .  you   re thinking about robot city again .      there was an edge to her voice that made derec grimace .  theirs had been a roller coaster ride of a relationship  they never seemed to be able to settle into any semblance of normalcy .  when things were good  they were very good indeed .  and when they were bad .  .  .   that was avery   s legacy as well   many of the memories derec and ariel shared were not pleasant .  for the months they   d been trapped in robot city  ariel   s personality had been in a steady  disintegrating spiral  fluctuating between vivacious and darkly sullen .   at least she   d escaped .  at least she   d escaped from that planet and been cured .   derec could never leave robot city .  it would always be there within him .  it was his  his responsibility  whether he wanted it or not .      derec  stop it     ariel said warningly .      stop what .         i   m not going to answer something that obvious .  figure it out yourself .      he knew he should have apologized then .  he knew he should have smiled deprecatingly and shrugged  should have risen himself and kissed her until she forgot the argument and the dawn was again something beautiful to see .   but he didn   t .      sorry i   m so stupid     he said bitterly .   ariel   s face was red with irritation  her eyes narrowed and her hands clenched into angry fists .     derec  don   t spoil the morning  please .         i   m not the one who knows what everyone else is thinking .  it seems to me that you claimed that ability .  i thought everything was going fine .         you   re being childish .         and you   re being arrogant .         arrogant .  damn it  derec .  .  . derec .     she stopped .  derec was no longer listening to her .  he was standing in the middle of the room  his gaze inward and blind .   the call had entered derec   s mind with an urgency that was almost painful .  aurora  the dawn outside the window  ariel   s voice  they   d all disappeared in the frantic need of the message .  the chemfets relayed the message to him .   under attack  it said .  the call was faint  as if coming from a great distance  much farther than the robot city he knew .  request immediate help .      what is it  derec .     ariel asked again  a look of concern furrowing her brow .  her anger was lost in her worry for him .  slowly  he came back to an awareness of the room around him .      i   m .  .  . i   m not sure .     he was still holding his head with a look of inward concentration  listening to those whispering pleas only he could hear .     it   s the chemfets again .  i   m .  .  . i   m getting a series of coordinates and a distress signal from a source claiming to be the central computer .  it says it   s robot city  but   mandlebrot .     he called suddenly .   the robot slipped quickly from a niche on one side of the bedroom .  derec had assembled the robot from assorted parts  a hodgepodge of models including a right arm constructed of what he called avery material   infinitely malleable and adjustable .  the patchwork quilt effect lent the robot  to say the least  a unique look  and derec had a vast affection for him .      mandelbrot  you   re also linked to robot city     he said to the robot .     did you just receive a distress call .         no  master derec  i did not .         if i give you a set of coordinates  can you tell me whether they   re anywhere near robot city .         i can link with the auroran net and access records there .         good .     derec rattled off the coordinates he   d heard in his head .  mandelbrot stood silently a moment  then spoke .      those coordinates are for a region well outside human space and distant from robot city  though in the same arm of the galaxy .  if i have not received the message you received  and if those coordinates represent the actual source of the call  then i can see two possibilities  first  that or .  avery himself has established a new robot city somewhere  perhaps by using the keys of perihelion to jump to another world .  or  secondly  that the distress call is from a robot city that is an offshoot of the original .  we know that some of the avery robots were sent out by the central computer to start new sites on other planets .  can you communicate with the computer yourself .      derec concentrated  but the wispy tendrils of the repeating call were gone as if they had never been there .     no     he said .     there   s nothing now .         there   s a third  even more likely  possibility you   ve both missed     ariel said  hands on hips .     it was your imagination .  you   ve done nothing but worry about robot city since we left .          it wasn   t my imagination     derec insisted .     it was real .  i know the difference  ariel .         you said it was faint .         it came through the chemfets .  i can guarantee that .         all right     ariel sighed .     all right .  i   m tired of arguing .  it   s gone now  so let   s forget it .  mandelbrot  you can go back to the niche .      as mandelbrot turned obediently  derec shook his head .     no .  i can   t just forget it  ariel .  it   s not that simple .  you don   t seem to realize that  to a large extent  i am robot city now .  i   m part of it  i   m responsible .      ariel whirled around at that  her face angry .  her finger dug into his chest  prodding .      no .  no  you   re not  derec .  your father   s responsible .  avery .  without his poisoning you with the chemfets  without his interference and his insane schemes  none of this would have happened   to any of us .  you   re not responsible  derec  any more than i am or mandelbrot is or wolruf is .  you can   t blame yourself for any of it  and there   s nothing you can do about it .          there   s trouble     derec insisted .     i can feel it .  i have to go see .  mandelbrot  i want you to see that our ship is provisioned and ready to go by noon .      mandelbrot hesitated  caught for a second between the conflicting orders  but derec was his primary master .  his orders took precedence over ariel   s .  the robot nodded and moved to the computer terminal on the wall .  mandelbrot activated the screen and opened a line to the aurora port computer .   ariel shook her head  dark hair swaying with savage motion .  she jabbed at derec   s chest again with the forefinger .     you   re not doing it  derec .  no .  if this phantom city in your mind has problems  then let it deal with them on its own .  that   s what the central computer is for .  and if it   s avery again  if he   s used his keys to jump from robot city to some other place he   s set up  it   ll be a trap just like the other .  i   m not at all interested in stepping into his deadly little webs again .          i don   t want you to .  i wasn   t intending to have you go along .  i thought just mandelbrot and myself .  .  .      the words didn   t come out quite as he   d intended .  because i don   t want you to get hurt again .  he should have added .  because i care too much about you .  but her face was already clouded  and somehow the words wouldn   t come now .   ariel nodded  muscles bunched as she set her jaw .     fine     she said  her words clipped and short .     just fine .  i   m sorry i   m such a burden .         ariel .  .  .      but she was no longer listening .  she went to her closet  snatched a loose smock from a hook  and tugged it on .  she brushed her fingers through her hair and gave derec one last smouldering gaze .   then she stalked from the house .      mandelbrot     derec said after the reverberations of her exit had stopped echoing through the house .     you should be glad that you don   t have to deal with emotions .         it has been my observation that human feelings are much like fruit .         hmm .  i   m not sure i understand .         if handled roughly  both feelings and fruit are easily bruised .      to that  derec didn   t have a reply .     chapter    the hill of stars    silverside knew the normal pack routine with a kill .   the hunters would first tear open the abdomen and feed themselves on the warm  pulsing blood rich meat .  afterward  their own appetites sated  they would use their crude flint knapped knives and flay the carcass  cutting it into manageable chunks to be put on the carriers .   now the kin circled uneasily around the dead walkingstone .  lifecrier reached out and tapped at the thing   s stomach with a claw .     it   s stone  silverside     the old wolf creature said .     a magical creature from the firstbeast .  there   s nothing for us to eat .  it   s a mockery .      silverside came up to the body  the other kin moving aside for her .     keeneye     she asked     have any of the walkingstones been killed before .      keeneye seemed grateful for the attention  as silverside had expected .     no     she said .     these are the hunters of the walkingstones  there are other kinds near the hill of stars  but they never leave that place .  every time before  we ran from the hunters when we couldn   t hurt them .  they   ve killed three hands of kin and more in the three dances of the moons since they came .  the fire from their fingers kills .      three hands of kin   with the wolf creature   s four fingered hands  that meant that over a dozen kin had fallen to the walkingstones in three months .  silverside had seen perhaps thirty to forty of the wolf creatures at packhome .  twelve members of the tribe was a significant loss .  it was no wonder that lifecrier and the others were looking for divine intervention .   silverside crouched down alongside the waikingstone .  she examined the thing carefully .  her optical circuits noted a seam running along the abdomen .  she slid a claw tip carefully along the edge  narrowing and flattening the claw so that it slipped easily under the lip of metal .   she pried up .  magnetic catches held tenaciously  then finally gave as she increased the tension .  the abdomen covering lifted  revealing an interior of miniature servo motors  linkages  wires  and circuit boards .  the kin around silverside gasped .      there   s no blood     keeneye said in silverside   s ear  marveling .     no muscles  no meat  no stomach .  how does it move .         magic     lifecrier said again .     the eternal ones have set them in motion against silverside and the oldmother .      the answer sounded right to silverside .  she could not refute lifecrier  not with the strange gaps in her knowledge .  lifecrier had told her of the struggles among the gods .  silverside had found nothing to disprove that she had been sent by the oldmother to serve humans .  given that  it was just as likely that the walkingstones may well have been sent by firstbeast or some other rival of the oldmother .   still .  .  .      the hunter is not magic     silverside told them .     the walkingstones are madethings .  they are tools  like our flint knives or the travois .  they are like the dolls the cubs fashion from sticks  only the walkingstones are stuffed with stone chips and vines from the void .  the power in them allows them to walk  and they speak with a voice you can hear only in your head .      look     she said and plunged her forepaw hand into the walkingstone   s entrails .  her claws emerged again fisted around the colorful intestines of the creature  a trailing  knotted coil of wires .  the kin howled at the sight  half in lament  half in wonder .      these are the guts of kin   s worst enemy     silverside said .     the cubs back at packhome could at least eat a sharpfang .  even if sharpfangs kill kin  they can also feed us .  but not these creatures .  this is the inedible meat of the walkingstones .         what are we going to do  silverside .     lifecrier asked  and his question was echoed by the others around them .   silverside thought for a moment .  then she tugged hard at the array of wires .  bright sparks spat angrily  arcing and dying on the ground .  silverside flung the tangle down .      since they will not let us live  we will kill them     she said .     a robotics expert would probably have been simply appalled and frightened and ordered the destruction of the robot .  janet anastasi  silverside   s creator  might have herself been concerned with the robot   s behavior  but she would have also been intensely interested .   silverside   s mindset had nothing of a human being in it at all .  the three laws were there  yes  but they had now been completely reshaped and changed .  as the robots of aurora  solaria  earth  and other human worlds were shaped and designed to mimic human behavior  so silverside had shaped and designed herself to mimic the kin .  indeed  because she had no conception that she was a constructed thing herself  she was kin  and she interpreted the inbuilt three laws of her positronic brain in light of her own    humanity .      the walkingstones threatened the kin .  they killed kin .  and though she could have led the kin away from packhome  that also would have meant the probable loss of life .  the wolf creatures were territorial hunters  and the neighboring pack leaders had already warned them .  silverside   s pack couldn   t move into another pack   s territory without being challenged and having to fight other wolf creatures  nor would another pack have allowed them to hunt in their own territory .   finding another viable home that was not already claimed was at best a dubious hope  and keeneye and lifecrier had already told her that the walkingstones were expanding their holdings   even if silverside   s pack left  another pack would eventually have to confront the walkingstones when they might be even more powerful .   silverside had reluctantly come to the decision to stay and confront the situation directly .   yes  kin might die  but more kin would likely die if they left .   a human robot might have looked for yet another  more peaceful solution .  but silverside was a carnivore  a hunter even though she herself did not eat at all  she took the carnivore   s solution .   having accepted the wolf creatures as human  she accepted their mores .  without further proof  she also accepted their mythology .  the oldmother had sent her .  she was chosen for the task .  the walkingstones might be intelligent  but they were made by another god and therefore were not    human    themselves .  though silverside couldn   t perform outside the three laws  she would do what she had to do within their limits .   as her new mindset perceived them .   what the carnivore could not avoid  it attacked .  dr .  anastasi   s experiment had worked perfectly well .  her robot had become something other .  a very dangerous other .   still  if it weren   t for the fact that silverside had just killed one of the hated creatures  the rest of the kin might not have accepted her statement .  a challenge to her leadership might have been the immediate outcome .   even so  there were questions .        we   ve tried killing the walkingstones before     keeneye said .  she used kinspeech rather than hunttongue  not wanting silverside to think she was offering formal challenge .  silverside listened to the old leader  sitting back on her hind legs and braiding a necklace from the walkingstone   s wires .     they   re not like sharpfangs .  sharpfangs are strong but very stupid .  these hunter walkingstones can kill by pointing their fingers  and our claws and teeth do nothing .      this one died     silverside said .  she placed the necklace around her neck  the other kin howled softly at the sight .      yes  but it   s the first .         it won   t be the last .  i will show you ways to deal with them .  this is our territory  not the walkingstones    .  they are driving away the game we live on and making this a barren place .  once the walkingstones and their hill of stars are gone  the game will return and the kin can live as they please .  we will take our territory back again .         you will show us how to kill them .         i will .      keeneye paused .  she looked from the dead walkingstone to silverside .     then lead us  silverside     keeneye said in a rising shout and let out a glad cry in beasttalk .   silverside took a strand of wires from the gutted hunter .  she quickly plaited another necklace from the colorful wire and knotted the bright coil around keeneye   s neck .  carefully  she then did the same with each of them .     there     she said when it was done .     we wear the signs of our victory .  now  follow me .  we must learn more about our enemy .      silverside dropped to all fours .  with a quick lope  she ran into the forest  moving westward toward the hill of stars .   howling  the rest of the kin ran behind her .     chapter     an unexpected message   an unexpected arrival       katherine ariel burgess  you   re a fool .      the image in the mirror didn   t seem inclined to answer the accusation .  ariel scowled at herself and slapped at the contact .  the mirror dissolved in a shimmering crystalline haze and was replaced by a pastoral sunset scene .  that only made her more angry  reminding her of the acrimonious morning a week ago .   she   d told herself that derec would wait  that he   d still be there when she came back from her long walk .  but he hadn   t waited .   when she   d finally cooled down and called the house in mid afternoon  balzac  the household robot  had informed her that derec and mandelbrot had left for the port several hours before .  ariel had called the port  wondering what she   d say if he was still there  rehearsing the lines in her mind .   i   ve changed my mind  derec .  i want to go with you .   but he   d already gone  and she had no idea where it was he was heading .   ariel didn   t know whether that made her angry or sad or both at the same time .  she simply felt confused .  the intervening days hadn   t made things any better .  sleeping alone each night was too vivid a reminder .   she came out of the personal  wandering aimlessly through rooms that now seemed far too large and empty .  she stared out the windows  fiddled with the reader  flicked on the holovid and as quickly turned if off again .   with a start  she noticed that the computer terminal was blinking .  feeling a sudden surge of hope  she started to press the access key .  stopped .      balzac .     she called .   the robot trundled from its wall niche in the next room .     mistress .     it said in a flat  mechanical voice .  balzac was a utility model  unsophisticated and plain .      the message on the terminal .  why didn   t you answer the call .         i monitored the message  but it was for derec and did not demand a reply .         who was it from .             who    is imprecise in this case .  the message was a faint relay from a central computer system .      ariel   s lips pressed together .  she inhaled slowly  thinking .     thank you  balzac .  that   s all i require .      the robot nodded and left the room .  ariel waited until it was gone and the house was silent again  then spoke her codeword to the terminal     euler      the name of one of the supervisor robots on robot city .  nothing happened .  she wrinkled her nose .   she knew derec   s code word as well  he   d made no attempt to keep it a secret from her .     aranimas     she said .   a foil screen scrolled open  glowing letters flickered across it as ariel leaned closer .  the message was short and succinct   city under attack by non humans .  imperative we receive outside aid .   the message was followed by a sequence of coordinate numbers for the location .  ariel smiled .     okay  derec     she said to the screen .     if the mountain has run away from mohammed  mohammed will chase it .  won   t you be surprised when i show up .      she turned away from the computer  suddenly excited .  this would serve him right .     balzac .     she called .     i need you to make some arrangements .           mandelbrot  the robot city has to be somewhere on that large continent there   see where the two rivers meet in the forested area .  the computer says that   s where the last message was    waved from .      mandelbrot  at the controls of their craft  punched in coordinates .     have you been able to get the city   s central computer to respond .         no     derec admitted glumly .     either i   m not doing something right or the chemfets only give me access to the original robot city   s computer .  before  all i had to do was think a message and it went through .  this central won   t talk to me or the original robot city   s computer .  it   s just beaming out the distress call at regular intervals .         then it must be expecting someone to answer  otherwise  why signal at all .         i don   t know  i don   t know .  i haven   t figured it out yet .  i   m just as puzzled as you are .      derec watched the long curve of the world flatten as they approached .  it was a pretty world  he decided .  he might have chosen it himself .  it seemed a calm and gentle place  much like aurora  though he could see the spiraling arms of a storm just touching the eastern shores of the continent below  and he knew that underneath the pastel blue white would be dark  streaking clouds and raging winds .   untamed  this world was .  which was very unlike aurora .   and very much like ariel .   the thought crossed his mind  unbidden .  she   d not sent any messages to him after she   d stormed out of the house  in fact  she   d disappeared entirely .  he   d made calls to a few places trying to find her before they   d left  but to no avail .  she seemed to have dropped from sight .  it had been very hard to leave without saying goodbye .  and because he knew that was exactly the effect she   d been after  he   d gone .   he   d begun to wonder if she   d be there when he came back .  there was a sullen ache in him at the image of an empty house .  it was going to hurt .  it was going to hurt more than he wanted to think about .   to take his mind off ariel  he reached in front of mandelbrot and toggled a switch to bring the world into closer focus .  unbroken treetops swayed in a light wind .      i don   t see any evidence of a city     he said .     if we weren   t looking specifically for it because of the signal  i   d swear this place was barren of any technology .  it has to be there  though .  if so  it sure hasn   t spread out as much as the original .  have you seen any evidence of other life  mandelbrot .         no  derec .  the nightside umbra shows no obvious large habitations  which would be lighted  i would think   though we haven   t seen this continent at night yet .  the atmospheric sampling does indicate a small amount of industrial waste  which is very likely the result of your city .  you remember the effect the other one had on its environment .       derec did .  the massive  out of control building spree of the first robot city had resulted in immense ecological side effects .  the horrendous deluges that daily inundated the city had nearly killed both him and ariel until he    d reprogrammed the central computer .     yes  i remember     he said .     i hope this one keeps a better handle on things .  take us down .  let   s see what   s going on .         derec  i advise against landing in the city itself .  assuming we can even find it .         why not  mandelbrot .      the robot   s eyes gleamed as it turned to him .     we do not know what kind of attack this city is facing     he said .     i have checked for other ships in orbit and found nothing  but i am still concerned that a city under attack will have defenses against ships .  you cannot communicate with the central computer .  given that  i would be afraid that it might deem an unidentified ship an enemy and take measures to protect itself .      derec grimaced .      if you order me to do so     mandelbrot continued     i will trust your better judgment and follow your orders .      derec shook his head .     uh uh .  and you   ll say    i told you so    afterward .         no .     the flat delivery almost sounded hurt .      okay     derec said  grinning .     i think you   re right .  let   s land elsewhere .  how much of a hike were you planning on giving us .         i have estimated that fifty kilometers is the minimum .         fine .  a few days    stroll through the forest        at that moment  the craft shook like a mad thing .  as the hull shuddered  derec felt mandelbrot   s firm grip on his arm  guiding him to his seat and forcing him down .  the crash webbing slid over him as the craft tumbled  mandelbrot staggered back to his seat and fought the controls .      what happened .     derec shouted .      i do not know .  our orbit is decaying rapidly .  .  .  .     the robot had no time to say more as the ship   s view of the world below spun and whirled .  mandelbrot   s robotic reflexes were far faster than derec   s  but the power to their main engines was simply gone .   using the attitude jets  mandelbrot managed to reduce the wild tumbling momentarily  but then the first tendrils of the atmosphere touched them and the hull struts moaned in agony .  the ship began to do gymnastics again  and this time snared in the planet   s gravity well   they were flung violently with it .   derec   s head slammed up against his seat despite the webbing  making him shout in pain .  mandelbrot had cut all the automatics  giving him full control of the ship  but it was of little help .  in the viewscreen  they saw the hull turning cherry red  the heat was suffocating in the cabin  the ventilation system gone .   white cloudtops seemed to race toward them  then they plunged into the columns of gray murk .  storm winds tossed them  rain sheeted across the screen .      mandelbrot .     derec   s scream shivered with the vibrations of the ship .   there was no answer .   they plunged out of the bottom of the storm  the murky landscape below wheeling like a mad carousel .  the ground  a fist waiting to crumple them like paper  rushed at them .           page           then  like the gut wrenching end of a roller coaster   s freefall  derec was shoved down in his seat as the craft pulled up in a quick loop .   for a moment  derec thought mandelbrot had saved them .   it was still too late .   the trailing bulk of the engines caught the lip of a rocky outcropping .  the granite blade of the hill ripped into the supports .  metal and stone screeched  derec heard the concussion as the engine exploded .  snared  the ship itself was hammered to the ground .  the inferno of the engine was sheared completely off and went spiraling away .   at least i won   t burn to death .   as a last thought  it seemed a strange comfort .     chapter     strategy and tactics    silverside brought the pack to a ragged halt at a ridge looking down into the shallow bowl of a valley perhaps a kilometer across at its widest point .  she sat in the shadows of the last few trees  lifecrier and keeneye came forward and sat on their haunches to either side of the new leader .  smallface was high in the sky  largeface had yet to rise .  the stars   the voideyes  as lifecrier called them   stared down at the city and marveled .   silverside felt some of that awe herself .  the hill of stars  set like a glistening diamond in the center of the valley and rising well above the level of the surrounding hills  was a fantastic pattern of glowing lights .  the slender pyramidal structure mocked the glory of the night sky .   nor was the hill of stars all .  other buildings spread out around it in geometric splendor  a procession of hard  crystalline shapes filling the valley and spilling out its open end  all linked by ribbons of walkways .   and everywhere  everywhere .  there were walkingstones  all different sizes  all different builds  all different colors .  they bustled along the walkways  gazed from the windows of the buildings  slid busily between the flanks of the city .  there were thousands of them .   they moved in an eerie  almost mystical silence   at least to the kin .  but silverside could hear the deafening roar of the city   s voices inside her head .  an eternal chatter of orders and instructions came from the central computer  reports were constantly being funneled back to that source .  and she understood the words  for they spoke as the hunter spoke  in that language silverside guessed must be that of the void where the gods lived .  it was more proof that the oldmother was being opposed .      they began with just the hill of stars     keeneye whispered to silverside .  she panted at the remembrance  and her long  furless tail lashed from side to side .     they   ve worked like the krajal since then .      silverside had seen the industrious insects called the krajal toiling ceaselessly through the undergrowth of the forest  building their mud colonies on the sides of trees .  keeneye pointed a long finger at the periphery of the city  her lips drawn back from canines in a snarl .      see how they tear down the trees and destroy the land .     she rasped .     all this valley was forest before the walkingstones came .  they destroy everything to put up their stone caves .  and the light   it   s as if the sun were resting down there for the night .  the walkingstones don   t care about kin or any of the living creatures .  they don   t care that our prey animals have fled .  they don   t care that their stone caves stretch out and out and out .  long before they reach packhome  we will have left .  we will have starved  or we will have been killed .         do these other walkingstones hurt the kin like the one we killed .     silverside asked .     there must be different species of walkingstones down there .         we don   t know     keeneye answered .     the others have never bothered us .  they stay within the stones .  only the hunters ever come outside .         that also makes them like the krajal     lifecrier added .     only the blue krajali get food  only the yellow speckled krajali build the tree homes  only the red krajali defend the homes against the longtongues .  they each have a separate task to do  and they each are shaped a little differently .  maybe it   s the same with these walkingstones .      silverside   s optics focused more closely on the hive of activity .  what lifecrier had said sounded like an accurate enough metaphor .  the view of the city bore that out .  certainly the walkingstones seemed specialized in appearance .  and though the walkingstones were obviously constructed things  their hard  unyielding bodies were like the chitinous shells of insects .   maybe the enemy of the oldmother had fashioned the walkingstones after insects .  they had the same outward silence  and their chattering inside her head to the unseen central seemed like the clickings of insects .  like the insect  they labored with seemingly untiring energy  like the krajal they built their own colony home rather than take refuge in what nature afforded .  and this central  perhaps that was the queen  directing all activities of the hive .   the intricacy and sophistication of the city echoed in silverside .  it awoke memories of her initial urges  find sentient life .  find humans .  she   d made the decision on what was human  but the intelligence behind the walkingstones .  .  .    .  .  . but that was the province of the gods  or so lifecrier   s tales had indicated .  a god had sent the walkingstones as a god had sent silverside herself .  it felt right to admire the genius that had created the walkingstones  a resonance of the third law commands that had shaped her first hours .  but admiration didn   t mean that the walkingstones weren   t enemies .  silverside had made her choice  the oldmother had sent her to the kin .   but still .  .  . the kin were human  yes  but silverside yearned for something more .      sometimes the krajal infest a place  too     lifecrier was saying .     the queen breeds and breeds until the trees drip with the shiny bodies .  they drop on the prey animals and bite  driving them mad until they flee .  they can kill a youngling   a slow and horrible death .      lifecrier closed his eyes  as if remembering .     the last time that happened  two lifecriers ago  halftongue was the leader .  during a storm  lightning struck a tree .  halftongue noticed that the flames killed the krajal and that they fled .  she took a branch from the tree and set a blue krajali on fire .  the nearby reds came to defend it  leaving an opening .  so halftongue and the others took several burning brands and began using them to drive the krajal away until they could reach the queen and kill it .  once the queen was dead  the krajal behaved like crazy things and were easy to kill .         walkingstones won   t burn .  you can   t burn a rock .     keeneye   s comment was laced with her old scorn .  if she was resigned to a secondary place in the pack behind silverside  she was also not going to submit to any of the other kin .     the walkingstones would laugh at a burning stick .      silverside nodded in agreement  scenting keeneye   s irritation with lifecrier   s tales .     still  there is a hint in lifecrier   s story .  i must find out more about these walkingstones .  keeneye  you will lead the pack in my absence .  i will go down into the city .  i need to discover if these other types of walkingstones are more vulnerable than the hunters .  if what i suspect is true  then the hunters will come after i attack .  you must watch   see what they do  see how many they send and how quickly .  then go back to packhome quickly .  i will return by another route after i have made certain that no hunters follow me .         if you   re not killed right away     keeneye said .  her pale eyes were noncommital and silverside could not tell if the prospect pleased or disturbed her .     if you   re right about these other walkingstones .         if anything happens to me  you become leader again     silverside answered .  yes  she scented satisfaction in keeneye with that  and she continued .     but it won   t .  i don   t intend to fight the hunters .  i only need to see how they react so we can plan .  you can   t hear them  but i can .  the walkingstones speak  they communicate as do the kin .  i can use their language against them .  i might be able to deceive them .         graymane knew the language of the oldmother     lifecrier said .     you see  keeneye  it is as i said .       keeneye grimaced  but she said nothing .      watch me for the time it would take to skin a deer     silverside told the group .     remember what you see  every detail .  it is very important .  then leave .  go directly back to packhome .     silverside used hunttongue to accentuate the command .   keeneye grimaced again  but she nodded .     as you wish .      silverside gave a soft bark of satisfaction .  she looked at the pack  who watched the trio expectantly .  the sight of the kin nudged a first law circuit .     keep them safe  keeneye     silverside said .     take them back as swiftly as they can go   the hunters may come after you if i can   t lead them away .          i will do as silverside wishes     keeneye answered in proud hunttongue .     she does not have to worry .      there was nothing more to say .  silverside glanced around the edge of the forest  making sure that no hunters were lurking nearby .  swiftly  she dropped onto four legs and moved out into the wash of moonlight .  she was a swift  glinting presence sliding into the shadows of the nearest buildings .  silverside moved in among them several strides  then hunched down  belly to cool stone behind one of the structures .   she listened .  the walkingstones chattered to central endlessly .  reports went in  orders went out .  the walkingstones were concentrated more toward the hill of stars where silverside suspected central hid  but they occasionally moved through this area .  she waited  patient .   when she heard the sound of a walkingstone   s tread  she allowed her body to deform slightly  extending an eyestalk around the comer of the building .  the approaching walkingstone was a spindly  gangly thing with arms tipped by mechanical claws rather than fingered hands .  it was alone .  silverside retracted the eyestalk  gathered herself  when the walkingstone passed the side of the building  she leaped with a beasttalk growl .   the walkingstone   s arms came up too late   silverside hit it  her jaws clamping around the thin  long neck and her powerful muscles shaking the thing from side to side .  she was careful to hold her own great strength back and use no more power than any of the kin possessed .   that strength was enough  as she had suspected .  these walkingstones were far less durable than the hunters .  a support cracked  internal wiring harnesses tore .  just before the main trunk to the brain was severed and the walkingstone went still under silverside   s great bulk  she heard it call out to the distant central .   under attack .  damaged .  .  .   silverside let the thing slump to the ground .  yes  as i thought .  the hunters were designed to be the city   s protection  the workers were strong but not overwhelming for a creature as powerful as the wolf creatures .  the worker walkingstones  at least  were vulnerable .   and this also revealed another weakness .  not much of one  but it was all silverside had .   the voices in her head had gone silent .  replacing the chatter was an amplified voice  loud and commanding  resonating on all the frequencies .  central .  my enemy .   and it did what she would have done herself .  central was sending the hunters to investigate .   silverside didn   t intend to be there when the hunters arrived .   giving a beasttalk growl of triumph  she ran back toward the forest  staying where the kin could see her but not heading directly toward them .  keeneye would watch and make certain  then run to packhome as ordered .  silverside would make her way there herself  but first she had to make sure there was no latent danger to the kin .   it didn   t matter if such a delay endangered her own self .   she waited until she caught a glimpse of the first hunter moving swiftly along a walkway toward the area where the attack had occurred .  i am here .  she called to it in her own head voice  using the voidtalk .  the hunter stopped  its armored head swiveling around .   silverside gave voice to a beasttalk challenge and ran .   she was just about to duck under the cover of the trees when the laser hit her .     chapter     a journey begins    if this was the afterlife  it was damned uncomfortable .   for one thing  it was wet .  he could feel water dripping on his face and body .   for another  being dead hurt .   derec   s ribs ached as if they   d been kicked repeatedly by an extraordinarily strong and stubborn mule .  most of his skin felt as if it had been scoured by a rough  rusty file  and what hadn   t been scraped raw was parboiled .  his head pounded with the great granddaddy of all headaches  and he was afraid to open his eyes or try to sit up .   if this was eternity  it wasn   t making a nice start .   but he couldn   t lie there forever .  besides  there was a certain curiosity .  .  .  .   there was definitely light beyond his eyelids .  and beyond the dripping of water  he could hear a rushing  crackling noise like cellophane being crumpled .   derec opened his eyes .   and  groaning  closed them again .   he was looking through a jagged hole in the ship   s hull into a dull gray  rain streaming sky .  through the curtain of rain  he could see a muddy hillside scored by some giant  maniac plow and sown with bright pieces of metal .  despite the storm  there was a fire smoldering in the grass a hundred meters away where one of the ship   s drive engines lay half buried .  a thick  greasy plume of black smoke was smeared across the sky under the racing clouds .   it didn   t look good .  being alive was threatening to be more uncomfortable than being dead .     mandelbrot .     derec   s voice was a hoarse croak .  there was no answer .      mandelbrot .      still nothing .  it looked as if he was going to have to get out by himself .  he didn   t like the idea  not one bit .  derec moved to unbuckle his crash webbing .  it was a mistake .   he screamed and promptly blacked out again .     it had stopped raining and the grass fire was out when he came back to consciousness again .      reality  part two     he muttered to himself .  there was still a throbbing ache in his left arm  his right seemed to be functioning  if badly bruised .  he forced himself to look   yes  the left forearm was definitely fractured  the skin puffy and discolored  the arm canted at a slight and very wrong angle .  the sight made him nauseous .  great .  all you need is to be sick all over yourself .  what if you   ve got broken ribs or internal injuries .  .  .  .   derec leaned his head back and took several deep breaths until his stomach settled again .  reaching over with his good hand  he tightened the left harness of the webbing until his shoulder was tight against the seat .  then he grasped his left arm at the wrist  took a deep breath  and held it .   and let it out again with a shout .  he pulled  hard .   bone grated against bone .     when derec came to consciousness for the third time  he checked the arm .  it was bruising nicely  but it looked straight now .  he could wiggle his fingers  make a weak fist .  the pain made him want to whimper  but there was nothing he could do about it for the moment .      okay     he breathed .     you got to get out  find the first aid kit  get the painkillers and the quick knit pills     he told himself .     you can do it .     using his right hand  he unbuckled himself   squirming for the right hand buckle at his shoulder  the pain stabbed at his chest  broken ribs  too  if nothing worse .  he was starting to sweat  coldly  and the periphery of his vision was getting dark .   shock .  take it easy .  just breathe for a few seconds .   gingerly  derec tried his legs .  his left ankle had been wrenched badly  but he thought he might be able to put weight on it  and his right thigh was bloody under the torn pants  but everything worked .   fine .  let   s see if we can stand .   he pushed himself up with his one good arm  cradling the other .  the movement coupled with the throbbing head made the ship swirl about him .  for a moment  the world threatened to go away again .  derec fought to remain conscious .  no  he pleaded .  the last thing you want to do is fall .  you might not make it up again .   after a minute  the landscape stopped its ponderous waltz around him  and he could stand .  the cabin was a total loss .  the flooring was buckled  gaping holes had been torn in the bulkheads  and everything was sitting at a slight downhill angle .  derec noticed mandelbrot immediately .  the pilot   s seat had been sheared off during impact and lay on its side at the    bottom    of the cabin slope .  mandelbrot was still in the seat  his body dented  dinged  and scratched .      mandelbrot .     derec called again  but there was still no answer .  first things first  he told himself .  where   s that kit .   it should have been on the near wall  it wasn   t .  after a stumbling search through the nearby rubble  derec finally located the white and red box .  he fumbled open the catch and tore open a vial of endpain .  he stabbed the injector into his thigh with a hiss of the air jet  the medication felt cool  and he could feel it spreading .  the pain began to fade  the headache to ease .  after a few minutes  he was feeling vaguely human again .   he found the quick knit tabs  read the instructions  and swallowed two .  with the pain temporarily subdued  he rigged a splint from a piece of plastic and the cloth covering of one of the seats .  the arm felt better secured and placed in a sling .  he knotted it with his teeth .   derec was beginning to feel alive once more .  alive enough to know that he was still in deep trouble on a world he didn   t know and maybe half a continent or more away from the robot city and help .  he could still hear the central computer via his chemfet link  but the damned thing still didn   t respond to him as had the original   it would have been easy to order a squad of robots to find and rescue them .   and if pigs had wings .  .  .   derec had to have mandelbrot .  without the robot  this was going to be very  very touchy .  the quick knit tabs would heal his arm in a week or two   if he didn   t refracture it rummaging through the wreckage  if there were no internal injuries that crippled him first  if there was nothing on this planet that decided he looked tasty .  .  .   if he was still alive in a week .   derec made his slow way over the broken hull to the robot .  the seat had pinned mandelbrot to the wall .  derec braced his back against the cabin wall opposite the robot  planted his feet on the seat supports  and shoved  the seat groaned  moved  and dropped back again .  derec gritted his teeth  pushed once more .  this time the seat tumbled over  mandelbrot dangling loosely from the straps .  derec waited until his breath returned and then opened up the robot   s chest cavity .   there were too many things that could have gone wrong with the robot that couldn   t possibly be fixed here .  derec could imagine every last one of them in his mind .   it didn   t look as bad as it might have .  the trunk line from the main power source had pulled loose  though backup power to the brain was still intact  good  that meant there would be no memory loss .  there was some structural damage  though mandelbrot   s avery type arm looked perfectly fine .  the optical circuits had taken quite a jarring  derec wouldn   t be surprised if there were some problems there when he powered up the robot .   and it was going to be no fun working with one hand .     only one way to find out .  .  .     he muttered  then shook his head .  who in space are you talking to .   it took an hour to find the toolbox  another to one handedly splice the bad power cable and jury rig the socket   he had to stop halfway through to hit the painkillers again  the headache was back and his ribs made every breath an agony .  the soldering tip trembled in his hand as he made the last connections .  he wiped sweat from his eyes and straightened .  he closed the chest compartment and touched the power contact .   a status light blinked amber .  one eye gleamed fitfully  the entire body shuddered .  the head swiveled with a distressing squeal of grinding metal  and mandelbrot looked in derec   s general direction .      master derec .         mandelbrot .         you are very fuzzy in my optical circuits .  it would appear that the landing was not all we had hoped for .         it would appear so .     derec shrugged .     how are you .         checking .  .  .     mandelbrot   s voice trailed off  the eye dimmed .  after several seconds it brightened once more .     systems check program running .  main positronic circuitry intact  two sectors damaged but recovered and backed up .  right optical circuits not functioning  left out of adjustment .  neck sleeve joint misaligned .  main trunk connections damaged but acceptable .  main and auxiliary power circuits acceptable .  three servo motors have cracked casings and will be a problem if the lubricant seals are breached and leaking .  knee servo in left leg burned out and knee locked .     the robot   s fingers clenched and opened .     other minor damage .  would you prefer the full details .         save it for later .         then i must ask how you are  master derec .     mandelbrot rose to his feet  the left leg extended stiffly .     i note that your arm is splinted and there is blood on your clothing .  you grimace when you move  as if your chest hurts you .         the arm   s broken  it   ll heal .  i   m banged up but alive .  i don   t think it   s anything serious .  considering the way we hit  we don   t have anything to complain about .         i was not complaining  master derec  simply trying to ascertain our status .  your health is of prime importance to me as you know .  the first law .  .  .      derec waved him silent .     we   ve done all we can do about that .  now we have to get ourselves out of here .      gears whined drily as mandelbrot surveyed the wreckage .     this was not a good landing     he said without inflection .   derec laughed aloud despite the pain .  after robot city  he didn   t know what to expect from robots  mandelbrot had either acquired a certain irony and deadpan humor or come up with a good approximation of it .  a first law response to make him feel more comfortable or not  it worked .  derec grinned .      actually  it was probably your best .     he said .     i   m surprised you got us down at all .  what in the world happened .         i still am not sure  master derec .  there was an alarm and then the impact .  after that  i was too concerned with the ship to pursue the matter .         i can believe it     derec smiled .     now let   s see what we can salvage out of this mess .      it was a long  slow  and painful process .  most of the emergency food stores had been smashed or lost .  mandelbrot dredged up an inflatable survival tent and heater  rope  and a battery powered lamp .  on the down side  the communications gear was hopelessly ruined  as derec found after an hour of trying to fit together pieces with the few spare parts on board .   the ship was a total loss .  it would never see space again .   the salvaging efforts made a pitifully small pile outside the hull .  at derec   s insistence  mandelbrot split the burden in half  a pack for each of them .     you   re hobbled  too     derec pointed out in the face of mandelbrot   s insistence that the robot carry everything .     you   d be endangering me more by loading yourself up .  i   ve got a bad arm  you   ve a bum leg and servos threatening to go at any time .  you   re half blind .  consider this a direct order and pick up your half .      mandelbrot obeyed .     good     derec said .     now   just where in the world are we going .         the robot city was inland  master derec .  i believe we are near the eastern coast .  since the sun is declining toward the hills  i would suggest that direction .      derec gazed at the slopes to the west  green with a thick cover of trees .  there   d be game under there  and plants to eat if the rations gave out .  he sighed .  there was little choice .  they wouldn   t make it off this planet until they had help  and the only help was robot city .  if the central computer wouldn   t respond to his chemfet link  the robots would still give them any aid they requested  if only because the first law required it .   we must look a sight .  derec thought as they walked away from the wreckage .  a lame robot and a beat up man .  at least the planet looks safe .     chapter     a chase through the forest    the laser from the hunter seared silverside   s flank .  she hadn   t expected it to react so quickly .   with robotic speed  she leapt to one side and behind the cover of a thick tree trunk .  the bark smoldered where her side pressed against it  and silverside modified her body to spread out thin fan like structures to radiate away the excess heat .  a spot of red gleamed on the tree by her head and silverside ducked once more   another hunter  and this one coming from a different direction .  she could see two more of the deadly walkingstones hurrying along the walkways toward the edge of the city and the confrontation .   silverside howled and fled deeper into the woods .  along the ridge  she saw the rest of the pack  following her orders  turn back and flee toward packhome .  now it was up to her   she had to get rid of the walkingstones .   ten minutes later  she was certain she   d lost them .   silverside had a decided advantage over the walkingstones in the forest .  her wolf shape was ideally suited for quick movement and lithe  accurate turns .  low to the ground  she could take advantage of brush and thickets for cover  knowing the forest as only a wolf creature could  she was at ease finding the convoluted paths of the game animals .  the walkingstones seemed far less capable once they left the arrow straight walkways and geometric patterns of their city .   silverside came to a halt in a glade a kilometer and a half from the valley of the walkingstones .  she halted  listening  scenting  and watching .  large moths flitted silently from tree to tree .  a creature with huge suckers for feet hung upside down from a nearby branch .  largeface spread silver lace patterns on the ground through the branches .   a branch cracked  a silver shape moved in the dark .   central  the creature is here .  the voice came from inside her head .  ten degrees south  unit three .  you should have a clear line of fire if you move forward .   the darkness seemed to bother the walkingstones as little as it did silverside  and it seemed that she had underestimated them .  they were persistent and excellent trackers or they could not have followed her .  they might be slower when moving in the trees  yes  but they seemed to be untiring .   and they had found her again .   her logic circuits couldn   t know disappointment or irritation or even fear  but the sight of the hunters through the trees made her pause  made her growl softly in beasttalk .  they were not kin .  these walkingstones lacked all etiquette .   if they were human  she thought  it would be easy .  i could challenge their leader  and whomever won would lead all .  that is the best way .   but the walkingstone   s leader was central  which was only a voice in her head  and the walkingstones attacked kin like the sharpfangs  from hiding and without a proper challenge .   like beasts .  like animals .       the hunters were speaking with one another now  short bursts of high pitched sound .  silverside fingered the strands of semiconductors and colored wire around her neck .  they were just made things .  tools .  they were less than animals  for all their sophistication .  yes  the technology made silverside ache to know more  but they violated all her most primal urges .   she wanted desperately to break these tools .   a crisscrossing of sudden laser fire raked the underbrush .  silverside pushed to her feet with a howl and ran again .  she felt the awful heat of their weapons strike her  and she turned and twisted as she fled so that none of the beams could touch her for more than a few seconds .  even so  she could sense internal damage  automatic alarm circuits overloaded and caused emergency sub routines to be run  rerouting her nerve signals along undamaged paths to the brain .   again her wolf shape aided her as it had before  she outdistanced the hunters quickly .  but she could still hear them  could still smell that sharp tang of steel and lubricants .  they would track her forever  she realized  and if they did that  they would find packhome .   you cannot allow that to happen .  the first law was plain here .   a new positronic pathway opened  glimmering .  another robot might have kept running until it ran out of power or was caught .  another robot might have been trapped by inbuilt programming .   the hunters were tracking a wolf  and though she had chosen that shape  it was not the only one she could be .   silverside   s body began to alter .  the great bulk of the wolf collapsed in on itself  the body becoming much smaller .  the excess mass silverside squeezed outward  thinning it until the alloy was as thin as she could make it .   great  powerful wings overshadowed her now .  the wings beat  cupping air .   silverside flew .   she was a lousy bird .  she was too massive  and there was nothing she could do to alter that .  she didn   t fly well  and she couldn   t fly fast or high  but she flew .   her moonshadow passed over the hunters moving through the woods below .   the walkingstones didn   t even look up .  a wolf that changed into a bird was not in their experience .        you   re certain you left them behind .      the sun was just peeking over the edge of the hills  and most of the kin had come out to greet silverside as  in wolf form again  she loped from the forest .  keeneye prowled the packed ground outside the entrance to packhome .  she kept looking back into the fog drifting through the shafts of light under the trees .      i am mostly certain     silverside replied .  one of the pups came up to her and playfully nipped her back leg .  she gently nudged the pup aside  and it ran back to its mother  yelping .     i was heading south away from the hill of stars  not toward here at all .         they will follow your tracks and your scent .     keeneye would not let go of the argument  but at least it was in respectful kinspeech and not hunttongue  where silverside might have been compelled to challenge her .      i became a bird .  i left no tracks  and the wind took my scent .         you became a bird .  .  .  .     keeneye   s stance stiffened  she crouched slightly  offensively .  that said more than her words .      you doubt silverside  keeneye .     lifecrier asked mockingly .     you saw the egg .  you   ve seen her kill a hunter  which none of us could do .  you saw her kill another of the walkingstones and escape the hunters    lightnings .  we all know she   s from the oldmother  and yet you scoff .    believe her  keeneye  because i have listened to the tales of the oldmother .  i have faith .  what of the rest of you .      the kin gave barks of agreement  and silverside could scent their pride in her .  keeneye   s lips lifted  exposing teeth .      it doesn   t matter     she said disdainfully .     bird or not  we   ve still done nothing about the walkingstones .  all we   ve accomplished is to anger them  and if they come here  to packhome  we will all die .  silverside might be able to kill one  but what of the rest of us .      keeneye   s tail thrashed dirt .  she fingered the necklace silverside had given her .     how many here have seen the bodies of kin slain by the hunters .     she continued .     how many of you have pups who are thin because the meat is scarce .  how many mothers have little milk to give the litters .  we can   t stand against the walkingstones .  and that is true with or without silverside  with or without the oldmother .         then we can go elsewhere     silverside suggested .     give the walkingstones this place and find another .          where .  we   ve already discussed that .  the other packs already watch their borders  knowing the trouble we   re having .  no other pack will let us into their territory .         then you are telling me that we must stay here     silverside said .     this is something i need to know   keeneye  lifecrier  all the rest of you .  i do not know this world as you do .  the oldmother left you the task of teaching me about the kin .  must we stay here .      they nodded  howling softly .     in that  i   m afraid i must agree with keeneye     lifecrier said .     our pack is already weak and small .  in a fight with other pack kin  we would all die .      that answer gave the logic circuits in silverside   s brain the information they needed .  electrical synapses closed .  it was simple .   the first law demanded that human life must be protected .  her positronic brain  like every robot   s  logically resolved inevitable conflicts to protect the many over the few .  if the kin stayed here  the conflict would be human against walkingstone .  if they moved  another  uglier conflict must be confronted  and that would pit human against human .  silverside could not kill humans .   that realization allowed her to make an unpleasant decision .     then we will stay here     she said     and my choice is made for me .         what choice .     keeneye demanded .      the choice to fight the walkingstones .         we can   t fight them     keeneye insisted .      i know a way     silverside said .     i do not like it  but i know a way .         then speak .  tell us     keeneye said  and the insolence was back in her voice  in her stance  in her smell .  silverside stared at keeneye  daring the former leader to challenge her again .  silverside let her body enlarge slightly  her already massive chest puffing out .  keeneye growled and backed away .      kin will probably die  my way     silverside said  still looking at keeneye .     but you tell me there is no other choice that is not worse .  if you tell me wrong  you may well destroy the pack .  if there is any way for us to go elsewhere  tell me now .         there is no way     keeneye said  snorting .  she pawed at the ground with a clawed hand .     there are other packs all around us  one eye   s  scarredpaw   s .  they   ve already said they will kill any of our litter kin who trespass .  ask lifecrier   he can tell you of the battles between packs .  i didn   t lie .  and i   m not afraid to fight .  kin die all the time   it is part of the hunt  it is part of defending territory .         then it is time to hunt walkingstones     silverside answered .      it is time to challenge them .        chapter     around the campfire    it was difficult to hear anything above the racket derec and mandelbrot made moving through the woods .  derec quickly realized that there was no hope he   d be able to survive by hunting for food .  he   d starve first .   they   d seen very little wildlife except during their rest periods .  otherwise  whatever animals lived here simply fled from the clamor of their passage .  shapes skittered through the trees ahead of them  birds took to the air with shrill cries .  but a new sound intruded  making derec cock his head quizzically .      did you hear that  mandelbrot .      derec had stopped  leaning on the walking stick he   d cut from a dead branch and breathing heavily .  they were struggling up a slope tangled with dense  close underbrush and tenacious  sticky leaved vines  the place seemed to have been designed to give them trouble .  the sun was already behind the hill and dropping rapidly  and derec   s legs itched wherever the plants had scraped skin through his clothing .  mandelbrot  ahead of him and sounding in dire need of an overhaul  was moving very slowly with his malfunctioning leg .  the robot stopped and turned his head around  the neck grating metallically .        i have heard several things  master derec .  which sound were you referring to .         the howling .  there   you hear that .      very faintly  a mournful wail greeted the dusk .  another voice joined the first  then several others .  the mournful chorus continued for several seconds  then went back to the solo voice once more .  the forest seemed suddenly very dim and dangerous .  derec shivered involuntarily .      that sends cold chills down my back     he said .      there are thermal blankets in the pack     mandelbrot told derec .     let me get one for you        derec smiled .     it   s not that kind of chill .  it sounds like recordings i   ve heard of wolves   made before they became extinct .      the barking howls began again  echoing and reverberating among the slopes .  mandelbrot   s neck joint screeched again as the robot looked up slope .     their voices are complex     he said .     in some ways it reminds me of wolruf   s language .       mention of the caninoid alien   s name made derec nod  he missed wolruf  missed her quick wit and odd temper .     i wish it were  believe me .  at least then we might get out of this mess .  we have to find a place to camp for the night  mandelbrot .  any level and halfway open space will do .  i don   t want to get caught out here in the open during the dark .         my data banks say that even in the days before earth was settled  most wild animals were afraid of humans .  they very rarely attacked anyone without provocation .         well  i   m not going to count on them having been fed the same data .  let   s keep going  mandelbrot .  maybe at the top of this hill .  .  . though from the size of it i   m beginning to think we should promote it to mountain .      it took them another hour to struggle to the summit .  there  the trees thinned out and finally disappeared on a wind swept  rocky ledge that  looming above the surrounding hills  gave them an excellent vantage point .   every last muscle in derec   s body ached from the exertion of the climb .  his broken arm throbbed and burned  he was breathing in quick gasps  afraid to breathe any deeper because of his ribs .  derec swung his pack down with a grimace and found the medical supplies .  an endpain injection allowed him to keep moving .  mandelbrot  every joint rasping  helped derec inflate the tent and arrange their pitifully few supplies .  derec started a small fire in a circle of rocks  and they sat on the hilltop watching the stars appear in the dark blue of the zenith  sprinkled across the sky in their millions .      they certainly are persistent  those wolves or whatever they are .     the howls had continued to serenade them as they   d made camp .  they seemed to be coming from the west  in the same general direction they were heading though several hills over .  derec sat on the edge of the ledge and tossed pebbles into the trees below  listening to them crash through the branches .  he looked at the shadowy landscape ahead of them and grimaced .     look at that .  you   d figure the hills would all have to run north and south   we   re going to walk five kilometers up and down for every one due west .      derec glanced over at the robot standing alongside him .  it didn   t seem to have heard .     mandelbrot .         i am sorry  master derec .  i was listening to them .         just make sure they don   t get closer .     derec threw another stone  then squinted toward the west .     how well are you seeing  mandelbrot .         my night vision is very poor due to the crash damage .  it is no better than yours .         uh huh .  take a look anyway and tell me if that isn   t a glow in the northwest  maybe four or five of those hills over .  i didn   t notice it before  but with the darkness        mandelbrot peered in the direction derec was pointing .     i see a patch of light reflecting from underneath clouds .  .  .  .      then  for a moment  they were both silent  listening to a voice that whispered in both their heads .   all units  central computer under attack .  all units .  .  .   the voice was very faint .  it faded even as derec tried to get the voice to respond .      my fa       derec began  then stopped himself .  he hated the man too much to call him that  and on aurora it meant very little anyway .     mandelbrot  it must be avery .         it is possible .          it   s more than possible .  it explains everything  the distress call  the central computer not responding to the chemfets  our crash landing   everything .  he could have used a key  jumped to the compass tower here  and started disrupting the city .         why .     mandelbrot asked .     the first robot city was his creation .          he was also very disturbed that i could control it .  maybe he   s decided to destroy all the others .         it is possible  i suppose     mandelbrot admitted .     but we will not know until we arrive .         we have to push harder  mandelbrot .  the city   s in trouble .         why should that concern you so much  master derec .      the question sounded like one ariel might have asked  and the reminder hurt more than his physical pain .  derec scowled .     it just does .  maybe it   s the chemfets   some chemical bonding with the city that   s due to them .  i don   t know  mandelbrot .  all i can tell you is that i hurt when the city hurts  and it makes me want to do something about it .  can you understand that .         i can  master derec .  what you describe sounds very similar to the compulsion of the three laws within every robot .  and if we must push ourselves tomorrow  i would suggest that you rest     the robot said gently .     you are exhausted  and i cannot carry you .      derec wanted to argue  but mandelbrot was right .  he could feel the weariness  and the effort it took to get to his feet convinced him .     then i   m going to try to sleep .  what about you .         i do not know how much longer i will be able to walk .  the less i move  the better .  i will stand here and watch .  have a good sleep .        his dreams were haunted by his father  who could take on the shape of a wolf .  ariel was there  but wolf avery chased her away  and though derec tried to run after her  his feet were leaden and horribly slow .   derec awoke with a start .  for a moment  he was disoriented and nearly panicked until the nagging pain in his arm and ribs reminded him .  he opened the tent and poked his head out through the flaps .   it was still dark .  two moons were in the sky  one high  the larger one low to the west .  backlight against the moonlight  he could see mandelbrot  standing motionless at the edge of the overlook and staring out into the night .  he could hear the wolf creatures baying at the moon .      mandelbrot .         everything is fine  master derec .  i was listening to them .  their voices  it is almost like a language .         their voices make me want to avoid them at all costs .  they   re probably discussing how tasty my bones and your metal would be .  good night  mandelbrot .         good night  master derec .      he lay there for a long time in the darkness  not wanting to go to sleep .  he didn   t know if it was because avery would be waiting for him in his dreams  or because he was afraid ariel would not .     chapter     feint and thrust    silverside   s creator herself might have been distressed by the robot   s logic .  janet anastasi might well have been appalled and considered silverside   s positronic mind to be hopelessly damaged .  it is impossible to say .   surely an auroran robot would have been crippled  if not driven into outright positronic lockup  by the implications of this decision .  but to silverside  the three laws were simply the morals of the oldmother  and her logic and her interpretations were not shaped by human standards  but by those of the kin .   inclined to respond physically and aggressively to a challenge .   it took the pack another day to prepare  a long day of using their    found    tools such as sticks and flat stones  their few flint shaped blades and planes .  no one was exempt  even the very old and the very young helped as far as they were able .   after silverside was satisfied with the arrangements  she sent most of the kin back to packhome after warning them to take a circuitous  long route .  she sent some of the hunting kin with them for protection  not wanting to leave packhome entirely undefended should her plan fail .  keeneye and lifecrier insisted on remaining behind with silverside  and she chose another half dozen of the pack to stay as well .   as the sun set  they said their farewells to the rest of the kin and watched them make their way among the trees .  when they were gone  silverside howled a long challenge to the rising moons and turned to the others .      now  let us go find a walkingstone to kill     she said .   the city had changed  even in the two days since she had last seen it .  it had encroached farther on the forest  spilling from the valley that had confined it .  worker walkingstones with roaring chainsaws for arms were tearing at the trees at the leading edge of the city  farther in toward the hill of stars  everything seemed to have changed .  the ice blue building to the west had been farther over and shorter the last time  and the flying buttresses linking it to the building alongside had not been there at all .  the cluster of geodesic domes at the base of the hill of stars was certainly new  and an open space lush with greenery yawned under the bright lights of a slender needle tower .  it was as if the walkingstones were not satisfied with their expansion  they had to tear down and rebuild even in the center of their city .   the valley was awash in them .  the wind stunk of metal  the voideyes in the sky above were lost in the glare .   yet the walkingstones    ceaseless toil impressed silverside  even as she growled at the sight of the naked  muddy hillsides in their path .      they rape the land  like a male taking a female before her time     keeneye snarled .  she growled in beasttongue  a sound of pure loathing .     there are always more of them  always more of their stone caves  always more of their lights and noise and smells .         they leave nothing for us     lifecrier agreed .     is this the way the void looks  silverside .  is this the way the gods live .         i do not know     silverside answered .     it is possible .  i feel .  .  . i feel a pull to it  lifecrier .  there is something in the smoothness  in the many tools they use  in the way they move .  perhaps it is something i once knew .         then the gods can have the void     keeneye said in irreverent kinspeech .     i hate it .         oldmother will eat the souls of kin as we rise to the void     lifecrier chastised the former leader  using hunttongue to emphasize his point .     she takes us to the one pack again  and we run in the endless forest .      silverside snapped at the two of them .     silence .     she ordered .  lifecrier immediately moved back into the pack  keeneye stared at silverside for a moment  then dropped her muzzle .     move forward now .  quietly .  we don   t want to bring the hunters too quickly .      the pack flowed among the trees following silverside .  she brought them to a halt near the cleared section downwind of the walkingstones and surveyed the area .      there     silverside whispered  pointing .     they will do .      the wall of a building rose several meters away  a building under construction .  a group of three walkingstones was hauling materials to a wheeled cart alongside the wall  their backs to the forest .  the workers were isolated  most of the continuing work being done in a floodlit area half a kilometer away .  their head voices were silent .      now     silverside said  and leaped into the open .   as one  the pack followed her  sweeping across the ground like a gray wind and then falling on the walkingstones with savage growls .  silverside took one of them by the throat  shaking with all her robotic strength and feeling the hated thing die before it could sound an alarm .  the others hit the remaining two walkingstones in a rush .   central .  under attack     silverside heard the distress call cut off in mid sentence even as she turned to help keeneye and the others .  she needn   t have been concerned .  as she had suspected from her encounter with the other worker  the kin   s strength was great enough to disable this species of walkingstone .  under the floodlights across the open field  other workers were looking at them  and silverside heard them alerting central to the pack   s presence .   she grasped keeneye   s shoulder .     the hunters will be coming .  we must go .         then we   ll meet them here     keeneye said .  her eyes were bright with the death of the walkingstones .      no     silverside said in emphatic hunttongue .     keeneye will destroy the pack if she does that .  we   ve prepared for them   they will follow .  i promise that .  take them  i   ll follow .      keeneye gave a howl of both challenge and triumph to the nearest workers and turned .  the pack followed her back into the forest .  silverside waited  standing over the downed workers .  yes  they were like the krajal .  the others had turned back to their work  following the orders of central .  she heard central call the hunters .  when she saw the first gleam of their armored skin rushing toward her  she turned and followed the path of the others back into the forest .   behind her  she heard the crashing as the hunters bulled their way into the undergrowth .   silverside snaked her way through the trees  making sure she stayed well ahead of them but left a clear path behind .  even so  the walkingstones remained close behind her .  when she finally broke through into the glade where the others waited  they were not far behind .  all the kin could hear them  birds were rising in panic above the trees  and they could smell the oily stench .  the kin stirred restlessly  muttering in angry beasttalk as they milled around silverside .   she stood in the center of the glade  pacing .  the open spot was situated in a deep valley  surrounded on all sides but one by steep slopes .     the rest of you   into the trees and make ready     she ordered .     do not let them see you .  remember that their lightning will kill you if it touches you .  i will lure them in and then run .  keeneye  you will do the rest .      they were barely in position when the first of the hunters broke through the ring of trees  the others at its heels .  silverside gave a rumbling beasttalk challenge  then broke and ran when the hunters raised their hands to her .  laser fire raked the trees  just missing her  and the hunters lumbered into motion again .  follow  the voices in her head said .  do not let the creature escape this time .   this was exactly what silverside had hoped for .  the hillsides formed a natural funnel  the walkingstones had to move as a group .  the walkingstones moved across the glade as one .   and  as one and intent on their pursuit of silverside  they tumbled into the deep pit the kin had dug across the glade and hidden with dry grass .      now  keeneye .     silverside cried .   the dirt removed from the pit had been piled next to it and blocked with fallen logs .  now keeneye cut the lashings holding the logs .  they rolled crazily over the edge  followed by a roaring landslide of dirt and stones .  the kin pushed at the mounds of dirt  howling  keeping it cascading down on the hunters as a choking cloud of dust rose .  silverside could hear the head voices wailing distress as the walkingstones were covered under the weight of two meters of rocky clay .   when the dust settled at last  there was nothing to be seen of the hunters .  they were gone .  buried .  even the head voices were silent .   the pack howled and wailed in beasttalk .  they clambered over the pit  stomping on the earth that hid the walkingstones and packing it down .  lifecrier licked silverside   s cold muzzle  even keeneye rubbed her flank in appreciation .     we   ve done it .     lifecrier sighed .     we   ve killed hunters .  all the kin can see the gift of the oldmother now .      the reminder served to temper keeneye   s satisfaction .  the former leader only grunted .     it might seem so .  but this was only one battle  lifecrier .  only half of silverside   s plan .  there   s still the rest .      silverside nodded in agreement and the mood of the kin darkened again .  the celebration ended as they gathered around her again .     all of you must stay here to watch     she told them when they were quiet .     central may send workers to dig these hunters out  or it may have other hunters to send .  keeneye  your task is harder than mine .  you must watch .  if other hunters come  flee  but remember that you cannot go back to packhome until you have lost them .  no matter what  you must keep them occupied for as long as you can .  if workers come  you must stop them from unearthing these hunters  or if you find that the hunters can dig themselves out somehow  you must find a way to stop them or slow them down .  we   ve not won .  not yet .  we   ve only made the first step .      silverside picked up a clod of dirt and crumpled it in her hand  letting the dust trickle back through her long  clawed fingers .     now  i must go and find this central .        chapter     a death       they have been following us for the last few hours  master derec .         i know .  i can hear them .      derec didn   t like the sound of the long  quavering howls echoing among the hills .  he also didn   t like the fact that the sun was just ready to set .   their last few days had been slow and painful  but mostly uneventful .  mandelbrot   s knee had seized up entirely  the robot walked with a stiff legged limp that made their progress halting .  derec   s arm was still sore and throbbing  but he nursed the remaining painkillers  taking them only when it became unbearable .  he watched his own footing carefully  knowing that if he stumbled he couldn   t easily break his fall .  derec would have sworn that their backpacks  light enough when they   d started out  seemed to be gaining weight as the days wore on .   he wasn   t much enjoying his first days on this world .  he would have given nearly anything for a hovercraft .  his feet hurt  his boots rubbed his toes raw  he   d found a hundred bruises he hadn   t known he   d had  and they had no idea if they   d ever see the robot city that still adamantly refused to talk to him .   what good are the chemfets if you can   t communicate both ways .   it was just like something dr .  avery would do .  more and more he was convinced that he would find avery here  that avery would somehow be behind it all .   worst of all  he missed ariel .  he missed her terribly .  he   d replayed their argument over in his head a thousand times .  he   d come up with a hundred lines that would have made it better  if only he had a chance to do it over again .  it would have been so easy .   okay  ariel .  i   m sorry .  come with us .  please .   but of course there was no way to go back in time and tell her that .  there was no way for him to turn back the clock and stop the argument before it began .  it would always be there between them .  the best he could hope for was that she   d be willing to forgive him when he returned to aurora .   if he returned to aurora .   all in all  derec sorely regretted his decision to come to this place .   and now there were wolves .   they had been shadowing derec and mandelbrot since yesterday  always staying out of close range but always just on the edge of sight .      i believe it is a territorial problem     mandelbrot said .     i think we are just on the edge of their land and they are warning us away .         we   re not going to harm them .  we just want to get to robot city .         that doesn   t seem to be something they would understand  master derec .      derec stopped and slipped the pack from his back  grimacing as the straps put weight on his broken arm .  there was a compressed air gun in the survival gear  a short range weapon only  but the glass darts contained a deadly nerve poison .  derec felt mandelbrot watching him as he loaded the gun and slid the holster on his belt .     they could be carnivores     he said to the robot .     i don   t want to take any chances .         i have been listening to them     mandelbrot said .     the calls are remarkably complex .         and their teeth may well be remarkably sharp .         understood  master derec .  still  i have been carefully watching and listening .  they seem to be staying within these hills .     mandelbrot pointed to the area directly ahead of them .     one of them will come directly into view and howl to us  like a challenge or warning   that is why i believe they are telling us to turn away .  what if their calls are a language .  perhaps we should avoid confrontation all together .         how .  by going a hundred kilometers around .  mandelbrot  we   re both hurt .  we need help  and the only help is in robot city .  which is   we think   that way .  wolves or no wolves .  i   ve heard the wolves  too  and it doesn   t sound like any kind of language to me .         i understand  master derec .  still  the voices are very complex  the falling tones  the breaks .  .  .         we don   t have time for detours .  we won   t live long enough for that .      mandelbrot nodded .  derec   s insistence forced first law overtones and third law obedience  the robot went silent .  they began walking again .   long shadows covered the landscape  the disc of the sun was gone behind the hills  and the western sky was a bath of crimson .  already the first stars were up in the east  with the largest of the two moons a crescent horn high in the sky .   derec and mandelbrot used the remaining light to push on into the hills .  the barks and yips and howls stopped ominously as they topped the first crest .  when it became too dark to see the tree roots and stones in their path  they stopped .  derec unpacked the tent  mandelbrot made a fire .     wolves are often afraid of fire     mandelbrot said .      i   ll remember to hire you as a guide next time we go on safari     derec said .  firelight threw moving  wavering shadows through the trees  the wood hissed and sparked  and it was hard to see anything beyond the glare of the flames .  derec thought it worse than the darkness itself .  it was easy to imagine shapes in the erratic light  and none of the shapes in derec   s mind was pleasant .      i   ll get some food started       derec began to say .   and then the shapes from his nightmares streaked from the woods  growling and snarling .   they were not wolves  at least not like any wolves derec knew .  they were larger than the old pictures derec had seen  lean  gray furred bodies and massive chests  their heads peculiarly shaped  large skulled but with a distinct canine muzzle .  they ran from the woods on all fours but reared up on the hind legs at will  slashing with forepaws   well articulated fingers tipped with razor claws .  their eyes were red from reflected firelight  and they roared and howled and shrieked as they attacked .   the creatures hit mandelbrot first  which very likely saved derec   s life .  they ignored derec  slamming into the hobbled robot .  mandelbrot could not move quickly enough to avoid them .  the robot flailed back at them  the avery arm snaking like a whip .  it struck one of the wolves across the snout and there was a distinct crack of bone as the wolf creature yelped  rolled  and fled .   three more struck mandelbrot at once  and the impact  combined with mandelbrot   s bad leg  knocked the robot entirely over .  he fell into the fire  clasping two of the attacking wolf creatures .  sparks flared and snapped  the wolves howled in fear and pain as they struggled to get away from the robot   s steel grasp .  mandelbrot let them go at last and the wolves yelped and fled  their fur scorched and burning .  mandelbrot struggled to get back on his feet  sending glowing embers flying through the air .   then everything was confused .  derec had dragged the gun from its holster .  he squeezed the trigger at anything moving beyond the campfire  the gun bucked in his hand .  something big and horribly strong hit him from behind and he went down  shouting with pain and nearly losing consciousness as he landed on his bad arm .  he couldn   t see anything  his head was full of exploding blotches .  somehow derec held onto the gun and fired blindly .  he couldn   t tell if he hit anything or not  but all at once the battle was over .  one of the wolves gave a short  high bark  the others dropped the attack and fled into the woods .   derec felt a metallic hand on his shoulder .     master derec .         wolves are afraid of fire  huh .         i have made the correction in my data bank .         good .  wonderful .  now help me up .      the camp was a mess .  bumming logs were scattered around the area  the tent had collapsed .  there was a long rip in one of the packs  and several cans of food had spilled out .     great     derec sighed .     we   ll be up half the night fixing things .  if our friends don   t make a return visit     he added .     man   s best friend  they aren   t .        they found the body in the morning as they began their trek once more .  derec nearly stumbled over it in the underbrush .     what the       he began  then stopped .      oh  no     derec said breathlessly .     please  no .         what is it  master derec .     mandelbrot said  limping over .   derec didn   t answer .  he only stared .   the wolf creature had evidently caught one of the stray darts derec had fired the night before .  it was a young one  a female who had evidently been watching the fight from the cover of the trees .  she certainly had not been involved herself .   she couldn   t have  even if she   d wanted to .  lashed around her body with vines was a primitive travois built of trimmed sticks  a carrier .  and in one hand  uselessly  she clenched a stone knife the chipped edges of which showed the mastery of a flint knapper .      by any god you care to name .  .  .     derec breathed .     mandelbrot  you were right .  the wolves   they   re sentient .      derec looked at the body  stricken .     and i killed one .        chapter     in the hill of stars    she bayed a challenge to central from the nearest hill  for no kin would go into battle with an equal without first warning them .   there was no answer .  she hadn   t expected one .   packing along the hills at the edge of the city  silverside watched for several minutes  paying careful attention to the movements of the nearest walkingstones and listening to their voices in her head .   there were several types that seemed to roam freely through the streets .  silverside left the heights and moved down from the trees to get a closer look at them .  she ran quickly across the cleared area around the spreading city and into the shadows of the buildings .  when one of the walkingstones passed her hiding place  silverside quickly memorized its shape and walk  once it was gone  silverside willed her body to change once more  patterning herself after the walkingstone .  her head became round and smooth  her body straightened and she stood upright  letting the markings of the kin disappear .   when it was done  she took the necklace of wires from her head and laid the token of her first victory on a ledge .  she walked onto the hard stone walkways and eternal daylight of the city .   silverside watched and listened carefully for any sign of recognition or alarm in the first few walkingstones she passed  but none of them paid her any attention at all .  as she went deeper into the steel canyons of this place  the walkingstones became more numerous .  soon silverside was moving in great crowds of them  of all manner of shapes and sizes .  this was certainly not the forest  where a kin could   at need   wander for a day or more without seeing another of the kin .  lifecrier   s analogy  which had first sparked this idea in her  seemed more and more apt .  these were krajal  hive insects .  they could not exist without each other .  they had no individuality at all .  they existed only to serve central  and without central they were nothing .   their society seemed very wrong to silverside .  her decision now gave her no pause at all .  it was right to destroy this place  despite the sophisticated technology it showed .  it spoke of intelligence  yes  but of intelligence used in the wrong way .  this was not logical  she decided .  this was not the way of humans .   silverside continued on .  the kin  she knew  would have been puzzled by the silence of the city  there were few noises at all beyond the hum of machinery and the sound of the walkingstones    passage .  none of them spoke in what the kin would have considered an audible range .  but silverside heard the racket of their thousands .  she listened to the walkingstones    endless chatter in her head .  already she was missing the good smell of earth and foliage and the sounds of life .  this was a dead place .  this was a sterile and horrible place  and she was headed for the very heart of it .   the hill of stars .  there  central would be waiting for her .  lifecrier had said that the hill of stars was the first thing the walkingstones had built .  the krajal always built first a room for their queen .   the different species of walkingstones all used different frequencies to communicate with central   silverside knew that without understanding frequencies or bandwidths  each species resonated in a slightly different place in her head .  janet anastasi had also built into her robot a primitive location device  silverside could listen to central and know from which direction the transmission came .   it was easy enough to walk the streets and listen  tracking central .  none of the workers even questioned her right to be there  they ignored her  going about their own tasks .   central was concerned about her  though .  silverside heard a continuous stream of unanswered queries directed to the hunters .  as she approached the hill of stars itself  central ordered a group of workers into the forest to seek the hunters .  silverside felt satisfaction at that  for it meant that central either had no more hunters to send or that it was not going to expend more of them until it understood what had happened .  either way  it meant that the other kin were relatively safe for the moment .   silverside continued on until she reached the large open plaza in which the hill of stars stood .   the gigantic pyramidal structure overshadowed any of the other buildings in the city  towering higher than the hills surrounding the valley .  its steep  sloping faces were pocked with windows behind which she could occasionally see one the walkingstones moving .  the scale of the structure was something she could only now begin to understand .  it was immense  far larger than anything else in this place .  a fitting place for the central  for this queen walkingstone  she decided .  there were large doors cut into each of the sides .  silverside began walking across the plaza toward the nearest of them .   she expected to be stopped and challenged .  she had prepared herself to be ready to move quickly and violently  knowing that once an alarm was raised  central would immediately take steps to protect itself  and she would have scant minutes to finish her task .   it was almost too easy .  none of the walkingstones in the plaza made any move to prevent her from entering the hill of stars .  like the rest  they paid no attention to her at all .  she was simply another one of the workers  going silently about her task without question   why should another of them question her right to be there .  she entered into a cold dimness bounded by stone and cut with wide hallways .   there were fewer of the walkingstones here  and most of them had a different body construction  more streamlined  with hands obviously designed for delicate work .  from the orders given them by central  silverside knew that these were the attendants of central  the ones allowed into its presence .  silverside let her body change to match their shape in a brief moment when she was alone in the hall and then continued walking  waiting .   it took only a few minutes .  an order came from central to one of the attendants who had just passed silverside  summoning it .  the walkingstone turned to obey  and silverside followed  moving with the walkingstone along the labyrinthian corridors deeper into the heart of the hill of stars .  in time  they passed through a set of wide doorways into a vast interior chamber .   and silverside looked upon central .   the huge chamber was brightly lit from hanging lamps .  four doors entered into it on the ground level  balconies rimmed the walls to the ceiling  twenty or more stories high .  in all that vast space  walkingstones moved on all sides  but the ground floor was left mostly empty but for a cluster in the exact middle .  there stood a quartet of hunters  one at each corner of an array of eight wafer thin  two meter tall rectangles  arranged like the rays of a stylized sun around a central column .  the column was all black and chrome  with tiny lights blinking red and amber up and down its length .  the presence of the hunters would have been enough  but silverside could sense the power and energy coming from the structures .   central .  the queen .  the mind behind the walkingstones .   and with the hunters guarding it  silverside knew that a frontal attack would not work .  she altered her course in what she hoped looked to be a purposeful way  angling toward another of the exits from the room .  one of the hunters watched her  but she heard nothing in her head from central .  silverside left the room and went into the hallway beyond .   had she been kin  she might have felt despair .  isolated as it was  with the hunters around it  there seemed to be no way to reach central .  it would be a long run across that floor  before she could hope to reach the unit  she would be cut down by the hunters    laser fire .  as for the balconies .  .  .   she passed a glassed in elevator rising toward the top of the hill of stars  climbing the outside of central   s chamber .  the glimmer of an idea sparked in her positronic brain .   silverside stepped into the open door of one of the elevators as another of the walkingstones stepped off .  a row of marked buttons was set next to the door  she pressed one and the elevator rose swiftly up  stopping gently with a chime .  silverside stepped out and found the nearest door leading into the central chamber .  she stepped to the railing and looked down .   far  far below in that dizzying space  she could see the sunray design of central .   any third law requirement that she protect her own life was lost in the first law possibilities represented by the death of central .  the fact that she might die in the effort meant nothing weighed against the fact that it would save the lives of kin .  silverside climbed up on the railing  her body changing back to wolf shape .  her powerful hind legs gathered .   she leapt .   her robotic strength took her out over the well of emptiness .  at the zenith of her leap  over the center of the space  she willed herself to change once more  letting the body expand and thin and flatten into a glider shape like the paraseeds she   d seen fall from the trees near packhome .  she sailed  soaring and spiraling down   a silent enemy descending .   for several seconds  she heard nothing .  silverside began to think that this would work  that she would plummet unhindered down to central .   but a worker pointed as she passed one of the balconies in her descent .  silverside realized that there were certain things too out of the ordinary for even the workers to ignore .   central .  alert .   the hunters looked up and saw silverside .   one of the younglings heard them first .     keeneye     he hissed .     walkingstones .      keeneye growled in beasttalk .  since silverside had left  she had been prowling the ground where the hunters were buried  nervous and agitated .  she   d been expecting this .  she   d known that this was a foolhardy idea from the beginning .  but silverside was the leader   there was nothing she could do about that short of challenging her again  and silverside was simply too strong .  keeneye gave lifecrier a baleful  accusing glance and bounded toward the youngling .      go see where they are     she ordered the young male .     quickly .         silverside hasn   t had time yet to destroy central     lifecrier said  coming up behind keeneye as she watched the youngling rush away .     only a few more minutes           or perhaps she   s already been killed and this is a squad of hunters who will kill the rest of us .         silverside is the oldmother   s           be quiet .     keeneye growled in savage hunttongue .     i am tired of hearing this prattling about oldmother and the void .  silverside has made a mistake  whether she is from the oldmother or not .         and what would you have done  keeneye .  would you let us slowly starve to death .  at least silverside is trying to do something about the walkingstones .      their argument went no further .  the youngling came back panting .     they are workers     he gasped  his head lolling and his tongue out .     but one of them has hands like the hunters .  that one walks in front  like a leader .         silverside had said that central might send workers     lifecrier said .      she didn   t say that they would have the weapons of the hunters  though  did she .     keeneye glowered .     if they   re workers  then we will destroy them as we did the others .  they will be expecting us here .  lifecrier  you will go to the west and circle to come behind them  i will go east and do the same .  the rest of you will hide in the trees until these workers begin to dig .  then we   ll hit them from all sides at once .  make sure the first one attacked is the one with hunter   s hands .      keeneye looked at each of the small group of kin and lapsed back into kinspeech  gruffly affectionate .     we must stop them from unearthing the hunters .  we must try to give silverside the time she asked for .     she looked at lifecrier last of all .     even if it means nothing     she added .     nowgo .      keeneye and lifecrier streaked away as the others melted into the cover of trees around the glade .     chapter     encounter with kin    the wolf creatures did not attack again that day  though derec and mandelbrot heard them often or glimpsed them shadowing their progress through the trees .  derec watched them  his weapon at ready but not certain that he could fire it again  not with the knowledge that they were intelligent .  once or twice  he called out to the wolves or gestured to one of them slipping past  but they never responded .   by noon  the calls had faded behind them  and they were left alone in the forest .      i think we must have passed only through a far comer of their territory     mandelbrot said .     the attack was simply to ensure that we came no closer to their den or whatever  and they stayed with us to be certain that we left .  it is a lucky accident that our path did not lead us in the wrong direction .         it would have been luckier if it hadn   t led us to them at all     derec answered morosely .      we must be very careful     mandelbrot said .     there are likely to be more tribes in the area .  master derec  do you think that perhaps these wolf creatures would be able to help us .  perhaps we do not have to find the robot city .         no     derec replied  but the question made him glance over to mandelbrot .     we need robot city .  stone age technology won   t do either of us any good .  are you going to repair your knee with a flint joint .  are you going to find servos and high grade lubricants and a new optical circuit .      mandelbrot was silent after that  but derec knew that the robot was experiencing a mental quandary after their encounter with the wolf creatures .  mandelbrot was obviously troubled by their sentience .  it showed in the questions he asked  in the way that he looked at derec   s weapon  in the attention the robot paid to the movement of the wolf creatures watching them .   knowing the robot as he did and having seen the reactions of the original robot city robots to wolruf  derec knew where the problem lay .  he could almost hear balances shifting within the robot   s mind .      mandelbrot     he said as they walked     how do you regard the wolf creatures .  how do the laws apply to them .         are you asking if i consider them    human     master derec .         yes .  i suppose that   s the basic question .  are they human .  i know you came to class wolruf as human .         positronic minds are as variable as those of humans  master derec .  what is human .  there are many ways to answer the question  all of them valid and all of them with shortcomings .  certainly it is more than simply the way a being looks  even among the humans i have seen there is a great variance .      derec was shaking his head .     but every one of them you   ve encountered has been homo sapiens  a bipedal  upright walking mammal descended from apes and able to trace their ancestry back to earth .  these wolf things  whatever they are  aren   t bipedal  aren   t apes  and aren   t descended from anything on earth .         that description fits wolruf as well .         point taken .  but you haven   t answered my question yet .  let me give you a hypothetical situation  if i told old balzac back on aurora that wolruf was a great danger to me and the only way to remove the danger was to kill her  would balzac do it .         the danger would have to be demonstrated  master derec .  your word would not be enough .         all right  assume it was .  assume i can convince balzac of the imminent risk .  i know i couldn   t order balzac to kill a human  but what about wolruf .  balzac   s seen her walk and talk and use the computer and pilot a ship .  would he still be able to protect me .      mandelbrot   s eyes gleamed .  his bad leg dragged through underbrush  and the robot came to a halt alongside derec .     you are asking this because you are concerned that i will not be able to protect you should these wolf creatures attack again .      derec shrugged .  he patted his broken arm  then waggled the gun in his hand .     we   re not in the greatest of shapes  mandelbrot .  neither one of us .  first  i don   t want to have to use this thing  not after what we know now  but if i have to in order to stay alive  i probably will .  what about you  mandelbrot .      the robot seemed to consider that for a long moment  and for a moment derec was afraid that he might have inadvertently driven the robot into positronic lockup .  then servo motors whirred as it began walking again .     i have searched my data banks and checked the functions of my logic system  master derec  and the readouts are very erratic .  my priority circuits are almost in balance .  had i never met wolruf  had i never seen sentient alien lifeforms  and did i not have memories of robot city in my mind  i am sure it would be different .         what are you saying  mandelbrot .         that i do not know what i would do  master derec .  i do not know .        he could have insisted .  he could have made it a direct question and stressed the importance of an answer   the second law would have forced mandelbrot to answer .     mandelbrot  do you consider these wolf creatures to be as human as me .      but somehow it didn   t seem right to ask .   after all  derec wasn   t sure of the answer himself .   all of the sudden  it was too late to ask .   they had continued to walk even after the sun had set .  the moons were up and bright  and derec wanted to cover as much ground as they could before settling for the night .   mandelbrot   s comlink overheard the short range call .     derec     it said .     there are robots in the near vicinity .     mandelbrot   s flat  emotionless voice sounded strangely dispassionate .     they seem to be searching for hunter seekers that are also supposed to be in this vicinity .      derec couldn   t help the grin that split his face .     that   s wonderful  mandelbrot .  now we can finally get out of here .     he focused his thoughts inward  trying to contact the robots via the chemfets in his body  but the link was still not there .     can you contact them  mandelbrot .  tell them there   s a human in need of aid        derec got no farther .   a fury in gray fur hit him from behind .  claws raked his shoulder as he was sent sprawling to the ground .  his broken arm hit a root protruding from the earth .  derec screamed involuntarily as the world went dim .  his attacker  a wolf creature  had turned to attack again  snarling .  derec tried to raise himself up with his good hand and could not .  the wolf creature gathered itself to pounce .   derec knew he was going to die .   the wolf creature  sentient or not  was going to rip his throat out .   derec struggled to crawl  to move .  he saw a blur of metal and heard the whine of overtaxed gears .  mandelbrot had moved to intercept the wolf creature .  but the gear whine became a wail and the robot   s leg seized up entirely .  mandelbrot started to fall  internal gyros protesting  as the wolf creature leapt .   mandelbrot   s avery type arm snaked out even as he fell  even as the body of the wolf creature bounded over the robot   s prone body .  mandelbrot grabbed  held  and threw .  it was all he could do .  the wolf yelped in surprise and pain  then the body thudded against the tree next to derec and slumped to the ground .   the stars in derec   s head went away slowly .  his vision cleared to see mandelbrot lying next to him and staring .     master derec .     the robot asked .     i think i may have killed it .     his voice seemed to grind from his metallic larynx  halting .  derec understood immediately that the robot was very near lockup .  his one good eye was dim  and his hand was fisted tightly .      mandelbrot     he said desperately .     you had to do it .  i would have died otherwise .  i   m .  .  . i   m okay  i think .  you saved my life  mandelbrot .  you had no choice .  no choice at all .  if you lockup now  you   re committing a first law offense .  i need you .      derec tried to rise and fell back again with a groan .  he   d intended it as an act   it wasn   t .  the pain was all too real .   his discomfort stirred mandelbrot .  the eye came back to full brilliance  the hand unclenched  and the robot stood up  his left leg sticking out stiffly in front of him .  gently  he helped derec to his feet .     thank you  mandelbrot     derec said and went to the wolf creature .  it was not breathing .  up close  it was magnificent  muscular  the thick fur rich with glossy highlights in the moonlight  the face expressive even in death .  derec   s gaze was caught by the forepaws .  they were true hands  despite the deadly curved claws  the long fingers delicate and jointed  the thumb opposed and ideal for grasping .  the creature must walk on its knuckles  he realized  for the tops of those joints were wide  flat  and bony .  except for that difference  the hands might have been those of a human .   derec sighed .  mandelbrot was right to be bothered by the death .   the massive head lolled  the neck broken .  derec stroked the fine  gray tipped black fur of the creature with his good hand .     you couldn   t help it  mandelbrot     he said again  knowing the robot was watching him .     you have to know that .      he stopped .  his fingers had found something in the fur of the creature   s neck .  derec pulled it loose .  it was a necklace of colored wire .  soldered to the end of one of the strands was a small circuit board .  derec   s breath hissed in with surprise .     mandelbrot  look at this .  mandelbrot .      mandelbrot was no longer listening .  the robot had suddenly straightened in an attitude of listening .     master derec .  the robots i heard a few minutes ago   they are being attacked .      from somewhere very close by  they could hear the sudden  savage howling of wolves .     chapter     escape from the city    silverside   s reaction to being seen by the hunters was swift and powered by the three laws .  the third law forced her to try to save herself .  second law demanded that she follow the orders of humans  and though she was their leader  keeneye   s commands to save the kin still carried weight  the first law compelled her to do whatever she could to keep her people alive .   which meant the prime consideration was that central be destroyed .   silverside changed her shape as the hunters turned to look up at her .  she drew back the parafoil and thickened the body .  even as the hunters raised their hands to fire their lasers  she became a streamlined  compact mass instead of a glider  and she dropped the last thirty feet like a massive stone  crashing heavily into the central column of central .  laser beams crisscrossed the air where she had been  delicate circuitry smashed under her fall .  silverside changed back to wolf form even as she rose from the wreckage of the core unit .  she went to the wide panels surrounding the core and pushed with all the strength of her durable body .  a panel toppled  striking the next in line   the array went down like a row of dominoes  sparking and crashing  the thunder of their destruction ringing in the cavernous room .   silverside fled the room  howling the ritual triumph of a victor even as she anticipated the hunters    lasers cutting her down .  it didn   t matter to her .  she   d done what she   d come to do .   but nothing happened  the hunters had stopped .   already confusion was spreading through the city   she could hear it  a thousand voices crying out in the voidtongue that the oldmother had given her .  walkingstones were asking central for instructions  but central was not replying  would never reply .  the alarm was spreading out through the various levels of this krajal like society .   emergency .  central core memory damaged and off line command program inactive  secondary routines down .   activate supervisory backups .   behind her  silverside heard the hunters stir .  she raced into the corridor beyond central   s room .  there were no walkingstones in sight there .  she quickly altered herself once more to appear as one of the hill of stars    hunters  depending on the disguise to give her cover as she headed for the exit from the place .  she listened to the continuing dialogue in her head .   city command given to supervisor units alpha  beta  gamma .  the general announcement went out first over all frequencies  then three new voices boomed in her head .  the direction finder in her skull indicated that all three were in widely scattered sections of the city .   alpha  normal city subroutines accessed .  city functions on line and programming reinstated .   beta  alert situation .  central computer destroyed .  attacking unit in shape of local wolf creatures is rogue robot .  repeat  attacking unit is robot not under control of city supervisors .   gamma  alert update .  witnessing units report sophisticated shape changing abilities .  compass tower hunter seekers programming altered to compensate .   silverside increased her pace as she moved toward the exit .  the corridor was crowded now  the walkingstones returning to their routines .  if the hunters were aware that she could change shape  then her walkingstone guise was not going to help her for very long .  someone would report her presence or discover the charade through some inadvertent response .   she knew that her victory had been short and bittersweet .  yes  she had destroyed central .  she had disrupted the city  if only momentarily .  but the city had responded to the challenge all too well .  if she interpreted the signals correctly  there were now three sub centrals  all in different places  and they knew her one advantage .  if she were going to win this battle  she must move quickly  find all three of these supervisors  and destroy them .   the next command from the trio of supervisors dashed any hope silverside had at all .   alpha  all city units  access subroutine      . a .     .  immediately report any units not responding .  hold that unit at all costs until hunter seekers arrive .  third law precedence invoked   city survival involved  higher priority than individual survival .   all around her  moving walkingstones came to an abrupt halt .  an instant later  silverside did the same  it seemed safest .   she was wrong .  a simultaneous alert was broadcast from the worker walkingstones around her .  anomaly .  hunter seeker unit in compass tower has stopped .  in the same instant  all the workers in sight lunged for her .   silverside growled as she dropped back into her preferred wolf shape .  she threw the nearest worker aside  the fragile body crumpling under her blow  and dashed through the opening it gave her .  the alarm followed silverside as she darted from the building   she plowed through a worker who tried to block the entrance to the hill of stars and emerged into cool night .   she howled a lament .   then she turned into the lumbering bird shape she had used once before  a black and sorrowing form .   clumsily  her wings beat air  and she retreated from the city into the open sky .  the false stars of the city below mocked her  and she knew there would be no hiding from the hunters now .     chapter     contact    the uproar was furious  and mixed in with it was an occasional metallic grating  as if someone were bashing a steel plate over and over with a rubber hammer .  all at once  there was a yelp of terror and a wail .      the wolf creatures     derec said .     they   re the ones who have been attacking the city .  they   re why we got the distress call .  look .     he held up the braided wire from the dead wolf creature to mandelbrot .  it sparkled in the yellow white light of the larger moon .      the city does not know that they are sentient     mandelbrot said .  the robot seemed to shudder once allover .     the robots think they   re just animals .  they are simply exterminating them when they find them  like pests .         this circuit board didn   t come from the wolves originally .  sure  the city might think the wolf creatures are just animals   after all  we did too .  but they   ve obviously destroyed at least one robot already .  mandelbrot  we have to do something .  now .      derec laid the necklace on the dead wolf creature   s body and took his gun in his hand  his face grim .  mandelbrot   s hand closed over his wrist  firmly .     no     the robot said .  the odd grating slur was back in its voice .     i cannot allow you to kill them  master derec .  i am sorry .         mandelbrot  you misunderstand .         it does not matter if the robots are destroyed .  that is only the third law and this robot city can easily build more .  i have made the decision you asked me about earlier .  to kill a wolf creature is to break the first law .         please .  you must trust me .  i am not going to kill them .     derec tried to move his hand  the robot   s grip was gentle but unyielding .     mandelbrot  i am ordering you to release my hand .  i will not kill the wolf creatures .  do you understand that .      derec thought that mandelbrot might not respond .  the robot was staring at the dead wolf creature  at the bright wire .  the incident had further upset the positronic brain  derec began to fear that mandelbrot would freeze now  with derec   s one good arm locked in a death grip .   it would be an ignoble and curious way to end  anchored to a dead robot .   mandelbrot   s fingers opened slowly .  derec let out a breath he hadn   t known he was holding .     thank you     he said .     mandelbrot  i   m going to need your help .  i need a delicate touch and two good hands .  here   take the gun .  unload it .  quickly  we may only have a few minutes .      the battle was still going on within the darkness under the trees .  in fact  the uproar seemed to have intensified .  as the robot took the darts from their chambers  derec opened his backpack and found the medical kit .  luckily  everything there was well padded and nothing had broken in his fall .  he looked through the collection of vials  squinting in the dim light  and found what he needed .      mandelbrot  break open the dart chambers and empty out the nervekiller .  put this in .         master derec           it   s a sedative .  undiluted  and with their body weight  it should knock them out .      mandelbrot didn   t move .  his one good eye gleamed an unblinking  insistent red .     master derec  these creatures are unknown .  their metabolism might be so different from yours that this kills them .         or it may not work at all     derec pointed out .  he sighed .  the sound of the nearby struggle was intensifying    he hoped there was still time .  he patted mandelbrot on the shoulder   the robot looked terrible  dinged  scratched  and battered .  having pieced the robot together from several different models and after the patchwork repairs following the crash  derec felt pleased that the robot was still operating at all .  he also hoped that he looked better  but the distorted reflection of himself in the robot   s body looked just as disheveled and abused .   they needed help .  quickly .      mandelbrot  we can   t communicate with them     derec continued .     twice now we   ve been attacked without provocation .  they may be sentient  but they   re also very dangerous .  we need the robots .  if we don   t do something now  they may destroy all of them  and then they may well come looking for their friend here and take care of us .          that is not certain .         no  but it   s probable .  this is a chance that we have to take  one way or the other .  a full strength dose would take out a person of their general weight in two or three seconds and keep them down for an hour or two .  now   take the sedative and put it in the darts .  i can   t do it myself .      derec held out the vial .   mandelbrot hesitated  then the avery arm extended toward derec and its fingers closed around the vial .     yes  master derec     mandelbrot said .  with delicate but quick precision  it began to do as ordered .   mandelbrot reloaded the modified darts into the gun and handed it back to derec .     okay  let   s go     derec said .  the shivering  challenging howls of the wolves still came from just behind the trees .  derec shouldered the backpack once more and began walking quickly in that direction .  mandelbrot followed more slowly  his left leg dragging and a distinct whine coming from his hip servomotors .   derec broke through the trees at the top of a steep hill  the sides of which were bare dirt .  below  in a small  grassy glade well lit by the moons  a group of five wolf creatures were struggling with four robots of the laborer type .  one other wolf creature lay dead from what looked to be a laser bum  but the robot fitted with the laser arm was already down   it was obvious that the wolf creatures would eventually win this battle .  they harried the robots  darting in with great leaps  ripping with the claws and tearing with their jaws  and then bounding away again before the robots could hold them .   as derec watched  another of the robots slumped to the ground as a wolf creature ripped a power connector away in a gush of violet sparks that left glowing afterimages in derec   s eyes .  mandelbrot was still struggling through the undergrowth toward him .  the wolves were nearly two on one now  and derec knew there was no time left if he wanted to save any of the robots .   he hoped this would work  but he knew that  though he couldn   t say it  he was as skeptical as mandelbrot .     the way things have gone so far .  .  .     he muttered under his breath .   he raised the gun  sighted down the long barrel  and pressed the trigger  aiming for a gray furred male who seemed to be the leader .  a chuff of compressed air  in the glade below  the wolf yelped and leaped into the air .  on its hind legs  it reached around and plucked the dart from its skin  looked at it  and threw it down .  the old wolf creature   s gaze swept around the glade .   it saw derec even as he fired the gun once more  hitting another of the wolves .   the old one howled and pointed .  dropping down on all fours again  it charged .  derec counted softly as he fired three more times  injecting all the wolves .  another of them  unhindered by the robots  followed the old wolf   s lead and   howling   rushed up the hill toward derec .     one  two  three  four  five  six  seven .  .  .      the wolves kept coming .  they looked far more angry than sleepy  and mandelbrot was still laboring through the trees .      oh  frost     derec hissed .   the wolf creatures were fast and powerful .  he knew he was not going to be able to retreat anywhere near fast enough .  he doubted seriously that he was going to be able to lose them in the darkness .   he threw the useless gun at the old one bounding up the hill .   it missed .   that figures  he thought .     chapter     the voidbeing    the old wolf creature leaped over the edge of the hillside with the second close behind .  the old one started to leap and then abruptly halted as if startled  pawing the ground with its clawed hands .  the grizzled head cocked quizzically  and it growled something in its sibilant language .   but the younger wolf creature following it had no hesitation at all .  it flashed past the old one with a howl  baring its teeth and its claws flashing in mid leap .  derec shouted and spun aside as the wolf hurtled toward him .  it missed  through derec felt the wind of its passage .  the creature twisted in midair and spun as it hit the ground  kicking up dust .  derec waited for the creature to regain its balance and charge again .   there was nothing he could do .  he was trapped between the old one  now snarling at him  and the younger attacker .   as derec watched  trying to decide which way to run  the younger gathered itself again .   whimpered .   and fell on its side .  the old leader had fallen as well  down in the glade  the wolf creatures had also been affected  dropping to the ground in the middle of the attack .  derec sunk down to the ground himself as mandelbrot finally thrashed through the last trees .     master derec .     the robot called .      i   m all right  mandelbrot .  it worked  i think .     derec gazed down in the glade below  glad that the nights were bright here .   the remaining three robots  suddenly free  had turned to take advantage of the situation .  they advanced to the unconscious wolves  raised their hands to strike and kill     stop .      derec   s shout made them pause .  they turned and looked .  derec stood at the edge of the slope  letting them see him fully .     you can see that i am a human     he said loudly .     you must obey me .  come here   the wolf creatures are no danger now .      they stopped  though they didn   t back away from the wolf creatures .  mandelbrot came up to stand alongside him .     these creatures are no danger to me or to yourselves now     he repeated .     come here .         yes  human master     one of them said .  the trio headed for them as derec and mandelbrot examined the two sedated wolf creatures beside them .   the drug had far less effect on the beasts than it would have had on derec or any other human .  derec went to the leader  it was still awake  its disturbingly humanoid eyes watching him .  the body twitched  muscles jerking without control as it struggled to rise and either attack or flee .  derec sat down beside it and stroked the head as he might have a dog .     i   m sorry     he said .     if we could understand each other .  .  .      mandelbrot was looking over derec   s shoulder .     it worked     derec told the robot .     it wasn   t what i expected  and i   m not sure how long it will last  but it worked .  now we need to get out of here before it wears off .     derec gave the grizzled lupine body a pat and laid the head down gently .  the old one   s eyes continued to follow his movements .   the three robots had reached them as derec rose  slapping dirt from his pants .  derec tried to contact them via the chemfet link  but there was still nothing there but silence .     you   re from the robot city .     he asked them .      yes .         who is in charge there .  are there other humans .  is avery there .         there are no other humans .  the central computer directs all city activities .      derec could feel his shoulders relaxing with their words  and he realized just how tense he   d been at the thought of another confrontation with his father and his twisted genius .  he let out a deep sigh .     then inform the central computer that you have found a human and will be returning with him and another robot to the city     he said .     tell central that we   ve come in response to its distress call  and that we have information for it regarding these wolf creatures .  tell it also to open a channel to respond to mandelbrot  the robot with me  i will communicate with the central computer through him .      the robots went silent for a moment  then one of them spoke again .     i am sorry  master  but the central computer is not responding .         mandelbrot .         they are correct  master derec .  there is silence on all .  .  . just a moment .     derec saw the other robots stiffen as if listening to something only they could hear  his own chemfet link seemed to be utterly dead .  he could no longer hear the central computer at all .      master derec     mandelbrot said     the situation in robot city has changed radically .  the central computer has just been destroyed by a rogue robot .  the city is now under control of three supervisor units .  i have contacted them and informed them of your arrival and the situation here .  they ask that we come to robot city as quickly as possible for consultation .  the robots here will guide us  and the supervisors will send out more robots in our direction to escort us in case the rogue attacks us .  it seems very violent .      derec was puzzled .     surely they don   t think the rogue would attack a human  mandelbrot .  and how did the city ever lose control of it .         that is the odd thing  master derec     mandelbrot answered .     it is not a city robot at all .  it is not even humanoid .      mandelbrot pointed to the drugged wolf creature .      it looks like one of these     the robot said .     the dark bird glided over the forest  silent except for the rushing of the wind past its widespread wings .  circling the glade once and seeing nothing  it banked sharply and descended  clipping the treetops and landing clumsily on the top of the hillside overlooking the clearing .   there  under the watching moons  it changed shape and became silverside once more .   the hunters were still buried below .  she noted that first of all because it was most important to her positronic mind   first law .  three walkingstones lay here as well  and that was also good .   but the dark shapes on the ground near the walkingstones were kin .  silverside howled a lament to the stars and then called for any of the other kin   there was no answer .  she shifted her vision into the infrared and immediately saw warmth radiating from the ground nearby  two of the kin  and the shape of one was very familiar .  silverside let out a glad beasttalk cry and went to him .   lifecrier was moving  at least .  the old one had lifted himself up on his front legs and was trying to walk  though his rear legs dragged limply behind as if paralyzed .     silverside     lifecrier barked in happy kinspeech .     you   ve returned .  did you kill central .         i destroyed it  but it did no good     silverside replied flatly .     what happened here .  are the others dead .         i don   t think so .     lifecrier sank down again  exhausted  but his voice held a rich excitement .     silverside  there was a voidbeing here .  it had a companion  another walkingstone unlike any of the ones around the hill of stars .         a voidbeing .  from the oldmother .     lifecrier   s words stirred odd resonances deep in silverside   s mind .      not from the oldmother .  no  not with that shape .  from another of the gods  perhaps .  the voidbeing carried a stick that threw small knives at the kin  and a magic in the knives took away our bodies while leaving our spirits inside .  i attacked it because it had the look of the walkingstones  and i knew it couldn   t be from the oldmother .  but before i reached it  r could no longer move .  i could only watch as it came to me and touched me .  i thought it would kill me then  but it didn   t .  it stroked me like a mother stroking her pup and talked to me in the voidtongue even though it seemed to know i could not understand it .  then it laid me back down .  it left a short time later with the walkingstones from the city .      delicate balances were shifting inside silverside .  core programming in her positronic mind gave her a feeling akin to yearning .  she could hear the echo of the first voice she   d ever heard  talking to her in the voidtongue in the darkness of the egg .  a human being is an intelligent lifeform .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings .   but this voidbeing is not of this world  she reminded herself  not alive as we are .  it is a madething of the gods  or one of the gods themselves .  so it cannot be human .  the kin are human .   the feeling receded  but only slightly .  there was in her a pull toward intelligence .     i must go find this voidbeing     she said to lifecrier .      it   s gone back to the hill of stars     the old kin told her .     the walkingstones went with it .      lifecrier struggled to rise again and this time succeeded in standing on wobbly legs .  the other kin were beginning to stir as well  easing silverside   s first law concerns .   until she noticed that there was one less of the kin than there should have been .     where is keeneye .     she asked .   lifecrier   s grizzled forehead wrinkled .     i don   t know     he answered .     we   d separated the kin to better fight the walkingstones  and she was to have attacked from over there .     lifecrier pointed into the woods behind them .     i never saw her .     the others were coming up to them shakily  and lifecrier asked all of them     did any of you see keeneye during the fight .      all the kin shook their heads .   silverside looked at the ground and the tracks left by the voidbeing .  it was an extremely clumsy creature  it had left a path through the trees that was as easy to follow as one of the walkingstone   s straight stone paths .  an uneasy suspicion came to silverside .     follow me     she said .   she ran into the cover of trees  lifecrier and the others following slowly behind .   it took no skill at all to follow along the trail the voidbeing had taken .  the creature had broken branches underfoot and on all sides  and the ground still radiated the faint trace of heat from its passage .  silverside saw a patch of kin shaped warmth ahead and barked a quick hello .      keeneye .      keeneye didn   t answer .  the infrared red blotch didn   t move .  silverside took her vision back up into shorter wavelengths for detail  and then she saw the strange cant of the head and the odd way keeneye was slumped on her side .   silverside growled  deep and warningly .  she burst through the underbrush between them  hoping that keeneye was simply sleeping as the others had been and knowing from the disquieting stillness that she wasn   t .      keeneye .     silverside sat beside the body and lifted her into her arms .  the head simply fell back  limp  the eyes open and unseeing  the neck was broken .  silverside could smell the odd scent of the voidbeing on keeneye   s fur along with the oily essence of the walkingstones .  that told her all she needed to know .   the voidbeing had killed keeneye .   silverside threw her own head back and howled her loss to largeface  singing keeneye   s spirit into the void as she had seen the kin do with others who had died .  from the trees  the kin hearing silverside   s sorrow   joined her with their own voices .  the rising and falling of their song went on for long minutes  and then silverside let the empty body fall back to earth .  it no longer held keeneye  it was simply a dead husk .      first we will return to packhome     silverside said to lifecrier .     and then i will come back here .  if this voidbeing lives in the walkingstone   s city  then it must be their leader .      she lifted her head and howled a beasttalk challenge .     and if it is their leader  then it would kill all kin in the way it killed keeneye .  i must make sure that threat ends .        chapter     best laid plans    derec had forgotten what a bath felt like .      i have died and gone to heaven     he groaned as he sank back in the swirling warmth .  clouds of bubbles drifted over the enormous tub  and he lowered himself into the delicious heat until only his nose was out of the water .  he could feel every bruised and aching muscle in his body starting to relax for the first time in days .  sitting up  he leaned back against the tiles  propping his broken arm  newly braced  on the edge .  he motioned the attendant robot forward to scrub away the accumulated grime of his trek through this world .   derec simply luxuriated  letting the robot do it all .   when it was over  he stepped out into the fluffiest  thirstiest towel he could imagine  allowed the robot to dry him  and put on a warm robe .   he felt soothed and comfortable as he went into the main room of the apartment .   the main room was as large and plush as the bathroom had been .  far up in one of the taller buildings of the city  immense windows on three sides offered a view of the sweeping expanse of the compass tower  by far the largest edifice in the city .  mandelbrot was standing there looking out at the landscape  along with another robot that derec recognized as one of the supervisor units .  the antennae studded globe of a witness robot hovered nearby .      master derec  you look much better     mandelbrot said  turning .   derec grinned .     a bath does wonders  doesn   t it .  and i can certainly say the same for you .     the dings and dents in mandelbrot   s body had been smoothed  his external linkages straightened  and his body polished .  the robot   s optical circuits now gleamed brightly  and when he moved  servos no longer protested .      i am again fully operational     mandelbrot said .     master derec  this is supervisor beta  one of the control units for this robot city .         beta     derec nodded .     there   re a hundred or so questions i want to ask you .         i can understand that  master derec     the supervisor answered .     mandelbrot has told me of your journey here .  first  i should tell you that the medbots who examined you tell me that you have no serious internal injuries .  your arm has been reset  and a drug that accelerates the knitting of bones has been given to you .  most of your injuries are bruises and contusions that will heal with time .  you should be fully recovered within the week .  as for your companion  mandelbrot has been serviced and repaired entirely from parts in city stocks .         for which we both thank you .  but it   s entirely possible that none of it would have been necessary in the first place had your central computer answered me .      derec saw the distress his comment gave beta  the robot   s eyes dimmed briefly  and it backed away slightly .     you sent out a distress call     derec continued     but you wouldn   t respond to our answer  either through contact via the original robot city or via the chemfets in my body .  had you done that  we might never have needed to come here at all .      and ariel and i might never have argued  he thought  and with the image of her that put in his mind  he felt again a deep sadness .  i have to call her .  i have to apologize .      we deeply regret that  master derec     beta was saying .      then why .  it doesn   t make any sense to ask for help and then ignore someone answering it .      beta gave an oddly human shrug .     i agree with you  master derec .  in explanation  all i can tell you is that this city was to be self sufficient  there were instructions against direct contact with the original robot city  but that does not explain why we would not respond to a human   s inquiry .  my fellow supervisors and i have conferred  and we assume the reason was a command in the central computer   s programming .  when the rogue destroyed the central computer  it also wrecked that portion of the backup units .  none of the supervisors had been activated at that time  as you can see  the city is not very large or complex yet .     beta waved a glistening hand to the cluster of buildings below them .     there was no need to disperse city control .  i cannot answer your question at this time  though we are attempting to reconstruct as much of the central computer   s core memory as possible .  if we learn more  i will inform you .         it was avery     derec said with certainty .  he rubbed at his damp hair with the towel .     he has the key of perihelion .  he could have come here and programmed the central computer .         that is possible .  there is no way to be certain .         dr .  avery might still be in the city     mandelbrot said to the supervisor .     in that case  master derec is still in danger .      beta gestured to the window and the horizon  where the city nudged up against what looked to be an endless forest .     this city  as i said  is very small .  i doubt that a human could be in the city and not be noticed .         your city let a rogue robot get in and destroy your central computer     derec reminded beta .      the rogue has very special abilities     beta answered .     we have taken steps to insure that it cannot do this kind of damage again .  one of those steps was to activate myself and the two other supervisors so that city control no longer resides only in one place .  and as you can see  a witness robot accompanies each of us  coded with instructions to return immediately to a haven should the supervisor be attacked .  that way  very little of the city   s knowledge would be lost should the rogue manage to destroy one of us .  there are other supervisor units waiting to take over should that happen .  we are also building new hunter seeker units with special detection devices .         great  but i doubt it   ll help much .  i   d make you a bet that this rogue came from avery     derec said .     it has all his earmarks  inventive  cunning  and very  very dangerous .  which brings us to another problem .  you   ve said that this rogue leads the wolf creatures .         yes .  it was seen directing a pack of them that attacked workers on the edge of the city .  they have given the city problems since the beginning  harassing our workers clearing the forest .  as we felt them to be hindering our directives and to be dangerous both to ourselves and to any humans who would stay here  the hunter seekers were directed to find and kill them .      mandelbrot had swiveled to face beta .     no     it said .     you cannot do that .         i do not understand .  all three of the laws of robotics demand it .  by the third law  we must protect our own existence  they have damaged and destroyed units of this city .  by the second law  we must obey the commands given to us by humans  they hinder us from following our basic programming .  by the first law  we must above all protect humans  and these creatures are undeniably dangerous .  they attacked master derec and would have killed him had you not been there .  how can there be any question about this .         because it   s not exactly that simple  beta     derec answered for mandelbrot .     they   re not just    creatures    attacking you because you   re here .  i expect that they   re protecting their home the same way i would .  they   re not just animals  beta .  they   re sentient .  they use tools  they have a language .         are you saying that they built the rogue .      derec sniffed .     not a chance .  they   re barely at a stone age level .  this rogue sounds more sophisticated than anything here .          then how did they get involved with the rogue .         i don   t know that  but i   m willing to bet that avery had a hand in it somewhere .  the thing to do now is to figure out how to proceed without harming the wolf creatures  there   s a way to do that  i think .         what do you want me to do .         the first thing that has to be done is to inform all city units to view the wolf creatures as human .  the first law applies to them as well   you are to do nothing that does them harm .  will you do that .         you can do it yourself  master derec     beta said .     we have reprogrammed the city to respond to the chemfets in your body .  this robot city is now under your direction .  all you need do is give us your orders .      derec had paid no attention to the chemfets  silent and useless so long .  now he opened his mind to the sub miniature replicas of robot city material .  he could hear the city now  roaring in his blood .  the flood of information was almost too much to comprehend  and he hastily closed down most of the channels  leaving open only the direct links to the supervisors .   you see  master derec .  it was beta  talking to him via the chemfets .  all robot city is now yours .   good .  derec nodded and went to the window  looking out over the rooftops and up to the summit of the compass tower .      then we   ll let the rogue in if it wants in     he said .     avery didn   t know that i would come here .  even a rogue has the three laws built into it .  avery might be able to design a robot capable of destroying other robots  but i find it hard to believe that even he could build a robot that could knowingly hurt a human .        silverside watched two of the cubs wrestling on the floor of packhome .  they rolled over and over on the dusty  broken stones  growling in high pitched beasttalk and nipping at each other with their sharp milkteeth .  finally one of them yelped in real pain and lay on his back  paws up and throat bared in submission .   it was ritual play modeled after the adults .  silverside could hear one of the nursing mothers chuckling throatily as the victor gave a thin howl .  she lunged and snapped at the triumphant pup from behind  and it screeched suddenly  leaping high into the air as the fur on its back ruffled in fright .  the pup stumbled and fell  and the adults in the cavern laughed as it ran under silverside   s legs for safety .  the pup peered out at them half puzzled  half embarrassed .   silverside reached down and lifted it in her hands .     you see  the leader always has to be ready for a new challenger     she said to it in soft kinspeech .  she stroked the soft fur and set the pup down again .   the little one ran for its own mother .      it   s always good to see the younglings playing     lifecrier said to silverside as the pup started to nurse .     it reminds you that even though our spirits leave here to go into the void  oldmother will send them back again .     lifecrier licked silverside   s face affectionately .     keeneye will come back one day .  she is not gone forever .         i am not concerned with keeneye     silverside said .     she is dead and doesn   t matter any more .     it was only true   there were no emotions in her positronic matrix  only the priorities built into it by the three laws .  yet silverside sensed that her uncaring words hurt lifecrier  and she tried to explain to the gray furred kin .     all that concerns me is how she died and why  and what i must do to stop that from happening again .  you do not understand me  lifecrier .  you cannot see what is happening inside me .      they were all staring at her now  lifecrier  the rest of the adult kin  the younglings .  their obvious respect and dependence on her stirred the boiling cauldron inside .  silverside felt pulled in a dozen different directions at once .  things had seemed very clear cut and simple when she had hatched from the egg .  but now .  .  .   the part of her imprinted with the kin hated the voidbeing who ruled the walkingstones .  yet another part of her yearned to find this creature who seemed more advanced than the kin  who could fashion creatures from shiny stone and have them do its bidding .   lifecrier had backed away a step in deference to silverside   s rank .  he lowered himself slightly to indicate subservience .     i don   t understand keeneye   s death     he said .     the voidbeing could have killed me or any of the others .  yet it didn   t .  i saw it raise its hands and stop the walkingstones from hurting the kin it had paralyzed .  it held my head and did nothing but stroke it .  it did not seem dangerous .         it killed keeneye     silverside repeated .     i could smell its presence on her fur .         i know .  still .  .  .         the walkingstones seemed to obey it  you said .  that would mean that the voidbeing ranks higher than central or these new supervisors .         i suppose .  .  .  .         then the voidbeing must be an enemy of oldmother .  it attacked you  even if it did not kill you .  it saved the walkingstones and left with them .  it had a walkingstone as a companion .  it is an enemy .     silverside recited the facts in a monotone .  around her  the kin began to nod in agreement .  only lifecrier seemed hesitant .   inside silverside  synapses closed erratically .  her positronic mind no longer resembled that of any other robot  her life among the kin had changed it far more than her creator might have expected .  in that sense  she was truly a rogue .  no human standards worked for her anymore .  she was an alien  and she had overlaid the three laws with an alien morality .  she could not disobey them  but her vision of them was skewed .      i must do what best protects us     she told lifecrier .     nothing has changed .  we still cannot leave packhome  my attempt to destroy central only made it more difficult to damage the walkingstones .  you tell me that this voidbeing is a being of flesh  and flesh is very fragile and very tasty .  it had its knife stick  but even a sharpfang has its teeth and claws .  if the gods had to send it from the void  then we must have hurt the walkingstones more than we know .  perhaps if we also kill the voidbeing  then the oldmother will have won .  what do you think  lifecrier .    you are the one who knows the oldmother best .         silverside is the leader     lifecrier answered  using hunttongue .     if she says that the oldmother wishes us to kill the voidbeing  then we will kill it .        chapter     stalking the gods    derec knew what the supervisor robot wanted before gamma entered the room .  the chemfets had told him  whispering into his mind .      we   re going to have to change your name     he told the robot .     gamma   it shows a definite lack of imagination .  but it can wait .  what   s up .         there are wolf creatures on the far hill  master derec .  they are approaching the city boundaries .         i   m aware of it .  they didn   t give us much time  did they .  is everything ready .     there was little need to ask   he could have found out via the chemfets  but somehow it seemed more reassuring to ask the supervisor .  there was only so much information he could absorb from the flood the chemfets allowed him .  even if he wanted to control every function of the city  it would have been impossible .   when the chemfets injected into him by his father had first asserted their presence  derec had thought that he was going insane .  he couldn   t control them  couldn   t handle the eternal input .  but he   d learned how to filter out most of it  learned to let the city take care of itself .  the supervisors were invaluable  and the lesson derec had been taught in the original robot city was to delegate his authority .  it was the only way to remain sane .   derec yawned .  he   d tried to sleep that afternoon  knowing the wolf creatures would come at night  but he   d been too wound up .  he yawned again  forcing oxygen into his lungs .      everything is set as you instructed  master derec .     the supervisor robot  identical to its counterparts alpha and beta  went to the balcony high up in a building near the compass tower .  city lights gleamed red and yellow on the robot   s burnished skin .  mandelbrot came from the next room and went onto the balcony with derec .      i see them     mandelbrot said .     there   just below the tree line .  there are six or perhaps seven of them .         get your eyes fixed at last and you have to show off     derec chided mandelbrot jokingly  but the robot missed the humor entirely .      i am sorry  master derec     he said .  in retrospect  it was the only reaction derec should have expected  but derec suddenly knew how much he missed human company .  ariel  especially .  i need to talk to her .  sometimes i feel half robot myself with the chemfets chattering away inside .   there had been no time to contact her .  derec had known the wolf creatures would come to the city again  and quickly .  it was what dr .  avery would have done  after all  and the rogue had to be avery   s   it just made sense .   he didn   t think it would be much trouble dealing with it .  in fact  his mood was rather jovial .  scrubbing away the filth of their journey through the forest and being in the city made him feel almost human again .  he felt safe here  and with the resources of the city  nothing was impossible .   he   d be home again  soon .  he   d see ariel and patch up the rift caused by their fight .   the rogue was not a problem .  the wolf creatures he was more concerned about  but they should be easy enough  too .  a general reprogramming of the city  an understanding of their language so they could communicate  and some compromise could be reached .  this stupid war with the city would end .   derec squinted into the night  cradling his sling in his good hand so that his injured arm wouldn   t brush up against the railing .  it was impossible for him to see anything at all .  he couldn   t even make out the individual trees  a kilometer and more away in the murk .  the sky was overcast  even if this world   s two moons had been up  their reflected light would never have penetrated the cloud cover .      i told you they   d move     he said .     can you see the rogue  mandelbrot .         no  master derec  i do not .  but it could still be there  back in the trees .      derec shook his head .     no .  not that one  not if it   s really the leader .  if these beings are anything like the old wolves  they   re pack animals .  the leader would be first  or the others wouldn   t follow .  remember wolruf .  always headlong into the fray .  .  .     derec grimaced .     i suppose it   s possible it   s already among the buildings  maybe in some other form .  we might have missed it .       he shrugged .  the city was alert now .  the chemfets in his bloodstream fed him a continuous stream of information over the security channels .     supervisor gamma .         yes .         you   re certain the robots will consider the wolf creatures human .  you   re certain they won   t allow them to be harmed .         you have instructed them so yourself  master derec .  if there were direct danger to you from one of them  i believe we would protect you first  as you most fit our programmed definition of    human     but otherwise  yes .  we will not harm them .         i can   t stress that enough .  the city can always build more robots .  i don   t care how many robots these wolf creatures might destroy   i don   t want them hurt .  we can find some other way to coexist with them .         that is understood  master derec .  mandelbrot has explained much to help us reinforce your orders .      derec could feel adrenaline building inside him .  he wanted to run back into the room and out to the edge of the city .  he wanted to be there .  he   d made plans to do so  but the idea had distressed alpha  the supervisor to whom he   d first broached the subject .     that would be extremely dangerous     the robot had said  very slowly and carefully .     i do not know that the laws would permit it .  .  .  . the rogue robot .  .  .      derec could have argued  it hadn   t seemed worth the trouble .  even mandelbrot had agreed  the rogue was an unknown and obviously dangerous .  despite derec   s assurances that even a rogue would follow the three laws and thus be unable to harm him  all the robots had been noticeably    pleased    when he agreed to remain in the city .  okay .  he   d play general this time  staying behind the lines and directing his forces .  he noticed that the supervisors had also placed a cordon of hunter seekers around his building  but he didn   t comment on it .      give me the visual  gamma .  and make sure we   re recording   we   re going to need every scrap of sound these creatures make to start deciphering the language .      the wall of the building directly across from them was a milky white  translucent plastic .  now it glowed with inner light  and a huge image of the forest gleamed there  red with enhanced infrared imaging .  derec could easily see the wolf creatures moving cautiously through the tall grass toward the city .      mandelbrot     he said  leaning forward slightly and pointing to the wolf in the front of the pack .     isn   t that the old one from the glade .  see   it has the same gray fur around the muzzle  the same markings .         i see him  master derec .         he might be the best one to capture .  he might remember that we didn   t harm him last time .  he might even cooperate .  gamma .         i have already so instructed all units  master derec .         good .  i imagine we   ll have to put most of them to sleep before they   ll give up this attack .  they seemed rather aggressive .     derec patted his arm and the bandages swaddling the claw wounds .  he watched them moving slowly toward the city .     they   re magnificent creatures in their own right     he said .     look at them .  so strong and sleek  we saw what they could do to a robot .      he could see now that several of them were wearing bright wire collars  totems against the city  perhaps  or simply trophies of past victories .  the sight made him nod .     mandelbrot  you were absolutely right .  they are human .  maybe if wolruf were here .  .  .      as the pack approached  derec sent messages through the chemfets .  several hunter seekers advanced from the outbuildings of the city in a line .  half of them carried neural disruptors hastily built during the previous day  the computer models of the wolf creatures indicated that the disruptors would interfere with the electrical impulses of the wolf creatures    brains and cause mental confusion .  the jury rigged models had also been prone to leakage and had disabled more than one of the robots as well .  as a backup  other hunter seekers loaded with sedative darts also moved toward the invaders .  worker units waited to capture one or more of the creatures in hopes of learning to communicate with them .   derec didn   t think they   d go quietly .  he fully expected a bitter battle before the wolf creatures would be overcome .   he was wrong .   halfway down the hill  the old one simply stopped .  in full view  making no effort to hide himself  he rose up on his hind legs  pointed to the hunter seekers  and howled in that eerie language .  the gesticulation needed no translation   it was obvious enough  come and get me .   there were evidently certain universals when it came to body language .      that doesn   t make any sense at all .     derec squinted at the meters tall image of the wolf .     you   d think a pack animal would just attack .          they are not just animals     mandelbrot reminded derec .      yeah .  and i   ll bet the rogue   s taught them a few sneaky tricks of its own .     he grimaced .     well  he   s obviously not going to come to us .  obviously they want the fight to come to them .  gamma  let   s send the hunter seekers forward .      but it was not a fight they wanted .  not at all .  as the hunter seekers advanced  the wolf creatures retreated .  step by grudging step .  they stayed out of range of the disruptors and the darts  though derec suspected that was accident rather than anything else .   derec tried direct communication through the hunter seekers  hoping they might understand the tone of his voice if not the words .  they simply howled back at it .   he sent an unarmed worker forward  arms outstretched peacefully .  when it reached the pack  they tore it apart .   at last  frustrated  he sent the hunter seekers forward at a quick trot .  the wolf creatures melted back into the woods  and derec called the hunter seekers back .   as a confrontation  it was an elusive  aggravating thing .  as an effort to solve the conflict  it was an utter failure .      frost     derec muttered as the wall across the street went dark again and the city lights reasserted themselves .     now just what in space was that intended to prove .        silverside listened to the chorus of head voices  waiting .  she was just to the south of the city  having circled halfway around it from packhome .   already she could hear the alarm spreading as lifecrier showed himself and the other kin at the edge of the forest to the west  and she could hear the new voice that directed the city functions  instructing even the triumvirate of supervisors .   the godbeing .  the one of flesh  not stone .   the city was stupid .  the walkingstones had not learned .  they expected the kin to attack the same way they always had  as if they could not create new tactics .  she could hear the godbeing telling the hunters to move forward  speaking to them in the voidtongue they both shared .  do not kill them  it said .  capture the old one .   silverside growled at that  pleased that she had cautioned lifecrier only to show himself and to avoid an actual fight if he could .  it was a first law decision  silverside only knew that it felt right to her .   do not harm the wolf creatures .  that was what the godbeing said  but silverside wasn   t sure that she believed it .  silverside could not lie herself   the oldmother had made such a thing impossible for her   but the kin could .  flesh could lie  and the godbeing was flesh .   the city   s attention was on the kin now .  it was time for her to move .   she had tilted and canted the dodecahedral segments of her body so that they reflected as little light as possible .  becoming a walkingstone had not worked the last time  she knew that the city was now aware of her abilities and would have taken precautions against that type of deception .  nor had the shape felt right to her .   still  the third law demanded that she protect her own existence  and to enter the city as kin would have been dangerous .  the bird shape had served her well twice now  she would use it once more until she found this godbeing .   silverside   s decision to accept the kin had given her a definite preference for their    human    shape .  she was kin .  she might enter the city as a bird  but she would meet this godbeing as kin .   silverside willed her body to change .  she spread wide  dark wings  and rose quietly toward the banked clouds .   the godbeing would be near the hill of stars .  she felt certain of that .  the hill of stars was the heart of the city  and the godbeing would be placed there  perhaps in the hill itself  perhaps even in the room central had used .  silverside banked and swooped  letting the wind lift her as she moved toward the glowing pyramid in the center of the city .   lights dimmed near the hill  then a brightness glimmered on the side of one of the buildings .  silverside brought her wings in  let herself drop lower as her optical circuits switched to a telephoto setting .   lifecrier .  she could see the kin  their images projected on a building alongside the hill of stars .  in her head  the godbeing seemed puzzled by the kin   s behavior  and it ordered the hunters forward .   silverside circled the area  her eyes searching .   there .  the godbeing stood on a balcony opposite the view of lifecrier  with two walkingstones standing alongside it .  silverside howled softly  banked  and plummeted like a stone as the wall showing lifecrier went suddenly dark .   the wind whistled past her as she dropped in silence .   a few meters above them  she pulled up with a savage beating of wings .  the walkingstones noticed her at the same moment .  silverside changed instantly into kin form and dropped .  the walkingstone nearest her she picked up and hurled over the edge of the balcony   it clutched at her desperately  missed  and fell with a strange silence .  the other walkingstone  an odd one with mismatched arms  immediately planted itself between silverside and the godbeing .  it made no move toward silverside  though she knew it would not let her pass .   the godbeing was a strange creature  she thought  its face a pasty  dead color and its fur all gathered on the top of its head and nowhere else .  it concealed its body behind some strange substance so that she could not even see its sex  and one arm was bound to its body .  it had no claws  and its teeth seemed to be flat and dull like a planteater   s .  it smelled horrible  like some obscene cross between a dead walkingstone and a treewalker .   it hardly looked formidable enough to be leading the walkingstones .   and yet .  .  . silverside was strangely fascinated by the creature .  it was a being of flesh  and it ruled this world of technology .  find intelligence  her old programming had ordered .   silverside shook the feeling aside .  protect the kin  that was what the first law demanded .      i challenge you .     silverside roared to the godbeing in hunttongue  but it only shook its head  not understanding .     i challenge you  godbeing     she said again  using the voidtongue .  the words felt odd coming from her throat and yet were strangely familiar at the same time .  the godbeing reacted to her use of the voidtongue  its eyes going wide and startled .     let us fight to decide who controls the walkingstones .      silverside growled and shifted into the challenge stance  her hind legs gathered as if to leap  her claws extended .  the walkingstone in front of the godbeing began to move toward silverside  and she snorted .  it reached for her  and her jaw clamped around its arm  tearing savagely .  it was like chewing on stone  but the grasp gave her leverage and she flung the robot to one side .   the godbeing backed away  trying to escape back inside the hill of stars  and silverside moved to block it .     no     she said .     i will not allow you to run .  we must fight .  that is the way to decide this .         there is no need to fight     the godbeing said .     you will not fight me .  you will move aside from the doorway .     there was a tone of imperious command in its voice .  almost  silverside wanted to obey  and for just a moment her stance changed  becoming servile and submissive .  but she shook her massive head and growled again in angry beasttalk .      the oldmother sent me to save the kin .  you kill them .  we must fight .  that is the way .      the godbeing was shaking its pasty fleshed head .     no .  i   ve changed all that .  i   ve told the city to stop .  back away now .  you   re a robot .  you have to obey me .         i am the leader of the kin .  i obey the will of the oldmother .         who is the oldmother .     the godbeing asked  and silverside could not believe its stupidity .  how could it not know the oldmother .  corning from the firstbeast  it must know her .   but there was no time to question the godbeing .  from the edges of her peripheral vision  silverside caught movement  trebled movement .  the walkingstone she had flung aside was advancing toward her  and from inside the godbeing   s cave in the hill of stars  she could see two hunters running toward the ledge and their confrontation .   silverside howled in fury and faced the godbeing .      you are afraid of me .  i should be the leader .  if you rule the city  then meet me .  i will wait for you .      she flung aside the hand the walkingstone laid on her and rushed to the edge of the ledge  knocking the godbeing down in her leap .  it was certainly a fragile being  for it cried out in pain as she plummeted over the side .   she willed herself to become the bird again and swooped up and away .  the walkingstones had helped the godbeing to its feet and were watching her as she gained altitude .  she watched them carefully to see if they aimed their awful fire at her  but the godbeing held them back .   howling her beasttalk challenge once more  silverside left the city .  landing in the forest  she resumed her preferred form and sat down to wait .     chapter     a call received    it had to be one of the most frightening sounds he   d ever heard  those shivering howls coming from the throat of the huge black carrion bird .  more than anything else  the fluidity of the rogue   s body was terrifying .  it had seemed to simply melt into its new shape .  .  .  .   watching the rogue flyaway  derec was suddenly very certain that this wasn   t going to be as easy as he   d thought it would be .  not at all .   he took a deep breath of the cold night air .  cradling his arm  he went back inside .      master derec  are you hurt .         mostly my pride  mandelbrot     he answered .     i suspect it   ll heal slower than the rest of me .      derec   s arm was throbbing again  and his head ached where he   d hit the railing as the rogue swept past him  but none of it was as serious as it could have been .  he   d seen those teeth  those claws  and he   d seen how the rogue had flung mandelbrot aside like a broken doll .  a few scrapes and bruises were nothing .  nothing at all .   derec sat down on the couch and leaned his head back .      we need wolruf     he said .  the city was still in an uproar .  he could hear it all in his head .  supervisor alpha was directing the hunter seekers to try to track the rogue  but derec knew that it would be hopeless .  there were too many shapes it could have taken to avoid pursuit .      wolruf .     mandelbrot queried .      yes .  think about it .  she   d understand these creatures better than we can .  at the very least she   d be dealing with a canine intelligence that is   maybe   more like her own in contrast to our apish thought patterns .  that   s our problem .  the rogue seems to believe it   s one of them  their leader  in fact .  which means it   s thinking like them .  the rogue   s logic is utterly alien .  it   s obvious that i didn   t understand it     he added ruefully .      it is still a positronic intelligence  master derec .  it was built by a human  if not dr .  avery himself .  that much is certain .  i observed it as closely as possible during the skirmish .  the skin was definitely dianite  like the material of the city itself  and it spoke in standard .  there are certain givens with a positronic brain .  it may even be that it will respond to the city   s orders  being made from the same substance .         yes  mandelbrot .  it follows the laws  or should  at any rate .  i just wonder how it might interpret them .  a pack society  a carnivore   s mores .  .  .     derec took a deep breath .     frost  i   m thirsty .     he went to a dispenser unit in the wall and ordered a drink  downing it all in one quick gulp .      we can   t understand these beings  not easily     he continued .     wolruf has a closer affinity to them than we ever will .  besides  you were the one insisting that they should be treated as human .  how can we do that if we don   t understand them .  how are we going to handle this rogue if we can   t understand what it might be thinking .         i agree with you  master derec .  send for wolruf .         good .     derec nodded .     it   s about time i made a decent decision .     which hasn   t been since aurora .   still holding the empty glass  he went out to the balcony again and stared out at the darkness into which the rogue had disappeared .  the sound of the rogue   s howling still seemed to echo .  he felt the skin of his back prickling at the memory .   he didn   t mention all the other reasons for wanting to make the call  though he knew mandelbrot would also be aware of them  if too concerned with causing a human pain to mention them .  wolruf   s outlook would help them  yes  but wolruf would also bring a ship which would allow them to leave the world if they needed to .  and derec wanted very badly to call ariel .  he wanted ariel more than wolruf in many ways .   wolruf could also bring ariel .   he sighed again .   derec felt in his head for the chemfet channels and called  alpha .  beta .  status on supervisor gamma .   beta responded immediately .  gamma unit inactive after fall .  positronic brain has been taken to repair station and will be reinstalled in a new body if possible .  extent of damage to brain is unknown  a new supervisor unit has been activated .  alpha reports that hunter seekers have lost rogue .  instructions regarding rogue and wolf creatures .   you will continue to regard the wolf creatures as human  derec answered .  the rogue is not to be harmed if you do find it  but there   s no need to send the hunter seekers past the city boundaries .  the rogue will be back .   derec was certain of that much .   understood .  derec could almost imagine distaste in the flat  emotionless response .   in the meantime  i need access to the city hyperwave transmitters .  you should have coordinates for aurora in the city memory banks .  please transmit the following message   ariel  find wolruf send her immediately   imperative .  and .  .  . i   m sorry .  i love you .  please send an answer to these coordinates .  and ariel     would like you to come with her .  derec .     the message arrived at aurora as a highly compressed squirt emanating from the aurora system   s wormhole  punched through the incredible distances and the space time anomaly by the powerful transmitters in robot city .   the weakened signal was received by aurora   s orbiting communications complex  the charges billed against ariel   s family   s account  and transferred down to the planetary net decoded and strengthened .  there it was posted to derec and ariel   s computer terminal .   that was exactly as derec had intended  except that ariel was no longer there to receive it .   someone else was .      wolruf .  who or what is wolruf .  you must answer me .  it is extremely important .      the household robot didn   t seem inclined to answer the query .  the inbuilt command against revealing an owner   s business was perhaps the most highly stressed program code in its memory  the second law priority reinforced to the best of factory   s technicians    abilities .   but there was one higher priority that could always be invoked  and the speaker was very skilled with positronic logic .  the words simply had to be carefully chosen and constantly repeated .      it is very important that you tell me  balzac .  mistress ariel is not on aurora  as you know .  she has left this world and cannot help .  master derec is in trouble  that is implied by the message .  he needs this wolruf to aid him .  i will contact wolruf  but i first must know where to begin looking .  you must tell me all that you know .  this is a first law situation  balzac .  first law .  ariel and derec are in danger  and your refusal to speak increases that danger .  this supersedes any previous instructions you may have received .  do you understand .      it took an hour of careful argument and resulted in a badly damaged robotic mind .  balzac would never be of much use to its owners again .   but it did speak  the words halting and slurred .  .  .  .     chapter     decisions    for the next two days  derec checked with the city communications center every hour or so  though he knew that he would have been alerted via chemfet if a message had been received .   there was never an answer .  ariel said nothing .   that was very unlike her .  derec was certain that even if she   d been furious  she would have sent back some scathing reply .  but the hyperactive frequencies were silent coming from aurora .   he hoped that she   d simply decide to head for the planet with wolruf  that any day a ship would appear in orbit around the world .  he instructed the city to turn its attention to the sky  to search the night for the faint glimmer of a ship   s drive .  maybe she was out there already  a day or two away after the jump .   but the sky was devoid of ships .  derec waited for eight days  not eating or sleeping well and leaving control of the city entirely in the supervisors    hands after giving them firm orders  the city is to cease any new construction and any clearing of land .  remember that the wolf creatures are to be regarded as human insofar as harming them .  do not destroy the rogue .   as the days passed  the wolves grew less cautious .  the rogue appeared every night on the hillside outside the city  pacing the perimeter and howling in the speech of the wolf creatures .  derec didn   t need to know what it was saying  that was obvious enough .  and the wolf creatures seemed to realize that the city was doing nothing to resist them .  on the third day after the rogue   s challenge  the pack made a blitzkrieg attack on a party of workers  destroying most of them before the hunter seekers arrived and the wolves fled .  following derec   s last orders  the hunters didn   t pursue the wolves but simply let them go back into the safety of the forest .   the rogue itself made a dash into the city on the fifth night  and it destroyed delta  the replacement supervisor for gamma .  the positronic brain was wrecked beyond repair  gamma was restored to working status in a different body .   on the sixth night  a hunter seeker managed to sneak up on the pack and sedate one of the wolves from a distance .  but when two hunters went to capture the creature  the rogue attacked from the shadows .  the hunter seekers were disabled  the rogue seemed unharmed .   it was apparent to derec that the stalemate could not continue .  it was also apparent that wolruf  if she were coming at all  would not be there soon  and that ariel had either never received the message or had ignored it and was not going to answer .   that left very little choice for derec .  he was entirely healed now  the broken arm knitted if still a little tender after the accelerated treatment .  he had no excuses not to confront the problem directly .  anything was better than brooding .   despite that  he was not at all pleased with the prospect .     mandelbrot woke derec from his sleep .     the rogue is outside the city again     the robot said softly .     i saw it in the distance  walking along the edge of the trees .          did you try ordering it in again .     derec asked .  with the help of the city   s technical library  mandelbrot had been trying to subvert the rogue   s base programming  since it evidently had a comlink to the city .  the robot had been broadcasting orders over various frequencies  but to no effect .      yes .  in the robot city program code once more and also in human speech using a recording of your voice .  it used the comlink to growl .         maybe you should offer it a biscuit     derec grumbled .      if you think that will work  master derec .  one moment        derec grimaced .  the robot was already moving swiftly toward the door .      no .  mandelbrot  come back here .  frost  can   t you tell when a person   s joking .  wait a second and let me get ready .     derec rolled out of his bed and rubbed at his eyes .     it   s time i went to see it personally .  it   s time i answered the damned thing   s challenge .  the rogue   s right  one of us has to be in control of things .      mandelbrot   s eyes glittered at him from the night darkness .  beyond the robot  the wide archway to the balcony was open .  neither of the moons was up  the sky beyond mandelbrot   s head was dusted with stars .  the wolves would be out there now  and the rogue would be with them .      master derec  i do not like this .         i don   t either  believe me .     derec pulled on his pants  tugged a loose fitting tunic over his head .      the rogue is dangerous .  it has destroyed city robots  it has damaged the central computer  it has harmed the supervisors .  it has even threatened you .         none of which necessarily violates the three laws     derec pointed out .     not even the threat .  it   s in the shape of those wolf creatures  it thinks like them  too .         in which case it is very dangerous .  and i must disagree .  no robot in a sane state could say what the rogue said to you on the balcony .  such a statement would cause extreme reactions within my positronic potentials .  even contemplating such an act now sets up vibrations that i can sense .  to actually make such threats meaningfully would be impossible .  the damage to my brain would cause an immediate dysfunction if not an outright freeze .         the rogue follows the laws     derec insisted .      the rogue is insane .  it must be .  its interpretations of the laws cannot be trusted .  it injured you the first time you met .         nevertheless  i   m going to go meet it .      mandelbrot stepped in front of derec  blocking his path .     master derec  i cannot allow that .  i am sorry .  the first law forbids it .         this is a direct order  mandelbrot  and i   ve already told you your assumptions are in error .  this isn   t a first law matter .  step out of my way .         i .  .  . am sorry .     the robot   s voice was slightly slurred  hesitant  the delicate balances between the laws shifted  but it remained in place before the door .      mandelbrot  the rogue hasn   t harmed me .  not really .  it was protecting its own existence  and it made a judgment call that it could move past me .  you might have made the same decision   a small bump against the likelihood of destruction .  it could as easily have taken my head off with those claws .         i .  .  . do not .  .  . know        derec saw that the robot   s resolve was visibly weakening .  he pressed his argument .     the rogue could have killed me in an instant  mandelbrot .  it chose not to .  that tells me that the three laws are still functioning .  and we   re not going to resolve anything here unless we confront it .  if we just order the city to build us a ship and leave   assuming the city   s even capable of such a task at this point  and i seriously doubt that   then we   ve abandoned these wolf creatures .  they   re going to continue to try to attack the city  and once we   re gone  who knows what will happen .  they may well die .  we   ve certainly disrupted their society already  and if the city continues to grow  it will contact other packs as well .  they   re sentient beings  mandelbrot .  you know it yourself .  i can   t and won   t just leave them  and just sitting here is useless .      as he spoke  derec realized that he was also talking to himself .  he had just been sitting there  moping about ariel and wolruf and doing nothing .  it was time to confront the rogue  one way or the other .  he had to face the challenge .      mandelbrot  i   m ordering you again to move .      the robot took a hesitant step aside .     i would like .  .  . to accompany you .      derec smiled .     of course .  you always need a second in a duel .     then  before mandelbrot could say anything else     just kidding  of course .        chapter     a challenge met    silverside watched the city as she   d watched it every night since smallface was a crescent horn .  the moon was entirely gone now  waiting for the oldmother to birth it once more in its endless cycle .  still the godbeing ignored her .  but silverside came every night and renewed her challenge .   the godbeing would come to her .  it must .   at least some of what it said had been true .  the city had changed  it no longer pursued the kin when they attacked .  only a few nights past  lifecrier had led the pack down to kill .  though the hunters had come to protect the worker walkingstones  they had not followed the pack when the kin retreated .   then the youngling slowpaw had been caught straggling as usual  and one of the hunters had shot him .  silverside had been certain that slowpaw was dead .  but the hunters came after the body  and after silverside disabled them  she found that they had only made slowpaw sleep .  she had been certain that the hunters would follow her for revenge and had been ready to lead them away from packhome again .   but the rest of the hunters remained in the city .  the godbeing   whose name was derec  as she knew from listening to the city   s voidtongue   had ordered it so .   what kind of creature would stay hidden in its cave for so long .  how could it hunt there  when all the game had been driven elsewhere .  the godbeing was flesh like the kin  it must eat .   which meant that it would come out .   most strangely of all  silverside could feel the urge in her to meet this godbeing again .  the remembrance of it stirred odd thoughts in her mind .  she felt a pull  a yearning .   it has knowledge .  it is intelligent .  it is a toolmaker far superior to any of the kin .  i have heard the city say that the one walkingstone was built by this derec .   there were moments when she did not want to fight it at all .  but the challenge was demanded by the oldmother   s commands inside her .  above all else  she could let no harm come to the kin  and the city harmed kin simply by its existence .  she must control the city as she controlled the kin  and the godbeing prevented that .   that meant it must be challenged .  if it refused her that privilege  it must die .     the edge of the city was well defined  like the boundaries of a cooled lava flow .  derec stepped from a hard level walkway and with the next step  he was on grass .  outside .   he suddenly  foolishly  felt unprotected .   that   s silly  he told himself .  mandelbrot   s alongside you  and alpha   s monitoring the whole thing through witness robots .  there are a half dozen hunters waiting back in the city  they    ii get to you in seconds if anything happens .  you   re as safe as you can be .  besides  you   re the one who insisted that the three laws protected you from the rogue .   he suddenly didn   t feel very confident at all .   a low rumbling came from his right .  derec turned .   the rogue was there .   it crouched fifty meters up slope where a stand of trees had been cleared by workers from the city .  perched atop one of the fallen logs and in wolf shape  the rogue looked bigger than derec had remembered .  its claws were displayed  its mouth slightly open to reveal the metal teeth set there .  it reared up on its back legs as derec turned to it  standing perhaps a half meter taller than derec himself .  mandelbrot had come alongside derec without prompting  the implicit threat in the rogue   s pose forcing the robot to stay close enough to intervene .   it    s a robot .  it follows the laws .  derec took a deep breath  motioning mandelbrot back .     i   ve come to talk with you     he said to the rogue .   it growled  then spat out in standard     i have challenged you already .  i did not come to talk .         at least tell me your name .         i am called silverside     the rogue answered  and derec could have sworn there was a hint of bravado in its voice  far more inflection than any robot he had ever heard before .  whoever had programmed it had been good .     i am the chosen of the oldmother  the bane of walkingstones .  tell your walkingstone to leave so that we may decide who is the leader .      derec looked at mandelbrot  who had taken yet another step closer at the rogue   s words .     mandelbrot is compelled to protect me  silverside .  tell him that you   re not going to hurt me  and i can send him back .         it is no protection to you at all     silverside answered  and her pale eyes glanced at mandelbrot .     i have already defeated it once .  i will do it again  and then you and i will settle this .         no  i order you       derec began  but it was already too late .   the rogue moved faster than derec thought possible .  if mandelbrot had not been there  derec would not have had a chance .  derec felt a wind as mandelbrot shot by him and met silverside .   the rogue collided with the onrushing mandelbrot in a thunderous  resounding crash .  there was a blur of violent motion  and mandelbrot was suddenly down in the dirt  his legs thrashing helplessly from a severed cable held in the rogue   s claws .  the rogue itself had a long scratch in its flank but otherwise seemed unharmed .   derec opened his mouth to shout  to protest  to scream .  the chemfets told him that the hunter seekers were coming  but they would be too late .   much too late .   silverside growled terribly  flung the cable away  and was on him .  he tried to raise his hands  hopelessly .  claws raked derec   s sides as she grappled him and bore him down .     no .     he screamed .     you can   t hurt me .  i   m a human        the rogue wailed .        i   m a human       the godbeing derec cried .  the word set off a bewildering spark of reactions in silverside   s mind .  human .  the resonance from that voidtongue word was stunning  and silverside reeled from its effects .   a human being is an intelligent life form .   intelligence .  human .      you are not human     silverside roared in denial  but she spoke in hunttongue   the language of    humans      and no answer came to her .  taking advantage of silverside   s confusion  the godbeing had rolled to its feet  and now she struck at it once more  intending to slash it open with her claws for its lie .   she could not .  could not .  it was as if the oldmother controlled her hand and brought the claws back at the last instant so that she missed the godbeing .  she leapt at it instead  bearing it down again to roll it gasping in the dirt  then moving away a step so that it could stay on its back  submissive and beaten .   it either did not know to submit  or it would not .  the godbeing staggered up once more  defiant .  silverside rushed at it again .  the godbeing screeched with pain as her arms wrapped around its chest and squeezed .      submit .     she whispered to it  and it was as if the oldmother   s will made the words a plea .  she wanted this to end .  she wanted the godbeing to go limp and end this farce .   she was so much stronger than this thing of flesh .  the godbeing was weak  weaker than the sickest of the kin .  and yet it still struggled .      no .     it shouted back  its face gone red  its eyes wide and mouth gaping open .  she could smell its breath  strangely sweet .     no .  you must stop this .  i order it .  i am a human .  you must obey me .      the words staggered silverside as if they were physical blows .  her grasp loosened  and the godbeing sagged to the ground .  silverside stared at it without seeing it  all her attention on the confusion within her .   human .   you must obey .   silverside howled in beasttalk .     somehow  he wasn   t dead .  the rogue was howling again like a mad thing  and  as derec stared at it  its body was changing .  the snout was shortening  the ears moving lower on the body  and the canine jaws softening .  yes  the face was humanoid  and the features were startlingly like derec   s own .      godbeing  i .  .  . i must know .  .  . more     it said  and he could hear the confusion in its mind in its halting voice .  positronic drift .  derec began to feel some hope .     i .  .  . need information .      there was someone or something behind the rogue  some shape .  mandelbrot had managed to lock his legs and rise  lumbering stiff legged to them and impelled by the first law .  derec saw the blow coming a moment before it landed .     mandelbrot  no       he began to shout  but it was too late .   mandelbrot   s closed fist fell on the rogue   s neck .  it went to its knees  a wolfish snarl coming from its human mouth  and now it was changing again  returning to wolf form .     no  mandelbrot .     derec ordered again .     i   m in no danger .      the rogue was confused .  it looked from mandelbrot to derec  to the forest  to the hunter seekers moving rapidly toward them .  it screeched  a sound of raw animal fury  its features changing rapidly and ceaselessly .  human wolf  human wolf .   wolf .   it stared at derec .     don   t go     he began  but the rogue shook its head .     dropping to all fours  it began to run for the cover of the forest .      come back .     derec shouted .     i can teach you .  in the city .  .  .      but it was already gone .     chapter     changeling    below  the kin huddled on the ledge before packhome .  the pups yelped and played mock fights and nursed .  the younglings old enough to be in the hunting pack strutted and told fanciful tales about how they had helped silverside kill walkingstones .  the adults simply nodded and occasionally looked to the summit of the hill where silverside and lifecrier had gone .   it had been a strange fight  that of silverside and the godbeing .  they still did not know who had won .      you are unhappy with me     silverside said in hunttongue .   lifecrier shook his grizzled muzzle from side to side .  he used kinspeech  telling silverside that she needn   t be so concerned .     no  silverside .  not unhappy with you .  i   m sad that you   re leaving .         i have not decided that .  i have decided nothing .         i can smell the change in you .         lifecrier has the nose of a dirtdigger     silverside said in hunttongue  and lifecrier bowed his head at the rebuke .  he did not move away  though  standing his ground on the rise .  they could see the hill of stars in the twilight  an aching brightness  and they both stared at it for long minutes .      i saw the oldmother move in you     lifecrier said .     my eyes are not as sharp as keeneye   s  but you and the godbeing .  .  .         i know .  i felt it .         what will you do .      silverside howled  and after a second  lifecrier joined her .  their twined voices caused flocks of birds to rise in the trees below .     i am kin     silverside said at last .     i lead the litter kin here .         i know .  no one would challenge you .  you are the oldmother   s gift .         i am kin     silverside repeated .     yet .  .  .     she stopped and looked at lifecrier .      i must do what is best for kin     she said .   lifecrier nodded .     that is all the oldmother would ever ask     he told her .        derec .     mandelbrot whispered urgently and pointed .   campfire and city lights glinted on the robot   s polished body  the red gleam of its eyes glanced at derec and then back into the night darkness beyond the city .   derec rubbed sleep from his eyes .  he struggled from under his thermal blanket and stood .  the night was very quiet .  even the brilliantly lit city at his back seemed quiet  though he knew that thousands of robots were about their tasks there .  the sweet odor of woodsmoke filled the air  a gentle and cool night wind tossed the mane of smoke back toward the city .   they   d been camped outside the city for the past two nights  waiting .  each night he   d expected the rogue to come to him .  the city was broadcasting an endless invitation to silverside .  come into the city .  you will not be harmed .  the city   s library is open to you .  come and learn .   at last  it looked like it would answer the invitation .   the only question was how .   on the wooded crest of a hill  derec saw the wolf creatures .  their dark  quick shapes moved like fleet shadows under the swaying rooftop of the trees .  both moons were up  despite the city   s glare and the campfire  derec could see them quite well .  mandelbrot had moved near derec  ready to protect him should the wolf creatures show any hostility .   hunter seekers can be sent  alpha reminded him .   no .  not yet .  anyway .   the shivering howls and barks of the wolf creature   s language drifted down toward them .  derec shuddered .  in the weeks he   d been on this world  he still hadn   t become used to that sound .  mandelbrot noticed and shuffled even closer .     old racial memories die hard     he told the robot .      the rogue is with them     mandelbrot said .     they   re gathering around it .  master derec  i think we should have the city call the hunter seekers .  i am not sufficient protection for you .  regardless of whether the rogue will harm you  the wolfcreatures are certainly nor bound by the laws .  .  .  .         i   ve already ordered alpha to hold them back  mandelbrot .  the wolves are no danger .  not yet .  be patient  you   re the one who worked so hard to convince me they   re intelligent  remember .         intelligent is not a synonym for    not dangerous         mandelbrot pointed out .     you as a human should be well aware of that .         hmph .     derec snorted .     we   ll wait  anyway .      the pack had gathered at the edge of the trees closest to the city .  derec could see the rogue now  glinting in the moonlight between the pacing outriders of the wolf creatures .  now it stepped out into full moonlight  the old one at its side .  the two licked each other  nuzzling and giving playful nips .  then the rogue began walking alone down the grassy slope toward derec and mandelbrot .   halfway down  the robot turned and looked back to the pack  which had gathered at the lip of the hill to watch the descent .  the rogue lifted its muzzle to the wolves and gave a long  ululating lament .   the wolves chorused back .   to derec  they sounded wild and sad .   the rogue began picking its way among the rocks toward derec   s camp once more .  as it approached  the rogue   s body began a slow metamorphosis .  step   the lupine muzzle shortened  step   the tail began to shorten and retract into the body  step   it raised up to walk on its hind legs  step   and the legs themselves altered  the knees beginning to flex forward .   when the robot stopped a few meters in front of them  it was recognizably humanoid in the firelight .  it glanced at mandelbrot  then at derec .      godbeing derec  i have come to learn     it said .  except for the stilted  formal grammar  its voice sounded very much like derec   s .     i have come so you may teach me of the void from which we both fell .  i have come to learn what is human .      derec nodded .  he pointed back to the city and the looming bright presence of the compass tower .     the answers are all in there     he said .     follow me  and i   ll show you the way .  mandelbrot  if you   ll take care of the fire  please .  .  . we wouldn   t want the woods to burn .     he said it mostly for the rogue   s benefit  wanting it to understand that he was concerned about the well being of the wolf creatures .   it was difficult for derec to give the rogue his back .  he half expected it to leap on him again  biting and tearing .  he listened intently for a suspicious sound behind him .  derec knew that mandelbrot was already on edge and would respond instantly  but still .  .  .   nothing happened .   alpha  we   re coming in .  the rogue is with me .   we will have the apartment ready  master derec .   derec began walking  then glanced back when he didn   t hear the robot following .  it was staring back at the forest  and as it did  the malleable face went vaguely wolfish again .      it   s your choice     derec told it softly .     i won   t force you to make that decision .  come with me or go back to them .  i won   t try to stop you .      the robot howled to the wolves one last time  the bestial sound eerie and wrong to be coming from that human shaped throat .   then the rogue turned from the darkness of the trees and the huddled pack .   it followed derec into the eternal light of the city .       stephen leigh    stephen leigh is the author of
